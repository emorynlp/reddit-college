  "title:": "Why is academia paid so little in the US?",
  "text": "I'm from Europe, and usually most jobs in the US get paid way better for comparable positions than even the richest Western European countries, bar Switzerland (which however is tiny and has a higher COL). Like up to 50% more if you have good skills and are willing to put an effort.\n\nHowever academia seems to be a major exception. PhDs are paid peanuts - not that you ever get rich as a PhD student anywhere really, but at least in countries like Denmark or the Netherlands you get a proper living wage up to 2,000-2500EUR net (2200-2700$). In the US you'd be lucky to get a 30k$ gross stipend for a lot more work and usually much less job security in the sense that you have to hunt for grants and you enjoy fewer benefits. No idea how PhD students can make ends meet in HCOL cities.\n\nThen speaking of postdocs, most of the postdoc positions I've seen are in the 45k-55k$ range, which is pretty much what you'd get in Germany for example, only a little more than in the UK and significantly less than in Australia or Switzerland (a postdoc in Switzerland gets a standard salary of around 70-80k CHF, up to 90+ in the last year). I just saw a couple positions at SUNY Buffalo and University of Arizona to name two at 48k and 53k respectively. These might not be Harvard and are in LCOL areas but they're still supposed to be pretty damn good unis.\n\nI know that tenure track professors can make MAD money - I've seen the salaries of some big names in my field and they get up to 150-200k$ a year. But sometimes you could see similar numbers in other countries as well, and becoming a full professor is a rare occurrence anyway.\n\nI mean I'm not saying you're gonna starve with 50k$ a year as a postdoc don't get me wrong, it's not a \"terrible\" salary by any means, but compared to the general level of salaries in the US it really does seem stupidly low, especially when you factor in the sheer amount of work. It's on par with the level of other countries that usually have much lower salaries across the board. Makes me wonder why would anyone in the US bother joining academia - what's the incentive?\n\nAm I wrong? If not, why is that?",

      "text": "It could be due to state universities getting a lot of their funding from state legislatures, which are often inclined to make cuts to state education funding. Especially so if they are controlled by Republicans. Private universities may have higher salaries because they don't get their funding from the state and are not subject to the same oversight that state universities are. SUNY Buffalo is a state university, so that would be an example of a university that gets funding from the state legislature. \n\nMany universities in the US have 2-3x more administrators than are necessary. I don't know if European universities have similar problem, but many of these administrators with useless jobs make six figures, and it takes a lot of money to support such a massive, oversized administrative class.",

              "text": "That's the fun, they don't!\n\nTo be honest, I don't know that a university really needs *any* academic integrity coordinators. Professors know who cheats and how to find out, so I think any disciplinary measure should be up to them. The administration should only get involved when it comes to expelling the student. That one change could save $300,000.\n\nOr, if the admin still wants to control that process, have a single academic integrity coordinator and distribute the responsibility to other folks in the dean of students office. That could save $200,000. \n\nLots of universities cut \"unprofitable\" degree programs or programs with few enrollments, but imo a university should only start cutting degree programs after it's cut all the administrative staff first.",
