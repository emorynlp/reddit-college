I\u2019m in therapy once a week, deep mental issues going in my family, about to start acupuncture to work with my stress-related chronic pains, trying to get a part-time job to I can get some form of security. \n\n\nDeep inside, I know that he is also a human being, and knows my life doesn\u2019t revolve around my research. I know he wants me to do more, but each time I do more, he tells me it\u2019s meaningless because it\u2019s not done in the right way. I\u2019m stuck between not moving and making a move risking it being totally wrong and getting scolded for it.\n\n\nReddit, I looked him dead in the eye and considered telling him that I\u2019d save him the time and simply drop out. I\u2019m exhausted. \n\n\nThank you for reading.",

I told my boss I go to weekly therapy sessions and it helps me focus because I unload those burdens.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed but just internalizing it, tell him that (and also work on getting it out productively). \n\nIn the best light, they want to see you succeed and you\u2019ve admitted you have a lot going on emotionally that is complicating the situation. \n\nPart of it is process, part of it is results. If your PI disapproves of how you seem to be working, then I don\u2019t really see that as a big deal. And tell them that. If you\u2019re comfortable with how you\u2019re working and making progress, tell them that. On the other hand if you agree that you\u2019d like to make more progress but you\u2019re struggling, tell them that! They could help you set attainable goals. \n\nIn the end, it\u2019s about the results. If you\u2019re making progress on your work, then your PI needs to see your process is working well enough. On the other hand, if you are struggling to meet reasonable expectations because of extenuating circumstances, I think your PI might be able to help. Or at least hear where you\u2019re coming from.",

I knew after the first semester in grad school I did *not* want to do research. While I can respect research, I also believe that a lot of academics don\u2019t encourage students to attempt non-research or non-instructing roles, which can be a disservice depending on the field. \n\nMy masters is in the engineering discipline. My husband and I both talk about how many engineers graduate with masters and PhD\u2019s and do not know how to apply their \u201cresearch\u201d in their daily lives for work. While backed by genuine data, when it comes time to actually plan out solutions... there\u2019s always someone that evolved through the ranks, even many folks that have only went to trade school, that corrects their applied method. \n\nI remember taking a cross-discipline (/interdisciplinary) course in undergrad that was also a requirement for folks on a specific pre-law track. The professor was a successful lawyer, 25+ year career, and did an excellent job connecting theory, research, and how it can be applied in his day-to-day. I think we all did graduate level work for that course, as the professor wanted us to truly think at that level. I checked his salary online. Holy shet. He made more than 3x what his peers in that program made. You CAN have both, just know this, and there is a need for folks that know both. Good luck to you.",

My vision of a Masters degree was, what I now know, a \u201ctaught\u201d degree. The one where you take a bunch of classes, have a lot of diverse projects and assignments, an internship, and an oral defense. This was going to be it for me, it\u2019s still what I want. I\u2019d still jump at the opportunity to keep studying, pursue another masters, if it truly gets to be interdisciplinary, practical, critical, and applicable. \n\n\nHowever I found myself in a University that is super pushy about writing and publishing. So much so that my classes are a joke. The content is not at all engaging, very detached from the real world, as professors are researchers with very little pedagogical training. I\u2019m here to watch my professor and copy him in hopes of producing something decent. \n\n\nI am being a bit brute about it but it\u2019s just how it is.

So, you're not alone! A few thoughts:\n\n1) his method of communicating, from what you're quoting here, is unhelpful *at best* and probably highly toxic (threatening you and criticizing what you do right after he tells you do more is not acceptable behaviour). So, I will say, as someone who's been in your position: It's not your fault. \n\n2) I don't think you collapsing in a heap of panic in front of him will help anything, and frankly (from my own experience) I'd be worried about him using that sort of vulnerability against you. What you could do is have a meeting with him, or ideally with him and your committee and/or the department grad chair, to nail down a timeline and specific goals and expectations that you both then stick to. Your other option is simply to keep your head down and push through, do what he tells you as best as you can, do what you think is best for the thesis, and try to get through.\n\nI'm not going to tell you not to drop out if things become too much, but please don't drop out just because of this guy. You're so close, you've made it this far which means you're plenty capable, and you deserve to get your degree despite someone's shitty communication style.",

If he is really a person, or a good professor, they should know the right thing to do. Telling people to succeed without showing them \u201chow\u201d is a sign of immaturity. He *should* be more understanding but... life can be weird that way. He\u2019s probably frustrated because you as his student doing poorly is a reflection on him. But he doesn\u2019t know how to get you to where you \u201cshould\u201d be so he is acting like a monkey. His fear brain is taking over, blocking out the insightful part of his brain. He probably hasn\u2019t experience what\u2019s you are describing, so he doesn\u2019t know how to handle it, and maybe doesn\u2019t believe it could exist.",

      "text": "Hello. As a professor and having been a PhD student once, I understand the pressure you're under and both sides of how this dynamic can play out. First of all, I want to say I am sorry you are going through so much and that you and your advisor seem to be having serious communication issues.  \n\nIt seems to me that it would be good for you to take a step back and reassess what the options look like in terms of taking care of yourself and getting your work-life balance and your PhD back on track. Can you take a break or leave of absense? If not, is it possible for you to break down your current research project(s) into small steps you can accomplish? Being paralyzed by the fear of being scolded or getting it wrong can lead to a vicious cycle; after all, we only learn by making mistakes, and it's important to take things one step at a time.  \n\nI don't know much about your advisor, but do remember whoever is your boss now or in the future is also a flawed human being, and they're probably trying to help out, guide you through the work and push you to complete it, even if they're doing so in a misguided and limited way. \n\nIt sounds to me like you are somewhat intimidated by your advisor and don't feel comfortable sharing your situation with them (I was there once, too). As much as possible, it is important that you sit down with him and tell them what is going on and how you feel. If you don't feel comfortable doing this one on one, maybe there's someone who can act as a mediator in this.  Overall, I think coming up with a way to navigate this with your advisor and coming up with a plan might help, but what do you think?",

Take small concrete steps. It's better to produce something, tick some todo list boxes and to build your confidence a little at a time. \n\nThe impostor syndrome is not fully going away, I know, but know all of us feel that way. I am a TT professor and I still feel impostor syndrome some days. \n\nI remember when I was a student, my (very Russian) advisor was very strict and business only. Coming from a warmer climate, for the longest time I thought his lack of positive feedback meant he must think I was stupid or incapable. \n\nHe also would email on Saturdays, not only during my holidays but during his asking about work. \n\nTurns out the dude is just that intense. Had nothing to do with the quality of my work... that's just how he rolls. \n\n>My own prof was shocked I took holidays during christmas. I mean.\n\nWow. I mean... you gotta draw those lines.

Lots of grads haven't yet learned how to be really focused for the full work day (they get distracted), so they have to work more hours. Profs have learned to expect this behavior, so they may be suspicious of a 9-5 schedule until you show them that you're getting results with it.",

You need to assess potential advisors for what theyre providing you holistically, and if they give off even a hint of making you feel not good enough or insecure, fucking NOPE.

So help him empathize with you. you could either a do it situationally where if you says something like that again be frank and tell him respectfully I try to stay calm but I do care about this and I feel like panicking isn\u2019t my way of doing things but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care. Or you could actually set a time and speak with him. Start off with I noticed that you make comments that have been upsetting for me and then go on taking about how you feel. Plan what you say, practice in a mirror, you want this to come across respectful and not overly emotional but sincere.\nShow him who you are, a caring person. If you bring this up I bet you it will help him realize this.",
