  "text": "First off I miss school dearly. I literally dream at night about going back to school all the time or just being on a college campus.\n\nI have always wanted to get my MFA and I think I would like to be an Art Professor. I love art, making art, teaching art and being on a college campus. However I\u2019m not 100% sure that\u2019s what I want to do and my life is in shambles right now. I don\u2019t currently even have a proper portfolio to apply with. I have a spread sheet of MFA programs that have full or partial funding with teaching being a part of the program lined up though. \n\nPeople warn all the time not to rush into a graduate degree or maybe skip it all together. Or wait until you\u2019re 100% certain it\u2019s necessary. I don\u2019t think I can level up in art world personally with out an MFA ( I could be wrong ). \n\nIt\u2019s always been a dream of mine to get an MFA but I don\u2019t want to make a poor choice just because it\u2019s a dream. I\u2019m 29 and graduated undergrad about 5 or 6 years ago. Not all dreams are meant to come true. I\u2019m trying to decide to really go for it or let it go. \n\nWhat do you think? Any advice? Go for it or let it go?",

You need a good portfolio to demonstrate your work.\n\n>However I\u2019m not 100% sure that\u2019s what I want to do and my life is in shambles right now.\n\nSo do you have a local college or university with an art department? If so, you could see if you could register to take a couple grad classes as a special student. \n\nPick classes that would help you to develop your portfolio pieces. And that experience would also give you a sense of whether or not grad school is really what you want to do. Finally, if you do well in the classes, that would also be in your favor when applying to an MFA program.",

      "text": "I wouldn't recommend going into an MFA to be a professor, go into an MFA to make better art. Art professor jobs are few and far between and extremely competitive. If you're willing to go into K12 art teaching though, you might look at MA programs in art ed or there are some out there in studio art. There are a few funded MA programs out there. You do need to have a solid portfolio and an even more solid statement about your work to get into a funded MFA program. You can also look at post-bac programs (not funded) if you want a class environment to help you build your portfolio or community college classes would also be a good start to get your work going again.\n\nAn MFA program is tough and I would not enter into one lightly. You have to deal with constant critique and some professors who really love to tear you down and the workload is very intense. There is also a lot of growth and excitement around new work and possibilities. I'd have conversations with some current grads and recent alumni of programs you are interested in before applying to make sure it is a good fit!",
