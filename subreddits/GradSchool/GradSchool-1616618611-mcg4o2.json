Take care of yourself first. You can try to let your friend know you still care about them, even if you're out of spoons, and if they're a true friend they should understand. This is a globally unprecedented time (in our lifetimes) and you have had other massive life changes on top of it!

That means I have to improvise. Texts at 3am (she's awake then). Letters in snail mail. And taking 3 short/ very cheap flights to visit her when she finally had space to breathe one weekend in Boston (from California). Her boyfriend gets the good weekends for visits, and sometimes I get the crummy ones. \n\nI don't think you should apologize for your very valid worries and concerns and time spent focusing. \n\nValidate their feelings, \"yeah, I've been extremely busy/ stressed and I just can't spend time doing casual things.\" \nAnd don't be like, \"I'm sorry\" when things are clearly a certain way due to priorities. \nVery valid priorities.", "author": "StolenPens", "created": 1616623591, "upvotes": 23}, "gs3md51": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mcg4o2/my_friend_told_me_that_i_have_been_a_shitty/gs3md51/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1616622716, "upvotes": 193}, "gs3ltfj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mcg4o2/my_friend_told_me_that_i_have_been_a_shitty/gs3ltfj/", "text": "I've become a worse friend and family member over the course of my PhD. I felt (and feel) guilty about it, but I remind myself that this is literally the most logistically complex thing I've dealt with in my life. I boom and bust, sometimes I spend days pulling myself together for a stressful deadline or meeting or interaction. I'm trying very hard to be professional and supportive of the people in my direct workspace and figure out my next steps, so by the end of the day my brain just shuts off. I have a lot of supportive friends and family who want to help, but the only thing I can really ask them for right now is patience.\n\nThat being said, isolation can really do damage. I found myself in a cycle of not being in contact, and then feeling too guilty to resume communication. The stress also made me feel incredibly vulnerable, so I became more avoidant to avoid dreaded questions like \"how are you?\" from friends and family outside the program. Waiting it out is not the answer.\n\nIf this friend is important to you, I think it's important to set expectations that allow you to be a reliable friend even if you're not around often. Figure out what time and effort you can provide, cut yourself a margin for stress inflation, and then ask your friend about one thing you can do that fits within those limits.\n\n* A phone call every 4 or 6 weeks isn't a ton of time with your friend, but it's something you can both look forward to.\n* Pick an emoji that means  \"can't talk, still alive, thinking of you\" that you can ping out once a week or so.\n* Avoid nebulous commitments - being more present in the group chat or texting more often is an unclearly defined stressor when I don't know how I'll feel week to week.

It just means that we have limited available time and sometimes some difficult decisions need to be made.", "author": "ko_nuts", "created": 1616619698, "upvotes": 71}}}
