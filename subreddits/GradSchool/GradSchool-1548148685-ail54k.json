I just wanna graduate with as minimal stress and as little time as possible (I already felt like I did my time in this dept when I was a masters student here, I\u2019m ready to move on to the next step of my life)\n\nI\u2019m only a second year trainee but I\u2019m reasonably reassured that my project\u2019s future is a bit more certain and I am honestly just relieved that I most likely will not encounter a deadend with my thesis project (and be forced to backtrack or start over). My departments average graduating time is 5.5 years but I wanna push for 4.5, just not sure how feasible that is lol.. I\u2019d be ok with 5 years \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m still way relieved :)", "author": "xyloneogenesis", "created": 1548148685, "retrieved": 1632953880, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 391, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"eeq67mf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ail54k/today_my_dissertation_project_went_from_maybe/eeq67mf/", "text": "Congrats!
