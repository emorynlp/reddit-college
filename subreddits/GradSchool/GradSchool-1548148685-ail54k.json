  "text": "I\u2019m kinda a weird case because I\u2019m not the brightest student in the classroom and I am like only acceptable at analyzing literature, and I have no plans on staying in lab science past my PhD program, so I\u2019m not super pressed about pumping out a million papers or looking for a breakthrough during grad school. I just wanna graduate with as minimal stress and as little time as possible (I already felt like I did my time in this dept when I was a masters student here, I\u2019m ready to move on to the next step of my life)\n\nI\u2019m only a second year trainee but I\u2019m reasonably reassured that my project\u2019s future is a bit more certain and I am honestly just relieved that I most likely will not encounter a deadend with my thesis project (and be forced to backtrack or start over). My departments average graduating time is 5.5 years but I wanna push for 4.5, just not sure how feasible that is lol.. I\u2019d be ok with 5 years \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m still way relieved :)",

I finally felt \"safe\" and like I would be okay towards the beginning of my fourth year and it was a long journey getting to that point. It is definitely an amazing feeling and I'm always happy when I hear a fellow graduate student feels this way about their project!",

(I just got seed funding for my startup too, I work on that in lieu of TAing/etc)\n\nBy some miracle I got into my dream school (top tier, close to home/friends, full funding, what\u2019s not to like?) and I\u2019m enjoying the process so I have no reason to leave. \n\nWithout giving out too much info, a fellow lab member is targeting the same protein as I am and we wanna find out whether it\u2019s essential to the parasite or not (its a side project for him, and my main project for me), but we\u2019ve had a hard time knocking it down lately. We recently just got results that indicates it is essential, which is pretty much ensuring that my project will have some sort of publishable result (that isn\u2019t a negative result like \u201cthis protein is junk and does nothing\u201d) ",

              "text": "Well. It sounds like you have a lot of creative energy that you are investing in a lot of different fields. It sounds more like you just decided/realized that academia is not your preferred career direction any more. A Phd is still an enjoyable process. Many researchers say that their PhD was the best time in their career. When they could focus most on research and had to worry much less on funding for projects. I think you should look at your PhD experience more positively and not undermine your abilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way. It's true. There is this bias for positive results in science. I don't understand why that is. Results like \"we were looking for this, and it turns out that's not it\" should be equally publishable. If anything it would be helpful for people working on the same thing. It is important to have a good record in the literature of what has been done and has failed as well.",

I was an English major in college and in my academic career I've pretty much only ever been commended on my work when it came to literary theory and exposition. But then I was like \"meh science is cool let's try that instead\" and now I'm four years into in a STEM PhD program like \"woops how'd this happen I'm actually not very good at this??\" So, I completely understand feeling intellectually underprepared, and also not feeling pressed to publish a bunch or make a splash in the field. I just want to finish and get out. Recently got the OK on my dissertation proposal, so just trying to bear down and get my work done because you know what they call the graduated PhD whose dissertation was the worst in their department?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA PhD.",
