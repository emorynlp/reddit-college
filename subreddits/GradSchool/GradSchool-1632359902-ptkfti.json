This program offers both masters and doctorates, and I am pursuing my doctorate as I did my masters at a previous program. My cohort is mixed of masters/doctorate students, but I feel like they treat me differently than my peers did in my previous program. I loved talking about our research with them, but here it just feels like everyone is trying to one-up each other all the time. For example, I asked a peer what they thought of a certain analysis in a paper we read for class and they immediately began summarizing the paper instead of discussing the question I asked. Or I asked someone about a specific area of study and they listed off other areas of study I should research because they\u2019ve researched it and \u201cit seems important\u201d (it wasn\u2019t relevant to my area of research - I wrote my masters thesis on it).  Am I in the wrong program? Am I just crazy behind where I should be? Or are my peers just going through a bad case of impostor syndrome and I\u2019m a victim of it? I I love this area and the program was supposed to be very collaborative but it feels just competitive.", "author": "emo_academic", "created": 1632359902, "retrieved": 1632952097, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"he0f08w": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ptkfti/i_feel_like_my_peers_look_down_on_me/he0f08w/", "text": "It would be valuable to engage the Director of Graduate Studies to help swing the culture of this cohort around a bit to be more collegial and less defensive.

I don't think they're doing it to you because they look down on you, I think they're trying to trick you into thinking they're smarter and more experienced than they are. If they looked down on you, they probably wouldn't bother, so I don't think it's anything personal. \n\nFrankly I see this in every batch of first year students since I entered grad school.

Another possibility is this is an example of people's brains working differently. I often run into this problem, where I have a very specific question, but people answer a broader question instead of the one I asked because they haven't been thinking about the topic as much as I have and can't quickly enter the headspace of something so specific without going over the whole thing first to refresh their minds on the topic (does that make sense?). So I recommend not taking it personally! I have a very strong feeling it's not about you, and more about them.
