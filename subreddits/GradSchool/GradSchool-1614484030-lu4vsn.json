I was in a much better mindset to do so as well.\n\nI strongly believe people cause themselves more damage by not grieving when and where they need to. Your dad will be proud of you no matter when you finish, but your dad will also want you live a happy and fulfilled life (and would know that to do so, you have to heal). \n\nThink of this time not as one to finish your studies immediately for him, but as a time to honor him.

As a fellow grad student who is right at the finish line but has also powered through some personal struggles, I'd say just be honest with yourself and what you need- physically, mentally, and emotionally.  There were many times I felt like I needed to just push through, but take it from me: it can be extremely taxing and take a huge toll on your health, motivation, and overall quality of life.  Here are a few things that helped me:\n\n1) Getting daily exercise.  It doesn't need to be an intense workout every day, just something.  The weather has been getting nicer where I live, so I try to take a few walks throughout the day when I'm hitting a wall.    \n\n2) Give yourself some downtime!  You need time to recharge and it'll help you stay motivated.  Read a book, watch a movie, do a hobby, anything besides schoolwork.  \n\n3) Get plenty of sleep.  I can't stress this enough.  There were times that I was trying to get so much done and would sleep maybe 4-5 hours a night, but that's not sustainable at all.  If I had to do it all over again, I'd tell my former self to get at least 8 hours a night, because the work will still be there in the morning and you'll be more productive.     \n\nIf you really are feeling it, consider taking a leave of absence.  I think that's much better than you literally running yourself into the ground.  Or, try to keep a countdown calendar to show you how many days you have left until you're done.  Then maybe take some time to decompress.  \n\nHang in there, we're here to support you!", "author": "stanpiotrowski", "created": 1614533277, "upvotes": 2}, "gp6zh6z": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lu4vsn/advice_for_grieving_while_in_grad_school/gp6zh6z/", "text": "Take some time off of research and truck through the courses or try to get them dropped (could be late in the game, but your faculty may be understanding).

It was...rough. I woke up every day and would study, then work, then sleep and repeat. On the weekends when I had free time it would hit me like a truck but I wouldn't ignore it then.

An extra few months in grad school is nothing in the grand scheme of life, and feeling overwhelmed and not processing grief fully can have long-term ramifications. \n\nIf you decide you really do need to keep up with school, my advice is to never feel guilty for your feelings, taking a day off, not doing as well on an assignment, first paper draft etc. Trying to go for a walk everyday and reconnecting with old friends really helped me.

I am happy I pushed through and learned skills to help me get through (even though it was terribly difficult in the moment). You make your own decisions, but if you do decide to stay enrolled, here are some tips: \nBe ok with doing the bare minimum. I went to class as often as I could make it, but if I felt like poop I didn\u2019t go. I took extensions on everything and worked just a little every day. I was ok with what I called 10% days rather than pushing myself to be at \u201cregular\u201d levels of productivity. Get a therapist and maybe get on some meds. Stay in touch with friends, whether in person or over phone/zoom. Allow yourself moments to grieve everyday as emotions arise. Grief is real, but it is not forever, and part of getting up everyday is trusting and hoping that the peaks of grief are just for a season of life, even when it feels like the grief will always be overwhelming. You can get through a semester of grad school so long as your expectations of what \u201cgetting through\u201d are changed to accommodate your very real needs right now.

One of those crises was mourning a death. Not a parent but my childhood/lifetime pet, my 24 year old parrot (I\u2019m an older PhD student), passed this summer after several months of decline requiring round the clock care, and it hit me very hard. I took a couple days and then tried to force myself to work. It was not a good time. I was neither productive nor rested, and had been burned out even before the death because of how much time and thought and energy his elder care took out of me, and this evolved into bad burnout and depression. I didn\u2019t have classes, I\u2019m just ABD, and the lack of structure didn\u2019t help, either. Having activities and things to distract you can be good, but you can\u2019t force it. If you\u2019re not able to work through it, fighting it endlessly will only make things worse. Fighting within your ability can be a good thing to get out of a rut, but you need to be able to identify your limits and be mindful that your limits are going to be a lot lower right now. Know that they will get better over time. \n\nFinally, some words about grieving itself that has helped me frame my grief in a way that is manageable for me. Grief is like an ocean. It is large and seemingly bottomless and it comes in waves. The waves will pass over you and sometimes they will be large and sometimes they will be gentle. With time, the frequency and strength of those waves become further and further apart, but be mindful there is going to be some variation in the rate of improvement, including some times when you get some really big or frequent waves even when the overall trend is diminishing. Don\u2019t fight them. It\u2019s ok to sad and to have to cry seemingly randomly. It\u2019s 100% normal. Just know that over time things will get better. If you have access, I highly recommend getting a counselor through your school. Sometimes having someone to talk to about how you\u2019re feeling and knowing that they understand what you\u2019re going through in a way your professors and friends can\u2019t can give you a little solace.", "author": "JamesTiberiusChirp", "created": 1614524064, "upvotes": 2}, "gp675wr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lu4vsn/advice_for_grieving_while_in_grad_school/gp675wr/", "text": "Oh my gosh this post and these great comments are what I needed to see today.

It\u2019s your choice of course, but if I were you I would take a leave of absence. These are all tragedies even without the artificial social attempts at normalcy that have come with the pandemic. You deserve to be able to properly grieve and let yourself rest. School will always be there.

That is an overwhelming thing to be hit with.\n\n> Any advice on how to stay focused on school, when going through a personal crisis? \n\nThe personal crisis is more important than school right now. The burnout has already decided for you, anyways. It's okay to just \"get by\" the rest of the semester and then take some time off to focus on your health. That can be a leave of absence, or simply letting your PI know that you won't be able to focus on research for a couple months. Supportive PIs generally understand that these things happen, and some time off won't make a huge difference in the end: you will still do good work and get that degree in the future. \n\nI'm sure your dad was already proud of you, and he would want you to take care of yourself right now.", "author": "peregrination_", "created": 1614487346, "upvotes": 32}, "gp4edjg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lu4vsn/advice_for_grieving_while_in_grad_school/gp4edjg/", "text": "You can't.

My dad passed away my second week of grad school. There were a couple of things that helped me through it: \n\nFirst, don\u2019t smoke weed or drink. It\u2019s tempting, especially when everybody else is doing it. But it won\u2019t help. It will only make you depressed and anxious. \n\nSecond, find something to take care of. There were days when the only way I could get out of bed was by reminding myself that I had to feed my dog. Once I was up, it was easier to face the day. \n\nThird, tell your instructors what you\u2019re going through. Mine were supportive and covered a few of my classes to give me time to grieve. \n\nFourth, be kind to yourself. You\u2019re in an impossible situation right now. And these are not normal times. It\u2019s okay to give yourself a break and relax the expectations you have for yourself. \n\nI hope this helps.
