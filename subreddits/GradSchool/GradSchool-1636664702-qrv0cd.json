  "title:": "Anyone have experience changing research \"field\" in middle of PhD?",
  "text": "Brief summary of my life: I study pollinators (3rd year PhD candidate), became allergic to honey bees, treatment may not be working, and I may need to find a new field of study because if I'm stung by a honeybee I die. I've always been a field ecologist working in agriculture, but maybe becoming a theoretical ecologist would be a good next choice? At least there's less honey bees in my office.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to see if anyone else had experiences changing \"fields\" and thesis topics half-way through. Of course, I'm hoping the treatment does actually work, but I wanted to consider other options :/ And I know becoming a theoretical ecologist isn't that much of a change, but I may need to switch up my committee a bit to get a modeler advisor...\n\nThanks y'all!",

      "text": "I changed fields in my 5th year. I work in a computational subfield, and it turned out that a specific statistical method that my advisor and I had been hoping I could use to ultimately tie my thesis together did not work because of a major theoretical issue. (Lesson learned -- never put all your eggs in one algorithm basket.) I ultimately was only able to salvage one paper from the intended three stemming from this line of research. I suppose I should be grateful I was able to salvage one at all, but it definitely feels like a lot of wasted years now.\n\nSo when I should have been finishing up my thesis, my advisor and I were instead scrambling to find another problem I could tackle. With the help of a collaborator, we were able to find something, but it was very much out my wheelhouse, and so far out of my advisor's that my collaborator is really my research advisor at this point, with my original advisor still providing funding. Essentially, I was starting over in my 6th year with a new thesis in a field that I had no expertise in that did not correspond to my coursework or training. I'm now in my 8th year, and very likely going to go into a 9th. Not fun. Even though time has passed, I still feel like I don't really know what's going on in this new subfield I'm in because I've been scrambling the whole time and never had a chance to take some months to sit down and understand this area. \n\nIt's still good that you are in your 3rd year rather than later -- there's lots of worse horror stories than mine in this subreddit of people needing to change their topic 5th year and beyond due to advisor abuse, terrible life circumstances, and the like. Definitely try to find a new subfield that hews closely to your original one for the sake of saving time. Going from experimental to theoretical or computational could definitely be overwhelming at the outset, and finding a closer subfield will at least make the transition easier. The topical specifics of a thesis tend to change anyway even when someone stays in one field; more worrying than the topic are the familiarity with the methods. You want to end up in a subfield that doesn't leave you swimming in a sea of terrifying unfamiliar methods for 1 - 2 years (and without the benefit of coursework to help that transition).",

      "text": "It sounds like it's not just your PhD area study that needs to change. But rather your long-term career goals, if you had planned on being a field ecologist after graduate school.\n\nSo yes. This could makes sense if switching directions opens up more career opportunities for you now that some have been shut off for me with your current area study.\n\nIf you decide to do it, talk it over with your advisor and the director of graduate studies of the department. That way the department is very aware this is a necessary change that has been forced upon you.",
