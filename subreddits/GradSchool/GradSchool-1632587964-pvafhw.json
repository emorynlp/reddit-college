It\u2019s a 4+1 program, so this is actually my last semester of undergrad AND my first semester of grad school. This has created an odd pace to my life, but so far it\u2019s not bad. \n\nOriginally I planned to wrap up the masters in a single year, but my school really emphasizes how this program is built for people working full time. As such, I accepted a job offer with a shiny salary and will be starting that in January. \n\nEvery class in my program is 8-weeks, so I\u2019ll only have one class at a time every 2 months. This doesn\u2019t seem too bad to me right now, but obviously it\u2019ll depend on the class. \n\nIs anyone else in a similar situation/program?

You'll get into the flow of doing classes before starting your job. That said, have you worked a full-time job before? Is this new job in tech? It's just hard to predict if you haven't had that experience before. I would perhaps reduce your course load the term starting in January if possible. \n\nAlso, does your new job know that you'll be doing the degree program? This is helpful because you'd ideally like a slightly slower ramp into things and to not seem like you're falling behind when really it's just a time issue.\n\nEither way, it is totally doable.
