Honestly even Nobel Prize award ceremonies drop the title often or use professor if the person is a professor.\n\nThe only emails I get referring to me as Dr. are vendors, salesman, predatory journals or outright spam. It's to the point that after years if I see an email addressing me as Dr. I either ignore it or am very suspicious of it. And I dont sign off any of my emails with Dr. because no one else does.\n\nNow if at your University all emails to male graduates refer to them as Dr and all to female graduates refer to them as Ms. then yeah that is all kinds of messed up. Might though be a case of the sciences just not referring to anyone as Dr. internally.",

The conference is a 7-day cruise trip along the Caribbean.\n\n\nFirstname, this dream vacation... err this conference is the most significant update that has ever happened in the history of OP's research field!! \n\n\nLooking forward to seeing you using tax payer's money on this unforgettable experience. \n\n\nPS: still waiting for the book chapter we sent you an email about. \n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\nThe Editor\n\n\nEdit: Haha, totally misunderstood the title!
