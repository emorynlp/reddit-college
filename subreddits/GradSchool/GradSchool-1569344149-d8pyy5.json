  "text": "My advisor is so quick to dismiss my ideas. \u201cThat\u2019s not relevant,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s not publishable,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t waste your time,\u201d \u201cwhat is the significance?\u201d That\u2019s just the surface.\n\nLast semester I took two very heavy classes, and he suggested them. On top of that, I was his TA. In March, he put me on a new project and expected basically immediate deliverables. I told him my classes were taking up all my time and that in order to keep the minimum gpa requirement for the project I need to put more focus on my classes. Once the summer hit, I tried to close the gap between where I was and where the project was, but both I and the project were moving forward. It was far too overwhelming. At that point, I was just doing what they told me to do on top of what they\u2019ve already done while I was trying to keep my head above the water.\n\nMy advisor said that because of my lack of contribution he didn\u2019t want to completely dismiss me so he wanted to talk about options. For this project, he\u2019d only to continue to support me if I step down as an MS student because \u201cyou\u2019re not being a PhD student; you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re told; you\u2019re being a technician. Consider this your last chance.\u201d He was also the source of a lot of drama and miscommunication. His approach was \u201cthrow her into the pool and expect her to learn to swim.\u201d But I was in a condition where I was already drowning as is.\n\nI consulted the grad office. I made sure I had nothing to lose. The thing about my university is I can switch back to PhD anytime I want to. So...to be funded, I temporarily stepped down.\n\nI recently took an interest in another direction of research. I talked to one of the professors of a class I\u2019m taking. He apparently is currently doing research in that area. That professor is a world renowned physicist. Very famous. When I told him about my position and warned him of my lack of experience, he said he will actively work with me, not against me. When I told him about how my ideas get dismissed, he knew exactly who I was talking about and said \u201cyeah he is very close minded.\u201d The cherry on top is I can actively practice my Hungarian too! (My fianc\u00e9 and I plan to spend part of our honeymoon in Budapest.)\n\nNot only did he listen to my ideas, but he said \u201clet\u2019s turn these into publications!\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s write a proposal!\u201d\n\nHe also said he\u2019ll help me reach my target in graduating in two years because I already wasted 2.5 years. He also said my current experience helps tremendously.\n\nThank you for listening to my relief. :)",

      "text": "Congrats! I entered as a PhD student in one program and essentially stepped down to an MS student after something far too similar happened. I then worked with a very sympathetic professor (part of the grad office) who helped me find my current program and advisor. I am again a PhD student and funded in a different program. It\u2019s a much better fit for me and I used my experience to help find my new research topic (I am in a social science)! I love seeing people who had rough journeys like me happier now that they are on the other side especially when they are still in grad school. \nYour advisor can really make all the difference. \n\nGood luck with your new advisor!",

          "text": "Staying anonymous is a bit hard, though. Each PI only has so many students (if we talk about direct supervision, not courses) and if you mention situations you had problems in, even if you keep it vague, the PI might already guess who's reporting there.  \nAnd if you take away stories of why this PI is problematic and just stick to grades it becomes kind of useless because different people have different needs and see different behaviours as unacceptable.\n\nOf course you could write that \"anonymous report\" once you left but if you are staying in academia you still need to maintain some kind of relationship with that person. At least you want to avoid burning bridges completely. You never know when you'll meet again.\n\nI'd actually also be vary about who you might throw under the bus. I could write a pretty negative story about a prof at my university (who never supervised me), just going by what his students and others told me, but question is, who will suffer? Knowing him he'll still blame his current students and scream at them.",

I recently learned to not be fooled by how professors teach a class; how they are in research can very well be the complete opposite.\n\nI was considering switching to another professor in my group. That professor is such a kind person and an extremely generous instructor. He is also super smiley and personable, always talking about what his target milestone is as well as how his wife and kids are. In research, though, it's a different story. After a close friend talked to me about how he is in research, I immediately reconsidered; the professor's relationship with his advisees is pretty much the same as my relationship with my former advisor was. It's always his non-advisees who say he's the nicest guy in the world. It's his advisees who say he's very tough and pushy.\n\nThere is a difference between being a boss and being a leader. Your former advisor, my former advisor, and my friends' advisor are bosses. My new advisor is a leader. Rather than knock his students down, he builds them up. Rather than throw his students into a pool and expect them to swim, he works *with* his students.\n\nTL;DR: Your example is completely normal, and that's why I believe it's important to garner opinions about a professor from students who work directly under them.",
