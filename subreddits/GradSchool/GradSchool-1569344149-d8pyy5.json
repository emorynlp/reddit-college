On top of that, I was his TA. In March, he put me on a new project and expected basically immediate deliverables. I told him my classes were taking up all my time and that in order to keep the minimum gpa requirement for the project I need to put more focus on my classes. Once the summer hit, I tried to close the gap between where I was and where the project was, but both I and the project were moving forward. It was far too overwhelming. At that point, I was just doing what they told me to do on top of what they\u2019ve already done while I was trying to keep my head above the water.\n\nMy advisor said that because of my lack of contribution he didn\u2019t want to completely dismiss me so he wanted to talk about options. For this project, he\u2019d only to continue to support me if I step down as an MS student because \u201cyou\u2019re not being a PhD student; you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re told; you\u2019re being a technician. Consider this your last chance.\u201d He was also the source of a lot of drama and miscommunication. His approach was \u201cthrow her into the pool and expect her to learn to swim.\u201d But I was in a condition where I was already drowning as is.\n\nI consulted the grad office. I made sure I had nothing to lose. The thing about my university is I can switch back to PhD anytime I want to. So...to be funded, I temporarily stepped down.\n\nI recently took an interest in another direction of research. I talked to one of the professors of a class I\u2019m taking. He apparently is currently doing research in that area. That professor is a world renowned physicist. Very famous. When I told him about my position and warned him of my lack of experience, he said he will actively work with me, not against me. When I told him about how my ideas get dismissed, he knew exactly who I was talking about and said \u201cyeah he is very close minded.\u201d The cherry on top is I can actively practice my Hungarian too! (My fianc\u00e9 and I plan to spend part of our honeymoon in Budapest.)\n\nNot only did he listen to my ideas, but he said \u201clet\u2019s turn these into publications!\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s write a proposal!\u201d\n\nHe also said he\u2019ll help me reach my target in graduating in two years because I already wasted 2.5 years. He also said my current experience helps tremendously.\n\nThank you for listening to my relief. :)", "author": "Palerthanghosts", "created": 1569344149, "retrieved": 1632953220, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 776, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"f1etwwv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/d8pyy5/i_am_about_to_make_the_greatest_decision_ever/f1etwwv/", "text": "Awesome.
