{"sid": "pgnfv6", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgnfv6/5th_year_regrets/", "title:": "5th Year Regrets", "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm starting my 5th year in a chemistry PhD and questioning how much I want/need to invest in finishing. It is standard for people in my group to finish within about 5.5 years with 1-2 high impact papers. I'm working on one right now and am a second author on another pretty good paper that will probably come out in a year. I don't know how long it will take to write and publish my first author paper, as my boss is notoriously slow (2-3 year average to publish a paper once manuscripts start to be reviewed)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boss is very friendly and the most lenient PI ever. I can name three people in the past 5 years that have \"graduated\" without publishing, and after not doing any experiments after their 2nd or 3rd years. I have been trying to move my projects forward, but hit a slump for most of last year due to virus problems and general lack of motivation. I like doing lab work, but every time I try to dig into the theoretical aspects of my work I get very discouraged and want to quit outright. I don't feel very confident with the math and get nervous when people ask me to write equations from memory and can't (why is that a thing?). I can't tell if I'm more incapable or uninterested in learning the material, as I care most about the applied parts of my work. I know everyone talks about imposter syndrome, but I find it hard to apply that to myself when I have literally seen imposters graduate. That sounds harsh but one of them did not even try to write a paper on their work before leaving with a PhD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suspect I would like more applied work, but I've also realized that the jobs most relevant to my work (pharmaceuticals) are likely in cities, where I don't want to live. I also don't need a high-paying job for the lifestyle I want. I got ridiculously giddy the other week when I realized how delicious (and cheap) red lentils are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, my PI talked to me a few months ago about starting another project on the theoretical things that he said would \"make a nice PhD\" along with my other work. I don't know if I have to make a paper of it because of how grant funds work, or if I can do some experiments and yeet cause I don't want to be here that much longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo with that in mind, I feel like I have a few options:\n\n1. Finish the PhD (\\~1.5 years)\n2. Try to finish earlier with a Masters (idk how feasible that is?)\n3. Just leave\n\nEdit: I am a PhD candidate/finished comprehensive exams and am \"one more experiment\" away from having a complete story for my first author paper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking for any advice on how to move forward.", "author": "Femdo", "created": 1630606523, "retrieved": 1632845137, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbdhfee": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgnfv6/5th_year_regrets/hbdhfee/", "text": "Hey!  I'm in the same boat!\n\nI'm taking it as a point where I'm just going to have to take this one on the chin and keep moving forward.  Even if it sucks.\n\nI'm also in a really weird period where I'm an \"international\" and in the process of going through the immigration process.  I might have to finish part-time due to what my lawyer advises me to do.  But at the end of the day, you're almost there.  It still sucks but just doing it will be very beneficial.  After that, you can always change. \n\nTLDR: Shit sucks.

If you have the drive to finish, finish. After all, you have invested a great deal into this and it would be a shame to walk away with less than you put five years into unless you have decided that staying isn't worth it for you. You really need to do a cost-benefit analysis (financially, emotionally, what opportunities you are gaining/losing, etc.) to make the decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeaving would honestly just be a huge waste UNLESS the cost of finishing is higher than the cost of dropping out. But if there is any feasible way for you to complete, I suspect you would carry it as a big emotional scar if you just dropped out without trying your best.", "author": "ProprioCode", "created": 1630618151, "upvotes": 2}, "hbd6tpq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgnfv6/5th_year_regrets/hbd6tpq/", "text": "For all that is good in the world just finish. Would you climb 90% of the way to the top of Mount Everest then turn around because you're tired?\n\nIf your answer is yes then why bother with the rest.
