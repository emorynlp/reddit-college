  "text": "Hi all! So my first year of my PhD was last year. I technically wasn\u2019t terminated since I can apply for readmission but I had to withdraw because I had too many incompletes\u2026 that being said I don\u2019t love my department and think a fresh start could be good for me and want to apply to other schools \n\n1. Has anyone done this / know someone who has and has advice \n2. Or have insight on how one explains this to other schools next cycle \n\nI am hopeful I\u2019ll be ok w reapplying Bc it\u2019s always a crapshoot but I got into 4/11 good programs fully funded when\nI first applied and chose my first school\n\nTysm!",

I was in a semi similar situation (swapping departments because old PI was toxic and in charge) and the advisor in my now home department did all the paperwork and everything and made sure I got in seamlessly.  She\u2019s been a grad student ally in a lot of ways for a while so she did more than she needed to, but there are lots of good PI sick of the toxic bullshit grad students have to face and hopefully your new department advisor is one.",
