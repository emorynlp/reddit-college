Has anyone done this / know someone who has and has advice \n2. Or have insight on how one explains this to other schools next cycle \n\nI am hopeful I\u2019ll be ok w reapplying Bc it\u2019s always a crapshoot but I got into 4/11 good programs fully funded when\nI first applied and chose my first school\n\nTysm!", "author": "monicaheart3", "created": 1632456565, "retrieved": 1632952077, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he1wwik": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/puc20i/withdrawing_and_applying_to_new_phd_program/he1wwik/", "text": "If it\u2019s the same department you should be taking to your academic advisor.
