{"sid": "ctykvf", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ctykvf/for_all_the_new_students/", "title:": "For all the new students", "text": "As the start of the semester for many new grad students is fast approaching or has just begun I want to take a few moments to wish you all the very best over the next several years. Over your time in your respective programs you will be tested and pushed in a way that you may never have been before, and there will surely be times when you feel like you are not even remotely qualified to keep going. But remember that you were chosen out of all the other candidates for your program because of your unique qualifications and skills and that you, not your mentor, not reviewer number 2, and not the grumpy fourth member of your committee are the only expert on your thesis in the world. Have confidence in your knowledge, skills, path and most importantly in yourself. Never be afraid to challenge those that say you are wrong and equally never be afraid to ask for help. Everyone in this sub knows the struggles and is always here to answer questions, give encouragement when you're down, champion your accomplishments and be a listening ear when you need to vent. I look forward to seeing all the accomplishments this class will ultimately have and see the impact it has on the world because in a matter of years you will have provided the world with a piece of information that currently isn't out there. Again I wish each and everyone of you the very best as you start this incredible journey and hope that this post can be something you can look back on if you ever are feeling lost or discouraged.", "author": "thatguy6793", "created": 1566485838, "retrieved": 1632954446, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 287, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"exy38il": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ctykvf/for_all_the_new_students/exy38il/", "text": "Starting a highly selective polisci research grad programme in a couple of days and I'm quite nervous.
