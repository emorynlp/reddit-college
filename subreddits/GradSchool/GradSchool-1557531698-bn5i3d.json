  "text": "I have been in a serious depressed state of mind for the last 6 months basically, and these past couple weeks has put me over the edge. I have decided to just leave with a masters degree and find a job in industry. This is just a friendly reminder that your mental health is more important than how many papers you publish, that's just a fact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's ok to not finish your PhD. You are not any less of a person for stepping away and starting a new chapter.  My biggest fear for leaving is what people would say about me or how they would look at me differently, but guess what...NOBODY CARES and you should do what you want to do and not be miserable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers",

I'm just worried about the opportunity cost to my career that lacking a PhD might incur (although this may be more pessimistic than it needs to be since I'm trying to change from an academic scientist to a software engineer or data analyst type role in industry). I think it was the right decision, but I haven't gotten anywhere since then (no job...). \n\nI think I'll be in a better place than I was, in like 5 or 6 years after quitting. But probably not 12-18 months. Although I hope I'm wrong on that last one.",

She protects her child from people who would do it harm. The goal of all the love she gives her child is the well-being of her child. \n\nA soldier doesn't care about the well-being of his enemy. He does all he can to harm his enemies. He shoots them, blows them up, denies them access to food and supplies when possible, drops bombs on them and every other act which will weaken and destroy his enemies. Why because his enemies don't care about his well-being or the well-being of his fellow citizens. The soldier cares about his well-being and the well-being of his fellow citizens; therefore, he fights their enemies. \n\nThere are various philosophical answers to the question \"what is well-being?\" as well as how to achieve it. The Greeks had a concept known as Eudaimonia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia which placed a high importance on virtue for its achievement. Amartya Sen pioneered the Capability Approach which purports that the freedom to achieve well-being is a matter of what people are able to do and to be, and thus the kind of life they are effectively able to lead.\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/capability-approach/\n\nIt's a complex concept which has been examined by many people over millennia.
