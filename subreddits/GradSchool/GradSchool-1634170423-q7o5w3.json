Not being paid for your work is, frankly, illegal and should be rectified immediately. Just because you also go to school there doesn't make your employer illegally withholding paychecks any less illegal.",

          "text": "Admittedly, with everything that was going on, I didn't notice the missed paychecks until last month. Then I reached out to my graduate coordinator immediately and checked up every week since. They submitted paperwork for the missed checks, which was taking a very long time with the HR and payroll offices for some undisclosed reason. I sent another angry email this week, cc'ing multiple department admins and several offices, and finally it seems the first tier of paperwork went through. In retrospect, I probably should have just started with that last angry email. It's just so frustrating that I have to fight so hard for money I'm owed, that I brought in from an external fellowship I won.",
