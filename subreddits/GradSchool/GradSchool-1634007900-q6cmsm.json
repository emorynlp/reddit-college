  "text": "I know to many this will sound insane. \n\nThis semester I started a master's program, but already I'm lacking motivation. It's not necessarily that I hate the subject; it's just that I'm not particularly passionate about it, and I'm feeling pretty lost in life.\n\nIt's in a STEM field that leads to a \"good\" job (in a field that I've worked in for a few years already), but I just can't find the motivation required to succeed. I feel like my life should be about more than securing a \"good\" corporate job, but I'm not sure what my options are, realistically. \n\nAny advice?",

      "text": "If grad school leads you to the job you really want, then give grad school your professional best to get there.\n\nOtherwise, if you're questioning why you are there, and whether it's worth it, then give it your professional best to the end of the semester and then evaluate whether you should stay. \n\nYou're already halfway through the semester. So you might as well finish it out by doing well. \n\nIf you decide to stay, then you'll be glad you did. If you leave once the semester is over, you'll be able to express in a job interview that you did well during the semester, but decided you would prefer to work.\n\nIn other words, there's no upside to doing poorly on your midterms and crashing and burning the semester.",

      "text": "you\u2019re not alone. the first semester is a lot to take in and it\u2019s important to be patient with yourself. there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling unmotivated sometimes, especially when you\u2019re outside your comfort zone or if you\u2019re not particularly enjoying the class. but hopefully you find some enjoyment in the program overall. there are some larger concerns in your post that only you can work through, but in the meantime good luck with your midterm and I\u2019m sure plenty of ppl might be able to share study tips here if you need them \ud83d\ude42",
