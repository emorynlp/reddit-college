When I was using the app I specifically searched for prospective dates with match rates above 90% because I was tired of going out with people only to find we had major differences in values or beliefs. This obviously is a very different experience in online/app dating than tinder. I saw someone wrote to indicate in your profile that you might be moving around. That\u2019s a great idea! Then dates know what to expect. You might meet someone who finds the idea of moving with you to be exciting and feel like an adventure. \nI want to mention that dating apps are a very different experience depending on gender.

I hadn't really dated at all (except for a long distance internet relationship in my teens lol) until grad school. I was in the habit of going off and on dating apps, mainly for entertainment/distraction, and nothing had ever really come of it except momentary validation that I was still a cute person lol. But the summer after my 1st yr of PhD, I fell very quickly into a relationship with someone I met on a dating app and it's been just over 2 yrs with him now. \n\nThe beginning of the relationship felt literally traumatic. No one tells you that ending your relationship with long term singlehood can be genuinely painful even though you want to spend time with a person. It was hard adjusting to the reality of sharing space and time, making compromises, coming to terms with the reality of a human to replace my fantasy of a forever-love-of-my-life, and understanding that just because they don't tick your imaginary boxes doesn't mean you're being untrue to yourself. \n\nI thought I had to break up with him over and over again. Every doubt I had became \"should I just finish it? Am just in this because I can't face being alone again?\" The only thing that kept me from letting him go was the fact that the idea of it made me sadder than I thought it would, and it didn't seem to be for the wrong reasons. \n\nI'd constantly wonder what the future would be like if we went into this. I'm an international student and he's from the country of my university. One day, I would have to graduate and take next steps. I had to talk to a lot of my friends who have been in long term and short term relationships or just had more experience dating to understand that it's fine to not know. I had to understand that I can enjoy what I have now and wait to make decisions when it makes sense to think about them, when we know what's coming next. That it's better to have this than not have it, regardless of the future. \n\nI like to think of it as a phase of my life. I'm not sure if he will be coming with me into my next phase, but I will always have this phase. The experiences I take from this phase will never be a waste. No phase of life is a waste. Everything you fill it up with colors your experience of that phase, and if I can make this phase as good as I can, that's great. That doesn't mean that if I start the next phase with all new things - new location, new people, whatever - that that next phase will be somehow tarnished because I didn't carry something from this phase along with me. \n\nMaybe this means that I'm stopping something in my heart from making a solid connection with him now, but that also doesn't mean that if he DOES come with me into the next phase, that I can't strengthen and solidify that connection THEN. It's okay to defer commitment I think, and it doesn't feel like doing that has tarnished my current phase either. (It helps that he lives in the moment just as much - in fact, I've picked up a lot of this outlook from him!)\n\nLife is just a long ass journey, man.

As such it\u2019s not always a choice. \n\nBroadly I would say the two biggest features are how many people you date at once, the duration of your relationships, and whether they are local or long distance. Obviously the feasibility is an issue. By being on your track it pretty much eliminates the choice of long-term and local.\n\nFor example a common dating strategy is to be serially monogamous. Date one person at a time. If you choose short durations you can still date lots of people. There is an exploration/exploitation trade off with how many people you date (dating more people let\u2019s you learn what you want and what\u2019s available, but limits enjoying the relationships you do find). \n\nOr in the flip side you could date many people for long durations, or any sort of combinations you like. \n\nSo long as you are honest and upfront with the people you date about what you\u2019re looking for, I think all dating strategies can be practiced ethically. It\u2019s a process to figure out what works for you and what makes you happy. \n\nSometimes you have to compromise on what you want in terms of career or relationships. But there are often more options than we first think.

This could mean, 60-80 hour work weeks, frequent travel, conferences, the possibility of relocating for work and the possibility of a meager salary.

Then after a Postdoc (or whatever) finishes, I move again. and again. How do you even try to build/start a relationship under those conditions?\n\nThis is one of the reasons I am leaving academia. Not the only one, but the overall uncertainty is something I am no longer willing to deal with.  \nThe uncertainty your describe never goes away, either you (and your partner) are willing to accept that or you get out. There is no magic solution to make that go away. And this isn't a problem with new relationships, even if you would have a partner for years you would have to discuss how to deal with all the moving. Do you go long distance? Is one person sacrificing their career to move around with the other one? Do you both make compromises that aren't ideal but at least allow you to stay in that same place? When do you want to have kids, pets, a house, whatever? When can you even afford that if you don't even know where you will work next year and under which conditions? And not having secured income for the next years comes with other problems, too, e.g. if you ever need to take out a load.  \nAnd not having a partner also does not make it easier, you still leave a lot behind, every time you move. Family, friends, communities... You constantly uproot your life to start over somewhere else, often without knowing for how long exactly and where your career leads you next or if maybe the next stop is your last one because you might ultimately fail to secure that rare tenured position. And until you have that, a long time will pass. For tenured professor, most people achieve that in their forties, so you still have more than 15 years of uncertainty ahead of you. If you get lucky, you might get another permanent position in academia somewhere but to be honest some of these are even rarer than professorships, although achievable earlier.\n\nSo yeah, I can't really give you advice, there really is no good solution to this problem. You just need to start dating and be honest about this problem with your partner from the start, so they can decide whether they want to deal with that or not. There will be people you really like that will see it as a deal-breaker and again, there is nothing you can do about that. If you want to be an academic you need a supportive partner that is willing to either move with you or go long-distance, no way around that. It makes dating a lot harder, obviously. It makes anything harder.\n\nAs said, I will leave academia soon and the moment I realized that now I can actually make plans what I want to do or have in the next years was great, because for the first time in my life (and I am 32 now), I actually have an idea where I will be in the next years.  \nSome of the professors I know had that with 45 or even 50 years, when they finally got a permanent position.", "author": "LittlePrimate", "created": 1598565784, "upvotes": 2}, "g32ird9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ihsh6d/what_even_is_dating_during_a_phd/g32ird9/", "text": "You\u2019re thinking way too hard about this.

Don't be afraid to meet up and grab drinks or a coffee (maybe not now during the pandemic lol) and just talk to them. Worst case scenario, you guys don't click and you go about your life. Also, understand that rejection is common and try not to take it personally. I would focus more on just having fun/meeting people.

Have fun! I don't mean necessarily have sex, I mean, you can if you want, but when you start talking to someone, or go on a date (online or irl), don't worry about what it would be like to be in a relationship with that person. Honestly, you will probably meet a lot of people you just don't click after the first few dates. Instead of planning too much, just enjoy the moment. Talk about yourself, ask questions, have a good time! As someone mentioned, you can make it clear on your profile you will move in a few years, and that's ok! I did that, met my now bf two years ago, and in a month he's moving with me across the country because I got a job there!
