  "title:": "Can I get a master\u2019s in education if my bachelor\u2019s is in something else?",
  "text": "Basically I\u2019m having a quarter life crisis. I\u2019m not sure what to do and the stress of the pandemic and everything else isn\u2019t making things any easier honestly because getting any kind of employment is so difficult. I have seen what jobs I\u2019m faced with and none of them are really appealing that I can get with my current degree. I need to do something else and I\u2019ve decided I need to go back to school. There doesn\u2019t seem to be too many other options to get into something different without doing that. The problem is this: Can I get a grad degree in something that isn\u2019t my original major? I want to one day hopefully work at a private school or prep school (as of now that would be my dream job) but I just have a regular old English degree for my bachelor\u2019s. I\u2019ve started to learn though that that alone doesn\u2019t lead to much so I want to make a change. Ideally I\u2019d love to get a master\u2019s in literature but I know that isn\u2019t enough to teach at a college even though I would probably enjoy that. Would it be smarter then to get a master\u2019s in education instead? Would that set me up better to teach at a good high school? Would an education grad program take a student like me who didn\u2019t study education in undergrad? I\u2019m just thinking that may be my best option because from what I\u2019ve gathered a master\u2019s degree in English on its own doesn\u2019t seem to be enough for anything these days. You\u2019re considered overqualified to be a high school teacher especially if you have no direct teaching experience, and you\u2019re under qualified for any other higher education job. Community colleges now don\u2019t even want to hire someone who doesn\u2019t have a PhD and I\u2019m not sure I want to get a PhD cause that\u2019s even more money and time.",

If an MEd was only available to someone with a bachelors in education, there wouldn\u2019t be enough students to run the program!\n\nMost graduate programs will allow students with different bachelors to join. For more technical fields, they may require some bridging courses first.",

      "text": "Look into Secondary Education master's programs, with an endorsement in English, if you wanna teach high school. I'm majoring in English right now and I'm applying to a few of these right now because I'm considering teaching HS as a job (also considering getting a PhD which is why I'm applying to English MA programs, as well as journalism or editing).\n\nWith a few exceptions, these kinds of programs always have content area endorsements where coursework you completed in your undergrad degree is used partly to qualify you for application and admission. So if you want to teach English, then having an English degree qualifies you almost automatically (as long as you took the right classes in your degree to get an endorsement). Don't overthink it - if anything, a master's degree in education is teaching you everything you need to know and assuming that you only have limited experience.\n\nI hope this helps!",

      "text": "Hey, I have my master\u2019s in teaching and applied to both public and private schools. You don\u2019t need an education degree to work at a private school if you can get placed by Carney Sandoe etc. otherwise it\u2019s expected that your undergrad degree won\u2019t be in education. I would encourage you to find a program where you can take both education and english classes. A master\u2019s in English without education would qualify you to teach community college actually. But education classes help you learn how to teach especially if you have no teaching experience. Let me know if you have more questions!",

I looked up the Carney Doe site and wow! I have never once every come across such a great resource! What kind of degrees or qualifications are they usually looking for though in their candidates? Do they want master\u2019s degrees? Or education degrees?",
