  "title:": "(23 M) Thinking about grad school and I want some perspective from people that have been in this type of program?",
  "text": "23 male, a civil engineering student looking to branch out via graduate school. I'm more interested in multiphysics modeling, computational mechanics, simulations, and data-driven design, and learning more higher math. What programs and fields that you are part of that encompass these fields? What are you experiences? And what degree or knowledge is useful as a springboard for transitioning into this type of field? I'm getting the vibe there might be a lot of people with mechanical, computer engineering, or computer science, and physics backgrounds in this field. If you have such a background, feel free to share your experience and research!",

      "text": "Yes, agree on the post on Computational Engineering/Mechanics/\u2026 or Simulation Technology/Science or whatever your university calls them. However, I would either recommend staying in civil engineering and simply select courses solely in that field (if you can) or choose a program which also has some undergraduate/bachelor program to it. Even though you might have to take some courses from their undergraduate program before admission. Those grad programs sometimes (grad only) lack depth and you mainly get to take undergrad courses anyway. Just for the cost of not being able to take advanced courses (or just a small amount).",

      "text": "Mechanical engineering student currently in grad school with a focus computational modeling, simulation, and analysis. I also work in aerospace defense and I would say mechanical/aerospace engineering and physics are the best fit in terms of degrees (depending on the programs offered at a given school) along with classes in applied math. I have also taken a couple of classes in engineering data analysis that had strong ties to civil engineering/geological sciences so I would say you\u2019re starting from a pretty good background",
