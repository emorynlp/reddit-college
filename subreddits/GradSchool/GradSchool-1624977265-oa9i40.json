Just wanted to start by giving my background partly for my own reflection and partly because you might find parts relatable.)\n\n### Background\n\nI came to NYC for grad school in 2013. Everything was _amazing_ in the beginning. I felt like the \"golden student\" in my class. I even finished my credits early so that I could go work at NASA as part of my thesis research!\n\nBut when I was finishing up at NASA in late 2015, I started to have some medical problems. Everything from then until now has been one long, humbling, and frankly painful chapter of my life. I had to go home so that my parents could take care of me during treatment. It was rough.\n\n- One of my medications caused liver problems, and supervised withdrawal from that med took a whole year.\n- My girlfriend (understandably) had to move on with her life.\n- When I moved, it was slow and exhausting, like an out-of-shape centenarian.\n- Reading _anything_ became harder and harder for my brain.\n- The rest of my class graduated. Then the next class, then the next class\u2026\n- Some of my friends started having kids.\n\nAnd there I was, stuck, feeling like my life was ruined. In addition to the original physical health problems, I became severely depressed.\n\nBut finally, in 2018, the \"you need to get worse before you can get better\" treatment shifted from \"get worse\" to \"get better.\" My doctors said it was safe for me to start physical therapy (which I completed, so now I'm _allowed_ to do regular exercise but I'm still quite weak), and I began to retrain my brain to read.\n\nMoving back to NYC in early 2019 felt like picking up where I left off in life, which was good even with some stumbles of its own. It took me longer to find a place to live than I expected, and by the time I was stable in that regard, it was already summer.\n\nThen 2020 happened. That messed up _everybody's_ plans, of course. You were there. You know.\n\nBut I kept chipping away at my thesis. Learned about the [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) method, and that helped a ton, but a lot of it was really just a matter of agonizingly rebuilding the work skills that had atrophied with my body.\n\nAnd yesterday, at long last, I submitted my thesis. Moving back to NYC felt like picking up where I left off in life, but this feels like actually taking strides forward again.\n\n### Message of Encouragement\n\nIf you're struggling, then my heart goes out to you. Don't give up. You can make it.\n\nRemember that person you were before your life was knocked off course? Remember how it felt to be that person? Smart, hard-working, capable, and accomplished?\n\n_That's still who you are._\n\nYou're going through a hard time now, but you haven't \"lost\" that person. On the contrary, the reason you're making it through your struggles as _well_ as you are is because you're exceptional. It might be hard to see, but you should be proud. Most people would not be doing nearly as well if they were dealing with what you are.\n\nHang in there. Do what you need to do one step at a time. Above all, take care of yourself.", "author": "SquareBottle", "created": 1624977265, "retrieved": 1632846176, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 324, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h3in21o": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oa9i40/a_message_of_encouragement_from_somebody_who_just/h3in21o/", "text": "Great post!
