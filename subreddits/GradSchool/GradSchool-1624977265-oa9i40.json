  "title:": "A message of encouragement from somebody who just submitted their thesis after YEARS of living in a nightmare.",
  "text": "(The message is at the bottom. Just wanted to start by giving my background partly for my own reflection and partly because you might find parts relatable.)\n\n### Background\n\nI came to NYC for grad school in 2013. Everything was _amazing_ in the beginning. I felt like the \"golden student\" in my class. I even finished my credits early so that I could go work at NASA as part of my thesis research!\n\nBut when I was finishing up at NASA in late 2015, I started to have some medical problems. Everything from then until now has been one long, humbling, and frankly painful chapter of my life. I had to go home so that my parents could take care of me during treatment. It was rough.\n\n- One of my medications caused liver problems, and supervised withdrawal from that med took a whole year.\n- My girlfriend (understandably) had to move on with her life.\n- When I moved, it was slow and exhausting, like an out-of-shape centenarian.\n- Reading _anything_ became harder and harder for my brain.\n- The rest of my class graduated. Then the next class, then the next class\u2026\n- Some of my friends started having kids.\n\nAnd there I was, stuck, feeling like my life was ruined. In addition to the original physical health problems, I became severely depressed.\n\nBut finally, in 2018, the \"you need to get worse before you can get better\" treatment shifted from \"get worse\" to \"get better.\" My doctors said it was safe for me to start physical therapy (which I completed, so now I'm _allowed_ to do regular exercise but I'm still quite weak), and I began to retrain my brain to read.\n\nMoving back to NYC in early 2019 felt like picking up where I left off in life, which was good even with some stumbles of its own. It took me longer to find a place to live than I expected, and by the time I was stable in that regard, it was already summer.\n\nThen 2020 happened. That messed up _everybody's_ plans, of course. You were there. You know.\n\nBut I kept chipping away at my thesis. Learned about the [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) method, and that helped a ton, but a lot of it was really just a matter of agonizingly rebuilding the work skills that had atrophied with my body.\n\nAnd yesterday, at long last, I submitted my thesis. Moving back to NYC felt like picking up where I left off in life, but this feels like actually taking strides forward again.\n\n### Message of Encouragement\n\nIf you're struggling, then my heart goes out to you. Don't give up. You can make it.\n\nRemember that person you were before your life was knocked off course? Remember how it felt to be that person? Smart, hard-working, capable, and accomplished?\n\n_That's still who you are._\n\nYou're going through a hard time now, but you haven't \"lost\" that person. On the contrary, the reason you're making it through your struggles as _well_ as you are is because you're exceptional. It might be hard to see, but you should be proud. Most people would not be doing nearly as well if they were dealing with what you are.\n\nHang in there. Do what you need to do one step at a time. Above all, take care of yourself.",

          "text": "Thanks!\n\nI have a digital Zettelkasten, but to my surprise, I think I might switch to a hybrid system. Taking impermanent literature notes while reading is just too _easy_ with a keyboard, so I end up taking too many notes. It's sort of like how if you highlight too many lines, the highlighting becomes unhelpful because you can't tell what's important anymore. By taking the literature notes by hand, I expect to be considerably more selective with what notes to take and more efficient in how I write them. Then, while I can still make sense of those quick notes, I'll them into permanent notes on my computer.\n\nOn the computer, I've settled into using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) are good options too. Really, as long as a text editor supports bidirectional links and/or backlinks, it should work particular well. [You've got options.](https://alternativeto.net/software/obsidian/?feature=bidirectional-links) But of course, you don't actually *need* those features. They're just really nice to have.\n\nIn any case, I highly recommend the book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+to+take+smart+notes&qid=1625028613&sr=8-1) by S\u00f6nke Ahrens if you want more information on how to start your zettelkasten. But really, just get started. Just accept that you're first several notes will be formatted inconsistently as you figure out how to do it. And the /r/Zettelkasten community is very welcoming and helpful too!\n\nGetting a zettelkasten started is definitely an investment. It took me a month just to wrap my head around how to do it because it was so different from every other workflow I knew, and then another couple months of faithfully adding notes before chains of thoughts started to emerge within the zettelkasten itself. But yeah, I really wish somebody had told me about this methodology when I started ~~my thesis~~ ~~grad school~~ ~~undergrad~~ high school, or maybe even earlier.\n\nAnyway, my zettelkasten isn't the only aprt of my workflow that I'd consider game-changing. If you aren't using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [some other reference manager](https://alternativeto.net/software/zotero/), then give one a try. Also, [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) and [other mindmappers](https://alternativeto.net/software/xmind/) might provide more helpful ways of organizing things like your paper's structure and tracking your usage of different types of sources.\n\nI'd also suggest taking stock of what your weaknesses are and spending a limited amount of time trying out different tools that can help. For example, if you know that you thrive when you have a routine, then you could use something like [Strategr](https://khrykin.github.io/StrategrDesktop/) to plan your typical weekday and then keep it open on the side of your screen. As another example, if you get demotivated and beat yourself up for not working enough, then you could get a wall calendar and stamp each day that you work for at least ten seconds (because every step is a victory) to have an incentive to [not break the chain](https://mrbuzzfactor.medium.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-hack-don-t-break-the-chain-8d1944b8323d)) that also serves as a visible testament to your effort. Get stuck fixating on tasks that aren't actually important? [Mindful Mynah](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindful-mynah/id503981565?mt=12). Bad managing your breaks throughout the day? [Pomotroid](https://splode.github.io/pomotroid/). Eye strain because you're looking at dense blocks of some soul-killing font like Times New Roman? Treat yourself to a better text editor like [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) and a better typeface like my personal favorite [Sina](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/hoftype/sina) (the regular non-italic weight is free, and you can buy other weights as needed\u2026 or you can find a typeface within your budget that brings _you_ joy). But yeah, instead of procrastinating by endlessly searching for every tool and life improvement for every problem that _anyone_ has ever had, actually take the time to make a list of _your_ specific workflow impediments.\n\nLast of all, don't just backup your work every once in a while. Make sure your entire workflow lends itself to keeping everything backed up. [And make sure your backup regimen is actually good.](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-back-up-your-computer/) I mean seriously, take a minute to imagine how absolutely awful it'd be to lose your work because you assumed you were backing up your data adequately instead of actually taking the time to look up what makes for a bulletproof backup system.\n\nThat's all I can think of right now. I've veered out from zettelkasten to my broader workflow, but hopefully this has been helpful. If you have more specific questions, then I'll try to provide more specific answers. :)",
