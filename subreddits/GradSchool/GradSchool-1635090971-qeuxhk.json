  "title:": "Can I get into the MFA Graphic Design(Prelim) at Yale?",
  "text": "Hi guys! I am interested in the three year MFA Graphic Design program at Yale and wanted to know whether I have any chance of getting in. I talked to one of the graduate students of this program and I was told that this three year program is open to students who don't have a Bachelor's in the field.\nI am a CS graduate from India. \n\n8.6 CGPA (A+), 2nd rank in the whole University. \n97% (science stream) in higher secondary exams.\nIELTS: Overall 8 band. \nExtracurriculars: Was elected into the student union of our college as Magazine editor. I designed compiled and edited the whole magazine by myself. \nPrizes in cartooning, English poetry and story writing.  Was head girl during my high school days.\n\nVolunteer experience: Volunteer artist/graphic designer at three organizations.\n\nJob experience: One month as creative associate at a sustainability focused start up. \nI'm freelancing now.\n\n\nNow, my family is very poor so I cannot afford to pay the expensive tuition but I heard that Yale offers need based scholarships. Does that apply to art school too? Also, there's another hindrance I face. My Bachelor's degree was only three years long and I wonder if that would be a problem. \nPlease do help me guys, it would be much appreciated!",

You're essentially paying a fortune for bragging rights and little else.",
