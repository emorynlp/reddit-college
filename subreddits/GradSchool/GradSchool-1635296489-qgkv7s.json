  "text": "Hi! So here's a brief context for my post:\n\nI just finished my Masters in Environmental Engineering and I'm really interested in going into a PhD in Environmental Engineering, studying air quality.  However, my undergraduate grades weren't so hot, but I did do well in my Masters.\n\nI just started a full-time job working as an Environmental Engineer, and my question is, is there anything else I can do in the mean time to boost up my application?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, has anyone else gone to grad school after taking a gap year?",

That all helped boost my application and my knowledge, I recommend taking some time off between programs if possible. I could not have immediately jumped into a grad program after undergrad. I was pretty burned out on school and needed a break. I started my grad program this year more emotionally AND financially stable than I was years ago!",
