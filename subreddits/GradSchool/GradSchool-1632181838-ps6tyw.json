I need to express why I have passion to be a trader, I honestly love trading and have a big passion for it. I\u2019m always watching the news and keeping up to date with economics, also I\u2019ve been trading for years, I have experience trading. \n\nHow do I express this in words? Please help me, thank you.", "author": "sonytt763", "created": 1632181838, "retrieved": 1632952177, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.14, "comments": {"hdno7ck": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ps6tyw/need_helping_wording_for_my_job_application/hdno7ck/", "text": "You always want to find a way to describe your passion in more detail. Why do you have a passion? Do you feel like it\u2019s the backbone of the country or like you\u2019re supporting the future of our country? Does it intrigue you that it may influence (or be influenced by) politics or our environment? I\u2019m not as familiar with economy stuff or stocks but the more granular you become in your reason the more authentic and vulnerable you appear and that\u2019s what resonates with a job. Figure out what motivates you and reiterate the mission or ethics of your trade\n\nIE I have a passion for library and information science (yeah you need a masters for that). I\u2019m interested in the digital preservation of research we are curating today and how it will influence user experience in the future because all business, governments, and organizations rely on data on a local and international level. I love supporting doctors, firefighters, astronomers, biologists, and lawyers in their quest to obtain information during their degrees and I love supporting first generation students who weren\u2019t taught information literacy or who didn\u2019t have access to digital resources growing up. As a child that grew up without consistent access to information, I resonate deeply with the mission of providing all populations (regardless of identity) equal access to information without discrimination and to protect their privacy in their information pursuits. <\u2014closing statement is the mission of my trade. My example is obviously not written concisely enough for an app but it gives examples of how to relate your upbringing and identity to your passion and motivators. Hope this helps!", "author": "alikerd", "created": 1632182740, "upvotes": 1}}}
