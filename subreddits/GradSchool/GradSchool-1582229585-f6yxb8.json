I just found out this week I was accepted into a Master's program for Chemistry along with an assistantship (TA)!!! I can't even begin to describe how happy I am. Its truly a dream come true. The person I spoke to said it's very easy to transition into the PhD program after a year, so I'm hoping for that. Anyways, I'm looking for advice on how to prepare. What should I brush up on? What are somethings I should master before I start grad school? Any and all advice is welcomed.

This is an achievement work being proud of. From my experience, the transition isn't difficult, especially if you have done undergraduate research. As far as preparation, I would try to work out logistical things (housing, getting to/from lab) as early as possible so that you don't have to worry about while taking classes, teaching, etc.\n\nAdditionally, if you aren't an organized person or used to following a routine, start working on that. Time is a crucial resource in graduate school and managing it well sets you up to be successful. Make sure you schedule time for hobbies and activities outside of grad school so that you can recharge your batteries.\n\nStart reading primary literature. Try to keep up to date on the things happening in your field and that are related to your research. I usually schedule about an hour everyday to reading a paper or two. As you become more practiced, you'll pick up the pace and be able to get the  main idea of a paper by skimming through it.\n\nFinally (and this one might sound odd at first), start looking at job ads. Your goal at the end of graduate school is to get a job, and while there is plenty of time before you start applying, knowing what companies and/or universities are looking for can inform some of the decisions that you make during grad school. For example, if most of the postings that interest you emphasis knowing how to use a certain piece of equipment, try to gain familiarity with that piece of equipment.", "author": "kiwijohn340", "created": 1582241014, "upvotes": 4}, "fi8i5rg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f6yxb8/i_just_got_accepted_into_a_masters_program_for/fi8i5rg/", "text": "I have a masters in chem. I'd highly suggest you put a lot of thought into what you want to specialize in, as chemistry kind of has a bad job market for non-PhDs, as I know all too well (it's location dependant, though).

Congrats!!! I second another comment's advice, read your mentor's publications. Also with TAing, my advice is to be as strict as you need to be from day one. Are you teaching a lab? Do the students need to adhere to a specific dress code? You are now the safety czar. Because if you don't, you may get in trouble. \n\nIt's much more difficult to start out too timid and need to become strict part way though (learned from experience).", "author": "Everybodyslonely", "created": 1582239780, "upvotes": 10}, "fi8e5lq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f6yxb8/i_just_got_accepted_into_a_masters_program_for/fi8e5lq/", "text": "CONGRATULATIONS!!
