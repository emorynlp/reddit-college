I've been working on the same damn project for 1.5 years now, I'm very burnt out and even though I could not have written up and published a paper on this by myself (the paper was obviously the product of the work of 7+ people), I still feel guilty that I didn't do more and that I didn't push harder for those methods. I have \"back-up\" projects, but they're all essentially the same thing, just with different data. I really regret not applying to other PhD programs last year, but I thought that it would be better to have something to show for my work here - and now I don't even know if I will.

Happened to me as well. I was so worried about this happening that I dreaded researching topics related to my PhD because I feared that any day there would be someone doing exactly what I was trying to do. Only better and successfully. Eventually it happened and I was devastated. I still remember the poster that I had to present shortly after learning of such a publication. I was so ashamed of my own work that I didn't stand near the poster at all, rather got plastered on cheap wine and walked about for two hours.\n\nAfter several rounds of shame, depression, and escapism, I managed to learn that it's very unlikely that two people working independently on the same problem will come up with the exact same conclusions and focus on the same aspects of the problem (or the solution). Even if they are using the same methods and trying to achieve the same thing. It's amazing how a tiny detail or a slightly different inclination can make two seemingly similar works significantly different and still interesting.\n\nDo your thing, focus on what you think it's important and, by all means, take what you can from what is out there and build on it. Even if you have to adjust your direction, just do it. It doesn't matter much if the answers that you find are not the answers to the exact questions you asked 1.5 year ago. If this paper you found answers something that you wanted to find out in the beginning of your project, then use this. Go back to your original motivation and identify what would come after the successful outcome and work from there.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes of graduate students is to become overly committed to a project to the point of fighting against changes in its course. Changing directions does not mean starting all over from scratch. It means taking everything you learned from your own project and from new findings in the literature and realizing that you can now ask better, more informed, and more interesting questions. And then try to answer those questions. Sometimes not exactly in this order.\n\nEdit: grammar, typos.", "author": "makakeza", "created": 1622040957, "upvotes": 13}, "gziidnd": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nldwd6/saw_a_paper_very_close_to_my_work_and_my_brain/gziidnd/", "text": "Two people/groups working on the same topic (independently) has happened before.
