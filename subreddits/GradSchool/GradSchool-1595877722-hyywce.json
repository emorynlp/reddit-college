  "title:": "[Rant] I'm getting cut out of a grant based on my own research",
  "text": "Two years ago, I made a discovery that had nothing to do with my Ph.D thesis but was solidly in my field of expertise. I documented the results, drafted a budget and full research plan to explore the implications of the new discovery, and shared the details with my advisor. \n\nHe loved it. So much, in fact, that he submitted my plan and budget almost unmodified to the National Institutes of Health as a grant proposal. \n\nThat grant just got funded. And I've been completely cut out of the project. One of the things my advisor changed was removing a budget line for a postdoc and replacing it with a graduate student. A new grad student. I.e., not me. When I talked to my advisor about it, he said my findings were a product of HIS lab, not MY efforts. I'll get a line in the acknowledgements of any papers that are produced from the grant, but won't get authorship. \n\nI realize that I can't just jump on board a brand-new project when I've got one year left before I defend. And I know that it would have been selfish to keep my results to myself, especially as this discovery has some public health implications. And yes, I know it's highly unusual to write your own postdoc position. \n\nBut, dammit, I feel used. This wasn't just a chance discovery; I worked hard to get these results and they're important. I feel I should be involved in the project. Now my work is going to completely fund someone else's Ph.D and I'm not even getting an authorship out of it.",

Any sort of ethics committee or chair is likely to be worried about a PR problem first and foremost, so thread can serve as a bit of a threat for them of what can happen if they don't handle this PR situation properly. You do risk a bit coming off as a bit errant though - immediately airing dirty laundry online. I might suggest taking the following steps:\n\n1. Speak with your chair/ethics rep in person, and describe to them reasonably how you have a problem.\n2. Before you ask them for a particular solution, just mention offhand how you've also asked for advice online, \"of course, completely anonymously, I don't want to hurt our school's reputation\", and then show him/her this thread.\n\nYou have to be clear that you of course wouldn't go to the public like this, but on the other hand they'll get the threat just from everyone's responses on this forum.. and they'll feel the outrage of everyone on this thread agreeing with you as well. This thread is actually a pretty great card to play imo, if you play it right.",

So I worked on a grant proposal and brought in about 500k but then that year we had an influx of grad students which ended up cutting my salary in half during the final year of my PhD. The school made up a rule about max salary for grad students which is a BS wage ceiling imo so I was expecting some cut anyways but halving was a bit too much for my liking.",

You didn't see the version that went into the NIH, so you don't really know.  Only the abstract is available to view and not until it is awarded. \n\nIf you acknowledge that you have to be a professor to be noted on a NIH grant then how were you to get credit for it?  If it is a publication that is an entirely different story - leaving off a pub is a major dick move and really is misconduct.  There is literally no way to acknowledge a graduate student on a NIH grant other than and F31 proposal. I am not sure what sort of acknowledgement you expected from it.  \n\nIt sounds like you are pretty dissatisfied with this advisor, so do you really want a post doc with them?  Again, maybe they are looking out for you by having you not work on the project. Maybe they have some insight, maybe not, but sometimes it is better to give people the benefit of the doubt than hold a grudge.",

I was able to do that because the PI and my advisor are decent human beings that want others to succeed (and also, I earned it).  This is truly one of the more egregious things I've ever seen on this sub, and this says a lot.  \n\n\nIt's very important that you are not just hired by the grant, but named on the grant application as key personnel (contractor, postdoc, etc). It's huge for your CV to have your name on a federal grant (being hired by the grant is very different from being part of the team that won the highly competitive grant).",

Then they assured me that even if it was tendered, I would still have a strong role and could be subcontracted by the winner. Eventually they took my project and put up for bid and a consultancy won.

Folding the discovery into a bigger study would elevate its impact tremendously. If a patent were to arise from this discovery (it wouldn't, but for the sake of argument), then the patent would be assigned **to the university**, not to the lab. A portion of royalties would be funneled back to the lab, but the patent would be shared between the university and the inventor, not the university and the inventor's boss. By analogy, I believe the data belong to the person who generated the data (assuming no significant usage of lab supplies). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If they publish your data you have to be an author, but if your  preliminary data just sparked an idea then that's just a tough break \n\nThis is my major complaint:  the PI seems to want to throw out my data, re-do my analyses (to get the exact same results), and publish without me. That is totally unethical.",

I know these things tend to vary by institution, but that is generally how it is in the US.\n\nSecond point--is this actually what your PI is going to do, or is there a rationale for re-doing the analysis? Are there additional controls / conditions that need to be included and therefore there is a good reason for the work/analysis to be re-done? Is this data generated at the bench? Or was this some code you wrote to analyze existing data?\n\nRegardless, you do *might* a claim to this as your intellectual property. Have you tried talking to your PI and just saying that intellectually this is your baby and that you'd like to receive credit for that part of it? I have been a 2nd/3rd/4th author on several papers since I graduated that used some of my preliminary data etc. Even though I didn't do the work, my mentor considered my \"intellectual contributions\" valuable enough.\n\nMy advice would be to talk to your committee members about this. Don't be accusatory, but just ask them for advice and CREATE A PAPER TRAIL (put as much as possible into emails, so you can verify later if needed). Then if you are still inclined you can go to your PI with your concerns about not getting credit for the idea. If he/she says, \"No\", well now you have a paper trail (your notebook, conversations with committee members) if you want to challenge that. Just be careful, if you want to stay in academia this could blow up on you so bad. So, if you take that route, you better make sure that your case is SOLID--if this blows up on you it could be the end of your career in academia. I'm not saying that is the way it should be, your situation sucks balls, but this is just the reality of it.",

Only the abstract is made public. \n\nThe only place to get acknowledgement publicly for a proposal as a graduate student in an NIH grant is if the student writes a F31 or another mentored award.  \n\nThe student acknowledges that you can not get recognition by the NIH unless one is a professor (research or tenure track) so I am not sure what sort of acknowledgment the student wants because there is literally none their advisor can provide for a graduate student in the proposal. \n\nThe student is ready with fire and pitchfolks when I am not sure what they were expecting and how the advisor could have given them acknowledgement. \n\nAs far as not having them on the project, the student is in the last year.  Maybe the advisor is looking out for them and wants them to post doc in another lab since post doc-ing in the same lab is generally not a good idea.",
