I documented the results, drafted a budget and full research plan to explore the implications of the new discovery, and shared the details with my advisor. \n\nHe loved it. So much, in fact, that he submitted my plan and budget almost unmodified to the National Institutes of Health as a grant proposal. \n\nThat grant just got funded. And I've been completely cut out of the project. One of the things my advisor changed was removing a budget line for a postdoc and replacing it with a graduate student. A new grad student. I.e., not me. When I talked to my advisor about it, he said my findings were a product of HIS lab, not MY efforts. I'll get a line in the acknowledgements of any papers that are produced from the grant, but won't get authorship. \n\nI realize that I can't just jump on board a brand-new project when I've got one year left before I defend. And I know that it would have been selfish to keep my results to myself, especially as this discovery has some public health implications. And yes, I know it's highly unusual to write your own postdoc position. \n\nBut, dammit, I feel used. This wasn't just a chance discovery; I worked hard to get these results and they're important. I feel I should be involved in the project. Now my work is going to completely fund someone else's Ph.D and I'm not even getting an authorship out of it.", "author": "impressive_neglect", "created": 1595877722, "retrieved": 1632845378, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 499, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fzo9liu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hyywce/rant_im_getting_cut_out_of_a_grant_based_on_my/fzo9liu/", "text": "This sounds similar to my prof who got no credit from his supervisor.
