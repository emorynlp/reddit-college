  "title:": "Burnout is real. I decided to take a leave of absence for the spring semester.",
  "text": "This is purely for my mental health. \n\nI'm in physics, for reference. \n\nI started my Ph.D. program this fall after graduating this summer from undergrad. I haven't had a break in nearly 5 years, as every single summer or fall/winter break has been spent on research and applications. I was always pushed to do an REU as soon as possible, and I was lucky enough to get one for the summer after my freshman year. The ball just never stopped rolling after that. \n\nRight now, I'm regretting going so hard and never giving myself a chance to breathe. I never let myself relax because I was so anxious about getting into graduate school. Now that I'm here, I have absolutely nothing left to give. I'm so burnt out, I can barely bring myself to attend the graduate classes for the degree program that I worked so hard for. \n\nI talked to my advisor last week, and he started cracking down on me and why I wasn't going to all the department events, the class tutorials, and everything that they offered throughout the semester. I finally broke down and admitted that I'm so depressed and burned out that I can't bring myself to do it. I want to, and I know I have the capability, I just...can't. \n\nMy \"come to Jesus\" moment was when my advisor took a step back and asked me why I like physics. I realized I had a problem when all I could say was \"I don't even know, anymore.\" Physics used to be my true passion, and now it's just dwindled into grades, problem sets, and just trying to pass my classes. I don't care about what I'm learning, anymore. And that's really sad. \n\nSo, my advisor and I decided I need to take a leave of absence in the spring to \"reset.\" I'll come back in the summer. And to be honest...it's the first time I've felt any mental relief ever since I decided that I wanted to attend graduate school. I now have the strength to power through finals and get over this semester and this mental slump. \n\nI was terrified that I would be looked down upon for needing to take a break. But, I've realized that it's now critical for my success. And now I'm absolutely thrilled that I'm taking a break, and I'm proud of myself for recognizing that it's okay.",

I've started graduate school immediately after undergrad myself, but ended up burning out my first year without realizing, and ultimately dropped out. Took me about five years before coming back. But I have to say, those five years gave me a chance to travel, dive into hobbies, and start a professional life before starting my grad program again. Taking a semester off is definitely worth while to take on.",
