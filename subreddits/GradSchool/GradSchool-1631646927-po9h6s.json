Like I don't know how profs send out these letters to every school that the student applies for, and is there a need to contact them months in advance?\n\nFor most American schools that I've checked has a GRE requirement and math is a big concern for me, so how much do GREs matter?\n\nLastly, what are the best schools in America or Britain that I realistically have a shot in? Like schools that aren't IVY or world top 50, has a program that fits my field of expertise, and a flexible requirement.", "author": "MemphisCanadians", "created": 1631646927, "retrieved": 1632844569, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"hcvaes4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/po9h6s/i_dont_know_anyone_whos_applied_for_grad_school/hcvaes4/", "text": "The first step in applying to grad school is to contact the advisors you want to work with. 99% of advisors won't admit a student who randomly applies to work with them without having contacted them first. \n\nThe personal statements will all be pretty similar you'll just have to make a few adjustments to each one so that it's unique to the university you're applying to. But to get the overall personal statement done and edited expect to spend ~3 weeks (proof readers need time to give feedback).\n\nIt's a little late to be asking what schools are good so I suggest spending a lot of time researching professors who's interested align with yours. The timeline is usually you'll wanted to have started contacting advisors by the beginning of September in the US bc they can take a couple weeks to respond. \n\nThe number of recommendation letters will be specified in your application. The professors know how to send letters of rec,  they've done it plenty of times before. Don't send more letters of rec than are specified in the application.\n\nIn the US most grad programs are getting rid of the gre requirement but it varies from program to program. If you're applying to a large program then they might require it to weed out some applicants. Also be prepared to explain the low GPA. Most universities want at least a 3.0, but smaller programs can be flexible with this if you can explain it to them.", "author": "hakeemalajawan", "created": 1631653146, "upvotes": 2}, "hcuxcrb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/po9h6s/i_dont_know_anyone_whos_applied_for_grad_school/hcuxcrb/", "text": "What is your timeline here?
