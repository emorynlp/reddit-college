  "text": "I'm an organic chemistry PhD student in the UK, I'll be finishing my PhD soon and I've always wanted to permanently live in the US. \n\nI know that there is a limit of 65,000 on the number of H1Bs that are given out each year for companies via a lottery, and that if I take a post doc at a US university it will likely be under a J1 visa, and that US universities are H1B exempt.\n\n1. Would it be possible to go straight into a research associate job under the H1B visa without a postdoc?\n\nI've been looking on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn but most research associate jobs in universities don't say if they will sponsor a H1B visa.\n\n2. Would it be possible to take a post doc under the J1 visa then somehow get sponsored for a green card by the university possibly through EB2 or self sponsor under EB1-B?\n\n3. Also what is a NIW ( national interest waiver), I've seen this term used on other posts, what are the requirements for this and what happens if you apply for an NIW?\n\nThanks for your time",

Most of them will sponsor you in if you meet their needs. \n\nIn private industry it was the case, but _something_ happened in 2016 that brought an entire narrative of bad people taking jobs away so companies seldom sponsor now. But hey you\u2019ve got a PhD and that increases your chances of getting a sponsorship anyways. Just keep looking and don\u2019t be disheartened.",

Why offer the idea of \u201cstaying here to learn\u201d through CPT and OPT when extremely few companies even bother?

Your average fresh graduate will work 2 years at most at his first job and then move on, a guy on OPT will stick around those 3 years to learn and then _be made to move on_ \n\nAll faith wouldn\u2019t be lost with the so called \u201cEinstein\u201d visas (the EB\u2019s) if you weren\u2019t aware deeming you \u201cworthy\u201d falls on the same guys who declared Melania Trump, a Slovenian citizen a \u201cvaluable asset\u201d for the United States through an EB card. \n\nThen there\u2019s the backlog. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m keen on trying to stay and helping out as an engineer in any way I can, but if the country decides I am not worthy I\u2019ll just try somewhere else. It saddens me that a younger me didn\u2019t see it this way and got himself stuck for another attempt with his Masters when I could\u2019ve moved over to Europe or Canada.
