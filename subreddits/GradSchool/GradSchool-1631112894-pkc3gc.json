Would it be possible to go straight into a research associate job under the H1B visa without a postdoc?\n\nI've been looking on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn but most research associate jobs in universities don't say if they will sponsor a H1B visa.\n\n2. Would it be possible to take a post doc under the J1 visa then somehow get sponsored for a green card by the university possibly through EB2 or self sponsor under EB1-B?\n\n3. Also what is a NIW ( national interest waiver), I've seen this term used on other posts, what are the requirements for this and what happens if you apply for an NIW?\n\nThanks for your time", "author": "Hunter-2_1-Actual", "created": 1631112894, "retrieved": 1632844721, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hc2zs65": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkc3gc/possible_routes_to_become_a_permanent_resident/hc2zs65/", "text": "I\u2019m like the opposite, currently a PhD candidate in the US but wanna do postdoc in the UK.

Try applying for those post docs. Universities don\u2019t have an H1B cap as you rightfully mentioned. Most of them will sponsor you in if you meet their needs. \n\nIn private industry it was the case, but _something_ happened in 2016 that brought an entire narrative of bad people taking jobs away so companies seldom sponsor now. But hey you\u2019ve got a PhD and that increases your chances of getting a sponsorship anyways.
