The whole experience was rather brutal tbh and I'm sure it's even more so during this pandemic. Grad school is rather isolating by nature. On top of that, there are many many expectations and it was one of the first experiences I have had where I couldn't perfect everything. I can imagine how much worse the experience is due to this pandemic but what you are describing is a lot of the grad school experience, unfortunately. Managing that disappointment and finding a way to take what you want from life is a lot of the training.

But now I\u2019m just lonely af.\n\nDon\u2019t have any real advice, as I feel pretty bleak about romance as well. But I try to remind myself that finding someone and settling down this early generally means it\u2019s more likely that it doesn\u2019t work out. And in a way, it is exciting that we\u2019re still free to do whatever the hell we want, even if most nights that\u2019s just tv and pizza.
