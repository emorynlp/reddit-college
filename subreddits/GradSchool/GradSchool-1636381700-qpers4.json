  "title:": "Non-traditionals: How did you boost your application for your unrelated Master's/PhD?",
  "text": "I'd consider non-traditional students to have pursued graduate studies unrelated to their latest degree. A Master's in Computer Science from a Bachelor's in Biology, a PhD in Financial Economics after a Master's in Physics, a Master's in IT after an English degree, etc. I'd also consider a low GPA to be non-traditional.\n\nHow did you beef up your profile, especially if you did so after graduation?\n\nI want to apply to a Master's in Biostatistics. The program I'm targeting is course-based so no thesis, and is hosted within the university's public health faculty. My Bachelor's is STEM (non-quantitative) with only a minor in statistics. I work in consulting now so unrelated work experience.\n\nI'll need to take up a couple more classes in mathematics, that's for sure. Multivariate calculus, at the very least. Hopefully, I can find some way to take a class in mathematical statistics.\n\nThe GRE is not required for the program I'm targeting, nor is it for most programs I've looked into.\n\nI'm thinking of taking up a casual/part-time research project with a professor working in biostatistics, or public health.\n\nI could also see an argument for a side project, such as the analysis of a public health public dataset to showcase proficiency in statistical methods.\n\nI'd love to hear feedback/anecdotes/thoughts/success stories!",

      "text": "Non-traditional in the low gpa sense ahaha. Anyways, I\u2019m a recent psych major applying to information science PhDs and cognitive science PhDs, and a couple psych masters. My gpa is subpar (2.87/4) but I think what\u2019s really giving me a fighting chance is clear research interests and lots of prior research and work experience. Also my 60/90 gpa is a lot higher. If you approach a professor you\u2019re interested in working with, with a good sense of direction and interest in theirs and your own research then that can really help your chances. You can also leverage your non-traditional major in your personal statement. If you can build a connection with a professor you\u2019re interested in having as a faculty advisor prior to applying, your chances are a lot higher. Goodluck friend!",

Coursera is free if you apply for financial aid (I've applied for like 5 classes and they've all granted me free tuition every time).",

That\u2019s actually great advice! I\u2019m pretty experienced with Python, but I didn\u2019t know about Coursera\u2019s financial aid! I\u2019ll definitely look into it. Good luck on your applications too friend!",

      "text": "Amazing to see people follow their passion !! I am an Aerospace Engineering undergraduate right now, trying to apply to a Masters in Astrophysics. I know it may not be too far'fetched but it is a switch over from engineering to a science degree. I did NOT have any coursework in Astrophysics at university and was only part of the science club, where I nurtured this interest. But every internship I've done was in the Astrophysics field, with research experience too. Haven't had the luck of publishing yet but I do feel confident working in this domain. I believe any sort of experience in the field you are applying to, can be possibly exaggerated to an amount, to make people know you are passionate. Looking forward to the comments of others as well, cuz it'll help me out too !! Cheers :)",
