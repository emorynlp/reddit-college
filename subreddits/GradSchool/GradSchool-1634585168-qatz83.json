  "title:": "Chances at US Politics PhD?",
  "text": "I wanted to know what my chances of success at a funded US politics PhD are. I am thinking of making 5-10 applications to top 20 schools. I have been told I can get a PhD in Economics with funding in the UK, which is my citizenship, so if a US political science applications seems a waste of time/money I won't apply.\n\nDetails on me. I have got good university results (but never truly excelled), have coding/statistical skills and have some prior work experience, and I am a British citizen. I have a BA in PPE from Oxford University where I got an average mark. I also have an MRes in Economic from Bristol University, which is a highly technical course which focuses on statistics and theoretical economics. My writing sample would be my dissertation from the MRes, which was also a pretty technical paper. I have a year of work experience as an Economic Consultant. I have 2 years of experience using Stata and Python. My GRE scores are (Verbal: 163, Quant: 164, Writing 4.0), I did two weeks prep for GRE and focused on Quant so I think I could boost them further.\n\n \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qatz83)",
