For a field where research tends to be individualistic, I've always wondered - what the heck can I do now, in my master's, to get published? I'm in a non-thesis master's, because I want the co-op option it gives, but then how do I get published?\n\nWhere should I look to get published? Do they mean peer-reviewed journals, or is something like an 'academic society' or 'academic community' journal/magazine good enough? How am I supposed to be a 'good researcher' or show 'researcher skills' in my master's?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTIA. Jealously looking at the STEM PhDs who have a bit more research bouncing board/aren't stuck into individualized research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'd like to hear from other people too, actually, not just English PhDs.
