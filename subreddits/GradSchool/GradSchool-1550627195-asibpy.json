Don't let programs strong arm you into a decision you don't want to make!", "text": "Congratulations on your admission into graduate school! Now that you have an offer in hand, please be aware of your rights! \n\nMost major graduate programs are subject to the April 15 Resolution (https://cgsnet.org/april-15-resolution)! If you have been offered funding of any kind, they cannot rescind the offer before April 15th. Many professors and program directors will either be unaware of (or willingly ignoring) this rule. In doing so, they undermine other programs and put you in a bad situation.\n\nAs a graduate student, you will be in a position very low on the totem pole for quite a while. It is important that we, together as grad students, do not let those above us beat us around anymore than they already do. If a program refuses to stand by the April 15 Resolution, please contact the departments relevant deans so that others will not be taken advantage of in the future. And you probably don't want to be involved with such a program anyway.\n\nP. S. Feel free to reach out if you need any additional advice regarding pressure to make a decision from a program. I'd be happy to help where I can.\n\nEdit: Clarified that this applies to funding offers. A list of universities this applies to can be found on the linked site.
