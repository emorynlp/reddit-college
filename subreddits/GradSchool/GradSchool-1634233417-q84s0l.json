  "text": "There is a recent post: [\"New Trend? Students Refusal to Use Titles\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/q8021l/new_trend_students_refusal_to_use_titles/) on /r/professors.\n\nIt seems that quite a few people in that thread view titles are very important and want students to address them using their title. At all the institutions I've been at, this was not at all the case, so I was curious on the perspective of folks here regarding the use of titles. I'm interested in the concept in general, not just between grad students and faculty.",

      "text": "IMO, you call people what they prefer to be called, period. It's not up to someone else to dictate what another person should be called, regardless of what their reasoning is. I think it's a bit narcissistic, to be honest. If a person has more of an egalitarian mindset, or whatever their reasoning is, that's fine but you don't get to impose that on other people without their consent. If a student wants to call their professor \"Dave\" in front of their friends or whatever, nobody can stop them, but if Dr. David Smith wants to be called Dr. Smith, then that student should address all professional communications to him as Dr. Smith and he should be referred to as Dr. Smith in professional contexts, like the classroom and at the university. Whether students like it or not, their faculty are not their peers or equals and maintaining a professional distance is always appropriate. Being too informal and too familiar in contexts with power differentials can be problematic. \n\nIt's also weird to me why this seems to be okay in academia but not, for example, a doctor's office, courtroom, or industry. I bet these people will say \"Your Honor\" if they have to appear before a judge rather than call them \"Clarence\", or refer to their boss as \"Mr\" or \"Ms\" if that is the norm of the office. If a professor introduces themselves as Dr. Smith, then you call them Dr. Smith because they are establishing what is considered normative in that context. \n\nIf a student wants to get a PhD and have their future students call them by their first name, that is their choice, but they can't make that choice for other people. I personally have mixed feelings about whether I will use my title or not, because although I am white and male, I am also gay and LGBT people are often not treated as authority figures in the same way heterosexual men are. Women and racial minorities are similarly disregarded as authorities, so if using their title means they are treated with the respect and authority that their expertise has earned them, then that should be respected.",

Some people in the original thread mentioned that it is often cultural, where people default to \"sir\", \"miss\" or \"teacher\" as a sign of respect and that has absolutely nothing to do with protesting anything.",

              "text": "I have the exact opposite experience: the people who insist the most on using titles tend to be women and people from marginalized communities because they tend to be quickly disregarded as experts, or have people openly doubt their expertise or qualifications. Many women I know in academia have talked to me about how some male students, in particular, talk to them as if they, the student, are the expert rather than the woman with the PhD. Also in my experience, it's mostly (straight) white men who don't care what their students call them because they are automatically seen as more authoritative by default. \n\nMedical and law programs are also professional programs, so they are not directly comparable to PhD programs. You can also treat your PhD students as junior faculty while those students still respect the title you earned. It's still not up to the student. My point was that it is up to the person who earned the title to indicate what they prefer to be called--and many of them do choose to be more informal and go by their first name. If someone says they prefer to be called Dr. Johnson, that is what you call them, period. That really isn't something that can be debated. You can have a healthy department culture while still being respectful of someone's earned title.",

But there was one professor who *insisted* on being called Dr. Name. Because it stood out as so strange and stuffy most people metaphorically rolled their eyes at it but acquiesced.\n\nNow, though, I get it. Anyone who works hard to be a doctor should be called a doctor if they wish. Additionally, I know many fellow women in STEM will have students who insist on calling them Mrs./Miss. even after corrected and at that point I'd just feel disrespected. And so I'm inclined to use \"Doctor\" when the time comes.\n\nThat said, I also am in a profession with a lot of patient-interaction where if people are calling you 'doctor' it could lead to a misunderstanding about your expertise even if it's completely accurate to be called doctor. I know some others who are PhDs working in healthcare don't use doctor to avoid being confused with an MD.\n\nAt the end of the day I approach it the same way I do as someone's preferred name or pronouns: It costs me nothing to respect how others identify and want to be addressed, but it could mean a lot to them, so do it.",

That is, students are more likely to address a female professor or instructor with a doctorate as \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\", compared to male instructors with the same qualifications. This relates to the difficulty that is sometimes experienced by female (and gender non-conforming) faculty in being treated by students as authoritative.\n\nFaculty who don't present as masculine don't have the luxury of being relaxed about the use of their title, so if faculty who do *are* relaxed about it, it ends up compounding the difficulty. Faculty who want to be called \"Doctor\" end up looking stuffy by comparison. For this reason I think it's an important exercise in allyship for male-presenting faculty to insist on being called \"Doctor\" as well.\n\nNow to be clear, I'm referring to undergrads above. Generally (in the US) graduate students and anyone else working in a research lab will not refer to professors or postdocs of any gender by their title -- first names are standard.",

So you see: equality in treatment does not guarantee equality in outcome, and equality in outcome is the goal.\n\nRespect between colleagues is a real, but separate issue, in my experience and the experiences of those whom I've spoken with about this.

The reason I identify them as separate issues isn't because they're not coming from related places (they are, broadly: misogyny, the ur-bigotry), but because they take place in mostly separate arenas and are combatted in mostly separate ways.

      "text": "From my experience, many (but certainly not all) of the people who insist on being called by their title are insecure and/or do not actually have much else to brag about. I did my Bachelor's at a fairly low level Uni, but Master's at an Ivy league and my PhD at a european equivalent to an Ivy league Uni. My advisors and other Profs at the later two (including a Nobel prize winner) always insisted on being called by their first names. Not so at the low level Uni. \n\nIn general, I think it is a good idea though to start out using the title until they tell you otherwise.",

I interact with many PhD scientists at work and know all of them by their first names. \n\nOut of respect I have been communicating with prospective professors as they wish to be addressed, which I have been inferring from how they sign correspondence. \n\nI have been realizing that professors that use the formal title kind of turn me off. I\u2019m fine calling someone Dr. Lastname if that is what they wish, but I definitely instantly feel more supported by someone who asks me to call them by their first name. It is probably no coincidence that I was on a first name basis with the only professor from my undergrad years that I still speak with occasionally. \n\nDr. Firstname is a good compromise in my opinion.",

My new school the professors across the board get super weirded out if we use Dr and insist we use first names. I\u2019ll still say Dr sometimes and they correct me.

I really appreciated it and remember the conversation 20+ years later (fuck I'm old). \n\nNot everyone feels the same way. It takes an immense amount of work to complete a terminal degree and some prefer to have that effort recognized in their title. Personally I don't feel that way but I don't exactly stop people from calling me \"Dr.\" either.  I will admit the faculty/staff that insist on getting their title in the conversation always pale in comparison to that one professor from my undergraduate days.",
