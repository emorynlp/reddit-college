  "text": "There is a recent post: [\"New Trend? Students Refusal to Use Titles\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/q8021l/new_trend_students_refusal_to_use_titles/) on /r/professors.\n\nIt seems that quite a few people in that thread view titles are very important and want students to address them using their title. At all the institutions I've been at, this was not at all the case, so I was curious on the perspective of folks here regarding the use of titles. I'm interested in the concept in general, not just between grad students and faculty.",

      "text": "IMO, you call people what they prefer to be called, period. It's not up to someone else to dictate what another person should be called, regardless of what their reasoning is. I think it's a bit narcissistic, to be honest. If a person has more of an egalitarian mindset, or whatever their reasoning is, that's fine but you don't get to impose that on other people without their consent. If a student wants to call their professor \"Dave\" in front of their friends or whatever, nobody can stop them, but if Dr. David Smith wants to be called Dr. Smith, then that student should address all professional communications to him as Dr. Smith and he should be referred to as Dr. Smith in professional contexts, like the classroom and at the university. Whether students like it or not, their faculty are not their peers or equals and maintaining a professional distance is always appropriate. Being too informal and too familiar in contexts with power differentials can be problematic. \n\nIt's also weird to me why this seems to be okay in academia but not, for example, a doctor's office, courtroom, or industry. I bet these people will say \"Your Honor\" if they have to appear before a judge rather than call them \"Clarence\", or refer to their boss as \"Mr\" or \"Ms\" if that is the norm of the office. If a professor introduces themselves as Dr. Smith, then you call them Dr. Smith because they are establishing what is considered normative in that context. \n\nIf a student wants to get a PhD and have their future students call them by their first name, that is their choice, but they can't make that choice for other people. I personally have mixed feelings about whether I will use my title or not, because although I am white and male, I am also gay and LGBT people are often not treated as authority figures in the same way heterosexual men are. Women and racial minorities are similarly disregarded as authorities, so if using their title means they are treated with the respect and authority that their expertise has earned them, then that should be respected.",

In class, all of my students address me as Mr. or Professor, and on papers and emails a lot of students have a tendency to put my name down as Professor or Instructor or Mr. NaturaSiveDeus, with some just not putting a heading at all. I've never really had an issue of students just, I don't know, calling me by my first name or anything.\n\nAs for how I personally view titles, I'm pretty neutral. Like with pronouns, I'll call someone by whatever it is they prefer. We all work hard for our qualifications, and I see no problem with wanting that hard work to be represented by an official title. That being said, if I ever were to get my PhD, I don't think I'd insist on my students, or anyone really, calling me \"doctor\" or even \"professor.\" I don't want to be on a first-name basis, simply because I've found that too much familiarity negatively impacts the classroom, but so long as I'm being addressed respectfully the actual title is irrelevant to me.",

No titles. I don\u2019t think I called any of my lecturers or advisors by their title. \n\nI had a call a few months ago (granted, this was in a work capacity rather than student-faculty setting) with a few academics based here and they were literally ridiculing the idea of being called \u201cdoctor\u201d or \u201cprofessor\u201d constantly.\n\nIn the US, I believe academics get more worked up about it though. I had another interesting chat, this time with an American professor, who told me to call him by his first name but if I became his student in the future, he\u2019d expect the formality of title-surname. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI can\u2019t speak for the rest of the world though. \ud83d\ude2c",

Also any time I refer to them to other people I usually use the honorific. So if I'm talking to Dr.A about Dr.B I would say \"I was talking to Dr.B the other day...\"",

      "text": "My undergrad most professors were adjuncts and only held Masters degrees. They and the few with PhDs still were on a first name basis. But there was one professor who *insisted* on being called Dr. Name. Because it stood out as so strange and stuffy most people metaphorically rolled their eyes at it but acquiesced.\n\nNow, though, I get it. Anyone who works hard to be a doctor should be called a doctor if they wish. Additionally, I know many fellow women in STEM will have students who insist on calling them Mrs./Miss. even after corrected and at that point I'd just feel disrespected. And so I'm inclined to use \"Doctor\" when the time comes.\n\nThat said, I also am in a profession with a lot of patient-interaction where if people are calling you 'doctor' it could lead to a misunderstanding about your expertise even if it's completely accurate to be called doctor. I know some others who are PhDs working in healthcare don't use doctor to avoid being confused with an MD.\n\nAt the end of the day I approach it the same way I do as someone's preferred name or pronouns: It costs me nothing to respect how others identify and want to be addressed, but it could mean a lot to them, so do it.",

      "text": "I used to not think it mattered very much -- just call people what they ask you to call them -- until it was explained to me by a female collegue that the use of titles by students is often a gendered issue. That is, students are more likely to address a female professor or instructor with a doctorate as \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\", compared to male instructors with the same qualifications. This relates to the difficulty that is sometimes experienced by female (and gender non-conforming) faculty in being treated by students as authoritative.\n\nFaculty who don't present as masculine don't have the luxury of being relaxed about the use of their title, so if faculty who do *are* relaxed about it, it ends up compounding the difficulty. Faculty who want to be called \"Doctor\" end up looking stuffy by comparison. For this reason I think it's an important exercise in allyship for male-presenting faculty to insist on being called \"Doctor\" as well.\n\nNow to be clear, I'm referring to undergrads above. Generally (in the US) graduate students and anyone else working in a research lab will not refer to professors or postdocs of any gender by their title -- first names are standard.",
