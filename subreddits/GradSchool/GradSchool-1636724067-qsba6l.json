I feel like I\u2019m just awful in my research and I feel like I\u2019m seen poorly by my colleagues and profs. The stress I\u2019m putting on myself for not being \u201cperfect\u201d + impostor syndrome is really affecting me. Perfection doesn\u2019t exist, but I\u2019m making so many errors that I feel like I\u2019m not cut for grad school. \nDo you have any recommendations on how to improve my mental health? It\u2019s my first semester in grad school. I just need tips on how to relax my brain for it to actually function and think properly.",

I find that I have to stop working an hour or more before I go to bed. I read fiction for fun or watch fiction on TV (I don't watch her read things that get my brain working). To let my brain de-stress from work before I go to bed.\n\nThe other thing, which you might not be able to do anything about depending on your living situation, is that sleep experts find your bedroom should only be for sleeping. If you're working in there, then you're brain doesn't condition itself to only sleep in there.",
