  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m heading into my last semester of undergrad for a B.S. in Criminology and Criminal Justice and am strongly considering grad school.  I\u2019m leaning towards an MPA or an MS in Criminal Justice Administration (both at schools different from my bachelors).\n\nMy goals are to work in law enforcement in some capacity and the masters would maybe help make federal jobs easier to obtain or at the very least open the door to more promotions with a local city/county police department.  I would think a lot of the skills learned in either program would transfer pretty well to a number of jobs, but I don\u2019t want to be in a situation where I now have two degrees yet still feel like my opportunities are limited to a single line of work (in this case criminal justice).\n\nTL;DR \nShould I specialize for my masters, or since my undergrad is already somewhat specific would it be better to get a masters that will have broader applications.",
