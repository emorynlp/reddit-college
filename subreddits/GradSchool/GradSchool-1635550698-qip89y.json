I usually just say I have no idea and this has been affecting my confidence level. I need to learn how to be able treat every situation like a stress-free situation where I can converse normally.",

It's definitely a confidence thing and you get used to it over time I guess. I have to prepare myself mentally before speaking and always feel like an idiot after lol but I guess I'm good at pretending.",

          "text": "What I usually do before class is go over what I'm interested in and what I want to say so I can at least have something semi rehearsed in my head. If anyone asks me something on the spot though... I word vomit a bit and sometimes it doesn't feel like it makes sense but again it's gotten me this far so I don't know. Not sure if this helpful in anyway but I mean I can relate and hope you realize that a lot of us struggle with the same issues, just in different ways.",
