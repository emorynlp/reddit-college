  "text": "Hi guys\n\nA little bit of background: I'm a software engineer with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and computing, with a work experience of about a year (still working). I plan on going for a PhD and have a few questions.\n\n1. What are the requirements/unsaid things I should be doing to get an admit from top US universities?\n2. What's the general procedure for applying? Do I contact a professor about working with them or is the process straightforward?\n3. How relevant is the GRE? I've heard it's not important but should I even bother giving it if I have my mind set on a PhD?\n4. Should I focus on obtaining some prior research experience? I've done some research work in my undergrad, but it was in a different area.\n5. Since my profile currently mostly has development based projects and is pretty much corporate tailored, how will that affect my application?\n6. I'll be pursuing research in AI and computer vision. Which universities/programs should I be looking at?\n\nI know this is a lot to ask, but I'm utterly confused and there's just a lot of information available online, so just want to streamline my search.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Hello, the best way to get into a graduate program is to contact potential research advisors or PIs from the program you're interested in. Most schools will not accept you without an advisor in mind. You should get involved in research because it will make your application way more competitive. You should start to contact PIs about a year before you intend to begin your program. Additionally you need to stay in contact with these advisors throughout the application process.\n\nThe GRE is starting to become irrelevant, but if you feel like your qualifications are on the fence, a strong GRE score can help subsidize some of the lack of research experience. \nHope this helps!",
