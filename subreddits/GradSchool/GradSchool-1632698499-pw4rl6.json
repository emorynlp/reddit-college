So instead, I majored in applied math so I could replaced those courses with a few extra math courses that I was more interested in. \n\nBy the time I finish my undergrad, I'll have taken all the classic physics courses, Classical Mechanics 1&2, E&M 1&2, Quantum 1&2, Thermodynamics. \n\nI actually kinda think of myself as a physics major because I usually end up taking a few physics related classes and just one math class a semester, but at the end of the day, when I graduate, I will have a BS in applied math, not physics. \n\nDo you think this will hurt my chances of being admitted to top schools for physics grad school.", "author": "function_of_time", "created": 1632698499, "retrieved": 1632843955, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heii8sv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw4rl6/applying_to_physics_grad_school_with_an_applied/heii8sv/", "text": "You can definitely get in.

Totally possible to get into a school with a different undergrad degree, especially since you already have all of the prerequisites. Your interviewers may ask you about your switch from math to physics, although maybe not. I did get asked, \"why biomedical sciences?\" during my interview, but again, I come from math so it's not the field change people would expect. I feel like a switch from applied math to physics is definitely more self-explanatory.
