We've since pulled a few others onboard with different specialties. \n\nThere are only two Neuro folks, but understanding how the normative brain is organized and how these different neural systems overlap and work together has meaningful implications for a lot of this stuff. For example, there's a lot of connectivity between systems that track social information and that regulate emotions, which explains why, at certain ages, making someone think about someone else they typically associate with doing the right thing is a really powerful motivator to get them to behave in a more socially desirable way.",

      "text": "Radical environmentalist here who mentioned that part of her past in her applications. Successfully convinced admissions committees that I\u2019m only interested in studying evolutionary bio models and won\u2019t be going back to radical environmentalism (not so true, but they bought it). Am now in the best program in my research area. Only downside is that there are certain faculty members here who know a lot about my radical environmentalist past; have secret financial ties to oil/plastics/pesticides that they\u2019ve been trying to cover up for years; and keep trying to screw me over/convince me to drop out so that I don\u2019t out their shit lol. \n\n(Might delete later for obvious reasons)",
