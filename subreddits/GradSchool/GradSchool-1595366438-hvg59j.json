You are making the right decision for yourself, especially if the program is no longer fulfilling to you. It\u2019s best to quit now before you get yourself into deeper debt for a degree that may close more doors than open.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to drop out as well. I was just hired to work at a job I love and felt a PhD isn\u2019t for me and I don\u2019t need it after all.  Getting a PhD doesn\u2019t guaranteed you will find work (or even get a high-paying job), I can\u2019t take doing this for the next 5 years, and I did it for the wrong reasons. I don\u2019t enjoy academia and I felt alone and unsupported as compared to my job, I have a lot of support and I\u2019m getting paid well for my passion. The PhD is taking a toll on my social life and mental health. \n\nDid you quit before the semester started, during, or after? I\u2019m debating whether to quit now as I started the semester or wait until I finish this semester.", "author": "kcrawford85", "created": 1595506204, "upvotes": 1}, "fyx1q0w": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hvg59j/today_i_dropped_out/fyx1q0w/", "text": "So what's next?", "author": "LicksMackenzie", "created": 1595454609, "upvotes": 1}, "fyvzgpr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hvg59j/today_i_dropped_out/fyvzgpr/", "text": "I've been debating if this is something I want to do, but my biggest fear is letting my PI and other profs in my department down.
