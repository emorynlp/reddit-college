I have personally benefitted tremendously, beyond all my expectations, from peer networking. \n\nSpeaking a language that is not shared by everyone present creates a barrier to peer networking that may lead to missing out on opportunities, simply because the person with the relevant knowledge (of a fellowship or research opportunity) did not know that your interests aligned with the opportunity. If they have a friend in grad school who mentioned needing someone to assist with, let's just say research on Parkinson, and they overheard you chatting with a friend about your interest in Parkinson research, it would have jogged their memory to say, \"Hey, my friend is looking for someone to help with their Parkinson project, I can give them your email address if you're interested!\"\n\nThis happens with considerable frequency in my field.
