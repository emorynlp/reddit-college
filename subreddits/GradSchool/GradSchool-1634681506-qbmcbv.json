  "title:": "No Response From Prof - 1 month, 3 follow ups, zero replies",
  "text": "Title - I reached out to a prof to ask if they were accepting students for F22. No reply, waited one week, FUd. Waited 3 more weeks, then followed up again. It's been a month without a reply. At this point should i just accept that they aren't accepting students and should focus my energy elsewhere? This is my top choice and have even offered to visit in person (my SO lives there so it is not inconvenient/far drive for me to come). Im really sad if i would have to cross them off my list  but a month of no reply, regardless of how busy you are, is a little ridiculous in my opinion.",

If it\u2019s a rotation based program and this is just someone you\u2019re interested in working with, I would still apply, in that case a lot of professors won\u2019t even talk to students before they\u2019re accepted. Regardless, I wouldn\u2019t send any more emails",

There should be many more things that factor into a decision than that",
