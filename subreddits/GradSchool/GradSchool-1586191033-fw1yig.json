Even my advisors (I'm co-advised) admit to having a hard time working from home, and they have missed scheduled deadlines for sharing edits of a proposal draft we are working on together right now. I know that when our work-from-home schedule began, I had a hard time staying focused and, even more so, motivated. However, I have come round to settling on a schedule and a set of expectations for myself that are reasonable for how I am coping with the situation and the environment I have to work in for myself at home. More importantly, I have placed equal emphasis on staying graduate-school productive as mentally, physically, and creatively productive, which has helped me a lot.\n\nI've jotted down some recommendations that have helped me stay \"productive,\" and I really hope they are useful for anyone also struggling to get things done.\n\n1.) Be kind to yourself. Understand that this is an unprecedented and terribly difficult time in your life and your mental health is your priority. You need to take care of yourself first, whatever that means for you, and any loved ones before you can start progressing elsewhere.\n\n2.) Schedule yourself appropriately. When I started working from home, I was scheduling the workday as if it was a 12-hour day. When you're running around between lab, classes, and meetings, with breaks and walks in between, maybe that was okay, but to do those hours working from home is impossible. I've broken my days up into 3 working sections from 9a-12p, 2p-5p and then 8p-10p approximately. This has been much more manageable and reasonable for me. Otherwise, I'd be staring at a computer screen for 12 hours straight and that is miserable.\n\n3.) Lower your expectations for what you can get done each day or week, and break tasks up to suit your level of focus. For instance, if you have a task for yourself that will take 3 hours to finish, such as an analysis or some papers you want to read, but from your experience, you can only stay focused for, say 1.5 hours, then break up the task into smaller tasks so that you're only working on it for maximum 1.5 hours at a time. You'll get it done by the end of the day this way, feeling a level of achievement, and you won't feel the pressure to cram it in all at once.\n\n4.) As others have mentioned many times, you should not work in your bed! it is important to share or divvy up a workspace with other house mates, no matter who they are, so that you can have a space for work ONLY. This is critical!\n\n5.) Perforate the day with walks, exercise, or any excuse to get outside. I always make a point to enjoy my first sips of coffee in the morning from the comfort of my front porch. I always got for a walk from 1p-2p, and then I go for a run and do an at-home workout from 5p-7p. You obviously don't have to do this exactly, but it's just important to keep the blood flowing and the joints moving.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps some folks out there.\n\nAlso, if anyone is looking to chat about coping with both graduate school and this crisis, don't hesitate to DM me and we can talk about it (as long as you're not actively procrastinating your work!)\n\nGood luck!", "author": "etvnhoteiedr", "created": 1586221487, "upvotes": 5}, "fmn9ivb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fw1yig/is_anybody_else_having_a_hard_time_working_from/fmn9ivb/", "text": "Yep!
