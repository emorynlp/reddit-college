I decided very early on that I didn't want to be a career scientist, and that nothing about this degree seemed like it was worth the time. \n\nThen, the pandemic hits. Productivity hits an all-time low, and I genuinely stop caring about my project, causing my PI to stress to no end. I thought to myself, \"OK. When the lockdowns end, I'll go back to the city and try one more time to see if I can get back into lab work. Then I'll make a decision.\" And guess what? I hate it even more now. I just can't see the point in this. So I'm going to quit. Have a couple interviews lined up back home. \n\nSo where am I going from here? Well, medical school is something I've always been passionate about pursuing, but something that also initially scared me off when I finished my undergrad - which is what caused me to go into grad school. Now that I have 100% confirmed what I want my path to be, and I know what it will take to get there, I feel confident about leaving this program and pursuing what I really want. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, rant over.
