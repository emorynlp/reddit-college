  "title:": "My class is revolting against our professor and I don't think it's merited",
  "text": "I'm a third year grad student and this semester I'm in a class with both graduate and undergrad students. The semester admittedly started off rocky as our young adjunct professor struggled with personal issues, a demanding full-time job, and his teaching position. He eventually put in his notice at his full time job and, I think, has turned the class around fairly well and I think I've learned a decent amount over the course of the semester so far. I know that a lot of people (grad students included) happily skip class and just weren't taking notes because they just expected the power points to be shared with us without reason. \n\nOur class has frequently derailed lecture to discuss formatting and logistics of quizzes and our one exam, time that could have been spend reviewing or lecturing more. The last occasion was appalling to watch, as first to third graduate students bemoaned a lack of study guides, wanted to know what to study for the exam, and did so during class time he had set aside to review. Not horrendously out of line, but they spent 45 minutes arguing and flat out lying about what our other professors provide, even though he can really format the class as he thinks is appropriate. Eventually he rolled over and let us use notes and take the exam either in person or remotely, but made the exam harder because we had access to notes, as you would expect. \n\nWhat seems like a small minority of us were horrified at the conduct of our fellow students, but remained mostly quiet, and speaking with the professor afterwards he agreed that was what was best for us to do. However, we're still in the group chat that has turned absolutely toxic. He addressed the 45 minute derailing with us during our last class, and admittedly maybe didn't say things that I would have, but setting a boundary obviously got the students even more riled up. They all emailed our program director to complain, who has apparently acknowledged their emails and is investigating. The chat is now acting as if our professor is absolutely going to get fired and what about their grades if he gets fired?\n\nI'm pretty disappointed in my graduate classmates' behavior. My retired professor and dean mother has agreed with me, but has also advised me to let it play out, as this is not unheard of for newer professors who make the mistake of trying to endear themselves to the class. However, reading the group chat and seeing it unfold in real time is making it really hard not to say something. I need to protect myself but I also don't want to do nothing. Has anyone had a situation like this? Any advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;drSuper nice but disorganized newer professor has shown weakness and now our class has jumped on him and is essentially trying to get him fired.",

Your class is turning this professor into the type of professor they would hate - a professor who would not give an inch, who would not round a grade up, and who would not be a fun professor to have. You may want to talk to the Chair and say that not everyone supports those student's opinions.\nMany of the students you mention are acting like undergraduates (I know you mentioned being in a mixed class, but expectations for grads should be different and they should know better). I've had new professors who make mistakes, but we never behaved this way. All new teachers will struggle, but arguing about their pedagogy won't make your grade better or your research stronger.",

My first year (high school) was awful, mostly because of the parents and the curriculum. I learned babysitting wasn't for me, but I couldn't teach lessons in a fun way (maybe the way your professor wants to teach too), I had to teach out of the book and from pre- designed PowerPoints. So now I'm in grad school for Astronomy & Planetary Science...",

      "text": "Your mum's advice seems solid, as in the \"trust the process and do what you have to do to graduate\" kind of way. There are (or should be) structures for this in the uni. If you feel strongly, you might think about talking to your dept head, and let them know what has been going on from your perspective. It doesn't mean that they will act on any of the information you give, but it might be valuable context for them to hear. If you do get involved, you may have to provide screenshots of the chat and other stuff, depending on how far much of this has gone. \n\nNot sure if you should worry about your cohort members/classmates. On one hand, they shouldn't begrudge your speaking your mind, and they shouldn't find out. On the other hand, they seem capable of doing that, and intercohort conflict can be damaging to your path through the degree (i.e. making your life socially difficult).\n\nIf you don't like any of those options, you could just talk to the prof and let them know that you like the class and that this all seems like bs. Its informal but might be a good morale boost for them.",

It is usually no more than 3 people (if that many) who are responsible for such unnecesary drama and the rest just follows their lead. You should identify them. Don't say anything to them (they will dismiss you or worse, try to exclude you from the group) but do it so that you will be able to assess the real situation. Then you can tell the university authorities that you don't feel this is an entire class complaint (but don't mention any names, you'll be asked for proof). It is not fair to take advantage of the teacher's situation in order to pass a course without studying.",

If the group chats are legit toxic, I'd screen shot and forward some of those along, and would maybe talk to some of the other students about going to the program director or submitting a formal letter with your side. If the \"investigation\" only hears from the lazy students who complain, then they would not be making a decision with a comprehensive view of the situation. Maybe the screen shot would be a bit much--it really depends what kind of things they are saying. If it's just people bitching, I wouldn't bother, but if it amounts to bullying and harassment, I think it might be worth documenting. \n\nI agree with others who critiqued your professor for, perhaps, not setting clear boundaries and expectations from the beginning, but I do not think that is an excuse to bully someone out of a job (potentially).",

Once, we had to spend an entire (3 hour) weekly session on student complaints that were sent in beforehand in which the professor would respond to the criticism and get feedback. But at least half of the semesters total classes were derailed by students upset with the workload or his teaching style. \n\nI had mixed opinions on it all. I definitely could see validity in the students complaints, I had some myself, but i didn\u2019t think it was justified for the majority of the class to start turning on the professor for it. It got to the point where students would openly suggest that other students should do other stuff during lectures and making passive aggressive insulting remarks to the professor in front of the entire class. I found it all incredibly unprofessional. Some students went as far as to make veiled threats via anonymous feedback reports, saying that they wanted to trash the professor to the department dean and so forth unless he changed what he was doing. It was obscene. \n\nPersonally I just kept my head down and gave him a could review at the end of the semester. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with any of that.",
