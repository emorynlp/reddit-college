  "title:": "My class is revolting against our professor and I don't think it's merited",
  "text": "I'm a third year grad student and this semester I'm in a class with both graduate and undergrad students. The semester admittedly started off rocky as our young adjunct professor struggled with personal issues, a demanding full-time job, and his teaching position. He eventually put in his notice at his full time job and, I think, has turned the class around fairly well and I think I've learned a decent amount over the course of the semester so far. I know that a lot of people (grad students included) happily skip class and just weren't taking notes because they just expected the power points to be shared with us without reason. \n\nOur class has frequently derailed lecture to discuss formatting and logistics of quizzes and our one exam, time that could have been spend reviewing or lecturing more. The last occasion was appalling to watch, as first to third graduate students bemoaned a lack of study guides, wanted to know what to study for the exam, and did so during class time he had set aside to review. Not horrendously out of line, but they spent 45 minutes arguing and flat out lying about what our other professors provide, even though he can really format the class as he thinks is appropriate. Eventually he rolled over and let us use notes and take the exam either in person or remotely, but made the exam harder because we had access to notes, as you would expect. \n\nWhat seems like a small minority of us were horrified at the conduct of our fellow students, but remained mostly quiet, and speaking with the professor afterwards he agreed that was what was best for us to do. However, we're still in the group chat that has turned absolutely toxic. He addressed the 45 minute derailing with us during our last class, and admittedly maybe didn't say things that I would have, but setting a boundary obviously got the students even more riled up. They all emailed our program director to complain, who has apparently acknowledged their emails and is investigating. The chat is now acting as if our professor is absolutely going to get fired and what about their grades if he gets fired?\n\nI'm pretty disappointed in my graduate classmates' behavior. My retired professor and dean mother has agreed with me, but has also advised me to let it play out, as this is not unheard of for newer professors who make the mistake of trying to endear themselves to the class. However, reading the group chat and seeing it unfold in real time is making it really hard not to say something. I need to protect myself but I also don't want to do nothing. Has anyone had a situation like this? Any advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;drSuper nice but disorganized newer professor has shown weakness and now our class has jumped on him and is essentially trying to get him fired.",

Your class is turning this professor into the type of professor they would hate - a professor who would not give an inch, who would not round a grade up, and who would not be a fun professor to have. You may want to talk to the Chair and say that not everyone supports those student's opinions.\nMany of the students you mention are acting like undergraduates (I know you mentioned being in a mixed class, but expectations for grads should be different and they should know better). I've had new professors who make mistakes, but we never behaved this way. All new teachers will struggle, but arguing about their pedagogy won't make your grade better or your research stronger.",

If you feel strongly, you might think about talking to your dept head, and let them know what has been going on from your perspective. It doesn't mean that they will act on any of the information you give, but it might be valuable context for them to hear. If you do get involved, you may have to provide screenshots of the chat and other stuff, depending on how far much of this has gone. \n\nNot sure if you should worry about your cohort members/classmates. On one hand, they shouldn't begrudge your speaking your mind, and they shouldn't find out. On the other hand, they seem capable of doing that, and intercohort conflict can be damaging to your path through the degree (i.e. making your life socially difficult).\n\nIf you don't like any of those options, you could just talk to the prof and let them know that you like the class and that this all seems like bs. Its informal but might be a good morale boost for them.",

If the \"investigation\" only hears from the lazy students who complain, then they would not be making a decision with a comprehensive view of the situation. Maybe the screen shot would be a bit much--it really depends what kind of things they are saying. If it's just people bitching, I wouldn't bother, but if it amounts to bullying and harassment, I think it might be worth documenting. \n\nI agree with others who critiqued your professor for, perhaps, not setting clear boundaries and expectations from the beginning, but I do not think that is an excuse to bully someone out of a job (potentially).",

Once, we had to spend an entire (3 hour) weekly session on student complaints that were sent in beforehand in which the professor would respond to the criticism and get feedback. But at least half of the semesters total classes were derailed by students upset with the workload or his teaching style. \n\nI had mixed opinions on it all. I definitely could see validity in the students complaints, I had some myself, but i didn\u2019t think it was justified for the majority of the class to start turning on the professor for it. It got to the point where students would openly suggest that other students should do other stuff during lectures and making passive aggressive insulting remarks to the professor in front of the entire class. I found it all incredibly unprofessional. Some students went as far as to make veiled threats via anonymous feedback reports, saying that they wanted to trash the professor to the department dean and so forth unless he changed what he was doing. It was obscene. \n\nPersonally I just kept my head down and gave him a could review at the end of the semester. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with any of that.",

Also it has to be said, the lecture course I'm thinking of was one of the hardest courses we had, and it did not consist of content you could easily self learn.\n\nI'm advocating this in hindsight. At the time I hated that I didn't have access to the lecture notes online. But after the fact I (and basically everyone I spoke to) acknowledged that we almost certainly would have failed the course had we not attended in person. \n\nI absolutely don't think my lecturer was trying to gate keep anything.

At some point you have to grow up and take both initiative and ownership of your education. Not a single one of my graduate class professors kept class material from being uploaded- lectures included since they were remote and being recorded anyway. They don\u2019t hold your hand and force you to come, they expect you to do what you know you need to do to be successful in a class. Undergraduate courses (with maybe the exception of first year/freshman courses) should be the same way.\n\nOf course I\u2019m no education expert, this is simply my opinion that I\u2019ve created based off my personal experiences and observations, and thus yours are also valid.

      "text": "This happened my senior year of undergrad to one of my favorite profs who was generally well-respected and had been at the uni for decades. This was a small liberal arts college so class sizes were small and the department only had a few professors \u2014 everyone knew each other. Sure, the prof could be disorganized at times, but no more than any other prof I\u2019ve had. It was an upper level course so by this point, we\u2019d all had this prof for multiple other courses and knew the expectations. If you put in the work, it was easy to succeed. \n\nSome of my fellow classmates (led by one particularly disgruntled student who iirc was unhappy with an exam grade) started a similar campaign of aggressively arguing over logistics, complaining about grade turnaround time, etc. I was horrified but like you, didn\u2019t feel it would be appropriate to make a stand in class. Towards the end of the class, I overheard the students talking about how they were going to tank the course evaluations. I typically don\u2019t like to stick my nose in drama or \u201csnitch\u201d but in this case I really felt this prof was being unfairly crucified and was worried about the potential consequences they might face if the students went through with their plan. So in my course evaluation, I filled out the evaluation as I normally would have and then at the end wrote out something to the effect of, \u201cthere is a group of students in this class who have been planning on tanking this professor and this course\u2019s reviews, I do not agree with them and would like it to be known that I, [insert name since reviews are typically anon], believe Professor X to be a good and fair professor and do not condone the behavior of my classmates or share their opinions.\u201d \n\nAt a farewell lunch I had with another prof (the department chair) before moving off to grad school, I learned that the ring leader had gone so far as to file a formal complaint with the dean, which meant they had to launch a full on investigation into the prof. However, apparently the comments I left in my evaluation helped them realize it was really just one obnoxious student with a personal vendetta against the professor. \n\nSorry for the big long story, but my main advice to you would be to keep playing it cool in class, but go to your department chair and tell them what is going on. The professor in my story was tenured faculty who had been working in the department for longer than most of us had been alive \u2014 the school took the students\u2019 complaint seriously, but the prof probably would not have faced dire consequences even if the admin had sided with the drama queens. A new adjunct does not have that privilege. Let them know that you have their back and that you think they\u2019re doing a great job.",

      "text": "I have experienced a similar story. In my current program we had a course in some biology related topic because I'm studying biology. Usually one would not think that there will be math involved. Part of the teaching persons was a professor who was quite new and his research topic was about mathematical simulations of biologic processes related to this type of course. So one-third was about mathematical models and and involved a lot of maths. He did a quite nice job and tryed to explain everything to us very clearly and you could see that he put a lot of effort in his work. But some people of our course where are afraid of math which made them to quit the course and not doing the exam. At the end it was around 50% of my classmates. This was right before the exam so almost two-thirds of the course were already over and then there was the math part. I was not sure whether it does cause problems for this young professor but in the last few lessons it seems like he got problems because so many people dropped out because of his teaching.\nI felt so sad for him because he really did a very good job and he took a lot of effort in and he tried to really make very complicated math easy to understand. I also did not get a good great on the exam because of the math part but it it was solely my fault and not the one of the prof because I'm just bad and that. So I would never think about blaming him for my bad math grade or potential bad math grade.",
