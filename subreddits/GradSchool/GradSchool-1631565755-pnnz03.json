I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the sciences and I've been thinking of taking a leave of absence for quite a long time and think the time has come to start it and I'm so scared to pull the trigger. \n\nI've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life, but it's gotten particularly bad since starting grad school. I moved across the country from my entire family, covid happened, I had a bad committee meeting that led to me having to delay my advancement to candidacy, etc., that has all led to me being extremely unhappy the past year. It's extremely difficult to get up in the mornings usually and get myself to lab. I try working from home but have trouble focusing. Some days I can do it, but I can't get into a consistent groove, but even on my productive days I would say I'm still unproductive compared to many people. All to say, the state of my mental health is having a huge impact on my work and I feel so bad for being so unproductive. I feel like I need to take some time away to get ahold of my mental health and get myself to a stable state so that I can return on a better note and advance to candidacy and get through the 2nd half of my PhD. \n\nFor the past year I've been going to therapy and recently started antidepressants, which have both helped, but really are not going to solve the problem. Because of that, I want to take a leave for the 2nd half of this fall semester (I would take the leave the whole semester but due to dumb policies I would lose my access to mental health treatment if I did that, which seems counterproductive, so I'm only going to take half of a semester as a compromise). I'm ready to take the leave starting in the next few weeks, but I'm so scared of disappointing my advisor and I have trouble feeling validated enough to take a leave. I think she realizes that I haven't been doing well, but I think it'll likely come as a surprise to her that I want to take a leave and I don't want her to think less of me if I take a leave. I'm a normal person and I care about my work and I want to finish my PhD, but I just need a long break. I'm also worried that my advisor and department will be upset that I'll be wasting some of my fellowship from tuition that went unused. I'm also worried that I'm not \"sick\" enough to take a leave. I've been unhappy for a long time, but I think I look fine to most people, and I'm not suicidal or anything, I'm just at the point where I don't want to do this anymore right now and I feel like this is what I need. I also think it's important that I don't let myself get to the point of extreme breakdown to allow myself to take a break. I need time to just relax and most importantly I feel like I need to spend some extended time with my family to make up for time lost during covid, and I feel like taking a leave right now is the only way to do that and if I don't I'll continue being depressed because I miss them so much and I have absolutely no time in the next year when I would be able to take a long extended break to see them again. \n\nAlso for context, I suffer from severe burnout and I have tried just taking a month off before earlier this summer and it didn't really help the problem much, so that's why I think I need a legitimate leave of absence for several months rather than taking a month off. Also note that I'm done with my coursework and my qualifying exam, so I don't have any deadlines or specific things I need to get done this fall. I do need to advance to candidacy by next fall through having a committee meeting where they approve of my candidacy, but that can happen next spring and theoretically should not be too much work that I haven't already done, so I'm not going to be pushing things off or missing anything by missing most of this fall. \n\nClearly, one of the reasons I'm struggling with commiting to taking a leave and accepting that it's okay to take a leave is because I'm worried about what others will think of me, which is one of my main sources of anxiety in general. So, I'm just wondering if anyone else that's taken a leave has any advice on how to talk to your advisor about it, how to advocate for yourself, and how to overall accept to yourself that it's okay to take time off? Thank you so much for any words of advice. <3", "author": "welovetomatoesyum", "created": 1631565755, "retrieved": 1632844580, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcsknb6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnnz03/needing_moral_support_for_mental_health_leave_of/hcsknb6/", "text": "Maybe grad school or your field of study isn\u2019t for you.", "author": "Festiveee", "created": 1631603194, "upvotes": -1}, "hcrimtu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnnz03/needing_moral_support_for_mental_health_leave_of/hcrimtu/", "text": "Sorry about the challenges you are facing. \n\nAs a DGS, I encourage you not to think about starting a leave as \"pulling the trigger.\" The decision is best made in a deliberate process. Talk with both your advisor and DGS, ideally in person, about the challenges. They can help put them in context and may well have other things to try. \n\nIf a leave is the best answer, those conversations and other activities will demonstrate it over some time.

Mental health concerns and burnout are stressful, particularly during graduate school. One way or another you will get through this though.\n\nThat said, I'm a 4th year PhD candidate, and I'm taking this semester off as a leave of absence. I can hopefully provide some perspective. \n\nFor me, the decision was difficult and leaden with emotion, but the decision was really clear. I was so burnt out, depressed, and anxious that I was failing to meet deadlines, producing poor quality deliverables, and burning bridges with faculty and colleagues I couldn't afford to. I was able to pause my scholarship for the semester, and also pause graduation requirements by a semester, which was also great.\n\nIt sounds like you have a good understanding of the pragmatics related to taking a leave of absence. I don't know your institution, but I would encourage you to balance any concerns on a leave of absence looking bad with the consequences of continuing to work while deteriorating and/or not being at your best. \n\nOne last piece of advice: If you do take a leave of absence, I'd strongly recommend not just seeing friends/family, but also working on developing resources to help you manage the stress when you undoubtly go back. For me, that involves lots of counselling, learning and applying CBT and DBT principles, and working on some of the maladaptive behaviours that contributed to my anxiety and depression in the first place.\n\nHope this helps.
