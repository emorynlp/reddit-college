My current arrangement is using a combination of a large desk calendar at work and Microsoft Teams and I'm finding this is working very well for me. I use my desk calendar to mark out experiments, genetic crosses, or other tasks that need to occur on specific days. With Microsoft Teams, I split up my projects into different \"teams\" and use Tasks by Planner to keep tabs of all the things I need to do for each project. It lets me make comments on the individual tasks, mark their priority, and make sub check lists if needed. I've found this approach has helped me keep track/remember all the things I need to do without feeling like I have to constantly write it down (I would just loose track of things in a planner). I also really like that I can mark tasks as \"in progress\". The last main thing I like is that when you set due/start dates for task, you will get email reminders about those tasks, this helps me keep things at the front of my mind and plan out when I want to collect different data sets.", "author": "wormy_nerd", "created": 1620050129, "upvotes": 1}, "gwruwx3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n30ddm/grad_students_what_are_your_favorite_productivity/gwruwx3/", "text": "Thank you so much for linking [Monday.com](https://Monday.com)!!!

GoodSync for keeping everything redundantly backed up across my laptop, NAS, Google Drive, Dropbox, and IDrive.\n7. Pomodoro method for time management.\n8. Strategr for making routines and seeing where I am in my day at a glance.\n9. Post-it notes for miscellaneous uses. I have a bunch above my desk that I move from left to right as I complete pomos so that I can visualize my day's accomplishments even when they aren't obvious. I also use regular post-it notes to do affinity diagrams when determining what matters in my topics and how to group seemingly unconnected ideas.\n10. A pocket-sized notebook and affordable fountain pen to jot down ideas anywhere, and also to force myself to be succinct and selective when taking notes while listening to people. (The fountain pen just makes it all a little more \"zen\" for me, but obviously any pen will do.)\n11. A wall calendar to keep myself motivated. Whenever I accomplish anything \u2013 even if it's just a small thing, like a single pomo or a short walk \u2013 I give the day a \"victory mark.\"\n12. A small number of paint markers to color code the \"victory marks.\" Yellow is for anything related to work, blue is for anything related to exercise, etc. (Again, I use a special type of pen because it makes it a more calming and satisfying ritual for me, but any kind of markers would do.)\n13. Highlighters with transparent tips.\n14. A small tea kettle, a cast iron tea warmer, and a ton of tea candles for the warmer. This lets me make a little ritual out of making tea when I start working, and keeps the tea within reach so that I don't have to get up (and interrupt my flow) when I finish a cup.\n15. A small diffuser and scented oils. Once again, this is partly for my time-to-start-working ritual.\n16. A few small plants. These just make my room feel more alive and inviting, which is good for mood, which is good for productivity.\n17. A big insulated tumbler so that I always have ready access to cool water. I used to also have a little light that would blink if I haven't had a drink in a while to remind me to stay hydrated, but it broke when I forgot to remove it.\n18. A countertop dishwasher. Out of everything I've purchased, this has made the biggest difference for my depression. I'm sure that it's also the weirdest thing to add to a list of tools for grad students, but one of the most important lessons I've learned is the connection between depression and productivity.\n19. A second monitor. A lot of tasks are vastly easier when I can have apps open side by side (and still have them big enough to use comfortably).\n20. Mini Metro. It's a very minimalist game that I find calming, and it's engaging just long enough to be a good break but doesn't keep me hooked indefinitely.\n21. Headspace (the website/app) for guided meditation. Great for days when I feel anxious, restless, or \"I don't know why but I really don't want to think about working.\"\n22. A mechanical keyboard \u2013 specifically, one that is \"tenkeyless\" so that the letters actually stay centered in front of me instead of having to reach slightly to the left. (\"Full-size\" keyboards include calculators on the right, which pushes the letters to the left. Whenever I try to position a full-size keyboard a bit to the right to compensate, it inevitably drifts back to the middle, which means I inevitably end up reaching a bit to the left in order to type.)", "author": "SquareBottle", "created": 1619999685, "upvotes": 6}, "gwpi2ed": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n30ddm/grad_students_what_are_your_favorite_productivity/gwpi2ed/", "text": "I use a damn whiteboard with a damn marker and a damn eraser", "author": "SilentFox12345", "created": 1619988347, "upvotes": -1}, "gwp8d9y": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n30ddm/grad_students_what_are_your_favorite_productivity/gwp8d9y/", "text": "I love Notion!

You won't be as productive as if you sleep at a humane hour and wake up well rested the next day. I get this wrong a lot and the result is at best two days of unproductivity or as opposed to one. The worst case is your sleep schedule is borked and the next few weeks may such esp. if you're under lockdown or WFH.\n\nAnother thing that I've discovered recently from a youtube video on a channel called Julia Ravey Science and totally worked for me is to start work right away in the morning, not even glancing at my mail or social. The days when I get up, brew coffee, have a little breakfast, and get on with reading are the most productive days. I turn on my pomodoro timer, and in some intervals I do check my mail and stuff, but I'm already in work mode and enjoying my readings, so it doesn't lead to whole day procrastination.\n\nLinked to that, I find pomodoro timers useful. I don't stick to it all the time, e.g. I tend to work / break +-10 min, maybe 5 on average, but having somethhing to anchor your work and break sessions, if that makes sense, and something that shows you that you've put in a decent amount of time at the end of the day. Because otherwise if I didn't/won't complete a book or a large paper that day, it feels like useless work. Having an end goal (e.g. do 8 pomodoros) and something to show for it (e.g. I did 8 pomodoros) is extremely useful in those times. I also like starting my pomodoro timer with a short break instead of a pomodoro, during which I set up my workspace and get into my \"working mode\", or \"flow\" or whatever. I wrote a little GUI pomodoro timer for myself in Python that does it like that, and I call that feature the \"ease-in mode\". Not a huge thing but I like it.\n\nOrganisation wise I like bullet journalling because I like having something physical for planning.  I've used a lot of software solutions with heavy customisation, but nothing works as good as a notebook for me. Guess it's a ritualistic thing and/or it being physical makes it all the more concrete for me. Also, techy stuff has a tendency to be distracting in and of themselves (maybe someone techier like me is more susceptible to that), so having a pyshical notebook helps with that too.\n\nLastly, spare weekends (or any 1-2 days of the week) for yourself. Whenever I skip them and try to work through multiple weeks, I fail on the 6th or 7th day at most, and in comes a long period of unproductivity and bad moods. IDK if it'll be the week for everyone, but I guess finding a unit of work between a day and a month, separated by decent amount of rest, is pretty useful.", "author": "gkayaalp", "created": 1619968496, "upvotes": 13}, "gwnzzfd": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n30ddm/grad_students_what_are_your_favorite_productivity/gwnzzfd/", "text": "physical exercise", "author": "anothertimelord", "created": 1619966351, "upvotes": 6}, "gwnx4cn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n30ddm/grad_students_what_are_your_favorite_productivity/gwnx4cn/", "text": "[Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/)!

Schedule time where you're not allowed to work. You need to be very, very wary of the diminishing returns of pushing yourself to stay late and finish x. The more you do it the less productive you become in general. For this reason a lot of this list is going to be about avoiding this.\n2. Plan your fucking experiments properly. Take time to figure out if your design actually makes sense and to give you good coverage of whatever relevant parameter spaces exist. Do not stay in lab late all the time just to generate more data for your advisor if that data didn't come from carefully thought out experiments and actually answers the question you think it's answering. A well designed experiment can take far less time to run and produce as much or more useful data.  \nI was especially guilty of this in my first couple years. I knew what I needed and just charged through trying to get it done ASAP and produced a lot of useless data from runs that didn't need to happen and I could've avoided if I had more thought about it more carefully. And refinements to the technique/apparatus I should have made right after the preliminary experiments and saved myself several iterations of 'final' data collection for the paper.  \n\n3. It's okay and even preferable to delay starting an experiment one or even a few days to make it so you don't have to work crazy hours to make it happen.  \n\n4.  If you absolutely have to spend all night in lab taking time points, give yourself permission to goof off in between them. Don't feel like you have to be productive. If you're there collecting time points every hour from 6PM to 6AM just play video games or watch Netflix or whatever.  \n\n5.  Learn some basic Python scripting for GUI automation. Make a Twilio account (or comparable). Depending on your set up and how your instrumentation works (in my lab half of the equipment was home made or older than me and had hacked together computer interfaces), if you can write a script that hits the button to collect whatever time point you need just because your shitty labview interface made by a grad student 10 years ago or MSDOS-era control program doesn't allow for data collections longer than a certain period then automate that shit. Have the script use Twilio to text you if a new file isn't created when expected or something else goes wrong.  \nIf you can use a commercially available sensor attached to a raspberry pi to monitor chamber conditions and text you if they go outside certain parameters then do it! Seriously, I got so much more done and had better work life balance doing it once I figured out I could automate half of what I did and make my set up call for help if anything went wrong. Highly recommend [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter18/) as an introduction.  \n\n6.

And at the bottom corner, a small log-off box where I signed and append the time. \n\nThis gives me inner peace that all the the items for the next sheet are actionable and that the time I\u2019ll be spending after work hours are guilt free.", "author": "rnvnasara", "created": 1619947662, "upvotes": 17}, "gwn290k": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n30ddm/grad_students_what_are_your_favorite_productivity/gwn290k/", "text": "I prefer ClickUp", "author": "babesdoitbetter", "created": 1619947559, "upvotes": 2}, "gwmyyhx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n30ddm/grad_students_what_are_your_favorite_productivity/gwmyyhx/", "text": "This may not be what you mean by \u2018tools\u2019, but what I find the most helpful for me and my terrible ADHD is having a huge pin board above my desk, separated into three sections: things to do, currently doing, and done (Loosely based on the kanban or scrum boards I see floating around Pinterest). Rather than having a task list in a notebook or a notes app, this has been the most beneficial for me because it is constantly visible, and the physical act of grabbing a sticky note, writing down a task, and pinning it to the board feels more motivating. This is definitely dependent on your schedule and where you get the most work done; all of my courses were online this semester, so all my work was done at my desk. In undergrad (pre-pandemic), I used my iPad for schoolwork, so I used a planner template imported into Notability. Using the same app for all my notes/music meant I opened it very frequently, so I saw my planner often. \n\nI\u2019ve also used straight up sticker charts with great success, though I mostly use them for chores and things now rather than schoolwork.
