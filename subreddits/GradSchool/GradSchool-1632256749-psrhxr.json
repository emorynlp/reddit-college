I have considered taking a break just because I worry I will be unhappy living in the place where my grad school is located for the majority of my young adult life. Just wondering if this is an issue for anyone else.",

      "text": "When I was applying to and then deciding on programs I was repeatedly told to choose the program and the advisor, not the location, so that's what I did. I kinda regret it. I just started my masters in Oklahoma and I'm from a northern state and it's actually just really really different and I don't love it. The majority here is conservative and religious and I'm neither of those things so it's been weird feeling in the minority in that way for the first time in my life. I don't love the heat and it's basically just a big football town. I absolutely love the city my undergrad was in, my sister and two of my best friends also just moved there before I left which made leaving way more shitty too. I plan on trying to move back right after I graduate. I didn't realize how much I loved my old city until I left. There is some truth in that I'm somewhat more productive because there's not much to do but I don't think it's worth it. I'm just really really hoping I can stick it out for 4 semesters to just get out fast. Realistically it's not long so I think I can do it. I couldn't do a PhD though, I'd suffer too much haha.",

I tried really hard to get into graduate student housing on campus, but that is also really expensive for what my stipend was my first year. Luckily the city has a low crime rate and there aren't really any \"bad\" parts of town, its just that many of the old houses have been converted into rental unites decades ago and the landlords are either absentee or incredibly cheap. My current apartment, for example, I'm pretty sure was converted from a warehouse in the 1970's because the oven is older than I am and there's a heat lamp in the bathroom. My dad told me those things used to be common in the 70's. It's better than where I used to live, however. \n\nI wasn't expecting to live in luxury, of course, but I had a one bedroom apartment back home that had all the basic amenities, including the ability to \"rent\" a washer and dryer for a small monthly fee, and I was paying about what I pay for a studio apartment here with none of that. \n\nI had an honest talk with my adviser about post-degree plans and I made it clear that I won't apply for jobs in small towns. I'm gay, so location is very important to me and I don't want to live in an area where I don't feel safe or am more likely to be discriminated against. I would rather leave academia for industry than be in academia in a horrible place.",

Unfortunately, all of that looks like shit if you do not regularly maintain it, which they did not. \n\nBefore that, I toured a 3 bedroom apartment (was renting with a friend and his friend at the time) and these people had the gall to label a closet as a bedroom.

I studied abroad in Amsterdam for a semester, and that was one of the happiest semesters I had, so I've decided that moving to a city with a similar population in my state would make me happier. Until I graduate though, I'm stuck here and trying to make the best of it. When I apply for PhD programs next, I'm def basing it off of program and location (not applying at a school with less than 100,000 people).",
