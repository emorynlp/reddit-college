I am in the process of writing my dissertation. I suffer from extreme imposter syndrome and never realized it. \n\nMy graduate school career hasn't been pretty to say the least. My masters was the one of, if not THE, worst times of my life. I had a tumultuous relationship with my MSc supervisor which has mentally and emotionally scarred me. He was a vile man and I hope to never cross paths with him again. I was given no opportunity to collaborate on projects that other students were given, I was barred from publishing results, I was constantly ridiculed and insulted. It was awful and I finished and I thought I had moved on but apparently some things will follow me forever. \n\nMy PhD has been much better, I switched schools, project areas and am with a lovely supervisor. I don't want this post to make it seem like she never compliments my work, but the way I see it is as her student, she has some responsibility to keep coaxing me forward by telling me I do good work.  Unlike during my masters, my PhD supervisor encourages me to work on side projects and I have started one recently which sent me down a fun little rabbit hole that I never expected to like. It's complimentary to my dissertation but is pushing me outside of my own comfort zone and I honestly love the challenge. It's outside of my supervisors range of knowledge and skill so she introduced me to another researcher from a different faculty and I have been working with him on it for the last \\~4 months and the new quarantine life style has allowed us to drastically ramp up our productivity on it and we are currently preparing a manuscript for it! Something that originally timeline wise wasn't set to be due until the beginning of next year - I guess being self-isolated does have it perks...\n\nToday was the meeting when we discussed the next steps to take for writing up the manuscript. Normally the meetings consist of myself, my supervisor and the other researcher but my supervisor was unable to make it today so it was my first time just meeting with the researcher one-on-one. And in this meeting, for the first time in my graduate student life, someone who is not my incredibly supportive PhD supervisor sang my praises. \n\n\"I wish my graduate students were more like you. You follow instructions, you get more work done in a few days than my students complete in a term. You contribute ideas that I would never have even thought of myself and are driving the project further forward than I imagine we could have. I hope you seriously consider switching gears and staying in this field\" \n\nMy response: \\*awkward laughter \\* uh thanks but I really haven't done that much and really don't know that much about this field, I am below baseline levels of knowledge honestly but it's something I will consider I guess? \n\nI was gobsmacked. And I frankly still am. And I desperately searched for reasons why this incredibly intelligent researcher would say such things about me. Is it pity? Is it a cruel joke? Is it because I am a woman and this is some sick twist where he is complimenting my work ethic out of attraction to me? He must just be confused and mistaken, if only he knew the sort of student I was he wouldn't be singing my praises.\n\nIt makes me sad that these are my instinctual reactions. It makes me sad that because of a horrible man early on in my research career that I am now scarred. I hope this isn't permanent and that I can crawl out from the heavy shadow that is imposter syndrome and into the light to shine my brightest but I honestly don't know if I will. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: A senior researcher complimented me today - and because of severe imposter syndrome and my personal history, I am unable to accept it as truth.", "author": "pretty_hippo", "created": 1587787730, "retrieved": 1632845980, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 338, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"foldlsm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/g7n7do/today_i_was_complimented_and_i_realized_how_much/foldlsm/", "text": "Imposter syndrome is something I'm having to live with too, especially tough when my educational career is... unconventional (I just jumped at everything since primary school and only now that I'm doing an MA could I settle on something), but I've observed it decays quickly, especially when you are surrounded with more people who're interested in your field: as you discuss, you figure you know some things and that the standards you've been holding yourself to are a bit (or just way) too high.
