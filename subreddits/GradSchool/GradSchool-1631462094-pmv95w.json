  "text": "I'm in the beginning of my second year as a masters. I rarely meet with my advisor, let alone my committee, and I have no data yet for my research (it's primarily computer modeling so every time something needs to be tweaked in the model we kind of have to start from scratch again with data collection). My advisor hasnt mentioned anything about my thesis and I have no idea when or how I am supposed to start writing anything. We haven't even submitted my official proposal yet because no one on my committee has gotten around to reviewing it.\n\nAm I still on a fairly normal timeline or am I fucked? Should I wait to submit the proposal and get feedback and speak with my advisor about the thesis or should I just start figuring out how to write something in case my advisor forgets I exist and never prompts me to start? I believe this is the semester I am supposed to start writing ?",

That may prompt your advisor to talk to the committee about what the holdup is.\n\nIn the absence of proposal committee feedback, you can always further develop your literature review and/or your methodologies section. And that will have you at least much further along in writing the overall thesis while you wait for proposal approval.",

It's going to be your career that's affected and your advisor is obligated to advise and work with you so don't be afraid of constantly emailing or reminding them and push for actual meetings. \n\nIf this doesn't work, I'd try contacting your department's DGS or chair and asking them for help/knowledge on deadlines and whatever else you think you might need.\n\nAdditionally, I don't know the formatting of your thesis, but you could always start writing up part of the intro/background or methods and take that to your next meeting with them to push your advisor to start thinking about it.",

Ask around a lot, ask other people you meet at a conference, ask your supervisors, just keep on asking. There really isn't a set rule on how you should write though. Some do well writing towards the end because they like to read and then write slowly but some prefer to write as they are reading.\n\nSo, there are no rules about when you should write your chapters. You will learn a lot of things as you go. That's the thing about graduate school. You learn a lot from trial and errors, and slowly build your routine along the way.",
