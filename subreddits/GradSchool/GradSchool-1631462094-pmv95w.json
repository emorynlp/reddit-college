I rarely meet with my advisor, let alone my committee, and I have no data yet for my research (it's primarily computer modeling so every time something needs to be tweaked in the model we kind of have to start from scratch again with data collection). My advisor hasnt mentioned anything about my thesis and I have no idea when or how I am supposed to start writing anything. We haven't even submitted my official proposal yet because no one on my committee has gotten around to reviewing it.\n\nAm I still on a fairly normal timeline or am I fucked? Should I wait to submit the proposal and get feedback and speak with my advisor about the thesis or should I just start figuring out how to write something in case my advisor forgets I exist and never prompts me to start?

That may prompt your advisor to talk to the committee about what the holdup is.\n\nIn the absence of proposal committee feedback, you can always further develop your literature review and/or your methodologies section.
