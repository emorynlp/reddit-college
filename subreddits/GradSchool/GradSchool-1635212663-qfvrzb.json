  "text": "I work 20 hours as a public speaking TA (so can\u2019t offer virtual option) and there\u2019s not really a professor I work under, just an instructor of record. I was able to cancel in person office hours today and just answer emails (lost my voice). I have grades due back on Wednesday though and I slept most of today so I lost a lot of productive time.\n\nThe professors for my own classes are being very understanding about it, as some of them have little kids and understand what it\u2019s like to be out of it for a few days. I just don\u2019t know how I can handle my TA work when I have an upcoming deadline and am unable to do anything other than read emails and sleep right now.\n\nI\u2019m trying to take care of myself as best I can, but I\u2019m so tired. Pretty sure it\u2019s not the rona, just a cold or college student plague, so there\u2019s not a lot of support through the university. \n\nAny advice?",

      "text": "I also work as a GTA for public speaking. Where I go to school we have around 11 GTA\u2019s so if we can\u2019t make it we usually reach out and ask someone else to cover. I do this occasionally if I need a mental health day. I\u2019m going to tell you what my advisor told me on the first day, \u201cprioritise whatever pays your bills\u201d. For me this means to finish my teaching duties no matter the time or day and work on my own research between 9 and 5.\nHope this helps. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat",
