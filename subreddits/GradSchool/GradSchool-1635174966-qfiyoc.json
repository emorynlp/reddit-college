  "title:": "Should I tell my current professors that I\u2019m applying to transfer to another PhD program?",
  "text": "I am in the coursework phase of a humanities PhD. My partner is also in grad school\u2014different institution, different discipline, same city.\n\nMy partner\u2019s advisor took a job in another institution and offered to take my partner along. We would have to move, which I\u2019m honestly stoked about, because the programs she\u2019s transferring to is much better than her current one. I would be ABD by the time we move and have been told I can almost certainly find a remote option to fulfill my TAship. However, her move has made me realize that my own program isn\u2019t that great\u2014-the person I wanted to work with most left and I found out the other one has a terrible reputation as an advisor. Also, placement record is pretty bad. So I\u2019m applying to transfer to two stellar programs in the city my partner and I are moving to.\n\nI\u2019m getting a letter of rec from the prof who left my current institution and other prominent profs I worked with before coming here. My question is\u2026should I tell the current profs I\u2019m working with that I\u2019m applying elsewhere? My fear is that if I tell them and don\u2019t get in anywhere else, they\u2019ll doubt my loyalty and it will hurt me down the line. But if I don\u2019t tell them and *do* get into one of these better programs, I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll be insulted that I hadn\u2019t told them I was applying, and then *that* would damage any potential professional relationship I could have with them. Any advice is very appreciated.",
