  "text": "Hi everyone,\nSo I\u2019m in the process of getting ready to take the GRE so I can better my chances of getting accepted into a grad program that rejected me. It would honestly be the best place for me to go since there are no prerequisite course to take. In other places there are, and I hadn\u2019t taken any of them. They\u2019re looking for a quantitative score of 151. I\u2019ve been taking the practice tests and just feel so drained midway through. The analytical writing and verbal reasoning sections are pretty wordy and take all of my concentration. By the time I get to quantitative reasoning I\u2019m pretty drained. Any tips or trick to feel energized through the whole thing and get the score I need? Thanks",
