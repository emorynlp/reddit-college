  "text": "Hi everyone,\nSo I\u2019m in the process of getting ready to take the GRE so I can better my chances of getting accepted into a grad program that rejected me. It would honestly be the best place for me to go since there are no prerequisite course to take. In other places there are, and I hadn\u2019t taken any of them. They\u2019re looking for a quantitative score of 151. I\u2019ve been taking the practice tests and just feel so drained midway through. The analytical writing and verbal reasoning sections are pretty wordy and take all of my concentration. By the time I get to quantitative reasoning I\u2019m pretty drained. Any tips or trick to feel energized through the whole thing and get the score I need? Thanks",

              "text": "How's your verbal score? I didn't focus on verbal that much because i knew i wont do well for it (got 153 for it). Didn't felt too tired when i start on quant, maybe because I didn't really use much brain power on verbal (not like i understand the questions anyway). \n\nHonestly speaking i don't think u need a study guide for quant unless u haven't done much math/stat recently. I haven't touched much advance math for years when I did my GRE and still did decent for quant (didn't prep for it as well because i was yolo-ing).\n\nPractice does help though, my first run on mock test was really draining but it was ok on actual test day.",

I also had like $40 worth of Barnes and Noble gift cards that I didn\u2019t have any other use for so I figured I would. B and N is expensive AF. What did you get on the quant?",
