At Another moment, I feel like crap, I feel unwanted from the academic world and I feel that I won't make it. It doesn't help that sometimes you are surrounded by others who may be better off in the program or faculty mentors that are just very critical on your performance.\n I really got to relax this summer but I felt restless for not doing anything. I just hope once school kicks in, I can stay focussed and motivated. \n----when I feel like crap, I try to keep my workout regime and eating healthy as constantly as possible.
