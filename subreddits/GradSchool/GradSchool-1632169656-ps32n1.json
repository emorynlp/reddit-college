I\u2019m a PhD student in social sciences. Yesterday a professor I admired greatly passed away suddenly.\n\nI took 2 classes with him and enjoyed both. He answered every single question students emailed before class. I looked forward to his class every week. My friends and I joked that he was a walking dictionary because he just \u201cknew\u201d everything.\n\nHe and I both had an unusual long commute (3-4 hours each way) and took the same bus often. We chatted while waiting for the bus almost every week. He seemed to genuinely care about my progress in the program. I\u2019ve dog-sat for him and met his wife twice. He was on my reference list when I was applying to foster/adopt dogs.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone in the department is coming to the funeral because everyone lives far away. I don\u2019t think I had a strong professional relationship with him because I was not his advisee. Would it be appropriate for me to attend the funeral? Should I reach out to his wife?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edited to add the paragraph below)\n\nI would like to thank everyone who commented. I have decided to attend the funeral. A few students are carpooling and coming to the city for the funeral, which makes me feel better. This professor was really well respected by his colleagues and students. I have already cried so much in the past two days and will probably cry again at the funeral.", "author": "badlipstickhoarder", "created": 1632169656, "retrieved": 1632952144, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 237, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hdrvf0m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ps32n1/should_i_attend_the_funeral_of_a_professor_who/hdrvf0m/", "text": "I know you've already decided to go, but I feel like if it's someone that you personally feel a connection to, it's appropriate to go.

That\u2019s the least I could to do this great man that I admired dearly.\n\nJust sharing my experience. I don\u2019t regret it at all.

The family will appreciate it. In 2019, the husband of the professor I was TA'ing for had a stroke and passed. My fellow TA's and I picked up a lot of extra lecturing and work to help her with the situation. The information for his funeral was sent out to the department. I had only met the professor's husband once at a department picnic and we just had a nice little conversation. He was also a well known academic in his own right, but had retired before our professor started at our uni. All us TA's went to his visitation and no one else from the department was there. We didn't stay long, but it really brought peace to the professor to see us there.  They had little info cards on him at the visitation and he had led an amazing life, so it was nice for us to attend to learn more about our professor and her husband. I always felt like I was closer to her because we all went, even though she wasn't involved in my work academically.
