  "text": "Potential ecology phd advisor. He seems very interested in me, invited me out to spend a weekend with him and his lab. We think along the same lines and have similar ideas. Really nice guy too which I am not used to in research. I really like him and the research. \n\nHowever, I talked with two of his grad students and one was not really into him and the other was fairly lukewarm. They both said he\u2019s hard to get ahold of and hard to get one on one time with. He is also slow to publish. However he does have meetings with them and gives feedback. They voiced frustration that he does not give them the tools to turn his or their big ideas into reality. \n\nHowever, my impression of a phd is that it\u2019s mostly self guided. I\u2019ll go to him if I have specific questions but I\u2019m not expecting handholding for lack of a better word. I\u2019m planning on asking him point blank if I can be guaranteed one on one time or what his advising structure is like. The publishing doesn\u2019t concern me too much, I\u2019m not set on academia. I mainly like this guy because he seems supportive in the way that matters to me. I can figure my way through lack of day to day support, but it\u2019s the larger comfort in a lab and intrinsic support I need and this guy can give me.\n\nThoughts? Red flags? Thanks.",

      "text": "A PhD in general is definitely not self-guided. You have your professors who will help you through the coursework, and your research (and eventually thesis) advisors who are there to help guide you and make sure you have a strong foundation from the very beginning. Obviously your thesis project is yours, but you don't work on it completely alone. Odds are, you'll have collaborators, and obviously your thesis advisor to turn to if you run into any issues. \n\nA good question that you should ask is what his advising style is like, and if you think you'd fit within those style choices. To complete a PhD, depending on your field, you may be required to have a certain number of publications to actually get your degree, so publications are incredibly important even if your aim is not to stay within academia after you graduate. \n\nListen to the students you've spoken to. Odds are, everyone has a different preference with advising style, so this person's current students may not mesh with their advisor 100% and that's totally fine, but you should still listen to them, because they wouldn't just make anything up. If you find that you don't end up working well with this person, then you can always switch advisors, as long as it's not after you've decided on your thesis topic (and advisor), because that could be a bigger issue to deal with. I hope this was helpful, and if you have any other questions feel free to pm me!",

People with shit advisers will either tell you generic things, or have mild criticisms. If they said what they really think, they could jeopardize their education so  you have to read between the lines. \n\nA PhD is most definitely NOT self-guided. Some people are more autonomous than others, but there are things that you are just going to be unfamiliar with because you're a student and you really need someone to guide you through that process. There are also times when figuring things out on your own is a major waste of time when someone with that knowledge could clarify it in a phone call or conversation. \n\n Being an adviser is one major responsibility of professors at universities, and someone who does not take that as seriously as their other obligations is being negligent at their job. I would be very hesitant about working with this person.",
