I\u2019ve never experienced grad school in person (started in Fall 2020 in the midst of the pandemic, have only ever known Zoom seminars) AND I\u2019m going to be TA\u2019ing for the first time. \n\nI am absolutely freaking out and having an all out anxiety attack. I normally get anxiety before every semester, but I feel like it\u2019s been heightened because I haven\u2019t been in a classroom in over a year, have forgotten what it\u2019s like to socialize with fellow students, I feel completely stupid compared to my classmates, and I feel like I have no authority/knowledge to be TA\u2019ing. The imposter syndrome is kicking in strong. \n\nI already take an SSRI but it is not helping right now. Anyone else feeling extra apprehension/fear/anxiety about this semester if you\u2019re going to be in person and/or teaching?

Even before the pandemic when I was just starting out in grad school my psychiatrist and I decided that it was appropriate to up my SSRI dose, even just for those first few months. If you go the medicine route, adding an anti anxiety med to my SSRI was a godsend. I used to get frequent panic attacks but haven\u2019t since tweaking my meds. Also, if you have the resources at your university, look into counseling or any grad support groups. And if possible, talk to your circle (friends, fam, other grad students) about how you\u2019re feeling. Chances are others in your cohort are feeling very similar things and it\u2019s nice to vent once in a while.

What you are feeling is very real. For me, however, I did find that my fears were, to an extent, a problem of anticipation. I had the memory in my head of how difficult last fall was, and the idea of returning to a similar realm of experience was absolutely terrifying. Even though it was tough, the sheer act of beginning helped to pop the anxiety balloon.\n\nI don't know how exactly your university is handling Covid, but it sounds like you will definitely be spending time in a classroom. For me, this has been a tremendous relief, more so than I could have imagined. Having a shared physical space with peers instead of a purely virtual one has been very soothing.\n\nA lot of my anxiety, at least, comes from the sense that the semester lags on and on forever and submerges and overwhelms you. Two things have been helping me on this point: First, putting everything that I do on my Google calendar, even things like \"Order takeout\" and \"Watch a movie.\" This makes the self-soothing activities and leisure pursuits feel just as important as homework and TA'ing and meetings. And there is no sense of guilt about spending time on these things because they're already built into my time budget, just like all of my obligations are built into the schedule. That knowledge helps keep the tide of anxiety at bay. Secondly, I've developed clear goals for the semester (I'm working on my thesis) that remind me that semesters actually go by incredibly quickly. This gives me a renewed sense of purpose (almost urgency, but in a positive way) that helps cut down on the sense that I somehow might not belong. (However, the sheer fact that you are in your program means that you are meant to be there! You were chosen for a reason!)\n\nIn terms of TA'ing, you know more than your students do. I'm in the humanities and so I have lots of opportunities to incorporate sharing-out activities that keep the students' voices the most active in the room--not mine. I also type out my script before ever recitation session, even down to the \"Good morning!\" I don't read it word-for-word at all when I'm actually in the classroom, but just knowing that I have those notes in my hand increases my confidence.\n\nYou got this!!", "author": "jemma3316", "created": 1631128777, "upvotes": 10}, "hc3elvq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkfnu6/does_anyone_get_anxiety_attacks_before_a_new/hc3elvq/", "text": "Oh i\u2019m in the exact same situation. 2nd year PhD, out of undergrad.
