I didn't apply or anything. They just heard about my work and decided to give it to me and I woke up to an email informing me this morning! Its not a lot in the grand scheme of things, but that is two months worth of rent (scholarship means money directly to my bank account in this case, it doesn't have to be used directly for research, just to support me during it). This is a great start to what is about to be the most stressful four weeks of my life! \n\nUnless something catastrophic happens, I have another grant that I wrote ($10k this time) being approved this week as well for the project. I somehow went from a money-less summer where I had to work an outside job for the past month to getting $11k in grants/scholarships within a week.
