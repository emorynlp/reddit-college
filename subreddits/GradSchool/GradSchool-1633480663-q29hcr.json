      "text": "I did it. I took 2 terms (8 months) off which was the maximum allowed in my program. I was also very burnt out, and I ended up bursting into tears in my advisor's office over very small things. My advisor agreed to let me take a break from school for a few terms for the sake of my mental health. I took the time during my break to recover and rediscover what I actually enjoyed about life (e.g. my hobbies, interests, and social life). I also took the time to properly research future careers and plan how I wanted to get there. After the break, I came back with a vengeance and have been much more productive than prior. \n\nDon't listen to the others telling you not to take the break. Work and research will always be waiting for you, but your mental health may not. And if you can't continue the program because of an unsympathetic advisor, it's not the end of the world, though it really might seem like it.",

      "text": "It's really really hard to come back.  If a student came to me and said they were taking a year off I would assume that is the last I would hear of them.  \n\nIf you need a break I would make it shorter and explicitly limited.  For example, taking a longer break for the holidays or stepping back from your responsibilities in other areas.  Set up meeting to get back up to speed and plan it before you take a break.  That would show you are still fully intending to complete the program.",

But I still try to be in small contact with my advisor and research collabolators, if any. Although I am not doing real experimental work at the bench, we still can discuss previous data and plan next experiments or papers to publish, whatever. It is not daily basis, but weekly or monthly.",
