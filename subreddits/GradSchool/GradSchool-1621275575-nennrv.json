  "text": "I always have this innate fear whenever I hear someone is interested in my lab/prof that this person is going to be better than me and my prof will start ignoring me and put more focus on this other person. \n\nIt's kind of dumb because everyone in my lab works on their own projects and there isn't a lot of overlap between projects but it's still a fear. \n\nI'm happy people are interested in my field because it's small and deserves to grow and I can use friends but I just wish I could feel secure in my project (even though I am/should be) idk.\n\nEdit: I am not worried about collaborating per se, but more about not being good enough or better than peers in my lab. Then I might get kicked out for not being good enough. But I appreciate everyone's comments and can relate.",

But eventually I learned (as another redditor mentioned) to cover my 6.  I set up networks across different schools and within schools (through conferences, meet ups, whatever I could find) so I could easily move if I needed to. I ended up realizing my advisor was just a genuinely toxic person who didn't care a world for his students so I ended up leaving real quick.",

There is certainly research I've contributed to where my name never got on the paper, I've been bumped from 1st author to second author by a brown nosing post doc who contributed very little, and I have also been totally scooped by a postdoc who was asked to finish up a project I had been working on when I was directed to work on something else - in this case I put in all the hard yards to watch someone else get all the credit. I also saw it happen to other people on multiple occasions. In my case, it was all attributable to bad leadership on the part of an awful PI. World famous for their research does not equal good person. Lesson learnt.",

If you genuinely enjoy conversations and look forward to checking in, your boss is also enjoying working with you and your position is secure. \n\nYMMV but recently my boss was acting really weird and distant and it broke my heart, but I kept wanting to reach out to her. Turns out her husband died and she didn\u2019t want to share the situation so she just went really distant and cold.

If so, I would recommend having a one-on-one meeting with your advisor and explaining your worries and hashing them out. If not, then I highly recommend seeking out mental health assistance and talking this out with a therapist.",

Worst case is they give you parameters for improvement so you know exactly what it would take for them to take something from you. That still sounds better than guessing or looking over my shoulder for 4+ years. Clear expectations that you can hold to can be a godsend in the weird nebulous world of research.\n\nNow, if you go in and they flip their lid or are passive aggressive then you know you have a toxic advisor which is a different issue entirely.",

      "text": "I certainly relate to this; there's another student in my research group with whom I constantly get confused (we were literally roommates in our first year and he is second author on my first paper) and I often feel like he is more competent and that is going to somehow invalidate my own success. It's definitely a form of imposter syndrome (though I have also deliberately tried to diversify my own work since being effectively redundant with another student is not ideal). Basically: you're not alone, the other students in your group probably also feel this way, and you just gotta celebrate your successes when they come and use those as sources of strength when you're hitting a hard time or feeling insecure.",

On one hand, I think I'd like being part of a \"dynamic duo\" but on the other hand, I'd definitely feel anxious over my identity as a researcher (on and off campus). I'm still learning to celebrate the little things. I do try to remind myself I'm doing much better now; I'm much happier in grad school than I ever was in my undergrad despite all the lingering and excacerbated mental health problems.",
