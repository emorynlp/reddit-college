  "text": "Just started grad school and I'm already overwhelmed with the sheer amount of reading assigned to us. We have 15+ articles per week plus 10+ chapters from text books. \n\nI've been out of school for 2 years and am slowly adjusting back into academics, relearning how to efficiently take notes, etc. Any tips for reading scientific articles, note-taking, and knowing what information to retain? It all seems important but I know I cant possibly meaningfully retain all this. Thanks so much",

      "text": "A lot of people in here have said skimming\u2014 yep! I\u2019m working on my lit review for my thesis and have started jumping straight to the discussion section of most papers to see how relevant they are. Then, I try to summarise what I care about in the paper on a single sheet of lined paper and colour code them based on overall topic. This helps me keep track of what goes where. If these are assigned papers, starting with the discussion then jumping to intro/methods/results as questions arise works well for me! \nAs to textbook chapters\u2026 one thing I\u2019ve found is that in many textbooks, the first sentence of every paragraph tells you what\u2019s going on. So I\u2019ll skim first sentences until I find something I really don\u2019t know, then read the whole thing. Also: DIAGRAMS. They usually contain all the most critical info (in biology texts anyway, idk what you\u2019re studying), so I look at them and re-draw them in a way my brain likes. Hope this helps!",

My suggestion is to just start an annotated bibliography (or can do this directly in a reference manager that enables you to annotate and/or take notes). \n\nSummarize each paper, IN YOUR OWN WORDS, with a couple of sentences. You should be able to do this just by reading the abstract, conclusion, and interpreting figures. Read into methods/discussion as needed. Organize it as you wish. No way you'll retain all of that on a weekly basis, but at least this will help you quickly search for and find relevant information in the future.",
