I\u2019m working on my lit review for my thesis and have started jumping straight to the discussion section of most papers to see how relevant they are. Then, I try to summarise what I care about in the paper on a single sheet of lined paper and colour code them based on overall topic. This helps me keep track of what goes where. If these are assigned papers, starting with the discussion then jumping to intro/methods/results as questions arise works well for me! \nAs to textbook chapters\u2026 one thing I\u2019ve found is that in many textbooks, the first sentence of every paragraph tells you what\u2019s going on. So I\u2019ll skim first sentences until I find something I really don\u2019t know, then read the whole thing. Also: DIAGRAMS.
