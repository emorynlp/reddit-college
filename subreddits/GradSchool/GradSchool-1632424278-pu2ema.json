My grad program has two routes, thesis and non-thesis (internship), of which I am planning on doing internship because the thesis route did not work out and would require me to add an extra semester on top of my one year, which I think kind of defeats the purpose. I have always wanted to get my PhD at some point in the future, however some people tell me I will not get accepted into programs without having written a thesis in grad school. I have shrugged this off because of a few reasons, one being that I still have a substantial amount of research experience and will be credited as a co-author on at least one published manuscript in the next year. Additionally, I do not plan on getting my PhD right away, so by the time I apply I will have work experience in my field. Lastly, I feel like I could simply explain in my PhD application that I was not able to write a thesis because I did a very strenuous one year program. \n\nEssentially, I am seeking advice on weather or not I will get accepted into PhD programs in the future without having written a thesis in my graduate program.

During my MS I did research, but due to wanting to actually graduate I did not write a thesis.  I went the \"capstone\" route, still did research, ended up with a pub or two.  I think I applied with one under review (3rd author) and one in preparation (1st).  Still landed in a top public school exactly with who I wanted and received a very competitive stipend/tuition package.  I think you could easily overcome not having written a thesis, ESPECIALLY with field experience.  Idk exactly about geo, but it sounds like if you have GIS experience they'll give you anything you want.  Additionally, if you are worried, look for funding sources you can apply for yourself.  The NSF GRFP is one, I'm sure theres others.  Even applying for it looks really good, and if you get it?  Then you're education is paid for and they'd never turn down a free student.", "author": "idk_witty_username", "created": 1632444645, "upvotes": 1}, "he0dyy8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pu2ema/pursuing_a_phd_without_a_masters_thesis/he0dyy8/", "text": "Research experience is really important for PhD programs.
