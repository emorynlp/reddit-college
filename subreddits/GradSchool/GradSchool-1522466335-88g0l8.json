After 6 years as a PhD student, I'm at the end and the beginning. I start a post doc in June. \n\nI dropped out of high school in the tenth grade, was a homeless teenager for a while. Didn't get a GED until I was already a (single) mom of one, and in my early 30s. \nI started taking classes at community college, encouraged along by my husband. \n\nNow, mom of three kids, my oldest in college, and I'm almost there. I realize I am an outlier. Not many high school drop outs go on to get a PhD, I've had a lot of help along the way. I hope I'm able to give back one day.
