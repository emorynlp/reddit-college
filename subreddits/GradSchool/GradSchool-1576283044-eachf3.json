I\u2019ve met countless students who were also taking a ridiculous amount of units while also working 35+ hours a week. \n\nDo you need to go in on a weekend to accommodate these students? Of course not, your weekends are your weekends and anybody who says otherwise is ridiculous. But to flat out ridicule or make fun of a student for asking is wrong, as you never know what\u2019s going on in that his/her\u2019s life and might just be asking out of pure desperation. \n\nI\u2019m just ranting because I\u2019m in my first year of grad school at my alma mater, and I\u2019m just getting to REALLY know my previous undergrad professors.
