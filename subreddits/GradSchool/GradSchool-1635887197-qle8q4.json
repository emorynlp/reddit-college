  "text": "\nMy professor stated that his job is not to make things easy for us, and unfortunately, learning requires time and work. However, I argue that excellent teachers could make learning digestible by focusing on quality vs. quantity. My professor assigns quizzes and exercise each week on top of projects and assignments. I agree that learning takes work, but I argue that too much work could also cost learning.",

A lot of professors don't do that for graduate classes.\n\n>but I argue that too much work could also cost learning.\n\nAnd how many hours a week are you having to work on the class?",

      "text": "The standard expectation for college-level courses is 3 hours per week MINIMUM per credit hour. If it is an in-person class at least 2 of those hours are work outside of class. This is for undergraduate work. So unless you are doing 2-3 times that per week for a single class (so 18 or more hours **per week** for a single 3 credit class), you are likely underestimating the amount of time you should be allotting to your classes.",
