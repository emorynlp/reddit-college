  "title:": "Started with a chip on my shoulder, ended with an MA",
  "text": " know that an MA is not a huge deal, but as someone who has struggled in school all of their life, it feels like a huge accomplishment. I had reading difficulties when I was younger and was a D student all through high school. I ended up with a huge chip on my shoulder, because I felt like all of my life, the academic system kept on telling me that I was dumb and couldn't learn anything. So I ended up going and getting my Bachelor of Arts and maintained a 95% average. From there I decided to do my MA, I think not only to give myself a professional advantage, but just to prove to myself and other people that I could.\n\nI was just told that my thesis passed and...I am stunned that I did it. It feels so surreal. Writing my thesis while a pandemic swept through my country was no picnic. Anyways, I guess I just wanted to post somewhere where this achievement might be appreciated. Best of luck to all of you!",

I also think it\u2019s partially to prove I can :)\n\nAnd also, getting a master\u2019s degree is a huge deal! I\u2019d even argue a Bachelor\u2019s is too. While it\u2019s more common to have a graduate degree in some countries, it\u2019s still a small population that has earned an MA or beyond. In the US about 13.1% of people have completed a graduate degree. So most people do not complete this much schooling, and for a lot of reasons, including that it takes hard work and dedication. CONGRATS!",
