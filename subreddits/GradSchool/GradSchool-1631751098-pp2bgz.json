Should I defer a semester?", "text": "I was due to start my PhD program this fall. I moved from Illinois to NJ. I'd found a room to rent through roomies.com, woman who owned the house seemed nice, I was excited to move and start my program\n\nWhen I got here, a couple of red flags popped up right away: the basement I'm renting doesn't have a door (just a curtain), and the landlord started asking me for rent in cash, which we'd never agreed upon. When I refused to pay her in cash (I told her I'd either do a transfer from my bank to hers or write her a check), she started getting really defensive and coming up with all these complaints/\"concerns\" about me, tried to make me sign a revised version of the lease with new \"rules\" (one was \"You're not allowed upstairs for the safety of everyone\". No joke), started calling/texting my parents (listed as my emergency contacts) to complain about me (for the record, I'm 32), and even called the cops on me last week because I was parked behind in the driveway and didn't move my car from behind hers fast enough for her liking. I wish I was making this up (and I then found out that she didn't actually have to go anywhere, she was just power tripping). On top of all this, there have been a few times where she's just walked into my space without me consenting to it (once while I was taking a nap, even), since I don't have an actual locking door. I've only been here three weeks\n\nNeedless to say, I've been incredibly uncomfortable living here. This past week especially I've been experiencing a lot of stress headaches, anxiety to the point of nausea, and even abdominal cramps. I haven't been to a single class since the semester started two weeks ago and haven't even looked at any of my syllabi. I've been getting no sleep on top of all that\n\nI've been frantically looking for a new place to live, but nothing has really come my way. Even if I found an apartment tomorrow, I'd have to move and buy furniture (I didn't bring anything with me because this place is already furnished) and then try to catch up on all my schoolwork. I've been in touch with my advisor and professors, but there's only so much slack they can cut me. And I definitely don't want to try and take my classes and do poorly\n\nIf money wasn't an issue, I'd just defer the semester and come back recharged in the spring. But money is an issue, since if I defer I won't have any sort of income. There's also the chance, my advisor told me yesterday, that I may not get funded down the line in the program if I go past the four year mark\n\nI really don't know what to do. I'm stressed out enough from everything that's happened, stressed from the fact that I can't find a new apartment, stressed that I'm going to have to spend a lot of money just to move into a new place, stressed that I haven't done a thing for my classes, and stressed and pissed off that this is how my PhD program is starting. I'm already exploring legal options against this woman - the distress she's caused me aside, this basement doesn't meet a few standards - I already mentioned that I have no door, but there's also no smoke detector, carbon monoxide detector, fire extinguisher, etc. \n\nWhat would you all do in my situation?

Anyone in the housing department or anything else, a department head, dean of students, friends in the area - just send messages. They may have more financial support or possible transition housing for emergencies like this.\n\nIt sounds like you'd strongly prefer to not defer right now. So you should spend another 1-2 weeks securing better housing. If it takes more than 1-2 more weeks then the chance of you finishing the semester well are getting smaller since that's a month of missed classes, which is a ton, but perhaps you could drop a class or two and have a partial load, if that works for your funding, or take 1-2 incompletes if your professors can accommodate that.\n\nOtherwise, if money is the issue, you can also apply for jobs (if you don't have enough going on already!) so you have options if you do defer. Don't worry about what your advisor said now about not getting funded for taking too long -- the actual risks to your mental health, sense of well-being, and semester grades are much more urgent right now than a tentative risk down the line. Address your immediate needs now, and worry about what he said about funding later when you're in a better place.", "author": "indecisive_maybe", "created": 1631760041, "upvotes": 9}, "hd12w2l": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pp2bgz/in_a_really_bad_spot_should_i_defer_a_semester/hd12w2l/", "text": "Find a local HUD agency and speak with one of their counselors.
