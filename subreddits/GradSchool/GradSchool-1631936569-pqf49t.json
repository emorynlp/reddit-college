  "text": "About 2 days ago, I applied to a PhD program.  Put a ton of effort into my SOP, saved it to my desktop, made sure everything was nice and tidy, and submitted my application. \n\nAbout 10 minutes ago, I'm deleting some files off my desktop, when I realize the SOP I spent literal weeks on wasn't what I sent.  I sent my rough draft which I stupidly overwrote my final draft with on my desktop prior to submitting my application.  My rough draft is filled with small errors, highlights, and other marked corrections.\n\nGuess I'm not getting in, unless there's some way I can fix this?",

      "text": "If emailing admissions doesn't work, I know some application websites for programs have a page where you can see the status of your application, which you'll go back to, to see when a decision is made. Sometimes this page also has an option to upload any additional documents you think the admissions committee may need. Maybe try that out, if emailing admissions doesn't work out. Maybe even see about calling. I know for one program I applied to, I had to call their admission office bc my transcript and my application were apparently in two different areas, and I had to call to let them know that my transcript was there but that they didn't link it to my application. So yeah, hope that helps or that you're able to get this resolved. Also, make sure you have dates and possible times of when you submitted what, as that can help sometimes too.",

They tend to understand that you are human and likely an adult with many things going on. \n\nGood luck! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get in.",
