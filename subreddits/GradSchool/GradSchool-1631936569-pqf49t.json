Put a ton of effort into my SOP, saved it to my desktop, made sure everything was nice and tidy, and submitted my application. \n\nAbout 10 minutes ago, I'm deleting some files off my desktop, when I realize the SOP I spent literal weeks on wasn't what I sent.  I sent my rough draft which I stupidly overwrote my final draft with on my desktop prior to submitting my application.  My rough draft is filled with small errors, highlights, and other marked corrections.\n\nGuess I'm not getting in, unless there's some way I can fix this?", "author": "throwaway2488995737", "created": 1631936569, "retrieved": 1632844154, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"hde8sx2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqf49t/just_made_a_giant_mistake_applying_for_graduate/hde8sx2/", "text": "I put that I was in not in good standing with my previous institution on my application (error on online application maybe)..

Sometimes this page also has an option to upload any additional documents you think the admissions committee may need. Maybe try that out, if emailing admissions doesn't work out. Maybe even see about calling. I know for one program I applied to, I had to call their admission office bc my transcript and my application were apparently in two different areas, and I had to call to let them know that my transcript was there but that they didn't link it to my application. So yeah, hope that helps or that you're able to get this resolved. Also, make sure you have dates and possible times of when you submitted what, as that can help sometimes too.", "author": "RoyalTHorny", "created": 1631998226, "upvotes": 1}, "hdcwz3i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqf49t/just_made_a_giant_mistake_applying_for_graduate/hdcwz3i/", "text": "Reach out and explain the error and resubmit the correct file.
