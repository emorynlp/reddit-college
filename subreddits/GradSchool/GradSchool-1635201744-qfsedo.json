  "text": "Hey everyone. I'm in my last 6 hours of my Master's program and am looking at graduating in just a few weeks. While that sounds like it should be great and smooth sailing I'm becoming extremely frustrated with my program and the schools administration concerning my graduation application. \n\nI first submitted my application for graduation (digitally) back in July (maybe 2 weeks before the start of my fall semester) and at the end of the application it said to check with my program coordinator to make sure they completed an audit of my degree. I believe that I reached out on 7/27 for the first time to ask if I was all set and good to go for graduation. The program coordinator responded back about 4 days later and said to \"reach back out when I get enrolled for classes\". To that, I responded that I was enrolled in my last two classes and asked when a good time would be for us to talk. No response. Realizing that I was doing this very early in the semester I waited the week or so that was left until classes started and emailed him back in the same chain advising that I was checking in. Maybe 5-6 days pass by before he responded back and said to \"reach out to him tomorrow\" so that we can discuss. (This is where I really start to get annoyed with this guy..) I call him and he literally asks me if I'm already enrolled in my classes and says that he would audit my degree once I turned in my graduation application. We finally clear up that I have completed all of those things and he finishes up his tangent about how he was wanting to change certain dynamics of the program and then proceeds to tell me that he would be in touch when he sees my completed graduation application. \n\nWe literally got nowhere....\n\nWeeks pass and I emailed him again (same email chain) asking for a follow up to our previous discussions as I was wanting to make travel plans to my university for the graduation. He doesn't respond and a week later I start getting to the point where I'm losing faith in this guy and the program as a whole. I forwarded that email chain yo the grad school asking for someone to audit my application package and transcript to make sure I'm good to go, they send me to the registrar, the registrar then sends me back to my program coordinator (All on the same email chain!) and he never responds. I go back to the grad school basically as a last ditch effort and they tell me that they have heard complaints about this guy and were looking into changing up the program's coordinator, they then tell me that they went ahead and pulled my transcript and verified that I was good to go. So I end up finally getting my answer and decide to move on with my life.\n\n...At least I thought I was..\n\n2 weeks later (about 2 weeks ago) my program coordinator then decides to email me in a group email with the program students and is asking us to fill out a file for him. The file is a word document titled \"Business School Graduation Application\" with a self audit portion for me to complete at the bottom. Annoyed that this is basically what I had been asking for since July I go ahead and fill it out and send it back to him. He responds saying that it looks good and then says something about how he approved some credits from a Dr. Such&Such that I had never even heard of before. Turns out that he had me confused with another student and ended up telling me so. \n\nIs it over yet..?\n\nNope, not yet! On Friday (10/22) I get another family from him, this time it is addressed directly to me, asking me to complete the same word document application again! I respond with a kind of serious email including the grad school BCC'ed and included the previous word document application that I sent him along with a pdf copy of my last conversation with him where he said the document that he got from me looked good. I requested a read receipt on it and specifically asked in the email that he confirm that everything looks good for me once he reviewed it. Well earlier today I see that he opened and read the email but I still haven't heard from him.\n\nIf you've stuck with me this far I really appreciate it! I'm just frustrated and really don't know where to turn next. I live 1300 miles from this school and my wife and I have already made travel plans to get there. I just really want to know if I'm going to be good to graduate! Am I being a little too hard on this guy? If not, do you have any suggestions of who I can inform about this issue? I've thought about the Chair of my particular degree area or even reaching out to the business school but have held off. I'm also working on applying for an Ed.D program that I'm hoping to start next fall so I'm really needing this to get straightened out! Any suggestions or well wishes would be greatly appreciated!",
