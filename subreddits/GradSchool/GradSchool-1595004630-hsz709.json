  "title:": "Is it normal to feel that one\u2019s research is bullshit?",
  "text": "I basically see an enormous amount of flaws in everything I do research-wise, spanning from the general focus of my PhD (if not the field itself) to the details in the design of my experiments. However, unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t mean that I have the creativity and skills to make \u00ab\u00a0flawless\u00a0\u00bb research. Plus, nobody in my lab works in this field so I am pretty much the only \u00ab\u00a0expert\u00a0\u00bb and cannot change fields because of the funding. \n\nSo I am basically stuck doing something I find very mediocre, with an infinite potential for criticism (that my brain can\u2019t stop exploring), and will end up receiving a PhD based on a compilation of work whose quality I could never find satisfactory.. is this normal? Is this what a PhD is like? And if so, why are we doing this to ourselves exactly? \n\nOk the last question is ranting..sorry. But this really feels like purgatory sometimes, and I don\u2019t know whether this is \u00ab\u00a0just\u00a0\u00bb me being a perfectionist (but isn\u2019t this what science is supposed to be all about; exercising critical thinking and spotting logical/experimental flaws?), and whether the constant belittling of my own research is founded/rational or the result of an unhealthy inner critic.. help?",

She said that part of getting a PhD is getting to the point where you question all of your research and see all of the flaws and wade through all of the data to find some bit of truth. This is why science is not made off of one publication. For something to be considered true there needs to be many many papers poking at the same issue and getting to the truth of something. You can't put too much stock into one paper. So don't put so much pressure on your own publications to be 100% perfect. Your paper likely will be just one small contribution to the overall field and it may have some parts that you get wrong. But as long as you are not making up stuff or falsifying data then it is probably just as good as most other papers.  I agree with others that a good dissertation is a finished dissertation.",

      "text": "Grad school is infamous for rampant [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). It sounds to me like what you're experiencing is one of the countless variants of that.\n\nIn the book I'm currently reading (How to Take Smart Notes), this little factoid was mentioned: half of all PhD dissertations are never finished. That's *a ton* of blood, sweat, and tears! Do you wonder how many of those topics were close to the finish line but just needed some little tweak in the author's self-confidence or workflow, as opposed to the substance itself being unsuitable?\n\nOne of the many excellent recommendations from the book is to not proofread while writing. The two are very different activities that require very different types of attention and mental work. So, if you try to do both at the same time, you're actually just exhausting your brain and obstructing the \"flow\" state by going back and forth between the two. Here are a few pertinent paragraphs:\n\n> On closer look, it becomes obvious how different the tasks are that are usually summarised under \u201cwriting\u201d and how different the kinds of attention are that they require.\n\n> Proofreading, for example, is obviously part of the writing process, but requires a very different state of mind than the attempt to find the right words. When we proofread a manuscript, we take on the role of a critic who takes a step back to see the text with the eyes of a dispassionate reader. We scan the text for typos, try to smooth out patches and check structure. We deliberately put distance between ourselves and the text to see what is really on the paper, not just in our heads. We try to block out the knowledge of what we meant to say to be able to see what we wrote.\n\n> While taking on the role of a critic is not the same as being an impartial reader, it is enough to spot most of what we missed before: the holes in the argument, the parts we did not explain as we did not need to explain them to ourselves. To be able to switch between the role of critic and the role of writer requires a clear separation between these two tasks, and that becomes easier with experience. If we proofread a manuscript and don\u2019t manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text. It is a common issue that comes up during discussions with students: When I point out problems within the argument, an ill-defined term or just an ambiguous passage, students usually refer to what they _mean_ first and only shift their focus to what they have written when they fully understand that what they mean is completely irrelevant within the scientific community.\n\n> Letting the inner critic interfere with the author isn\u2019t helpful, either. Here we have to focus our attention on our thoughts. If the critic constantly and prematurely interferes whenever a sentence isn\u2019t perfect yet, we would never get anything on paper. We need to get our thoughts on paper first and improve them there, where we can look at them. Especially complex ideas are difficult to turn into a linear text in the head alone. If we try to please the critical reader instantly, our workflow would come to a standstill. We tend to call extremely slow writers, who always try to write as if for print, perfectionists. Even though it sounds like praise for extreme professionalism, it is not: A real professional would wait until it was time for proofreading, so he or she can focus on one thing at a time. While proofreading requires more focused attention, finding the right words during writing requires much more floating attention.\n\n> -----\n\n> Ahrens, S\u00f6nke. *How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking \u2013 for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers* (ch 9.3, par 1).

But on top of that, I kinda dislike my sub-field and know zero expert in it with whom I could talk about my research. Thus, I think it is natural for the research to be worse if there aren\u2019t many scientific exchanges going on and one doesn\u2019t get any topic-specific feedback or ideas, and one feels lonely in one\u2019s research.. The thing is that I have no doubts that I will be able to finish my dissertation (therefore probably not imposter) but the problem is that I think I\u2019ll very much dislike it.. I might very well have some other issue like perfectionism or pessimism or sth",

              "text": "\"It's not imposter syndrome if I think I'm not the only imposter\" isn't true. It just means your *personal* imposter syndrome is hiding itself in an *inclusive* imposter syndrome, so to speak.\n\n\"It's not imposter syndrome because I think I can get away with it\" is also untrue. That you believe you'll finish your dissertation and that it'll be accepted doesn't preclude you from imposter syndrome.\n\nThat said, maybe you don't have imposter syndrome. I'm not a doctor. But I think that the thing about imposter syndrome is that it tends to affect intelligent people (see: [Dunning\u2013Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning\u2013Kruger_effect)), and intelligent people are able to come up with more ways to rationalize it. It sounds to me like that does a pretty good job of explaining things, but again, I'm not a doctor. I'm just a well-meaning stranger trying to be an honest and supportive sounding board.\n\nIn any case, I wish you the best of luck with your studies and hope you end up with something you can be proud of. :)",

      "text": "You might benefit from reading and thinking about how observational research is designed and interpreted. In situations where we can't do controlled experiments, or we still need to produce evidence that experiments would be justified, the goal of producing a *body* of evidence becomes even more important. No one study design or approach is perfect, but by studying a problem in different ways whose limitations compensate for one another, we build up meaningful knowledge anyway. This is true in any field but you are really forced to reckon with it in observational science.\n\nIMO you are supposed to see flaws in your own work, as with any work, because they will lead you to new research questions and methodological refinements. These flaws aren't evidence that you're bad, they're evidence that it's hard to rigorously investigate the physical and social worlds. For pressing human problems, lack of perfect knowledge is no excuse not to act. Anything that contributes to having the best *available* information is an important humanitarian activity.\n\nYour ability to see how one solution leads to more questions is actually really important if you want to do research. It's evidence of understanding and interest in your field. But it can poison that interest if you take it as a sign that you're too flawed to do the work.",

Having trouble distinguishing one from the other suggests that your self worth might be tied up with your work in a way that is detrimental to your academic goals. If recognizing a limitation in your research leads to a strong emotional reaction or even depression, then you should talk to a therapist about it. There is a lot of information available about the negative impacts of perfectionism. In short, it does not lead to perfection, but it can cause serious problems, including underachieving, problems collaborating with others, and burnout.",

Behind those papers are whole PhDs or Post docs sometimes and endless troubleshooting. It\u2019s easy to compare yourself to them and judge your own work. It\u2019s just as easy to tear a paper to shreds during journal club to the extent that you no longer believe the results, but that\u2019s just a fallacy. Academics do that to make themselves feel better about their own work.\n\nThe truth is you don\u2019t need to do any of those things perfectly to demonstrate a point in science. Are the flaws that serious in your experimental design that your whole paper could come crashing down? Probably not. Do you compare your own work too much to people who probably have better funding, more support, more hands, and maybe more experience? Probably. Maybe there are some weak points, but it doesn\u2019t mean your research is bullshit. \n\nRemember that you are a still a student. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes. It\u2019s okay to fail sometimes.",

      "text": "Other replies say it\u2019s imposter syndrome and maybe that\u2019s what it is but I had a similar experience. It definitely was not a normal situation and I knew it. My topic was sort of interdisciplinary between a rigorous subject and a somewhat less rigorous subject and my department belonged to the latter. So my committee members often complained that I overcomplicate things while journal editors would tell me that I was being too handwavy. I felt alone the whole time as my advisor couldn\u2019t give me any advice beyond basic good research habits. In the end I did it for pleasure and pushed for rigor. Since I was doing it for pleasure I didn\u2019t stress out (this is important!) but my work ended up looking much better and I took pleasure in knowing that like a pervert rather than fretting about my work still being mediocre. As I learned more through the process my early chapters started to look more and more like crap although I did my best to amend them. If you believe your work isn\u2019t watertight, you are probably right, but don\u2019t stressed out about it. Keep filling in the gaps and improve your work for the valued reader of your dissertation - that\u2019s you! (literally nobody other than you yourself will read it). This is what I learned talking to some people: no matter what I did, a lot of people would just assume that it\u2019s the advisor who does the heavy lifting in my PhD dissertation. In that sense, it\u2019s actually what you do after your PhD as an independent researcher, not your PhD research, that actually counts more as your work and is more likely to become your magnum opus down the road.",

And that out of those 0.1% who did, very few of them did it before the age of 50.

I mean I get that it\u2019s training but nothing fundamentally changes between the time before you get a PhD and the time after. A PhD doesn\u2019t automatically grant you a set of skills or access to automatic respect, it\u2019s just given incidentally if you persist for a while in research. There are PhDs that graduate without any meaningful skills or growth and there are others who could immediately step into a PI role. Why wait to do good work till afterwards?\n\nIdk maybe I\u2019m not in the majority but I could care less about the requirement and the piece of paper; I don\u2019t really care if it takes 4 years or if it takes 7. What I care about is that I gained the skills to be a complete scientist and have published good, rigorous work\u2014respected by others\u2014that advances my small corner of the field. I didn\u2019t start my PhD to get a PhD (so to speak), I did it to fully become a scientist.",

I\u2019m still trying to make academia work so in that regard, a PhD is the halfway point and really doesn\u2019t qualify me for anything inherently. I mean, you need a PhD for a postdoc but there\u2019s a huge range of qualities of position and they\u2019re a function of skills and publication record not that you have a degree. Similarly, data science doesn\u2019t need a PhD and instead they will examine what skills you have to build (business) solutions from data.",
