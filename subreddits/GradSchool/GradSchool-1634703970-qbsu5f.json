  "title:": "Why (CS) Grad School?",
  "text": "Hi all! I am a CS undergrad, about to graduate next year, and I have a very *very* basic doubt that has been nagging me for the past three years. *WHY GRAD SCHOOL?!?*\n\nMy Background:\n\nI have always been a decent performer, academically. I have a GPA > 9.5, from one of India's top tech colleges, decent internships (both research and industrial), a few mid-tier papers, etc. The thing is, I did all of this only because, in the back of my mind, I wanted to pursue further research. Or so I thought.\n\nNow when it is finally the time to start applying, I am having serious second thoughts. I always thought I wanted to pursue research, but I realized that actually it is what everyone else *expected* from me. I mean, that is what practically everyone told me, that since my profile was decent, academically, grad school was my only way forward.\n\nI recently spoke to a very good friend who wants to pursue a Ph.D. and asked him the exact question, \"Why grad school?\". He bluntly said that it was the *prestige* that matters, and *that's the reason why most people who get a Ph.D., actually do so.*\n\nMy Question:\n\nIs my friend correct, and is prestige the driving factor for people getting a Ph.D.? Or is it an innate love for the subject that actually motivates Ph.D. aspirants?\n\n*Thanks for reading; sorry for the long post.*",

      "text": "I don't think there is a one-size-fits-all answer here -- it really depends on what YOU want. Although, I will say -- one piece of advice that I have received is to only do a PhD if you *need* it. \n\n\"Need it\" can mean two things here -- either, you really want the experience of doing it (not for the prestige/credentials, but because spending 5-6 years of your life hitting your head against problems appeals to you), or your dream career requires it. From what I can tell, many good CS jobs do not require a PhD (except perhaps some industry research labs, not sure about those).  Personally, (and I'm also a CS student), I'm in grad school for the former reason -- if this weren't the case, I probably would have gone straight to industry. Especially as there is a serious opportunity cost -- one has to give up 5-6 years which could be used to gain work experience/better positions.",

          "text": "Thank you so much, and your comment actually makes a lot of sense!\n\nTo be honest, I do like solving challenging problems, but a 5-year-long commitment scares the hell out of me. Add to that the uncertainty and the constant pressure of 'publish-or-perish,' I don't think I'll be able to survive grad school haha. Plus, I don't have a dream job as such; just a decent-paying one will do the trick for me :)",
