  "text": "I\u2019m a PhD student and things have been kinda spiraling out of control. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my anxiety or if I\u2019m being a bad TA. I should start off by saying I\u2019m a PhD student for a department I did not major in. Although I know some stuff, it\u2019s more grad level content. I\u2019m quite unfamiliar with the undergrad content. (Undergrad is more engineering based while grad is more math based). I\u2019m very lost on the class I am TAing for. The professor is going at light speed and frankly literally the entire class is confused at what\u2019s going on. In fact they\u2019re more confused than I am, which is bad since they are seniors, and I don\u2019t know jack. They\u2019re absolutely great students and they\u2019re very smart. I think the department failed them + covid happened and they either forgot everything or didn\u2019t learn it properly. I honestly don\u2019t have any time to teach the prerequisites for this class as I have coursework of my own + research. In fsct, I\u2019m nearly failing my own class. I work from 8 am to 7pm everyday and I\u2019m genuinely burnt out. I just can\u2019t put more energy into this class. The professor also never gives me a solution to the homework nor a rubric for grading. I don\u2019t really understand how he expects me to grade without the goddamn solutions for homework I don\u2019t even know how to do. He\u2019s a great guy I just think he\u2019s as burnt out as I am. The students do like me a lot, and I can help them out with some stuff but not everything. I host office hours, and I do actually help a lot. In fact some of them even asked to get some beer with me, though I had to decline and say it\u2019s against the school policy to hang out with students while in their TA, but I\u2019d be happy to once class ended. I just don\u2019t want to be fired because I need to TA in order to have my tuition waived as a PhD student. This is my first year and I\u2019m extremely burnt out. Maybe I should be putting more work into this class. I kinda put in 15/20 hours a week, though I have so much damn work with other PhD stuff I can\u2019t really put in more. Any advice?",

      "text": "I see only 2 possible solutions: find someone who TA this course for this Professor before and beg them to share any materials they made (solutions, grading rubrics). Go to Professor's office hours every week and ask him for keys to students' homework/ grading rubrics or suggest you need to go through the homework problems with them. Hint somehow that PhD program should teach PhD students and not to expect them to have the expertise of a full professor on entering the program.",

              "text": "No way. Honestly, the school doesn\u2019t give a shit if you do a good job or not. They really don\u2019t care if their students succeed. They just want those dolla dolla bills. To be frank, they probably expect students to do poorly in this class which is why the professor is bad at teaching it too. It\u2019s a bad system.",

Definitely try to get a answer key from the prof every week. I would just keep doing the office hours since they seem to help. It sounds like the students are happy with the work you\u2019re doing so far, and if the prof hasn\u2019t complained either, you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. Maybe at the end of the semester you can provide feedback and say that the TA needs to be given answer keys.",
