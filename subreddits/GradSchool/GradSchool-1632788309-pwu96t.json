  "text": "So, basically the only thing keeping me from graduating is finishing my thesis. I have delayed this task for THREE years and I don\u2019t think my adviser even notices. However, I am now too ashamed to ask for help. \n\nI get so anxious to the point of freezing when I start or even think about my thesis. It has become so much of a burden to me but I really need to finish it. To be honest, I can write almost anything but for some reason I cannot start/finish my thesis. \n\nIs there any way someone can help me? Perhaps a tool, or an advice? I need all the help I can get. I know I can do this, but a simple guidance will reaaally really help.",

Use online school library interloan system to find necessary sources. \n\n4. Start with writing bullet point summary of each article you cite. Then combine all those bullet points into cohesive paragraph.",

      "text": "Just write. Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s garbage and doesn\u2019t really make sense. Just start writing. It\u2019s way easier to go back and edit it to make it nice. Once you start writing it\u2019ll be easier to keep it going, starting from nothing is always the hardest part. \n\nI would also recommend starting with the methods and results as they usually require the least effort since you\u2019re basically describing what you did and what you found.",
