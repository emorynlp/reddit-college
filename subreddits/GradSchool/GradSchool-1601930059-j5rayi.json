We know that women in graduate school and higher ed face additional struggles.  Despite significant post birth recovery, many sleepless nights, and keeping two very small children alive (21 months and 5 months), I still managed to research, write and defend.  \n\nToday, not only did I pass my defense, but I also became the second person ever in my department to do so with no revisions.  \n\nI must admit, as I blearily sat feeding my newborn at 2:00 a.m. this past May, I would often visit this subreddit to keep myself awake.  Seeing the successes of many posters who never talked about kids and the additional challenges of being a woman made it feel like this was an impossible task.  I felt isolated and wondered if I was crazy to try and be both a mother and a student.  So, I post today in the hopes that some other woman reads this and feels hope.  \n\nKeep going and hang in there.

Tbh, even though it was tough, I\u2019ve also never felt more supported. For example, some of my grad school friends helped me get my thesis bound and submitted because I was literally in the hospital delivery ward by the time the deadline rolled around and I couldn\u2019t do it myself. A lot of things did fall into place. I job searched with a new born and had a memorable session where I nursed  while doing a phone interview with a recruiter, but again a ton of people stepped in to help whenever they could. My in laws did some baby sitting so I could attend job interviews and the interviewers were even ok with me stepping away to care for my kid when they could hear him crying on the phone. I did pass up certain job opportunities because I couldn\u2019t imagine doing them with a new born (like ones that involved  moving to a brand new country for example), but two years on I\u2019ve gotten a job that I love and it\u2019s still...tough but doable. I think if you ever felt like you need to ask for more help or reach out, being pregnant or working on your PhD with a newborn is definitely the time to do it.
