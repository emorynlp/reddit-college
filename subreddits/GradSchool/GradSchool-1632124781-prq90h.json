  "title:": "Master's Degree or Career",
  "text": "I am 23 year old guy with a bachelor's degree in computer science. The master's degree is free in my country, so it doesn't cost me anything to get it (besides busting my ass for two years).\n\nBUT, I just got a job (more like a summer internship) in a unicorn company. That comes with all the benefits you'd expect. The best equipment, free lunches, masaages, amazing team buildings, great mentourship and so on. I am thoroughy enjoying myself and they're very impressed by my work ethic and my experience. My boss asked me to actually get emplyed there because I'm doing so well. I declined, saying that I'll pursue my masters degree. They said that I could work as much or little as I wanted during my masters, but it would not count as being employed, but continue only this internship status.\n\nThe problem here is that they're \"fine\" with with me working 20 hours per week, but I believe they are not thrilled. I will also not get any stock options in this time, and I am quite sure that the company will IPO within the next year to year and a half, which completely eliminates that. \n\nThe thing is that I don't think I want to get my master's. I feel like I should get it, but I am not too thrilled. The thing is also that this is a unique opportunity because this is not silicon valley, it's a small country in eastern Europe and companies like this one don't just pop up every year. \n\nI don't know how to figure out what to do. I don't know what extra benefits will masters degree bring me or really how to quantify it. I know a few people that went back to school after a few years of working to get their masters just because they couldn't advance into positions without it. But I also know that I will get a sizable chunk of cash which I will invest and grow over time if I actually get emplyed here. I want to get into product management within at most 10 years.",

      "text": "... and product management position at this company or other companies in your area requires a Masters degree? I think it's unlikely (do check, don't take my word for it). Many positions just say Masters or equivalent working experience. Also it's usually the case that within-company transfers or position changes are easier than getting into the company in the first place. So in that sense, quitting the program makes sense.\n\nThat being said, if you think Masters is necessary for your career long term, I'd consider perhaps delaying or temporarily halting the degree if your Uni and supervisor allows it, or find some other ways to get enough credit to graduate while working full time. Also if you're thinking of dropping out now and re-doing the Masters in, say, 5 years or so, is it likely to affect admission process etc.? For example, if you need a good recommendation letter to get in then burning the bridges or having a fallout with your supervisor at this stage is not a good idea.",
