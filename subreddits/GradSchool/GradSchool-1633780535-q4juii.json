  "title:": "I now have a new academic advisor?",
  "text": "My old advisor was also the head of the department. She had just received the role as the head over the summer, and said that regardless of the new role she would still be myself and a small group of other people\u2019s academic advisor.\n\nYesterday afternoon, I received an email inviting me to join a Google Group for the new professor in my department\u2019s advising students. I was very surprised, since this came out of nowhere. Nobody had received any communication saying that she was no longer our advisor. She essentially ghosted everyone.\n\nA lot of the people in my cohort who had the same advisor as me are pissed. Personally I\u2019m more confused than anything else. I\u2019m also a bit worried because I planned to take an extra class in the spring so I can graduate on time, and my old advisor was fine with this. I\u2019m now worried about the new advisor not allowing me to do this.",
