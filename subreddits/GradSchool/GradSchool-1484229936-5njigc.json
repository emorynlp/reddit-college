Part of my programme expects me to relocate to a foreign lab for around 12 months, and I'm in the middle of that period right now.\n\nUntil quite recently, I was suffering from serious, persistent PhD-related anxiety and didn't know a way out. I only saw 3 options: quit my PhD (nope to that), suicide (double nope to that), or work enough to finish. Obviously, work was the best solution, but I found that difficult for the following reasons:\n\n* Some gaps in my technical knowledge: I knew what I was supposed to do, but not how to get my code to do it.\n\n* The assumption that I really *should* already know all the above technical stuff, so felt that asking about it was a stupid question.\n\n* The only people who I felt had a responsibility to answer my stupid questions (supervisors, etc) are non-technical teaching types/people with expertise elsewhere who don't know how my code is supposed to work anyway.\n\n* The only people who would really know how to solve my problems were at other institutions worldwide, who I could have contacted in principle, but who in practice I didn't want to bother with my stupid questions.\n\n* I happened to be the only researcher from my institution deployed to the foreign lab at the time, giving me a whole office to myself. This seemed great initially, but it soon resulted in crushing isolation. Gone were the days when I could roll over to one of my more senior peers and ask a quick question.\n\n* Additionally, no one in my office = no need to maintain good attendance. I went in late, often not at all, and when faced with a brick wall of code I couldn't progress through, I procrastinated (the usual: Reddit, Facebook, Reddit, Imgur, Reddit, YouTube, Reddit and Reddit).\n\n* I suffered in silence for so long and got so far behind that asking about a basic problem would mean admitting I had done next to nothing for the past few weeks/months, making it even harder for me to consider asking for help.\n\n* My supervisor is pretty hands-off (and back in my home country), so I only have to give an update every couple months to my home department via videoconference. Each time I'd have 1-2 weeks warning to prepare a talk, so I'd panic, contemplate self-injury to get out of it, and scrape together maybe 25% of what I should have done in order to have **something** to show and survive the talk.\n\n* This is quite specific to me, but I have a love-hate relationship with food. I used to be obese, but I lost around 35 lbs in my late teens through diligent diet and exercise and achieved a healthy weight (in fact IMHO I looked pretty good), which I maintained throughout undergrad despite frequently failing to prevent myself binge eating. However, during this period of several months of increased PhD-anxiety, almost every day I would go home defeated, stop by the supermarket and buy an absurd quantity of junk food. I ate my feelings because I just didn't have the willpower not to. A typical day's haul might be: sharing-size bag of Doritos, 3x100g chocolate bars and a sack of gummy candy, which I'd consume entirely between the hours of 7pm and midnight while browsing the internet. This obviously affected my weight, sleep cycle, and self-esteem terribly.\n\nHere's a list of things, big and small, that I did (knowingly and unknowingly) to improve my situation.\n\n**I bought an alarm clock**\n\nThis stopped me using my phone as an alarm, and stopped me getting trapped in the \"morning scroll\" in bed.\n\nBefore: my alarm would go off at 8, I would snooze it repeatedly for an hour, then the guilt would set in, but not wanting to face the grim prospect of another day at the office doing nothing, I would put it off by browsing the internet in bed for a couple of hours. Eventually I'd go into the office around lunchtime, on a good day. On a bad day I'd just \"work from home\" i.e. procrastinate at home instead of in the office.\n\nAfter: my alarm goes off at 8, my phone is charging near my other everyday carry items, ready for me to get dressed. I never go back to sleep (sometimes I have a couple of 5 minute snoozes to shake the sleep out of my eyes and stretch before getting up). I get ready and leave my apartment within an hour. I have cultivated a habit of not unlocking my phone until I'm at the bus stop on the way to the office, and I check messages/news during the 20-30 minute ride.\n\n**I uninstalled all social media apps from my phone**\n\nOkay so I kept the various messaging apps to keep in touch with friends and family, but everything else had to go. Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and Imgur were the worst offenders, particularly when they referred me to some news on current events. Inevitably I would end up reading about the latest governmental idiocy or some massive socio-economic problem that would seem so intractible and it would depress me too much. I would burn up my mental energy trying to process how I felt about the issue and trying to solve it, when economics and politics are so much more insoluble than the scientific problems I'm trained to solve. Besides depressing news, I unsubscribed from several depressing/nihilistic meme pages whose content made me feel validated, but which were ultimately reinforcing my depression and anxiety.\n\nFurthermore, the kind of content I consumed though these platforms was in very small, easily digestible chunks. I would say to myself \"just one more swipe\", \"just one more article\" and waste hours because I couldn't pull myself away. Instead, I started reading eBooks on my phone. This means I can still have entertainment for 10 mins here and there, but it's not too hard to tear myself away because the book is a longer term project and it'll still be there when I come back. I'm also getting through many more books (about 1 every 2 weeks) this way.\n\nI still surf the web pretty freely in the evenings, but on a desktop with better things to do (TV/movies/gaming), so my addiction has been curbed.\n\n**I sorted out my diet**\n\nFor years, I've found it helpful to treat my food problems like alcoholism. A small piece of chocolate, candy or other sugar can make me fall off the wagon completely and get into a spiral of regular binge eating, so I avoid it as much as possible. The first few days are the hardest, but eventually my low-carb/complex-carb diet becomes perfectly comfortable, until my next slip-up. Three things that made this easier were:\n\n1) Chugging a whey protein shake after breakfast each morning, which kills any genuine hunger I have for most of the day.\n\n2) Deciding I would eat lunch every day from the office cafeteria (instead of a packed lunch), knowing the only thing I could afford to eat every day was the salad bar with cold meats. This reduced the amount of grocery shopping I had to do and so reduced my exposure to junk food.\n\n3) Using a calorie-counter app on my phone to gamify eating and let my OCD-but-not-actually-OCD help me to meet the calorie targets each day.\n\nBefore: fat as hell, getting fatter, almost obese again, hating myself, not wanting to exercise because I feel terrible.\n\nAfter: back to a healthy weight, feeling good, exercising, sleeping much better. Incidentally, the tastiest thing I eat every day is my cereal in the morning, which is an additional motivating factor to get out of bed because I look forward to that breakfast treat.\n\n**I realised my friends were imposters too**\n\nWe all know that PhD students suffer from imposter syndrome, particularly when things aren't going well. I defined \"imposter\" to mean \"struggling with work, maybe failing a lot of the time, but pretending to be successful so no one knows\". I realised that by this definition, I was indistinguishable from all my friends, who I thought had their shit together. For all they knew, I had my shit together too, because I never let on how much I was suffering. However when I paid attention I realised (from small throwaway comments and jokes) that everyone has productivity issues:\n\nFriend A half-jokes that he spends too much time on Reddit (I know that feel)\n\nFriend B says that he spends all his time \"dossing around\" (i.e. \"goofing off\" in Freedom Units)\n\nFriend C seems to be the ideal grad student, I envy him his diligence, he's always in the lab from 9am-7pm, but then friend D (who he works with) mentions that it took him months too long to do an important task that others were relying on, and D had to do it for him in the end, just to get the group project finished.\n\nI realised that everyone I knew probably felt inadequate at least sometimes, and they probably all thought I had my shit together, and that helped ease my imposter syndrome a bit.\n\n**I picked a few valuable people to think I'm a moron**\n\nIn everyday life, I have a category of people whose opinions I don't care about. This is usually reserved for people I judge to be assholes or morons whose opinion I can't possibly change. For example, a young-Earth creationist I know thinks I'm either a sheep or part of the scientific conspiracy against God because I supported the Earth being billions of years old. Eventually I just gave up and stopped caring what he thought of me.\n\nI picked a couple of people here and there who could help me with my basic problems, and deliberately committed pride-suicide with them by asking the most basic stupid questions I needed answered. It was painful to do, but once it was done, I could mentally shrug and say \"well, the cat's out of the bag now, he knows I'm a dumbass anyway\" and I felt free to ask for more help.\n\nI was (and continue to be) extremely polite, humble and grateful for all their help. I didn't want to be an arrogant idiot, because I had nothing but respect for these colleagues of mine, and still wanted to minimise my impact on their work. (Un)surprisingly, everyone was very friendly and helpful and I made good progress in my work by leveraging these few helpers. None of them have insulted me for asking a stupid question, and even if I have lowered their private, personal opinions of me, they're too professional to let it show, and I've made peace with it because any higher opinions would be undeserved anyway.\n\n**I saddled myself with regular contact with my supervisor**\n\nI suggested to my supervisor that we talk at least every week at a set time via videoconference, so that I'd *have* to talk to him at least at the agreed time, and wouldn't be able to squirm out of it. This helped leverage the part of my mind that used to cause me to go into panic mode every time I had to give an update. Those panics were hell, but they did make me get stuff done. Forcing myself to give weekly updates helped spread out the load, so I didn't ever feel panicked, but had enough pressure to get work done every week. I also got into the habit of emailing little updates throughout the week whenever I made a small step forward, which gave me a teeny-tiny ego boost each time, since I felt I could say \"look, I've achieved **this one specific thing** since we last spoke\".\n\nThis regular stream of emails made it much easier to slip in a casual question here or there without it seeming like a big deal. My supervisor may not be familiar with the tools/software I'm using, but he's a absolute guru/genius when it comes to the underlying science, so the 2-way flow of explanation (me explaining my progress and him explaining some background theory I don't get) has been useful, since he often knows the right questions to ask about my work that will direct me towards the solution on my own, even if he doesn't know the answer himself.\n\nI hope my experience can help some other poor lost grad student some day.\n\n**TL;DR:** Alarm clock not phone, vegetables not chocolate, everyone (and therefore no one) is an imposter, revealed my inner idiot to get the help I needed, started talking to my supervisor more often.\n\n(Edited for clarity and detail)", "author": "PedanticPendant", "created": 1484229936, "retrieved": 1632954454, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 282, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"dcd1cts": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/5njigc/a_personal_account_of_a_few_changes_i_made_to_go/dcd1cts/", "text": "> I picked a few valuable people to think I'm a moron\n\nIf there's one thing I learned in grad school, it's that I am a moron.
