  "title:": "Do I have what it takes for masters in mechanical engineering at ETH Zurich, Oxford, Cambridge, Columbia, or Princeton? Looking for some advice!",
  "text": "I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate student at a top-8 Canadian school interested in research-based masters programs in mechanical engineering at ETH Zurich, Oxford, Cambridge, Columbia, and Princeton. I'd love to hear feedback from current masters students on the strength of my experiences, areas for improvement, and how good my chances may be at success. Thanks in advance!\n\nSome background info:\n\n* **Major:** mechanical engineering; areas of interest include energy & fluid systems, CAD/FEA, and automotive design.\n* **GPA:** 3.72 (4.0 for 3rd/4th year courses)\n* **Research experience:** I\u2019ve recently begun working as a research assistant in two mechanical engineering professors\u2019 labs. One lab examines detonation phenomena in rotating detonation engines. The other lab studies low-speed aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. While each target school has a different deadline, I will have spent between 3 and 8 months working in each lab by the time of applying and hope to receive **2 of the 3** required academic references.\n* **Self-directed project 1:** I am the founder and manager of a faculty-supervised student engineering team that has spent 2 years designing a functional, software-automated aeroponic vertical farm. We've spent several hundred hours creating a full 3D CAD model of our original farm design. We also developed an electromechanical feedback control system (based on plant science research) that maintains optimal growth conditions with sensors, actuators, and micro-controllers. This year we plan to manufacture a physical prototype on our school's campus. Our team now has 25 alumni and 15 current members. Since 2019, I've established partnerships with 1 governmental institution, 7 industry partners, 1 vertical farming research lab, and **one Columbia professor emeritus** who is a giant in the field. I plan to get **reference letter #3** from the professor who supervises this project.\n* **Self-directed project 2:** Last year, I collaborated with a team of professional engineers to develop a low-cost, oxygen-generating mechanical ventilator intended to address shortages caused by COVID in developing countries. Our design ranked in the top 65 of 1,029 international submissions at the Code Life Ventilator Challenge in March 2020.\n* **Internships:** I did a mechanical engineering internship three summers ago at a company specialized in large-scale HVAC retrofits. Unfortunately, the past two summers' internships were cancelled due to COVID. I filled those two summers with 4 additional courses apiece, and spent all my spare time working on Projects 1 and 2 (see above).\n* **Standardized test scores:** None. Should I take the GRE or an equivalent?\n* **External funding:** None. Any recommendations as to which grants/scholarships I should pursue? This being said, my financial situation is fortunate and is not a limiting factor in terms of paying tuition if necessary.",

      "text": "As for the ETH Zurich, i know there is something called \u201eExcellence scholarship and opportunity program\u201c, which would be huge (need to be at least in the top 10% of your bachelors). I guess you can expect similar prerequisites for being accepted at all. I have also heard that the world ranking of your university will be taken into consideration (e.g. by the QS or THE rankings). To me it does sound good and I know people have joined from smaller universities in Europe. Should it for whatever reason not work, I can also recommend to apply solely for a thesis at the end of your masters program, since you might even get some funding from the lab and the chance for a PhD position. I do wish you best of luck and recommend to just apply ;) Sometimes they make it sound harder than it actually is.",
