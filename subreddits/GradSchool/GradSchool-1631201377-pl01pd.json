I really don't want to sound like an absolute fangirl, but I would recommend it to everybody (actually that is what I do all the time so sorry...). It needs some configuration and you have to get used to it but it is a total game changer. I have to admit, that this is the lerning type that fitted me the most and it may be not for everybody like this. But I am so happy because it made my bachelor program grades good enough for my dream masters program. Now my overall score is good enough to choose freely for my PhD program. Not everything came from Anki alone I have to say. I also studied more since I started using it. However it helped me to focus on the important parts and I even remember some things from the exams to this day.
