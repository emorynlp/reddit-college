  "title:": "Want to apply to PhDs but can't understand most of the research? (mathematics / theoretical computer science)",
  "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nApologies if the same questions has been asked before. I'm based in the UK, and I've graduated last year with a masters in mathematics / computer science. I've been working for the last year, however grad school has something that I've always wanted to do, as I've really enjoyed my subjects at the undergraduate and master's level and I've found I really enjoy the research aspect of my current job. A topic I'm interested in is quantum computing and I'd like to do a PhD on it given the chance.\n\nHowever reading the research papers of prospective supervisors has been really tough for me. There's so much content out there on so many subtopics. Although once a while I can understand the ideas behind the papers, most of the times I've just been totally lost. I believe I'm not at the level yet to generate insightful ideas for further research at the PhD level. I feel like in order to really find a topic I'd do for my PhD I'll need to be focused on a narrower field and for a longer time. However, I find it difficult with my current work as well as the risk of not being able to find a supervisor wiling to take me on, even if I do find a good topic.\n\nWondering if anyone else has had similar feelings before? Any advice from current PhDs in theoretical areas? How did you overcome this, or should I take this as a sign that this type of research isn't for me?",

Do you need to put together a research proposal before you are admitted into a program? Do you have ideas for such a proposal (even if you don\u2019t understand everything that you read)?",

      "text": "If your problem is that you don't understand the formatting of the paper, you can learn that easily with the right mentor. If you don't understand the context of the paper, that's a little bit more tricky and should make you question if this is the right move for you. If you can't wrap your head around the math, then it will probably just be a needlessly frustrating experience for you. \n\nThis might be as simple as the authors/reviewers of these studies are terrible with basic communication... a lot of fields in the sciences can be like that. Unfortunately, it is something you would have to learn to adapt to so you could understand it. It's dumb, but true.",

          "text": "Thank you for the insightful breakdown, it's really helpful!\n\nI think for me, a lot of the frustration comes from the second issue - the context. For some papers, it's easy to see the potential & how they contribute to the field. However for others, it just seems all too abstract, and I'm unclear exactly what it's trying to achieve. I find this much more on the theoretical side.",

You know it is written poorly if the reader can't figure out what the point of the study is. I know there is theory for theory's sake, but I've never found that even remotely helpful to anyone.",
