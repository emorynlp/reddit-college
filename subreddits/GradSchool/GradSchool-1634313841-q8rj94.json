  "title:": "How do I apply for scholarships/financial aid if I have not yet fully committed to a single grad school?",
  "text": "I recently received acceptance to a grad school I've been interested in, but don't want to commit there just yet because I don't know what kind of money I'll be getting vs. their tuition.\n\nBut on the other hand, I don't know how to get money without already being committed to a school. I've completed my FAFSA and should be hearing back about that next week, but a lot of the scholarships I'm finding for grad students get paid directly to the school's financial officer. If I'm not committed, do I even have access to a financial officer?\n\nDoes this mean I have to give the college the enrollment fee specifically to see if they're going to give me money and if other people are going to give me money? I get that $150 may not be much when we're talking about tuition or scholarships in the thousands range, but why should I commit if I don't know whether or not I'll have enough money to go without having to sell a kidney?\n\nTL;DR - Catch 22 between not wanting to commit until I get money, but having to be committed to get money.",

      "text": "Basic info first: what country/region will you be studying in, are you a domestic student with respect to that polity, and what field?\n\nIn general, scholarships that are open to students who are not yet enrolled are perfectly aware of application timelines. They may ask where you expect to attend, but nothing is binding until after you receive the award.",
