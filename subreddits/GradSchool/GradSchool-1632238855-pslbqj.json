So I have to erase and scroll back down.  \n\nI don\u2019t think I even need to mention the Mendeley Word plugin. Just Google \u201cMendeley word plugin problem\u201d and you\u2019ll see how difficult it is to get working for some people. And even once it is working I still get popups in word telling me it can\u2019t connect.  \n\nThen today is my last straw. It won\u2019t let me erase any notes I\u2019ve written. So one typo and I can\u2019t go back and change it or add anything in other than the bottom. Drives me nuts.  \n\nSo, long story short, is there a better manager to use? Preferably one that has the same features (highlighting, notes, adding citations in Word) without the bugs. Bonus if I can somehow transfer my annotations from Mendeley to the new app :)", "author": "You_Stole_My_Hot_Dog", "created": 1632238855, "retrieved": 1632952134, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"hdtt839": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pslbqj/better_reference_manager_than_mendeley/hdtt839/", "text": "I have Zotero/Papership but I can\u2019t figure out how to Cite in text like Endnote does.
