  "text": "I\u2019m having the hardest time ever. School is so so busy. Between my house chores/cooking/cleaning, courses, work, and my thesis stuff I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019ve been stretched out thin. Somehow I\u2019ve managed to do decent these first two months but god. I feel so alone. I miss my family and my SO (they\u2019re in a different city kinda far away). They can\u2019t visit cause of covid ( I\u2019m in res) and I can\u2019t visit cause of my in person classes. \n\nWhen I\u2019m busy I\u2019m fine. I just go on about my day\u2026 go into autopilot mode and work. But the second I get a chance to think about them that\u2019s it. I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t focus on anything. \n\nIt straight up ruins a couple days for me\u2026 I go into this horrible loop where I get lonely, don\u2019t do anything cause I can\u2019t focus, feel bad about not doing anything, then feel lonelier cause there\u2019s no one to hug, be intimate with, and share my feelings with.\n\nIdk what to do anymore. My roommates are extremely introverted and are mostly in their rooms.. It\u2019s basically like I\u2019m living alone. Some days I go without even seeing them.\n\nHelp.",

While something I'd always recommend, it didn't really help me. It took some time but eventually I got into a routine and made some friends that I could make plans with which made me feel like I had people near me to share my life with. I also made time to try exploring my new city some more (hard to do with work and covid for sure). If you're new to your program, chances are others are feeling similar and that could be a good opportunity to connect.",

It helped me to start trying to carve out a more independent life, develop some routine, some habits, some objectives that connected me to the place I was and people I was around. I think thats different for each person. It'll be ok and things will get better. Be sure to keep reaching out to others",

      "text": "I'm in the same boat. Remember that we're still in a pandemic. Working from home, especially as a grad student where you're your own boss, is tough. I'm not sure about your living circumstances, but I'm in a one bedroom, so I feel like I can't \"turn off\" from work. You seem to be doing all the right things - exercise, cooking, cleaning, etc. It's hard to balance it all. My guess is you, like most of us grad students, have high expectations of ourselves, and put more pressure on ourselves than needed. Just like any other job, you're allowed to take some time off. \n\nAs for loneliness, I'd have to agree. Even in the best of times, grad school is hard because we're largely doing our own thing. I think with Covid in the mix, and social media distracting us from actually getting together in person with each other, that we've been further isolating from each other and almost have forgotten to be social. I'm very introverted, but I still feel like I'm lacking the social connection. \n\nIt sounds clich\u00e9, but try and get involved in something outside of your school/home. Soccer, a running club, a book club...anything. I find that quickly opens doors to other people and interests, and at least for me, it gets me out of my head and going down the spiral of thinking too much about school, loneliness, etc.\n\nHang in there. \"This too shall pass\" as the saying goes.",
