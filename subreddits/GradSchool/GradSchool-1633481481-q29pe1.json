  "text": "I am a senior in college. I have always been planning to go to a graduate school. And I finally figured out that I enjoy algebraic number theory, but my school does not offer that. A google search showed that Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley were at the top for algebraic number theory. I was wondering if I could get a second opinion on this or just some advice really. Thank you for reading this :)",

      "text": "Not to be a debbie downer, but you should take a good look at the AMS group rankings for schools. It doesn\u2019t matter how competitive you think you are, you should really consider applying to group 2 and group 3 schools. Math PhD programs are ungodly competitive. Michigan took in less than 20 students out of their applicant pool of over 800. I heard through the grapevine that Utah was similar.\n\nSpend some time looking through the research group pages of universities on each tier and find which ones have professors doing what you want to do. Additionally, what you\u2019re interested in now may change, so having a more broad group of research interests in the department may prove fruitful. \n\nI\u2019m in a program that I really like, and it\u2019s not near as flashy on paper as Harvard or Berkeley, but I really like it and that\u2019s what matters.",

          "text": "Yeah I asked my question for this reason. As I know I would not go through the selection process but all goes does is keep throwing is these 3 universities at me (I'll research better ,thank you). Thank you for explaining how competitive it is as in my university the math program is very small so I did not think it was that competitive. Your comment was helpful!!!",
