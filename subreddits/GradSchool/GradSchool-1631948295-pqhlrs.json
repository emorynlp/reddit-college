I have my transfer examination on Monday, and I\u2019m so nervous. You may already be familiar with the possible outcomes for this type of viva, but I can basically either pass, get a deferral decision, obtain a masters, or be asked to withdraw from the program. I\u2019m so afraid of \u201cfailing\u201d and leaving with a masters or be kicked out lol, Im ok with the other two outcomes. Also, I have a history of not sleeping like at all before important exams, so there\u2019s that as well. Fellow grad students, what can I do to feel a bit less relaxed, and not obsess over my possible \u201cfailure\u201d? Asking for a friend \n\nTL;DR: Im afraid of \u201cfailing\u201d my viva examination, how can I deal with this feeling?
