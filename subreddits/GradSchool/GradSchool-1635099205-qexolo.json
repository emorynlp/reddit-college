  "text": "Kind of a niche question here, but asking for a friend: \nStarted an MA in International Relations this past semester in a program where the first year is abroad, and the second year is domestic. There is another program within the same institution where you get the same degree and have the same coursework, but both years are domestic.\nAfter part of a semester abroad, they would rather just finish their MA domestically, so were wondering about the possibility of transferring to the domestic program after this semester.\nHas anyone heard of a similar situation or knows if this would be possible?",

I can see the department having flexibility especially if it's the same degree program without any tuition differences or class size restrictions.\n\nI'd ask whether there has been cases of transfer between the programs, whether you can pursue that option, and if they have no history whether they can consider you to transfer between the programs.",

The friend just\u2026 doesn\u2019t like being abroad and feels their mental health taking a dive because of it, to put it simply.",
