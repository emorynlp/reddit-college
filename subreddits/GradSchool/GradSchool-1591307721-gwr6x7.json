  "title:": "How do you re-ignite your interest and motivation after so much burn out and imposter syndrome?",
  "text": "I'm not going to completely hate on myself for being unproductive at this time, but at some point I feel like I need to get back to normal. I can't help but feel envious of people who are able to be productive during the pandemic (and now the protests, and... just generally anxiety-inducing events). At this point I am months behind, and can't stop kicking myself for not getting anything done. I kind of just feel tiredness and anxiety. When I finally get something done, I see a colleague or other academic who has managed to publish or find a job or a fellowship during this time, and suddenly I am no longer proud of the fact that I was able to catch up on my e-mails finally or write a conference abstract.\n\nAnd this is more than just current events getting me down, I've always felt like this. This is probably a bit silly, but I've always been super envious of people who are like Leslie Knope. She has so much energy, drive, and is always on top of things. I've tried so hard to be like that kind of person, but I don't have it in me. I'm always sort of half paying attention to my work, I don't feel like any one thing gives me that much passion, and I have no sense of organization or time management. I like my work but I'd be fine if I wasn't doing it, since there isn't really anything I love enough to HAVE to do it. And I feel like that's an abnormal outlook to have for an academic. So I am really jealous of people who care that much about something. \n\nI do keep \"to do\" lists now and am getting more productive, but it never feels like quite enough. And my drive for something is very short-term. Does anyone else feel like this? What do you do to keep powering through? Is it normal to enjoy your line of work but not LOVE it?",

One thing to keep in mind is not to be obligated to love your work as much to the point of being overwhelmed over the fear of not being recognized. I would imagine your peers have appreciate the fact in which your contributions (i.e. collaborating with a faculty member for research opportunities in relation to your academic goals.) Another thing to reigniting your interest is finding the balance between your academic work and what you love to do in your free time. I read leisurely as much as I can, but also keep your mind busy without the excess pressure as well as obtaining new skills. All of these things could better maintain your sense of control of what you do going forward and not to place emphasis over what you can\u2019t control.",

Even in times  like this, it has helped me to become productive, and trust me, the book has the ability to make you a better person if you allow it. I highly recommend this book to everyone, including my family members. Good luck.",

      "text": "I had a burnout as well, and I didn't really identify with my work at all. Writing my thesis was a real struggle, I had to force myself all the time, I was extremely slow, constantly stressed, and I sacrificed pretty much everything else in the process (there were ups and downs there, but everything else did suffer). Although I submitted before there was a lockdown here, I did spend most of my time at home.  But in the end I got it done, I submitted, I've defended recently and it went better than I'd expected. It's weird, my PhD was such an all-encompassing part of my life for so long, it took so much out of me, I had so many doubts that I'd make it... and now it's (almost) over. The point is, keep going, you can do it.\n\nThe two things that helped me the most during writing up were to \n\n1) make a plan for \"good enough\". You will never get it perfect, and you will have a chance to make corrections after the defense. Define the absolute minimum you need to do, and build up from there if you have the time. (Note: I had a hard deadline, so I knew I'd have to submit whatever I had by that day. I think that it's different in the US, isn't it? I ended up submitting what was pretty much a first draft, but by my deadline I was just so glad it was over that I didn't even care that it wasn't \"good\" - it was good *enough*.)\n\n2) I used a timer and set myself a goal of working for at least N hours a day. I started with 3 hours and built up from there (I'd pause the timer if I stopped working on my thesis for any reason, e.g. getting up to make a cup of tea or checking my email (including my uni email) - things you wouldn't really count as time off in a work environment). 3 hours may not sound like a lot, but it gave me a feasible goal and it allowed me to ignore/push off the oppressive guilt at the end of the day. With time, I moved my goal up to 5 hours, and as I got closer to my deadline I worked a lot more than that, but starting slow helped me a lot. \n\nAnother thing that helped was to do more difficult (for me) things earlier in the day and use the evenings to work on more pleasant or easier things (like improving graphs / figures / tables or whatever). This often allowed me to reach or go beyond my time goal, which made me feel more motivated and less guilty.\n\nFinally, this may seem counter-intuitive, but try not to feel guilty when you don't complete your goals for the day, or if you have a whole day off. Instead, try to understand your patterns, what triggers the not working, and try to work around your limitations, don't try to force them to disappear through will power (that will probably not work and it will just make you feel worse). Take a day at a time, start fresh each day - the minimum work time is the same every day and doesn't increase after you have a bad day to compensate. This is important to keep the guilt/anxiety under control. I only increased my minimum time when I was going over it consistently, and set myself a new goal that I was already achieving most days.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get more feedback/suggestions from other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: Focus on the goals you set for yourself and don't compare yourself to others. Everyone is different, what others seem to achieve doesn't mean anything about you. Working through a burnout is horrible, a constant battle with yourself. If you don't have a deadline that's coming up soon, try to make time for something you enjoy every day. Feeling motivated and being able to work harder for something that's not your thesis/dissertation can show to you that you *can* work hard, concentrate for longer periods, improve, etc. It's not you, it's your PhD (environment / circumstances) messing with you.",

Instead of focusing on what I still had to write/correct/read/analyse, I made an effort to look at the progress I had made instead. This didn't come easily to me at first, and it felt scary. I mean, I had to always keep in mind what I needed to do in order to get it done, right?

People who say they have been as productive or more productive are either lying or they are extremely privileged. I think that it's a normal response to not focus on your dissertation when the world is burning. Not to mention the students that are parents, the students that have been in social isolation, or the students that have lost funding due to COVID. \n\nAs far as your outlook- I think that this is also normal. While I love my work and would love a career on the tenure track, I absolutely will not give up other parts of my life in pursuit of the academy. Seeing recent graduates (who have done amazing work!) have their postdoc offers revoked due to COVID definitely has me building my cv in ways that could be applied in industry/'alt' careers. \n\nMy advice to power through would be to allow yourself a break. I have spent whole days sitting at the computer getting NOTHING done when I should have truly given myself a chance to relax. The awesome thing about breaks is that you allow your brain the opportunity to get creative. And honestly at this point, I give myself one goal each day (ie email this committee member, read this paper, write this paragraph) and then anything else is considered above and beyond what you needed to get done. Some productivity is better than none at the end of the day.",
