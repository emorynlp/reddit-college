  "text": "This isn\u2019t to be confused with \u201cI don\u2019t do my work\u201d, because I do, and in fact, I usually somehow do most of it. For example, I had a project a couple weeks ago where I wrote 8/10 pages AND edited the whole thing. One dude did like half of a page of writing. I have another group project that starts tonight and I really really really don\u2019t wanna do that again. Please share tips to not somehow get saddled with the most work?",

      "text": "You need to communicate with your groupmates. If one dude does half a page, you need to tell him to do more. If you silently take the work on yourself, other people are going to let you. Explicitly agree to who will do what, and follow up with people who aren't doing their share. There's a type of student who frequently finds themself taking on all of the work in group after group, and it's a *them* problem, not a problem with every other student they've ever been paired with.",

      "text": "Break the project up into individual tasks and make sure each task has ONE stakeholder and a due date and then as a group you heart everyone say 'i got it' and then you check in periodically and get detailed status updates until it's is all done. Can also find project management courses on Coursera for more details. If you get good enough at it then companies will pay you 6 figures to tell people what to do with out actually having to directly manage any one person or be too knowledgeable in the project.",
