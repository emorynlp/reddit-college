She didn't want us coming in not because she wanted us to take rest and feel better but to make sure \"the sickness didn't spread and infect everyone else\", so that they could continue working (till they're dead). The implication of productivity over compassion was a shock. I don't think I had ever ( even in my corporate job back home - I am from as Eastern culture) witnessed such blatant, taken-for-granted assumption of work before everything else.  \n\nFast forward to the academic year,  my cohort-mates perceived a missed class ( due to a genuine health-related reason) like they were committing a crime and disappointing the God of Attendance. I just never got it. I missed class with zero guilt when I felt like I was sick. Two years down the line, the culture of work before health has finally started to infect me too.  The thought of getting sick fills me with dread ( even with no deadlines looming), and when someone says \"I'm not feeling so well\", I have to tamp down my initial response of edging away and force myself to respond like a normal human being I used to be - with genuine compassion.
