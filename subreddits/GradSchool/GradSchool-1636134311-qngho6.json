And, of course, in conjunction with your grades person statements, research experience, and recommendations carry a lot of weight.\n\nUltimately, for a Phd you need to convince an institute you can be a good researcher. As grades do not have one-to-one correspondence with research potential, it is highly unlikely anywhere maintains a strict cutt-off of 4.0.",

And they will write about how I knew what to prioritize and sacrifice my coursework to push forward my research in the SoP.\n\nObviously getting both all As would be ideal, but that just goes to show you how much GPA is outweighed by other factors. Plus, students that get all As might not necessarily be willing to challenge themselves to learn new things and might be trying to game the system, so it weighs much less than you think.",
