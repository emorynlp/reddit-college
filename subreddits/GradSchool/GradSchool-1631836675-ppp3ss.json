Now I am waiting for the department\u2019s approval as applications for January 2022 intake has passed (I didn\u2019t know as I found the vacancy late and I didn\u2019t want to apply without meeting a supervisor). \n\nI have another supervisor meeting tomorrow for a PhD at a top UK Russell Group university, I am still attending the meeting of course. I am unsure if I should continue apply to other universities until I get confirmation letter of an offer for Calgary University. I do want to attend Calgary as I love the project and would love to travel and I don\u2019t want to get carried away and not have backup options.", "author": "fezfack", "created": 1631836675, "retrieved": 1632844193, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hd5w80u": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ppp3ss/i_got_an_offer_for_a_masters_at_a_top_uni_should/hd5w80u/", "text": "Yes, keep applying.
