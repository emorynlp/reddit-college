  "title:": "Getting a PhD to Escape Financial Hardship?",
  "text": "tl;dr: Should someone do a PhD abroad to escape hardship back home?\n\nI'm from a country that has a damaged economy thanks to cartoonish levels of government ineptitude and Covid-19. Even with a bachelor's degree, jobs are still a fantasy for people without connections. I have a friend who's actively thinking of moving to a wealthier and more stable nation in the hope of having better a chance at life. He studied telecommunication engineering and a common path that people advise is to pursue a PhD. Now, I am aware of the trade offs this will involve. This is 4 to 5 years of very hard work in what may be the best years of your life. However, the alternative seems to be sitting at home and begging for a job that may probably never come. Any advice you'd give him?",

Of course you should at least have some interest in your field of study, otherwise those few years will be hell. In my case, I went abroad for a PhD in a better country where I also get payed decently during my studies, and its fairly easy to obtain residence/stay as an immigrant afterwards.",
