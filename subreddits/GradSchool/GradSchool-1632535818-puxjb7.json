I'm currently in my first year of a PhD program. One of the grad students I worked with in my post-bacc research position asked me if they could share my CV with an undergrad student they're mentoring. I sent it to them. Now the undergrad student reached out to me and is asking if I could share my SOP with them.\n\nI'm definitely a supporter of open science and mentoring other students. My mentor shared her SOP with me when I was applying and I found it very helpful. The student is in a different field from me.\n\nHowever, I don't know this student at all. They obviously have the endorsement of my colleague. I'm also applying for the NSF and will use some of the same chunks of writing from my SOP.\n\nDo you think it''s okay to share my SOP with the student? Would you share with someone you don't know, but is obviously trusted by someone you know? Or are there any downsides?

She did, however, offer to review a draft of my SOP and gave me an outline of the structure of her SOP. \n\nI think it's really up to you. If you feel comfortable sending yours to this student, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. If you don't, I think there's a good argument to be made for not doing it. If I were in your position, I probably wouldn't share my SOP because I don't know this student. I'm not sure why they asked you rather than the grad student who's mentoring them, since they presumably know them better.
