      "text": "You don\u2019t necessarily need an undergrad in psych to go into a grad program, but you will need to have a solid base of courses. I\u2019d suggest reaching out to a college counselor to figure out what types of additional courses to take to give you your best shot of getting in somewhere. Also, to go straight to the PhD route, you\u2019ll want to get some psychology research experience and have some letter writers that are in the field. I\u2019m in the field, so feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. Best of luck.",

      "text": "Start taking additional psychology classes if you can. Look up program requirements. For clinical psych (US), you generally want to have stats, intro psych, abnormal psych, and research design courses. However, do not worry; for people without a psych major, schools may require the psych-specific GRE (or a similar exam). You\u2019ll definitely want to get psychology research while you can. You may even want to take a gap year to volunteer in a psych lab. Network as much as you can. In terms of choosing a Master\u2019s vs PhD, think about what career you\u2019d like to have, and what credentials you will need to get there. Sometimes, you just need a Master\u2019s to do some kinds of counseling. \n\nI switched careers during my 4th year of undergrad (US, engineering to psychology). I finished out my BS in engineering and stayed an additional semester to get a secondary major in psych). I had already taken a few psych classes when I made my switch. I asked around for months for open research assistant positions and joined the lab of one of my professors. Currently I am working as a post-bacc lab coordinator and plan on applying to PhD programs this cycle.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck!",
