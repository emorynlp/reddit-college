It turns out, everyone needs them.  Even highly driven budding researchers.\n\nOne of the best things I did during graduate school was unplug and decompress for a month, before my final push.  I had saved up some (admittedly not much) money, and booked a round-trip ticket to Scotland with a friend.  We backpacked around, staying in student hostels and having extremely picturesque adventures.  I completely unplugged from the work and responsibility.  My only \"concession\" to the lab was to visit a gorgeous red phone booth on a spit of land in Lochranza (Isle of Arran) and, surrounded by the orange-and-purple sunset and next to the ruins of a castle, to call my labmates back at the synchrotron and describe the trip to them.  It was a call they did not particularly appreciate, of course, but I sure did.\n\nComing back, I had new vim and excitement, and some new insights that wouldn't have been accessible before.

My advisor is not here for the whole academic year, and as a matter of fact, I have never met him in person. All I got was a \"keyword\" to search on and a vauge question to think about when I first enter the group. I spent one whole year just reading and reading and getting nowhere closer to answering that question I was being asked. Everytime I try to email my advisor to report what I am thinking/doing/reading I would basically just get back an \"OK\". But when I try to ask more specific questions to get suggestions on how to continue, I will not get a reply. Don't know if he didn't see my message or just didn't want to answer. I feel like I am doing shit that nobody cares and getting nowhere closer to graduation. I am doing a two-year research-based Master's. And at this point I just want to graduate and finish this intermediate stage of my career and no longer that care about the science.\n\nOn the other hand, I have been working with one of my undergrad professor to finish up a project I have started long ago. Even though my undergrad prof thinks that project is good enough to be used as a Master's thesis, but he has already left the university and so I can't switch my advisor to be him. I am still working hard to finish this project, but I can't help to think wtf am I doing, because even after getting this done I am still stuck in my current position.
