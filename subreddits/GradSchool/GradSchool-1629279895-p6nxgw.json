  "text": "I\u2019ve entered a \u201cquiet\u201d period on my PhD and my daily workload has been quite light the last few weeks aside from some code editing and minor admin tasks. \n\nI\u2019ve had conversations with my supervision team but my main supervisor is on annual leave for another week so there really isn\u2019t much for me to do bar reading literature and carrying on with my numerical work. I can\u2019t start the theoretical work until my main supervisor reviews the numerical calculations so I\u2019m kind of floating if that makes sense?\n\nI feel as if I\u2019m wasting my days but I\u2019m still doing things, like I feel I should be packing things in if that makes sense? I\u2019m kind of losing my motivation as a consequence.",

It sounds like you're sort of on hold due to other people and that, to me, means doing the work you can and otherwise doing life stuff - chores, hiking, art projects, catching up on TV, whatever. Also looking through relevant job boards or postdoc opportunities or professorships or info about getting an industry job post grad, all that kind of stuff. If you don't know what you're gonna do when you graduate, spend some real time considering your options. Sounds to me like this free time and you ought to take advantage of it!\n\nRest, reset, and hopefully you can rekindle some excitement in the next few weeks to get you through. Best of luck!",

Starting the writing early is what I wished I had done early in my MS and ultimately getting everything done is up to you, not your supervisor. Even if some of the writing changes, at least you have something done and can edit instead of having to write the whole thing later.",

Even highly driven budding researchers.\n\nOne of the best things I did during graduate school was unplug and decompress for a month, before my final push.  I had saved up some (admittedly not much) money, and booked a round-trip ticket to Scotland with a friend.  We backpacked around, staying in student hostels and having extremely picturesque adventures.  I completely unplugged from the work and responsibility.  My only \"concession\" to the lab was to visit a gorgeous red phone booth on a spit of land in Lochranza (Isle of Arran) and, surrounded by the orange-and-purple sunset and next to the ruins of a castle, to call my labmates back at the synchrotron and describe the trip to them.  It was a call they did not particularly appreciate, of course, but I sure did.\n\nComing back, I had new vim and excitement, and some new insights that wouldn't have been accessible before.  I also had the energy to push through for another 12.5 months and get my dissertation done.",

My advisor is not here for the whole academic year, and as a matter of fact, I have never met him in person. All I got was a \"keyword\" to search on and a vauge question to think about when I first enter the group. I spent one whole year just reading and reading and getting nowhere closer to answering that question I was being asked. Everytime I try to email my advisor to report what I am thinking/doing/reading I would basically just get back an \"OK\". But when I try to ask more specific questions to get suggestions on how to continue, I will not get a reply. Don't know if he didn't see my message or just didn't want to answer. I feel like I am doing shit that nobody cares and getting nowhere closer to graduation. I am doing a two-year research-based Master's. And at this point I just want to graduate and finish this intermediate stage of my career and no longer that care about the science.\n\nOn the other hand, I have been working with one of my undergrad professor to finish up a project I have started long ago. Even though my undergrad prof thinks that project is good enough to be used as a Master's thesis, but he has already left the university and so I can't switch my advisor to be him. I am still working hard to finish this project, but I can't help to think wtf am I doing, because even after getting this done I am still stuck in my current position. I honestly have no idea wtf am I doing and am so tired of thinking how to continue.",

                  "text": "have you tried emailing your advisor with this exact question? It sounds like you're not a priority to them right now for whatever reason and you're not making yourself visible enough to become one. Tell your advisor you would like to graduate on time (I'm sure they also want you to graduate, it looks bad if you don't) and ask what you can do to make that happen. Better yet, make a timeline yourself with your end goals in there (even if it's a made up goal you've never discussed with your advisor before) and send it to them so they have to put almost no thought into the question. If they say yes to your plan, move ahead with it, but check in with them and remind them of the plan as you get closer, so they have ample opportunity to redirect you. If they say no, ask them for specific feedback or an alternate plan. \n\nI know it's intimidating to be pushy with those who have power over you, and I too was really timid in the first couple of years of my grad program, but it did me no favors. At the end of the day, you need to look out for yourself and if your advisor isn't making you a priority or giving you direction, sometimes you need to be pushier and \"manage up\" by telling them how it will be. \n\nI hope this helps.",

(in hindsight, this was good for managing depression-adjacent thoughts)\n\nEventually, I let myself take almost a week to somewhat-leisurely go over my lab notebook (no experiments or other tasks) and review experiments from the six months or so leading up to vacation, some of which I'd completely forgotten I'd done. That jogged my memory and reminded me of all the little questions pushing my project forward, but I couldn't bring myself to do this until a couple weeks into the doldrums...\n\nPlus I had gradually mounting anxiety at my lack of productivity. I'm guessing that probably helped, too.",
