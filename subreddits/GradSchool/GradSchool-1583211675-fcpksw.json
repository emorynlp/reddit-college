  "text": "There is this little something that I want to share with prospective students in Ph.D. programs. We had the visit to our department recently and this is my fourth time being part of this event, including the one time I visited myself. So here it goes:\n\n* The kickass famous professors and the awe-inspiring brand name universities may have you enamored and that's ok, but also \\***LISTEN\\* to the current students.**  Pay attention to the very visible flags that they are putting in front of you. Rather, **ASK directly:** \"Has there been any mentorship trouble that you have faced?\" Listen to even the one student you thought was weird. You may think what happened to them will never happen to you 'coz you will be better at the program and with their adviser. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN. Who knows, that student you found weird thought the same and was not as \"weird\" before grad school happened to them!!\n* **FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT than you think!!** Yes, the stipend is not much but the university brand name is great and you will be able to pinch a little from here and there and manage, right? WRONG. Not going to happen. The deeper you are in the program, the more the burden of a tight pocket will upset you. It will most definitely hinder your research progress. If you can still choose between the uni which is set in an expensive city and therefore kind of unaffordable (but you like the idea of it and are thinking you will manage somehow) and the other one which has a slightly less cost of living... Do yourself a favor and take the financial aspects into consideration as a MAJOR factor. It will start to matter sooner than you think.\n* **Graduate student union is YOUR ONLY FRIEND in this mad journey** you are setting yourself on. Ask after it, be a part of it. Moreover, help fellow grad students and try to be there for them. In my experience, they will be there for you too. And no matter how self-sufficient you are, you WILL need them. Academia is a harsh, sometimes toxic world. Your colleagues can make it or break it for you. You can do the same for them. Yes, we should try to excel in our respective fields and we are all brilliant minds getting admissions in top universities and doing path-breaking research... But the feelings of alienation are real and they set in before you know they did. Try to build a compassionate workplace for your cohort mates. Nothing beats solidarity!! Not a thing.\n* **Pick a hobby**, invest in it the summer before you start. This is not a drill. PICK IT now. **PICK. A. HOBBY!!!!**",

The city I am in is stupid expensive and we are still struggling with two incomes and a preexisting social/family support structure. Even with the stuff I just mentioned, toxic department culture can really make things rough. \n\nMake sure you know folks who are in your current (grad program of any sort) situation, not just new professors or other friends so you can get venting/solidarity/specific emotional support. Get a hobby (honestly, supporting the college sports teams is oddly helpful if there are no pro teams because it is entertaining and part of a totally unconnected to your studies culture that is affordable) board games, running, whatever works for you. Having a pet is also very good (probably a cat because taking care of a dog is a shitload of work).",

Sometimes apparently you get lucky on the department on the university because my graduate field assistant is awesome and will go the extra mile. My research advisor is also a a great champion of making sure students are okay.  I had to a be a TA for a class with a professor that is known to be a piece of work, not only did he regularly check in on how things are going but also gave me some strategies with dealing with said professor.\nNow of course I wish the university would stop assigning that professor classes, but there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nAlso our graduate student assembly pushes through a lot of resolutions that the university listens to and most of the time makes changes that deal with protections for grad students.\nAlso if you do things outside of your PhD work you can find great mentors, who listen and give great advice even if they wouldn\u2019t advocate on your behalf, for me it\u2019s the director/coordinator of a teaching training program, I know other have found advice from our diversity program leader etc.\nCaveat: I live in a semi high cost city but get paid accordingly (can\u2019t afford a nice 1 bedroom downtowns but can live downtown with roommates or in a 1 bedroom 10-15 mins out) which definitely changes the work environment and DEFINITELY something someone should consider.  \nYou can choose a program that has a livable wage and is not so toxic.",

Conversely, I can't go back to school again any time soon (if I ever wanted to) because of my current debt from this degree, and I'm okay with that because I'm further along in my career, have a decent income already, and the degree has a decent ROI. \n\nIf I had said \"screw it\" and paid for my first grad degree because I just really wanted to do it, well, things might not be so great now. Life happened and we experienced layoffs, a mortgage, a baby, a little medical debt, and all kinds of things we could cover because we didn't have loans to worry about. That first degree was a great experience, but very very few things are worth that kind of debt.",

Same with walking. Just download a podcast and walk. I also lift weights in front of the TV so I can get out my stress from watching the news.
