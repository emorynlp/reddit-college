We had the visit to our department recently and this is my fourth time being part of this event, including the one time I visited myself. So here it goes:\n\n* The kickass famous professors and the awe-inspiring brand name universities may have you enamored and that's ok, but also \\***LISTEN\\* to the current students.**  Pay attention to the very visible flags that they are putting in front of you. Rather, **ASK directly:** \"Has there been any mentorship trouble that you have faced?\" Listen to even the one student you thought was weird. You may think what happened to them will never happen to you 'coz you will be better at the program and with their adviser. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN. Who knows, that student you found weird thought the same and was not as \"weird\" before grad school happened to them!!\n* **FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT than you think!!** Yes, the stipend is not much but the university brand name is great and you will be able to pinch a little from here and there and manage, right? WRONG. Not going to happen. The deeper you are in the program, the more the burden of a tight pocket will upset you. It will most definitely hinder your research progress. If you can still choose between the uni which is set in an expensive city and therefore kind of unaffordable (but you like the idea of it and are thinking you will manage somehow) and the other one which has a slightly less cost of living... Do yourself a favor and take the financial aspects into consideration as a MAJOR factor. It will start to matter sooner than you think.\n* **Graduate student union is YOUR ONLY FRIEND in this mad journey** you are setting yourself on. Ask after it, be a part of it. Moreover, help fellow grad students and try to be there for them. In my experience, they will be there for you too. And no matter how self-sufficient you are, you WILL need them. Academia is a harsh, sometimes toxic world. Your colleagues can make it or break it for you. You can do the same for them. Yes, we should try to excel in our respective fields and we are all brilliant minds getting admissions in top universities and doing path-breaking research... But the feelings of alienation are real and they set in before you know they did. Try to build a compassionate workplace for your cohort mates. Nothing beats solidarity!! Not a thing.\n* **Pick a hobby**, invest in it the summer before you start. This is not a drill. PICK IT now. **PICK. A. HOBBY!!!!**", "author": "chuchule21", "created": 1583211675, "retrieved": 1632845346, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 527, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fjf3xp7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fcpksw/dear_prospective_students/fjf3xp7/", "text": "I definitely have a few hobbies that I alternate between.

I had to a be a TA for a class with a professor that is known to be a piece of work, not only did he regularly check in on how things are going but also gave me some strategies with dealing with said professor.\nNow of course I wish the university would stop assigning that professor classes, but there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nAlso our graduate student assembly pushes through a lot of resolutions that the university listens to and most of the time makes changes that deal with protections for grad students.\nAlso if you do things outside of your PhD work you can find great mentors, who listen and give great advice even if they wouldn\u2019t advocate on your behalf, for me it\u2019s the director/coordinator of a teaching training program, I know other have found advice from our diversity program leader etc.\nCaveat: I live in a semi high cost city but get paid accordingly (can\u2019t afford a nice 1 bedroom downtowns but can live downtown with roommates or in a 1 bedroom 10-15 mins out) which definitely changes the work environment and DEFINITELY something someone should consider.  \nYou can choose a program that has a livable wage and is not so toxic.", "author": "RaddishEater666", "created": 1583232334, "upvotes": 34}, "fjcq2ct": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fcpksw/dear_prospective_students/fjcq2ct/", "text": "> Pick a hobby, invest in it the summer before you start.
