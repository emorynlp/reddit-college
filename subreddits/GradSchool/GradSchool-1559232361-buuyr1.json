I, like many others, am happy I did not. Most of the rest of your post though is totally true. What I would say though is that you delay much of the start of your adult life by doing a postgraduate degree: you don't start moving up a career ladder for a start, saving money for a home and in terms of personal relationships it can be difficult to plan for a future when things are so uncertain.
