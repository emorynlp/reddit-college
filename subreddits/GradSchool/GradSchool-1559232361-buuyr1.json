  "title:": "Trying to decide if you should take that year off before grad school or not? Well to put it simply I have yet to meet anyone who regretted taking a year off prior to starting grad school, but I have meet a lot of people that regret NOT taking a year off.",
  "text": "I took a year off and highly recommend it, it helped me relax, enjoy life SAVE SOME MONEY, and most importantly it made me have no doubts that I wanted/needed to go to gradschool. going into the work force made me very aware that i loved research and learning as well as saving a couple of 1000 dollars that i have found very useful. this year off gave me perspective on why I am in the field I am in, and every time I start to feel stressed and jealous of my friends with normal jobs, I can remember how empty i felt away from doing research, it helps me stay motivated and prevent burn out.  \n\nAnywho, thats my two cents, if you are even considering taking a year off i would recommend it, it helps focus you and makes you realize if yopu actually want or need an advanced degree.",

I am already in the \"student mode\" and I am quite comfortable this way right now even though I am at an internship this summer. If I were to get a job for a year or two I believe I would lose that \"student mode.\" \n\nMost of my friends back home didn't go to college and are still working as though they are in high school because they didn't continue their education immediately. I feel as though I would fall into the same trap. All of my advisers and friends within my major of anthropology are going into grad school right away. \n\nI think the Summer between undergrad and grad school is the perfect amount of time and space to relax and improve your skills. Taking a year or two can be detrimental as life may get in the way and it is very difficult to return to school at an older age.",

      "text": "I had to take two separate gap years for medical reasons during my accelerated undergraduate degree, after which I went straight into Masters, and then because I took my time to apply, a 7 month break before starting PhD. But irregardless of my worry that I wanted to get into a doctoral program early and finish before I became 30, it turns out those 7 months were necessary to get my health back and to put things into perspective, to handle my mistakes and improve myself and to just relax and unwind a bit by the beach, gardening, traveling and just being a screen potato. Baking is highly therapeutic for grad students but it\u2019s not like we get to do a lot of it. \n\nIt all depends on your perspective, do you want to finish off your BEng/BSc, MSc, and PhD in one 6 - 10 year stretch of \u201ceducation, research and work\u201d, or do you want to take a gap year or couple more off to travel, work, join the corporate world or the industry, focus on yourself, take a vacation etc. and have your end point be 12 - 15 years later?",

Unfortunately during my senior year when I spent some time studying abroad in London, my cohort there was very mean to me and would say I had no political future, so I gave up that dream. I nannied for a year to save money and then had plans to go to a different school for a master\u2019s in public policy. After talking with some friends, I decided against it and decided to try and find a job instead so I could keep paying down my loans. One night I was at a networking thing and there was a table about teaching English in Israel. I had been there the previous summer on a Birthright trip, so after a few months of soul searching, I decided to go for it. I taught English in Israel for a year, became determined to do Israel advocacy, nannied and babysat for five-and-a-half years and paid off my bachelor\u2019s degree by age 27. I started my master\u2019s degree that same year in Communication: Public Relations and Advertising. By age 28, I had enough money for school, no loans to deal with, a good living situation and knew what I wanted to do. Six years out from undergrad was hard, but was right for me. It definitely helped me with my 4.0 GPA as well. :)",

There are all sorts of reasons, but for us it's simply years of accumulating evidence that students who hold off *even a year* tend to make different choices about graduate school and tend to be happier/more successful once they do start. I only took a year off myself (way back when) and I wish I had taken more. There is no really compelling reason to rush through, and plenty of evidence (at least anecdotal evidence, I'm not aware of general studies) that show better results among those who take a break to do something else.\n\nFor me, really, the kicker is that a large percentage of my former students who came to me talking about graduate school as juniors/seniors eventually ended up going in a different direction-- and many have come back over the years and thanked me (and my colleagues) for encouraging them to take a break. It's insane that we, as a society, expect 17-year-olds to \"know what they are going to do with their lives\" and force them to declare majors before they even start college. Pushing 22-year-olds into grad school is really not that much different; given time to grow, explore, mature, and gain perspective a good many will make different decisions about what to study, where to go, and how to make that happen.

But then I began to realize everyone goes at their own pace, and grad school will always be there. It was well worth it to be able to take the GRE and go through the application process without also focusing on school. I got to work in a lab during that time and it just reinforced my decision to go into research, plus it gave me a ton of experience that was really valuable in my applications.\n\nI encourage everyone I know planning to apply to grad school to consider taking a year off. There are plenty of people that can easily transition right away, and that's great, but I personally have not regretted taking that gap year for one moment. My life is exactly where it needs to be.",

But I've kind of just jumped on opportunities as they came up, and pursued them to better myself without really thinking if I *wanted* to be doing them per se.  I'm also really indecisive, and so given the opportunity to get a grad degree, I was never 100% certain about it, and could've easily spend years agonizing over the decision and risk never going if I didn't resolve to just go for it and try my best. Even if I enrolled in a program and dropped out, I'd be happy I at least made an informed choice and tried my best to see it through. I suspect a lot of people are like me, so I guess it depends on the person/program/field.  how long did you wait?",

That's a perfectly valid path through life. There are many wonderful things about the opportunities that arise with a doctorate (and many ways it can also limit choices in some ways), but a lot of them are intangible and have to do with more nebulous reasons like autonomy.  I went through quickly for the life sciences, but I still spent 5.5 years making a graduate stipend and 2.5 years being paid a postdoc salary and I currently make a little over 80K.  If I didn't have a reason beyond money to do what I do I would do something else.  Most graduate students who are not motivated enough to make their way back to graduate school after a break are going through graduate school as a default path rather than realizing the pros and cons of their decision and doing graduate school because it's really worth it.\n\nI'm speaking as someone who is now a tenure track assistant professor--and happy with my choices in life--but see graduate school aimlessness from the other side now.",

It might delay completion of my PhD, but that\u2019s better than, say, being passed over for a job/promotion because you\u2019re pregnant, or failing to get tenure because you didn\u2019t publish enough while having kids, etc. \n\nI also know a few women who had children before their PhD, during their \u201cbreak.\u201d If you have a partner and want kids before or during grad school, I think that\u2019s better than waiting. The career clock *really* starts ticking once you have your PhD. Any delay in reaching that next step after grad school looks bad. \n\nAll of that to say that taking a break should not impact when you start a family, not unless you\u2019re waiting until you\u2019re done with the career grinding, which is a bad idea regardless of whether you take a break or not imo.",

Now we're 50+ and still have teens at home, but it's great-- we have money, time, and other resources to devote to them that we would not have had in our 20s-30s.

And they spent a lot of money to get those two children via fertility treatments. I am aware that plenty of people do it, I'm simply saying that I personally do not think it's a good idea. I'd rather have a short-term struggle as a late-20s graduate student with a child, then end up an old parent who might not be mentally or physically able to enjoy my kids' development into adults with families. \n\nBeyond being an old parent, it isn't a safe bet that fertility treatments will work. The success of IVF decreases steeply after 35. And for men, the risk of certain developmental disorders increase with the age of the father. So I think it is unwise (specifically in academia, when many people aren't done with the tenure marathon until their late 30s at the *very* earliest) to put of having a child until you're fully settled in your career.\n\nI'll also add that adoption in the US is very difficult and even more expensive and time-consuming than IVF. It is possible, of course, but I would not say \"I'll just wait and if I can't have kids, I'll adopt.\" It isn't that simple. Take a gander over to /r/infertility if you don't believe me. \n\nLast thing is that, for all of the older professors with young children, there are plenty of graduate students and postdocs with kids. And none of the ones I know are even close to struggling to finish. Of course, it is more difficult with children than without children, but I personally feel that difficulty is worth it if you want a family. But finishing a PhD program and having a child is far, FAR from being impossible or unlikely. \n\nI would personally rather take that struggle than end up 40+, struggling to have a child, and sad that I put off having kids while I was younger.

I\u2019m sure you realize how important it is to \u201cpublish or perish\u201d in your junior career, and that clock starts ticking as soon as you finish your PhD. There is simply not that level of pressure (career-wise) as a graduate student. A lag in production matters way more as a junior faculty member who is trying to get tenure. \n\nAnd considering that these days people are doing 2-3 postdocs before landing a faculty position, that means having your first child in your late thirties (which has a lower chance of success and a higher probability of complications, regardless of anecdotes), and what if you\u2019d like multiple children? Well, unless you\u2019re banging them out one after the other (which is, again, terrible for your career if you\u2019re a woman), you can kiss that idea goodbye.",

It's really impossible to generalize across all fields, institutions, and circumstances in any case. In my field, for example, postdocs are uncommon and most new junior faculty are 30-32. Because we tend to do extended travel for archival research-- often abroad --it's really very hard to have kids and be a full-time graduate student (unless your research is done).

There are a lot of degrees that aren\u2019t particularly marketable at the bachelor level, and there\u2019s also a limited number of jobs that pay more than a graduate stipend and would willingly hire an employee that is going to quit in a year. Of course this is going to depend on the field\u2014 if you\u2019re in an industry where you\u2019re already going to be making 40-50K without grad school, and you have a job offer before you graduate, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it.

I'm just saying if it takes 6 months to get a job, is it worth working there for only another 6 months before leaving to go back to school? You might even end up burning some bridges if you do that.  I'm sure you could get *something* and make *some* money, but if you're not making a lot of money, and it's not related to your field, it's not advancing your career. And even if you start looking months before you graduate, it's not guaranteed you're going to line something up. Obviously its a different story if you need experience to boost an application to get in to grad school in the first place.",

You're probably better off having a job even in a random field if you don't know what you're doing, what your plans are, you're unsure about what you want a career to be. Theres nothing wrong w taking a break from school before going back whether it's in your field or not. If anything, you'll learn quickly what you want to study and work on getting back in with a solid goal in mind. Or realize you don't want to go back to school at all and are content with whatever else you decide to pursue. \n\nEven if you do know you're set on a career path...you mature in the real world anyways. \n\nSo there's a perspective",
