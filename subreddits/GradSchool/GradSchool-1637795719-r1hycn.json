  "text": "I'm from this Latin American country ~~El Salvador~~ and I'm about to finish my undergraduate. I really want to get a Ph.D. though I still don't know where. I suppose I would just go to the one university in any developed country that offers a full scholarship and is willing to accept this student. But a bigger problem is that the ones I've seen so far only accept people to Ph.D. programs if they have a master's first. I know a master's is not a necessary step but it does seem to be necessary for scholarships. Is this the norm? Or have I just been unlucky finding one that suits me? Where should I look for?",

      "text": "I\u2019m from Canada and a masters is pretty much required for PhD programs unless you have a really high GPA. This being said, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone who did straight to PhD there. We do have programs that may offer a \u201ctransfer to PhD\u201d option where you complete an exam in your second year. If you pass, you\u2019re in PhD stream (with no masters). If you don\u2019t, you finish your masters. This may also change depending on your program. If you\u2019re in a research-based program, you get paid a stipend. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think new international students qualify for Canadian scholarships (which end up replacing your stipend / can be more money) or at least the ones I\u2019m familiar with. I could be wrong.",

      "text": "It might be too late to apply for US PhD programs that begin in fall 2022, since most deadlines are December 1 or mid-December. This gives you a lot of time though to research PhD programs that will accept you without a Masters degree and fully fund you. \n\nStart by looking at the department websites for a handful of programs that are good in your field, read up on their application requirements, faculty, and the financial aid package they offer. You might have better luck on the money side of things at private schools, but there are certainly excellent graduate programs at public schools too. (for example, the University of Texas in Austin is a public school, while Rice University is private. Both have stellar PhD programs across several fields.)",

At mine, you just need to take more courses than the people who already have a masters degree. Perhaps it may be dependent on the fields and countries that you're currently looking at?",
