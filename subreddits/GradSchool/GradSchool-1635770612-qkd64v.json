A PhD in any type of psychology would allow you to pursue a career in research or academia. Clinical or counseling psych would allow you to do therapy, assessments, and work in a variety of settings like schools, hospitals, private practice, etc. There are a lot of different types of graduate degrees in psychology and a lot of different things you could do with it, so I agree with some of these other comments - a good place to start would be talking to your undergrad advisor about it.",
