Decided that medical school wasn\u2019t for me (lifestyle and time in school), however, I don\u2019t have any internships or industry experience at all in the tech industry.\n\n**My main goal is to fill the holes in my CS foundation that my minor did not catch and start my career as an SWE as soon as possible. I am not too interested in working in research in a master's program though.**\n\nI keep hearing on here that recruiters don\u2019t care if you have an online degree but when I talk to tech friends and family in the Bay Area, many of them urge me to go for the in-person degree which is both, more expensive and usually longer.\n\nAfter talking to my tech friends and looking at other posts on this sub, it seems like a bootcamp is also not really a good option for those that want to switch into tech since most don't guarantee a job and there are already a bunch of bootcamp grads.\n\nI got accepted into [r/OMSCS](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/) last fall but decided to defer my admission and try to figure out whether I really need to do a masters program for 1-2 years or if I could try to get a job through self-teaching or attending a bootcamp.\n\nI feel like I have the foundation to self-teach full-stack development or iOS development but would doing a bootcamp help me more in terms of giving me guidance and giving me access to a cohort and network which could potentially get me a job in a quicker amount of time? If so, is the price tag worth it and which are the best bootcamps to apply for?\n\n**TLDR: Premed student with some CS coursework wondering if a bootcamp is the best bet for me in terms of getting a SWE job or if going for masters (online/in-person) is better. The last option is to simply self-teach myself the skills until the end of the year. Any advice would be appreciated! :)**", "author": "iamthat1dude", "created": 1631561357, "retrieved": 1632952650, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hcr473a": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnminh/premed_graduate_is_an_online_masters_in_cs_right/hcr473a/", "text": "An online MS CS makes the most sense for people who already have a good position in the field who are looking for that credential and/or fill out some remaining knowledge gaps. That doesn't describe you. \n\nEspecially since you already have decent coursework in CS and the foundations to teach yourself more, the decision to going back to school (or pursue some other alternative) shouldn't be based primarily on knowledge acquisition. Instead, focus on what it will actually take for you to land the job you want. In general, the biggest benefit that in-person programs maintain over online programs is networking opportunities and, through that, job prospects.", "author": "aggressive-teaspoon", "created": 1631575114, "upvotes": 4}}}
