  "text": "I'm asking because I applied to a program last year that I now realize I had no business applying to, and I got rejected. I have decided to pursue a different program that I'm much more suited to, and I would like to apply at the school that rejected me (in addition to others). I also would be having one of my letter writers that I used for the previous program write me a recommendation for this new program, so I'm wondering if that would look weird if a blanket admissions committee is looking at it, or if the applications just go straight to the various departments.",

That you have the required GRE or other test scores and that you have the minimum GPA. If you meet those requirements they just send your app along to the department",
