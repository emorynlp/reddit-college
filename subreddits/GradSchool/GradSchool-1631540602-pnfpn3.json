  "text": "I screwed up my MS when I started last fall. I moved halfway across the country to start this, thought this would be everything I ever wanted, got here and immediately faceplanted.\n\n- I completely underestimated how badly covid restrictions would affect me. I lived alone, didn't know anyone b/c the orientations were online, and sorely needed friends.\n\n- My personal life was already precarious. I did not have a strong social support system when I got here, so when I started to face challenges I had no one to talk to. \n\n- I have a list of mental health concerns that I knew I wasn't handling well, but since I've had problems since I was 14 or so, I figured 'so what if I'm in grad school? Just another job.'\n\n- I didn't take seriously the fact that I was so unhappy at my last job. All I wanted was to get out of my dead end job. I never considered that it may have been because I was unhappy, period. I thought it was the job, not me. \n\n- I have been avoiding my advisor, my peers, basically anyone who could ask me about my project because I'm ashamed of myself.\n\n- I feel like I've lost sight of why I'm here in the first place and I'm burnt out. \n\n- I feel like there's no easy way to catch up on all the work I didn't do because I was dealing with depression this whole time. \n\n- My advisor already warned me once that I could lose my job if I don't get my act together, and then retracted it saying 'sorry I was an ass when I said that,' although he was just doing his job.\n\n- I feel terrible because I really wanted this position, it's fully funded, my stipend is great, and my advisor still somehow believes in me.\n\n- If I quit, I will be losing a lot in the process. I only have a bachelor's degree and a half-finished masters won't look good. My advisor will have to explain to the funding org why I quit. I'll probably lose the social ties with people in my program.\n\n- I met my soon to be fiance while out here, so there is something good that came out of coming here. I also learned a lot about myself and other people, not to mention about science.\n\n- Still, finding a job will be tough, and working a job I dislike even tougher. \n\n- I don't know what I want to do now, I'm feeling uncertain. I'm seeking a way to build community and to belong to something because I've never had that. I already quit one career path because I didn't have that and I got burnt out. I don't know if science is for me. I'm smart and passionate, but without a secure feeling of belonging, I lose focus and motivation instantly and things go south, fast.",

      "text": "I think you should try to power through - if you can. You've come a long way and we often make mountains out of molehills for the remaining work to be done. I recommend something like this:\n\nFirst, make a list of all the discrete tasks that you ignored. Not like \"do analysis\", but all the tiny parts of that. Then, make a list of what you think needs to be done in the next semester. Organize these tasks into a Gantt chart or caldendar. Have a meeting with your supervisor, who sounds very reasonable, and discuss your plan with him. Having a plan, support and a list of tasks will probably be really motivating. I'm realizing I should do this as I finish my own dissertation tbh. \n\nYou write very well and are clearly talented - try to power through and find a job that will give you life.",

          "text": "This was an inspiring message -- I realized I can respond to people like this, too. \n\nThis ended up being a great day for me. After I wrote this post, I decided I had to find a way to go to class and be productive even if I didn't feel like it. But as one does, I looked up videos on depression on youtube (lol). I found one ted talk with this older lady who gave some older lady advice that went along the lines of, \"depression is what you may feel when you fold, or you give up and you don't get what you want. You end up feeling like there is no way out. When you're experiencing depression it shrouds your ability to think clearly and think of creative solutions.\" I think it helped me a lot to clarify for myself that there are obviously solutions to this problem as you said, but that the depressive state makes those solutions appear invisible. \n\nThen I watched a Joe Rogan short, which.... I don't usually go for Rogan clips, but anyways. Joe was discussing the 'meaning of life' question with his guest, and his guest explained that the question is a great example of Agrippa's trilemma where there are only three possible answers to such a question -- circular reasoning, infinite regression or an axiom. When he said that I was like, \"that is depression in a nutshell.\" I think when I get depressed, it's when I start obsessing over things that have no answer, such as \"what is my purpose in life/science?\" That starts to become overwhelming, and I typically start to make mountains out of molehills. Then I freeze up and I can't do anything anymore, like work. \n\nSo, putting these two thoughts together, I realized I could just go to work and that I was ok -- like you said, I just needed to plan and then execute and *not dwell on existential questions* because the statements, by definition, lack justification (or at least adequate support). \n\nMy advisor and I had a meeting after my class and he told me to plan things out. I already knew I needed that, but he reassured me. I think he realized at some point during our few (but pretty honest) discussions that he needed to be a little more patient and supportive with me. I do appreciate tough love, but right now I think I just needed support, and I got that and was really glad. I think he's adapting to the circumstance he's given like I am. \n\nI will definitely try using a Gantt chart! I didn't know they were a thing, but they look useful! \n\nThanks for the comment on my writing. That's funny, I've been told a lot that I write well, but I see my shortcomings so I'm always answering that with \"nah, not really.\" But after grading a lot of undergrad homework, I realized it's true. XD \n\nI realized after grading today that science is so important and worth pursuing and learning more about. These kids are all giving me answers to a question asking why antibiotic resistance is relevant that goes along the lines of, \"well, think of covid for example -- masks and sanitation makes microevolution even worse, and now we have delta!\" I was like, \"wow.... these kids really need help, lol, and I can help them. I wasn't this turned around when I was their age, but I can see what's going wrong here in their learning. I care about these kids.\" I think sometimes if you can, you should, because the should part could become the answer to why it's worth it. \"Because I can\" could be the answer to \"how do I help,\" and I think that might be the creative solution to \"why do I exist.\"",

I totally relate to the idea of constantly zooming-out on life and thinking \"Is my work really fundamental, what am I doing, etc.\" It's ultimately not super productive as you see now! Honestly, congrats on deciding to power through. \n\nThe one thing I feel obligated to add because I looked at your profile quickly , is that teaching is really gratifying, but a lot of science is not teaching. If you do a PhD, it will be mainly focused on research - and you will at times probably feel the way you did in the OP. It's a bit lonely, pretty hard, and just overall frustrating. I say this as a PhD student who will probably leave academia behind. There are a ton of great jobs in research that you can do with an MS! In fact, I am applying for them with a PhD (sob).",

I really feel for you and I\u2019m sure you know there\u2019s no easy answer that will fix all your problems.\n\nI know that I got a lot out of participating in my department\u2019s graduate student society. Even now those of us that still live in town get together for drinks a couple times a month (I graduated a couple years ago). I know every department is different and every cohort of students is different too when it comes to the culture around socializing so that might not be an option for you.\n\nGood luck out there on whatever you decide to do :)",
