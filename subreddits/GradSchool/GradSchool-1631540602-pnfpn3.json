I moved halfway across the country to start this, thought this would be everything I ever wanted, got here and immediately faceplanted.\n\n- I completely underestimated how badly covid restrictions would affect me. I lived alone, didn't know anyone b/c the orientations were online, and sorely needed friends.\n\n- My personal life was already precarious. I did not have a strong social support system when I got here, so when I started to face challenges I had no one to talk to. \n\n- I have a list of mental health concerns that I knew I wasn't handling well, but since I've had problems since I was 14 or so, I figured 'so what if I'm in grad school? Just another job.'\n\n- I didn't take seriously the fact that I was so unhappy at my last job. All I wanted was to get out of my dead end job. I never considered that it may have been because I was unhappy, period. I thought it was the job, not me. \n\n- I have been avoiding my advisor, my peers, basically anyone who could ask me about my project because I'm ashamed of myself.\n\n- I feel like I've lost sight of why I'm here in the first place and I'm burnt out. \n\n- I feel like there's no easy way to catch up on all the work I didn't do because I was dealing with depression this whole time. \n\n- My advisor already warned me once that I could lose my job if I don't get my act together, and then retracted it saying 'sorry I was an ass when I said that,' although he was just doing his job.\n\n- I feel terrible because I really wanted this position, it's fully funded, my stipend is great, and my advisor still somehow believes in me.\n\n- If I quit, I will be losing a lot in the process. I only have a bachelor's degree and a half-finished masters won't look good. My advisor will have to explain to the funding org why I quit. I'll probably lose the social ties with people in my program.\n\n- I met my soon to be fiance while out here, so there is something good that came out of coming here. I also learned a lot about myself and other people, not to mention about science.\n\n- Still, finding a job will be tough, and working a job I dislike even tougher. \n\n- I don't know what I want to do now, I'm feeling uncertain. I'm seeking a way to build community and to belong to something because I've never had that. I already quit one career path because I didn't have that and I got burnt out. I don't know if science is for me. I'm smart and passionate, but without a secure feeling of belonging, I lose focus and motivation instantly and things go south, fast.", "author": "TypeOfPlant", "created": 1631540602, "retrieved": 1632952654, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hcrkgei": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnfpn3/wondering_if_i_should_quit_weighing_the_options/hcrkgei/", "text": "I think you should try to power through - if you can. You've come a long way and we often make mountains out of molehills for the remaining work to be done. I recommend something like this:\n\nFirst, make a list of all the discrete tasks that you ignored. Not like \"do analysis\", but all the tiny parts of that. Then, make a list of what you think needs to be done in the next semester. Organize these tasks into a Gantt chart or caldendar. Have a meeting with your supervisor, who sounds very reasonable, and discuss your plan with him. Having a plan, support and a list of tasks will probably be really motivating. I'm realizing I should do this as I finish my own dissertation tbh. \n\nYou write very well and are clearly talented - try to power through and find a job that will give you life.", "author": "namenamename0", "created": 1631582639, "upvotes": 1}, "hcpgrbe": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnfpn3/wondering_if_i_should_quit_weighing_the_options/hcpgrbe/", "text": "Have you tried working on these issues with a therapist?", "author": "PalatableNourishment", "created": 1631550199, "upvotes": 2}}}
