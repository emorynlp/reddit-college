It doesn't help that my English skills are slowly deteriorating because I don't live in an English speaking country anymore--I always struggle to find words now and just use the most basic word possible and it's usually one that doesn't really encompass the nuance I'm trying to communicate (even that sentence sounded weird). My writing process doesn't help either because I never write papers on the internet, all of my work is handwritten first and then I type it up on the laptop (really inconvenient but I cannot help it). If I write a paper though sometimes it sounds so good that I'm really impressed with myself but after reading some online discussions that I have with people sometimes I say to myself, \"b\\*tch wtf were you talking about?\"", "author": "TarquinOliverNimrod", "created": 1587844188, "retrieved": 1632953884, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 383, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fomlvj0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/g801gl/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_articulate/fomlvj0/", "text": "I\u2019m just totally incomprehensible", "author": "HulioJohnson", "created": 1587894980, "upvotes": 1}, "fomfjgv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/g801gl/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_articulate/fomfjgv/", "text": "Yes.
