  "text": "Sometimes I re-read the things I write, usually involving comments or online debates where I don't normally tend to think about what I write before writing it and although what I'm saying is comprehensible I still feel like I sound like an idiot sometimes (not like Tr\\*mp level but definitely less than I'm capable of lmao). It doesn't help that my English skills are slowly deteriorating because I don't live in an English speaking country anymore--I always struggle to find words now and just use the most basic word possible and it's usually one that doesn't really encompass the nuance I'm trying to communicate (even that sentence sounded weird). My writing process doesn't help either because I never write papers on the internet, all of my work is handwritten first and then I type it up on the laptop (really inconvenient but I cannot help it). If I write a paper though sometimes it sounds so good that I'm really impressed with myself but after reading some online discussions that I have with people sometimes I say to myself, \"b\\*tch wtf were you talking about?\"",

      "text": "Yes. I was thinking this the other day. I am literal days away from my MAT-TESOL, and I had submitted a video of myself teaching my students, which had a live crit with my prof, and a few from my cohort. Of course, the prof mentions the discussion sounds \u201ccasual\u201d and maybe I should think about weaving some academic conversation activities into my lessons.. \n\nThen it hit me as I was writing my presentation on this very critique.. this is just me. I have the language, but I am just a very casual person. I don\u2019t just pull these academic words out.. and sometimes I just don\u2019t remember them at all. I know the concepts but I have to like describe them in more laymen\u2019s terms instead. Others in my cohort seem to be able to just sling these words around, they know all the definitions and these things come so easily.. I swear sometimes I feel like there are some things that are just lost on me.\n\nI\u2019m also not generally as \u201celoquent\u201d when speaking as others or at least I don\u2019t think so.",

One of my biggest criticisms of anthropology is the over intellectualism and overuse of academic jargon, especially as it relates to how we articulate ourselves verbally. To be honest nothing annoys me more than when certain classmates feel the need to overuse academic language when we have classroom discussions, it\u2019s not authentic to me. It sort of comes off as an attempt to present more intellectual than you are. I find it more impressive if you can articulate these very complex ideas and theories into language that\u2019s more accessible to the general public. This is why the field is so inaccessible to be honest and why a lot of people aren\u2019t studying it. if the field wants to be more popular and more accessible we have to start with the language we use in it.",

              "text": "I definitely have to agree with you on a lot of your points. I\u2019ve found that through the past 2 years I\u2019ve felt a lot of things, 1 being: I\u2019m not smart enough for this, and that is because a lot of the people are exactly the ones you speak about. The ones who just over saturate with academic jargon. It\u2019s insane to me. I think we all know this language to some degree, but I also think it\u2019s important to be able to just talk about it like normal people. When someone asks what I do I\u2019m not just going throw out huge words that I need to deeply explain. To be honest, I walked into a job interview a few weeks ago and used some of these terms (TESOL educators are usually of varying education levels,\nI\u2019m not saying this to sound like an ass, some have bachelors degrees in anything + certifications, random hav PhDs, some have a masters) and I ended up having to explain a lot, and just kind of decided that from now on, I probably needed to use layman\u2019s terms from now on. Needless to say, I did not get the job. It was super awkward on so many levels. \n\nI think it also has to do with your personality, some of us (myself) are really laid back, and I think that contributes to how we use language. If I know the use of academic language is important, say for a presentation, I need to specifically prepare for it. Otherwise, I\u2019m very casual.\n\nSide note: your theory of why you think anthropology is inaccessible makes me quite sad. Anthropology was actually a little chunk of my masters. I really enjoyed it, but it was a LOT to process on top of language acquisition, and learning theory etc etc, I think we have a lot of work to do to make academics more accessible to more people.",

It\u2019s insane to me.\n\nActually I have the opposite of this. The ones who tend to oversaturate are the ones who I believe to be the most insecure regarding their ability. I don't know, after getting my undergrad in Sociology and now my MSc in Anthro, I've definitely learned that the ability to use academic jargon is a skill, but is one that is certainly not reflective of the users intellect. The people who I am most envious of are those who can verbally articulate in a seamless way that sounds like it rolled off the tongue and they tend to be more accessible. I'm not the worst at articulating verbally but I'm certainly not at my best. I tend to have brain farts a lot and also struggle to find the correct word often as well. When I'm writing the process is far more reflective and gives me the time to find words that I may be lost on. I think once you transition to the workplace and aren't in an academic setting, you have to keep in mind that most people aren't at our level so it definitely works in your favor to speak in a way that's accessible. \n\n>Anthropology was actually a little chunk of my masters.

They overlap often but anthropology is far more complex when you add in the ethnographical aspect (I HATE!!). There have been times where I've read ethnographies and didn't understand SHIT. I refused to write a review or make notes on it because it was so inaccessible to me. It already doesn't help that you take 1 million breaks in a 20 page article to look up words in the dictionary. It's a necessary field of study but I think it needs to be modernized very soon or else it will eventually die out.",

I sat with a student for 15 weeks, wrote the paper but felt like I had NO IDEA what I even wrote. Also agree it\u2019s absolutely necessary, and needs to be modernized, I actually had no idea what it even was when it was introduced. \n\nYou are probably right about those who oversaturate, I never thought about it that way. \nAre you me? I am definitely a word stumbler, and it makes me feel stupid?? But once I get my thoughts together I can just discuss the topic in a way that is easy to understand for basically anyone.  The big advantage for me when writing is that I can easily pull out books and other resources to put the academic term to my non-academic language. You can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re in a live discussion. \n\nI just watched this interesting video about ways to teach academic conversations, and I think it was something that we kind of missed out on in our time in school. It\u2019s becoming more popular, we got to university and it was just kind of expected that we knew how to do it, but it\u2019s something that needs to be explicitly taught.",
