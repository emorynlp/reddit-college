One is a pure science position in soil science, biogeochemistry, and greenhouse gas emissions at a state school, and the research topic is one that I love. Its a lab work and modelling job, two things I could use in my skillset as a scientist. My MS is based on irrigation management, but I have been really wanting to focus more on soil science for a while now, so this is the perfect opportunity to do so and become an expert.\n\nThe second offer is kind of a hybrid position in agricultural research science and global development policy at an Ivy League, where I would be doing international field work that as I understand it is partially ag research science and partially almost anthropological/extension like- getting to know local practices and challenges to inform the research and explored solutions. The end goal is science with the ability to inform policy in resource management, food security, economic security, etc based on agricultural improvements. This would be new to me and is frankly a little intimidating, but I am extremely motivated when it comes to discovering improved management techniques, so this seems like a shortcut to doing exactly that.\n\nMy goal, eventually, is to work in public policy as a science expert- I especially want to shape agricultural management and regulation toward improved climate change resilience and mitigation. Bonus points if I would be working directly for progressive think tank or politician rather than a position where I would be expected to affect a nonpartisan appearance. I initially expected to study soil science, become an area expert, work in extension for a bit to develop some adult education experience, and then move into policy as a science PhD. I love soil science and believe it is hugely relevant to this kind of work, but I also dont want to be a lonely scientist whose work is ignored and never affects change.\n\nI don't exactly know what the domestic public policy landscape looks like and what the best path is to get there. I also very much want to be a science expert, not a pure policy person. To anyone who knows this space better than I do, would it be more advantageous to be a pure soil science and GHG expert, or someone with a hybrid of research science and policy experience? Also if my goals change in the future, would it be easier to move into policy after a research science PhD, or to do research science as the hybrid PhD? Also worth asking is how much weight an Ivy degree carries in that world. I know it shouldnt and the elitism is stupid, but if it helps me create change that's worth something to me. \n\nThanks in advance, and lmk if I'm failing to consider any important details!", "author": "crushendo", "created": 1631810057, "retrieved": 1632952559, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hd3pxkl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ppgsip/should_i_do_my_phd_in_pure_science_or/hd3pxkl/", "text": "If you are sure you want to go into science policy (i.e. you're not going to change your mind half way and decide you want to go into academia), definitely go with the hybrid position. There is an incredibly high premium on policymakers with interdisciplinary backgrounds, especially in the environment/climate world. Also, as far as the prestige of the school, it's a generally accepted wisdom that for your PhD the school doesn't matter as much as your PI/lab (but in the case of an Ivy, you will almost certainly be working with a good PI). \n\nIt's also a good idea to talk to your current advisor and see what they have to say. Good luck with your decision.", "author": "CooperSly", "created": 1631813177, "upvotes": 4}}}
