  "title:": "Strategies for doing Literature Survey and finding central articles/journals/books in your field?",
  "text": "I am tasked with a seemingly impregnable problem of finding \"central\" artifacts (papers/books/articles) for 10-15 really niche topics. Right now my strategy is to try and find survey papers (without any luck) and go through each of the references in those papers, check them in google scholar, see if they are \"central\" i.e. cited more than, say, 100 times. In addition, I also have to find out what they are usually cited for.\n\nThis is a mind-numbingly mundane and tedious task and I can't help but think that there is a better/automated way for this. If you could point me to the path of light, however bleak it may be, I would be immensely grateful.",
