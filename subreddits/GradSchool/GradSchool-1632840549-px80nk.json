  "title:": "How to address my research in my PhD personal statement?",
  "text": "I already have a master's and am applying for a PhD. I have worked on 7 or 8ish research projects through the years in different fields. In my personal statement, how should I address this?\n\nMy CV already has details on my research projects, so should I restate all this in the personal statement, or should I talk more so about what I \"learned\" from these experiences overall (communication, programming etc) since the details are in the CV already and what skills this allows me to bring to their department?\n\nI have probably 0.7 pages left on my personal statement, and talking about each project, even just 3 sentences, would take up a lotttt of space and I still need a conclusion part to the statement. Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "In my statement of purpose I tried to describe my research so that it showed how it built my interest in the field (IMO the most important characteristic of a future PhD student). I mentioned first the graduate level classes I took as an undergrad that piqued my interest in research in general and then my own projects when I worked in academia, how much fun I had working with proteins (I'm a biophysics major) and that I know I want to keep improving my skills in this field. Worked well for me.",

      "text": "Personal statements don\u2019t really need your projects. It\u2019s all about you. Go with what you learned about them, how they built your character, etc. unless a project is truly near and dear to your heart, or the school app is demanding to know about projects, gloss over them. \n\nAll my apps last year didn\u2019t really ask about projects and I went in with 0 haha. But I\u2019m humanities. Might be diff for STEM. \n\nGood luck!",
