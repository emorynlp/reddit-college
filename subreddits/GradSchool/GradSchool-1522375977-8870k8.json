At my school it\u2019s mainly professors and other students that show up.\n\nThen they kick everyone out and my committee confers amongst themselves about my diss. \n\nThen I\u2019m invited back and and each member of my committee gets about fifteen minutes to ask questions. \n\nThen they kick me out again and discuss as to whether or not I pass. \n\nThen they call me back in and hopefully they all then hug me and tell me I\u2019m wonderful and congrats I\u2019m now Dr. SuddenOsprey. \n\nThis is, of course, theoretical. We\u2019ll see how it turns out in about a month. ",
