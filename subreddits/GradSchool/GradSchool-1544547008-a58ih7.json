Having public interest and excitement in research is important.\n\nSo next time you get the \"when are you graduating?\" or \"how did finals go?\" questions, maybe don't just roll your eyes and explain to them condescendingly how this so *obviously* isn't how it works. Develop a communication plan, start with an interesting hook, meet them where they're at, and move on from there.
