The whole \"lol my family is so stupid and don't understand anything\" trope is so circle-jerked to death. Look, I get it -- most of my family didn't graduate high school and none of them really get what I do and I get the 'annoying' questions too after years of explaining. But like.....graduate degrees are just not that common for people to have or to really understand. It's a really strange work format that isn't super similar to anything else people are familiar with (maybe apprenticing, but that's dead for the most part). \n\nSomething as scientists or humanists we should be striving for is being able to communicate what we do and why we do it to a general audience. How else are we going to convince the public that what we do is worthwhile and should continue to be funded? I know it's more complicated because government and politics and yadda yadda, but still. Having public interest and excitement in research is important.\n\nSo next time you get the \"when are you graduating?\" or \"how did finals go?\" questions, maybe don't just roll your eyes and explain to them condescendingly how this so *obviously* isn't how it works. Develop a communication plan, start with an interesting hook, meet them where they're at, and move on from there. On some level this isn't really much different from writing a grant.\n\n(This isn't aimed at you in any specific way OP, just airing my general grievances with the types of comments these threads tend to bring out!!)",

It's the fact that something which is a very major part of our life really just doesn't exist to other people. I know very well what my parents do and all the stuff that goes along with it, but they know absolutely *nothing* about what I do on a daily basis and are apparently not interested in finding out. \n\nMy family members didn't even finish *primary school*, so it isn't just that my subject is inaccessible, but that the entire concept of tertiary education is. My grandparents don't know what a degree is, they don't know what a PhD is, and if I say I study physics then they don't know what that means either! I was talking about Oxford the other day and they asked me \"what's Oxford?\". There isn't enough knowledge there already for me to build upon unless I'm going to lecture them for 30 minutes, and neither of us wants to do that. I tried to do it in little pieces but nothing ever stuck. \n\nIt's just unfortunate that I can't share this part of my life with them. All of the best and worst days so far mean nothing to them. I can't share my achievements or my concerns, which means that I drift further away from them and the relationships feel more and more one-sided.

Finally, someone kicked the stray dog out of the house.

I ignored my uncle's comment, but there is a shear ignorance when it comes to learning science. However, I wasn't pursuing an undergraduate degree to train animals. ",

Now keep in mind that the people don't want the gritty details, just like a carpenter won't explain his job by saying that he uses a hammer. \n\nIn your case, I'd explain it this way (as a sort of elevator pitch, if they want to know more they already showed interest, and keep in mind that this is not my subfield, but I want to illustrate the type of explanation rather than the details. Words in parenthesis are to be omitted): \n\n\"So, I have these two objects, one's quite simple (linear maps), the other one is fairly complicated (the root system associated to Macdonald polynomials or probably the associated Lie algebra I guess). But turns out that if I look at them from the right angle (through a representation) they actually behave the same / similarly. If I understand how to look at it so that they seem to be similar, I can use my knowledge of the simple thing to understand the hard one; now the hard bit is to find the right angle to look at. The field's called representation theory because we want to know how to represent complicated things as simple/simpler things, when viewed the right way\"",

I was recently informed (by someone with only a high school education, might I add) that I'm not a scientist, because I'm \"just\" a student. He explained that I only get to call myself a scientist when I have a degree (lol I have two master's degrees) and a job (people don't realize that grad school *is* a job; you get paid; my research is at a national lab, and I often do the same work as staff scientists). Until then, I'm apparently not even a novice! He's also a major misogynist, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't think my work as a female scientist is equivalent to the work of a male colleague. ",
