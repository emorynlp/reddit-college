There's something about how it takes the vast majority of your time and energy in order to just get through it, so even the smallest of flubs have been pretty all-encompassing for me. And since this is grad school, IE the most challenging school on the face of the earth, flubs are going to happen A. LOT. It's been tough for me, to say the least.",

They were extraordinarily challenging. I would spend 20 hours per work working on 4-question problem sets. I link my anxiety to this.",

It really helps. \n\nAnd always keep in mind that the struggles you are experiencing now are temporary. One way or another things will come to an end. Remembering that has helped me out a lot.",
