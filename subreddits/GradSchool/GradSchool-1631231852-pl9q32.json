I'm in my second year with no publications. I have no broader impacts (outreach etc.) except for mentoring one undergrad. I didn't apply last year because I didn't have a great CV then, and I planned on having a publication by now in addition to more experience to boost my profile, but I haven't been able to get the paper out yet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advisor wants me to apply, and I know there are benefits to applying even if I don't get it, but if it just feels like a huge time drain when I have lots of other stuff to do.

That\u2019s not what the NSF GRFP application requires. I have helped about 10 people write these and win them. \n\nThe proposal and personal statement are a package that go together. Lets talk about the personal statement first. Mostly because thats all I can remember. The personal is like a history that justifies why your perps al research experience makes YOU the best candidate to execute the proposal. It\u2019s like a story about how went on this journey and learned this skill and that skill and you will need these skills to do the proposal. The proposal has a very specific structure. I think it\u2019s two pages. I tell you what. If I get a chance I will go back and read a few and then give you some pro tips. \n\nAt the end of the day, you don\u2019t need to have publications yet. You do need a great undergrad GPA. You need fantastic letters of reference.
