I am sharing here because I want to share somewhere and didn\u2019t feel like sharing anywhere in twitter and fuck Facebook. I never thought I would see this day two years ago when I failed my comprehensive exam. But with diligence I am on the other side. So wanted to share some love to all hardworking and struggling graduate students, don\u2019t give up, the feeling after being done is worth the hard work. A lot of love to this subreddit for all the inspiring stories and motivation.", "author": "sikusa", "created": 1589026627, "retrieved": 1632953640, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 478, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fq4e1xk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ggegzt/finally_done_with_phd/fq4e1xk/", "text": "Congratulations!!!!!
