  "text": "I am finally done with my PhD after 5 years of whirlwind. I am sharing here because I want to share somewhere and didn\u2019t feel like sharing anywhere in twitter and fuck Facebook. I never thought I would see this day two years ago when I failed my comprehensive exam. But with diligence I am on the other side. So wanted to share some love to all hardworking and struggling graduate students, don\u2019t give up, the feeling after being done is worth the hard work. A lot of love to this subreddit for all the inspiring stories and motivation.",

Do you have to come up with your project on your own or does your professor have an area/theme that he wants you to work on? Are there preliminary data sets and publications that you can build upon? The most important thing is having a hypothesis that you can test. Once you have a research question in mind, do the background reading/research to see what has been answered and the follow up crisis/problems/questions they bring together. Reading is the key and constantly discussing ideas from your reading with your professor will be key in helping you identify you niche interest.",

First obstacle was to design a research project on my own and the methods I was planning to work has never been done with anyone in Clemson, so it took me a lot of reading and figuring out things on my own. The upside of it is that now I know when you have true drive self-learning is the biggest tool because your knowledge ends up being more complete than from learning in a class for sure. Then publishing was a learning process because my advisor wants us to do it all by ourselves which is actually great because I learned how to write cover letters and summary statements for publication. This is really helpful if you want to pursue faculty job because at that point you need to do it all and this experience helps immensely. The greatest obstacle of all was when I failed my comprehensive exam to get back to learning and overcoming my shortcomings. I had a great committee, they all made me think deeply about science, scientific process and big picture stuff which was very helpful in my growth. I started reading more of all kind of literature, that helped me to improve my writing and comprehension. Overall, it is important to thinking critically and keep after things and keep away from naysayers and drag-me-downs.",
