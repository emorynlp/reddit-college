  "text": "So I\u2019m submitting in a few weeks and have fallen a bit behind so I\u2019ve yet to truly decide my reference letter rankings. I am starting my second year of grad school with no papers but a conference poster from my REU. I have 5 letters being submitted; \n\n1)my current/future PI- I\u2019ve done some work in the group so far but haven\u2019t stood out lately. I am quite qualified for the type of projects they do, having done similar work professionally albeit a long time ago.\n\n2/3) My REU mentors- I had two, one of which was the projects PI and who is relatively famous in their field. While I am not ultimately ending up in this field the project had many overlaps. The second mentor was one I worked with daily during my REU and got to know better that summer. However, the last few summers I have been fixing up code and making plots for the main PI.\n\n4) My undergrad senior project mentor - the project was pretty closely aligned to what I\u2019m doing now. While it is similar this was also covidpocolypse so the project pivoted, successfully. I only had this professor for one other class around sophomore year.\n\n5) My first undergraduate research mentor. This project was not really related to my research and never really had results. However, I had this professor for like 3 upper-level classes.\n\nMy undergrad was relatively small(12k) so I was close with both professors well but my advisor was #5 and spent more time hanging around them. Only #4 and #1 are starting from scratch as the rest submitted for my grad school applications. For almost all of my grad applications, I picked only one of my REU mentors but I\u2019m pretty sure they have the most tangible evidence of my badassery.\n\nI\u2019m worried that my current PI doesn\u2019t have enough to go off or that it will come off lackluster. For that reason I\u2019m leaning 2,3,4 but I know I\u2019m supposed to choose 1 and #5 has many more personal and career details.",

      "text": "Just to clarify: are you applying as UG, G1, or G2? \n\nI would say that a recommendation from your current advisor would be absolutely critical if applying as G2. Otherwise, submit the strongest recommendations you can. I actually used only recommendations from early undergrad (when applying as a G1) because they were the strongest letters. I was funded and the timing of my rec letters was not raised as a concern in any of my reviews, even with some pretty nitpicky reviewers. \n\nSomething that might help, though, is for writers 2/3 to submit a single letter under the PI's name. This is pretty typical in situations where your primary supervisor was not the PI. Then, you could submit 2/3, 4, and 5 as your three letters for more range.",

          "text": "I'm just starting my second year, so G2.\n\nYour second idea is very intriguing, but they would both have to keep it under 2 pages right? May just ask them about it but would hate to give them more work if they're over a page each already and only 2 weeks left.",
