  "title:": "Why I regret going to grad school (and why I'm not quitting)",
  "text": "I regret going to grad school. I admitted this to a friend for the first time today. I am casually curious about a lot of topics and able to comprehend them, most of all my field of study, but I am honestly not that driven to dive deep in research. For years during and after college I worked in jobs that mostly involved repetitive physical tasks like being a research technician...and I loved it. I loved delivering pizza, I loved being a farm hand, I loved doing little lab tasks I was told to do, I loved being told how to collect field data then doing it. I was great at it too. I knew enough about the science to be good and know why what I did mattered, but mostly I loved daydreaming all day while my hands stayed busy. I have inattentive adhd and am prone to constant daydreaming and mental distraction, but treatment helped me to focus enough to do a quality job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI loved my last job for a while two. I was a technician at an agricultural experiment station for years, and I only wanted to leave because the working conditions became unsafe. Instead of making a lateral career move, I decided to try my own research and go to grad school. My classes are interesting when I try really hard, so is my job, but I feel a constant and overwhelming pressure to stay motivated. To vaguely quote Dianne from Bojack, research to me is like this magic eye poster that is the most incredible and beautiful thing when you squint at it just right.....but I'm so tired of squinting. It's what I thought was my dream but I really just like being a technician. I am constantly exhausted by the pressure to perform and will completely go off track without that crushing pressure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why not quit? Because I am halfway there. I believe that I can finish and still get some good from this experience. I will only quit if I feel that I am seriously sacrificing my health to do so. But it's time to finally admit my main motivation to stay in school is for the sake of following through on what I started.",

After my MA, I got a job as an e-commerce specialist and they had the same idea. Now, I'm the digital media coordinator for a healthcare management company, focusing on helping their hospitals best use social media and online reputation management.\n\nAll three of my jobs have been with companies started and run by people who immigrated from East Asia, and I was essentially told by two of them that I was hired because of my cultural studies experience, because I would understand the company culture. I also took my (Taiwanese-American) husband's last name and have been told based on my name plus field of study that they expected me to be Asian, lol. I'm super white.\n\nAs much as I enjoy working with social media, it's just not what I expected from jobs I planned to be temporary/transitional. My ideal position would be working in a cultural center, working with media and educating people, or working in a university office of some kind to deal with intercultural affairs. But I worry that job experience trumps education and I'll never get that opportunity.",

They had much higher job security, while still getting the perks of being the tech. Basically, they were the real people who made sure research got done out in the woods. \n\nAnd they kept me, a 21 year old strait out of undergrad, from accidentally impaling myself on chicken wire.",

Don't get me wrong, I like being able to have freedom and flexibility to steer the direction on my project, but I absolutely enjoyed being a research assistant more. A full day of monotonous lab tasks or following orders in the field for 7 days straight felt more productive and somehow more freeing than an hour of writing my own thesis or addressing reviewer's comments.\n\nI'm a professional visual artist outside my PhD, and have been dipping my toes in commercial scientific illustration work. I am not worried about lack of creativity or original ideas (or whatever it is academics harp on about), because I require that every time I create. Unfortunately the demands of a PhD have sapped my creative energy, inspiration and motivation from not only art, but a lot of things now. The pressure to constantly perform something groundbreaking or new was a lot more than expected, and I hate channelling the remaining creative energy I have into writing papers for publication (I much preferred reports honestly).\n\nBut like you, I also feel that the positives I get from the PhD experience outweigh the negatives and will push through to the end, even if there are some regrets. If anything, I learnt so much more about myself (i.e. resilience, perseverance, problem-solving etc.) thanks to my PhD. But I look forward to hopefully never having to take charge of a research project ever again. And I am happy with that.",

              "text": "It took me a long time to realize that my best at the phd level (which usually got me well above average previously) puts me average to low average for PhDs. It was definitely frustrating at first and took some soul searching to become comfortable with that. \n\nBut being a phd alone is still an impressive feat in the grand scheme. And most importantly you gain the transferable skills from the phd process. Which I think are formidable. I feel much more confident approaching things in my day to day with the analytical reasoning skills I have picked up in my PhD. Everyday things are less scary compared to a phd I guess. \n\nOverall it's something to be proud of even if you arent the best at the technical aspects, etc.",

There are so many variables in the PhD outside of your control (and the control of those outstanding students), that we can't really tell what is due to merit anymore IMO.  For example I knew people who published well very quickly, and I felt behind - but then I found out later that they did very little of the work in their papers and their PI wrote them! \n\nWhat can you do though?  That wasn't my situation so I'm not going to feel bad.  I'm becoming more pleased with what I got done and what I am publishing.  Gotta love what you're capable of, whatever it produces.",
