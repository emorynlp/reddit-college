I admitted this to a friend for the first time today. I am casually curious about a lot of topics and able to comprehend them, most of all my field of study, but I am honestly not that driven to dive deep in research. For years during and after college I worked in jobs that mostly involved repetitive physical tasks like being a research technician...and I loved it. I loved delivering pizza, I loved being a farm hand, I loved doing little lab tasks I was told to do, I loved being told how to collect field data then doing it. I was great at it too. I knew enough about the science to be good and know why what I did mattered, but mostly I loved daydreaming all day while my hands stayed busy. I have inattentive adhd and am prone to constant daydreaming and mental distraction, but treatment helped me to focus enough to do a quality job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI loved my last job for a while two. I was a technician at an agricultural experiment station for years, and I only wanted to leave because the working conditions became unsafe. Instead of making a lateral career move, I decided to try my own research and go to grad school. My classes are interesting when I try really hard, so is my job, but I feel a constant and overwhelming pressure to stay motivated. To vaguely quote Dianne from Bojack, research to me is like this magic eye poster that is the most incredible and beautiful thing when you squint at it just right.....but I'm so tired of squinting. It's what I thought was my dream but I really just like being a technician. I am constantly exhausted by the pressure to perform and will completely go off track without that crushing pressure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why not quit? Because I am halfway there. I believe that I can finish and still get some good from this experience. I will only quit if I feel that I am seriously sacrificing my health to do so. But it's time to finally admit my main motivation to stay in school is for the sake of following through on what I started.", "author": null, "created": 1562806838, "retrieved": 1632954156, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 330, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ettuilv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/cbp61w/why_i_regret_going_to_grad_school_and_why_im_not/ettuilv/", "text": "I've been having second thoughts on pursuing a PhD after I complete my MSc and I feel this on such a deep level.

I totally feel a very similar way. Don't get me wrong, I like being able to have freedom and flexibility to steer the direction on my project, but I absolutely enjoyed being a research assistant more. A full day of monotonous lab tasks or following orders in the field for 7 days straight felt more productive and somehow more freeing than an hour of writing my own thesis or addressing reviewer's comments.\n\nI'm a professional visual artist outside my PhD, and have been dipping my toes in commercial scientific illustration work. I am not worried about lack of creativity or original ideas (or whatever it is academics harp on about), because I require that every time I create. Unfortunately the demands of a PhD have sapped my creative energy, inspiration and motivation from not only art, but a lot of things now. The pressure to constantly perform something groundbreaking or new was a lot more than expected, and I hate channelling the remaining creative energy I have into writing papers for publication (I much preferred reports honestly).\n\nBut like you, I also feel that the positives I get from the PhD experience outweigh the negatives and will push through to the end, even if there are some regrets. If anything, I learnt so much more about myself (i.e. resilience, perseverance, problem-solving etc.) thanks to my PhD.
