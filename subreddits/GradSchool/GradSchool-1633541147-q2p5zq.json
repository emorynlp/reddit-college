  "text": "Hello all, this is a bit of a silly question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. I started my grad program straight out of undergrad, and have only ever used a backpack to carry around my laptop and various notebooks. If anyone has suggestions for a more professional style of bag (I'm open to satchels, brief cases, oversized purses, or even backpacks that don't make me feel like I'm still in junior high) please drop a suggestion or a link below!\n\nSincerely,\n22 year old who still feels like she looks like a child at bring your kid to work day",

I've had professors in their 60's bring backpacks to class.\n\nI used to use messenger bags because they looked a big more scaled up from the standard backpack, but the problem is that if you have a lot of stuff to carry, messenger bags can really hurt your shoulder. Schlepping around a laptop might be the heaviest thing, but it sure can feel that way. Backpacks at least distribute the weight more evenly. \n\nI like Swissgear backpacks. I've had one for over 10 years now and it is as good as new. I probably paid like $100 at target for it, but it was worth the price. It doesn't look like a high schooler's backpack and they are very sturdy and well-made.",

Apparently, I \\*happened\\* to be walking past a high school bus stop at around the time the school buses did their rounds and they just assumed. What made it even worse was when she struck up conversation I actually thought she was an undergrad at my university, which lead to a \"whose on first\" esque situation where the two of us were talking about two different schools and neither realized it until she said something that tipped me off that she thought I was 16. I kind of had to say I was 26 and walk away \\*really\\* sheepishly. \n\nBut the thing is... I still use my backpack anyways. It's way too convenient to not use it that way, and I'm not the only one. Faculty often outright use them in my department so nobody really seems to care in the space where I actually spend most of my time. The occasional mistaken age thing (which doesn't really happen often) doesn't outweigh the benefits I get from the practicality of a backpack.",

(Plus, backpacks obviously can also be fashionable.)",

It fits everything I need (only downside is no side pockets so my Hydroflask has to go in the bag or I have to hold it). It cost me about 75 dollars on Amazon for the color I got. I can also use it for travel!",
