I know there might be some spelling/grammar mistakes. For reference, I am applying to water science/geography related programs.\n\nI listed a couple areas of need, but feel free to ream me for any other aspect! \n\nLayout:\n\nOrganization of sections for what I want to do?\n\n\\- Secretary part gets separated for Leadership and Service section with current section layout\n\nSpacing, general layout critiques?\n\n\\- I\u2019m not sure how to reorient my Poster presentation bc of the long title, plz help\n\nVerbose wording:\n\nWhat is unnecessary/should be cut?\n\nProfessional experience:\n\nI was promoted at my company recently. How do I account for this on an academic CV? I haven\u2019t come across any examples in my search. \n\nThank you in advance :)\n\n[Click here for CV!](https://imgur.com/a/2qYMfgp)", "author": "Yea_Sure_I_Guess", "created": 1631164007, "retrieved": 1632952756, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hc71dr6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkr7ws/cv_for_grad_school_in_need_of_critique/hc71dr6/", "text": "I work in a similar field to where you're applying.  My advice is that of my own and might not always be 100% correct (others may criticize), but hopefully I can give you some more direct guidance.\n\n1. Structure looks good.  \n2. Research Interest has too much white space and all the bullet points are centered (making it look weird).  Line up the bullet points.  I also recommend reducing the spacing from the first and second line (e.g. Ecohydrology and Ecosystem ecology shouldn't be this spread apart).  This will also give you some additional space to bring Technical Skills from page 4 to page 3.\n3. For your research interest...  I see you've had experience in ecohydrology, GIS, and Water Governance.  If there's anything you can put a bullet point in for Human-environment interactions under one of your experiences then that'd be great.  \n4. For any experience (Teaching and Research Experience, Professional Experience), I like to go with the 3 bullet point rule.  Try to keep things short (1 to 2 lines max usually) and 3 bullet points each.  2 bullet points are fine but preferred 3.  Focusing on \"Problem, Solution, Impact\" \n5. My first take on this is that you're really comfortable with GIS software and solutions.  Probably great with data visualization as well (and you've taught it for your TA position).  Then I see your field work experience for your RA-ship.  Nice rounded resume, but anything related to coding would be extra helpful if you have it.  You say you have Python experience, anything to solidify python on your resume would be helpful.\n6. Leadership and Service.  What's the difference between your Researcher and Writer experience and your Professional Experience?  Is it that you actually got paid vs volunteer work?  I'd just move Research and Writer up to Professional Experience (and write that this position was a volunteer position for organization X) and rename \"Leadership and Service\" with \"Leadership Experience\"\n7. So \"President\" of a club is a bit difficult to figure out what you actually did.  Bullet 1 and 2 are basically saying the same thing (I was the point of contact for everyone).  But bullet 2 also slides in \"I delegated tasks\".  If there's any way to show specific leadership examples then that'd be useful as in it's current form just sounds pretty vanilla.  Make it unique to \"Led an initiative to incentivize academic excellence through X, Y, and Z policies\" (surprisingly worked in my fraternity for a friend of mine) or \"Led a fundraising campaign to raise over X dollars for Y Foundation\" (what I did).  \n8. Secretary actually has something interesting with planning an annual inter-departmental banquet.  Can you expand upon that?  Focus on the leadership parts and not the \"called an event space, brought in caterers, and sent out invitations\"?  \n9. Honors and Awards.  It's great but I think it's too big.  It takes up too much real estate on the page.  Personally for me, I'd get rid of the descriptions as the award pretty much speaks for themselves.  Look at how other Professors put their CVs together and take inspiration from that.  Most professors just say \"Awarded X from Y\" then Month and Year without the Department Name, School Name, City, XX, and a description.  E.g. Dennis Lettenmaier (famous professor in my field of study) lets his awards speak for themselves ([https://geog.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dpl\\_long\\_vitae\\_oct16.pdf](https://geog.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dpl_long_vitae_oct16.pdf) ).\n10. Projects and Presentations section only has a presentation. I'd rename this section as \"Conference Presentations\" and use proper APA citation format for this presentation.  An example is Dr. Patrick Reed (another famous professor in my field).  His website uses the same format ([https://reed.cee.cornell.edu/presentations/](https://reed.cee.cornell.edu/presentations/) ). What you're going to want to do is bold/highlight your name in the presenters list.  You don't need the explanation of what the presentation is about, if they're interested by the title then they'll look for it.\n11. Add more technical skills if you can.  Break them down into categories (e.g. Data Analysis, Visualization, etc.)\n\nBest of luck!  You have great experiences.  Just need to brighten those up a bit more.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1631203375, "upvotes": 1}, "hc6ab9s": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkr7ws/cv_for_grad_school_in_need_of_critique/hc6ab9s/", "text": "Try to get rid of that hanging fourth page, either by removing something less relevant in your CV or through creative typography.", "author": "p53lifraumeni", "created": 1631190874, "upvotes": 1}, "hc5jvd0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkr7ws/cv_for_grad_school_in_need_of_critique/hc5jvd0/", "text": "Heads up I'm not in the field but I have helped a lot of my friends and family with CVs so maybe I can be of some help here:\n\n1.  Personally I'd suggest that you remove the last section, you can put your researcher/writer experience under research. \n2. President at school clubs dont really mean anything since anyone can do it and it adds little to no value esp in an academic cv. \n3. I'd suggest adding numerical values in your CV to show how your work made impact if possible. With extra space freed up you should add more content, your recent role is way too thin. \n4. Depending on the focus of the school or the program (you can find that on the program page or past syllabus if you're lucky), try to sprinkle some relatable material or content from your work to show you already have some levels of familiarity with the course material.\n\n Just my 2 cents, good luck!", "author": "supercitrusfruit", "created": 1631168951, "upvotes": 2}}}
