Paul Tough's book \"The Years That Matter Most\" goes into this in a lot of detail, and all the ways that college and grad school and internships gatekeep mobility.\n\nThis is why it can be so damaging and depressing for students who've grown up hearing that \"you can do anything\" and to \"never give up on what you want.\" Then those same people are shocked when their kids beg them for money to live in New York for six months, or when they get angry emails from former students saying the system is so unfair.\n\nWe used to have interns (i.e. volunteers) at my former place of work. The point of the internship was to attract a more diverse group of people into our very white, middle class industry. But it turned out, the only people who could afford to work for us for free were...white middle class people.",

One is that (1) companies create unpaid positions to save money and take advantage of competition in the applicant pool. The other is that (2) unpaid internships are expressly created to block upward mobility by non-wealthy folks. (1) can be true and have the effect of blocking mobility without supposing there are some malevolent actors designing career entry points to protect the wealth of all rich people. You may think I am arguing semantics, but it is really important for productive discussion to temper one\u2019s cynicism and avoid relying on some hypothetical bogeyman",

I don't know if campus legal resources is something I could go to because it wasn't through the campus. \n\n\nEither way, Covid happened and I stopped going in (with an email to the director explaining that I do not feel comfortable coming in for the duration of the pandemic) and I'm probably not going back.

They can probably follow a decision tree and do basic tasks, but that's about it. So their \"work\" actually is generally not at a professional level -- and in a health care field, that's actually a liability. So intern \"work\" requires constant supervision, correction, monitoring. Which costs FTEs and employee productivity. In turn, the internships are accredited, so that also costs money. Someone has to ensure quality control and make sure that the pedagogical requirements are met for the internship, so again -- money, FTEs. So depending on the field, no, this \"free labor\" isn't exactly free for the employer, either. That's why the internships have a price tag.\n\nEmployers using interns to do scut work that anybody with a pulse can do? Yeah, absolutely. That's exploitative. But bringing somebody into a business or work environment on a temporary basis, basically showing them the ropes and investing time (and by extension money) into them without necessarily seeing the payoff of getting them as an employee, as a resource for advancing the mission of whatever organization you're in? It seems a bit entitled at the very least to moan and complain because someone isn't being paid enough to live in NYC on an interim basis to basically learn skills at someone else's expense. Particularly if that involves one of the most expensive places to live in the country. But maybe in this sub \"unpaid internships are exploitative\" is a tautology.",

Everybody with an ounce of real-world experience knows that the skills you acquire in school are molded by the workplace. A lot of forward-thinking community colleges have teamed up with local employers to create school-to-job pipelines. Fact is, secondary education in much of this country is a joke and many employers struggle to find people with the skills they need.\n\nThose were also very different times you are thinking about where there was far less job mobility and it was common to stick to one employer for a few decades at least. Much less likely to happen these days. Whether that's good or bad overall I don't know, it certainly rewards those with skills. It has more to do than just \"gutting\" labor laws. There are also macroeconomic changes, automation, and others.\n\nThose situations are all different than a 3-month temporary summer appointment or whatever the OP is wailing about where there doesn't really seem to be an expectation of continued employment after. Yeah, it'd be nice if they paid free rent, relocation, and a living stipend but that seems ridiculous to me, personally. There are only a handful of industries that do that (law, tech). If you're already based in NYC it might be a good deal in whatever field they're working in.",
