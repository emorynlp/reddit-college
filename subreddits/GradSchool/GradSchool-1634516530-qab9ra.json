I do have some, however, I had planned to volunteer in a lab & Covid happened.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether to address this in my statement as I\u2019m concerned it might just look like an excuse.\n\nJust wondering what anyone else in a similar situation may be saying, if anything.",

Mentioning you wanted to do more research but covid made it impossible will definitely not look like an excuse.",

I used to work at a tailor shop last year, and the number of cancellations made a lot of wedding businesses go under.\n\nThe reason my wife and I moved to Raleigh was to have more opportunities for me to get into research. I didn't even realize I could volunteer at labs to get more experience! Of course COVID would have made it difficult last year.\n\nGood luck!",
