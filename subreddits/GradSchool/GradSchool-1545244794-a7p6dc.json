Sure, you SHOULD get A\u2019s in grad school but that doesn\u2019t mean the classes are so easy that an A is guaranteed.

But they were the ones that were ultimately the least useful to me\n\nAlso I heard that, in my department, if you're a research stream grad student (have a supervisor etc..) it's essentially impossible to fail unless you literally don't submit anything. I think it has to do with profs getting pissed if another prof forces their student to spend more time on courses rather than research (which is what they are paying you for). But I've never seen that happen, I put effort in all my courses\n\nEdit: congrats btw! ",
