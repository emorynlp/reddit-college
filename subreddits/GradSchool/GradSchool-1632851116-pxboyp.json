  "text": "Hello all,\n\nThroughout my master's, I have felt really depressed. I've struggled with the culture that glorifies having poor boundaries between graduate school responsibilities and self-care. But now that we've returned to in-person courses and I have been writing my thesis, I am wondering if I actually want to leave. I love my field and I love the autonomy of research. I thought I would be relieved to be on the way out, but instead I feel anxious that I will be facing years of being a grunt for someone else's project (I'm going into wildlife biology). Now I wonder if I should pursue a PhD so that I can continue doing this work that I love. But I'm also not sure that its the best thing for my mental health. \n\nHas anyone else struggled with this anxiety as they transitioned out of academia? Or, conversely, has anyone found that they could maintain firm boundaries between their work and their personal time as they continued to pursue research in a university setting?",

      "text": "I'm exactly like you, just finished my master and I'm  struggling with what decision should I make. I got some advice from my friends and family; if you have the funds that will save you from struggling while you're studying your PhD then you should complete your studies, it's only two or 3 years and you'll be your own boss!\n\nThis is the advice that I got and I'm planning to pursue it. The anxiety is a part of the academic life but it will get better once you finish and see what you accomplished..\n\nI'd love to get more advice from other commenters too.",
