  "text": "Hello \nI'm an international graduate student and just started school in the US. So I mailed a few professors for opportunities to work in their group/join their lab. \n\nThe first prof kind of agreed but I'm also waiting for another group's process to complete. If selected I'd like to join the second group. \n\nI plan to wait for the process to end before replying to the first professor. In case I decide to join the second group would it be okay to say the truth i.e. I got an opportunity that aligns more with my interest.\n\nNote these are not paid positions, atleast for now. \n\nAny other way to handle this?",
