I still have it but use the tools to reduce my anxiety and focus on what I need to do. Anxiety sucks but seeking help if you have insurance through your school can make things feel less overwhelming.

      "text": "I just recently made the decision to get help with my anxiety. I highly recommend therapy if your school has that available for you. It's helped me build strategies that really work.\n\nA couple things you can try in the short term that help me:\n\n* square breathing (a google search will explain it better than me). This requires patience, as you need to do it for at least 10 mins for it to work in my experience. \n\n* something that works for me as a quick fix is filling a salad bowl with ice water and dunking my face a few times.\n\n* for sleep, I microwave a small glass of oat milk and drink it, then in bed I tense and relax every part of my body from my toes to my neck.\n\nSwitching my coffee to decaf has also helped me a lot.",

For example, I enjoy crocheting, so when I get into work I crochet for a bit while I mentally plan out what I need to do for the day, issues I encountered yesterday etc. \n\nIt helps me fall asleep knowing I have allotted time to think the next day- as opposed to feeling like I need to plan before I fall asleep.",
