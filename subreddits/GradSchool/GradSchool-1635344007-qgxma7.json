  "text": "I've come across some programs that seem a little more unique, in that they combine multiple fields and  aren't offered by every school with a related department- the UK has a few Digital Archaeology programs, for instance. Environmental data science is more common, but still seems like an interesting mix of fields. MsC in Puppetology seems fairly niche.\n\nWhat other programs have people seen or are in that might not be on a most searched for list?",
