  "text": "Hi\n\nOriginally from the UK, moved across to Canada in 2015. I have a four-year Integrated Undergraduate/Masters from the University of Plymouth in the UK. ([https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/mpsych-advanced-psychology](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/mpsych-advanced-psychology)) Yes i know that's weird but it is seen as a masters-level qualification in the UK! I recently got it assessed by our overseeing body up here, and they gave me 144 credits total.\n\nInitially after graduating, I went travelling (remember those days?!) and lived in Aus/NZ for a few years before moving here. I have since racked up three years clinical therapy experience, and two more as research therapist working for a University over here studying the development of Psychosis. I have been a part of some ground-breaking international studies, although I don't have my name specifically on any of the publications. My supervisor is in the top 1% in her field and I have an unbelievable lab team, so my references when i ask for them should be top dollar.\n\nHowever, when converted, my calculated GPA is a 2.9 on a 4.0 scale. (I should not have gone to university before the age of 22, I was not ready maturity-wise!)\n\nDoes this basically render me inadmissible to pursuing my Doctorate degree here? Or in peoples experience does the work experience I have been a part of help universities overlook such a thing?\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question, I'm totally a fish out of water when it comes to understanding this process on this side of the pond!\n\nCheers all!",
