But how is it in academia? Especially in the computer science department when deciding whom to hire for tenure track position or whether to grant tenure to the tt track faculty or when deciding whom to admit for the competitive phd program.\n\nIf I start from community college at the age of 26 and apply to phd at 33 after masters degree, will I face a lot of discrimination due to age? It seems I will be finishing phd in computer science at 38 or 39... I don't have any industry experience...",
