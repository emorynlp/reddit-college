What's more, the offer of a guaranteed $2500 a year COLA is the first time the administration has actually made an offer. This is big news considering the university has consistently argued that negotiations with the strikers was not legally permitted. It opens the door for us to negotiate a better cola.\n\nBut there's more: the statewide union is considering filing an unfair labor practice against the university for direct dealing, which means we may end up having the union on our side for a while at least moving forward. To be clear, there is precedent for us negotiating with the university directly and independently of the union, but if the union wants to step into the fray with us, we won't say no.\n\nFor the first time since we started this, it looks like we have the upper hand.
