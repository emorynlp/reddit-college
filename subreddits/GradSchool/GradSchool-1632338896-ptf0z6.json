So this is an awesome question and I\u2019m sure lots of people will benefit from it! \n\nAt the top of my list of easy meals is fried rice! It is so satisfying and extremely easy to make with just a few staples. Here\u2019s my method of making fried rice: \n\nUse old rice for best results, but no problem if you make and use it right away. Add your preferred oil/fat to the pan (I like butter haha). Add the rice and whatever seasonings you like (soy sauce, sriracha, sesame seeds, sesame oil, chili oil etc.). Let the rice cook a bit. Add your extras\u2013 I always have frozen stir fry veggies in my freezer that I add, you can do protein like cubed chicken here too. When that has cooked a bit, then push the rice to the side and make a well/circle in the middle. Drizzle some oil there, let it get hot, then crack in an egg (or two). Immediately start stirring it! Stir continuously into the rice until the mixture is nicely combined and smells so good. \n\nOther things on my list include: grilled cheese (can add protein), nachos with a can of black beans, huevos rancheros (seasoned black beans, salsa, cheese, and a fried egg over corn tortillas), chickpea curry (takes a little more effort but well worth it), ramen with various add-ins and/or a peanut sauce, and roasted veggies with your favorite protein over rice or quinoa. For breakfast I always have peanut butter toast. Quick, healthy, and protein. \n\nI also lots of friends (some with ADHD) who swears by Trader Joe\u2019s prepared meals.
