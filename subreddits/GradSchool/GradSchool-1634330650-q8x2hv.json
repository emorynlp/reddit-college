  "title:": "(Very) best PhD programs French or German",
  "text": "Salut everyone, \n\nI\u2018m sorry if this question has popped up before, but I would really appreciate your help :) \n\nI\u2018m looking for top notch PhD programs in either French or German. Could you please recommend me some? \nFor instance, I know that Yale is/used to be(?) superb and regarded as the best program in the world for Comparative Literature. I\u2019m struggling to find any useful information for similar ones in my two languages. \nAs a background: I did my undergraduate in Comparative Literature (French, German, Classics) in Paris and am currently pursuing a similar Master in Oxbridge. It is my goal  to become a professor and therefore I want to learn from the best professors in the world. \n\nVielen Dank f\u00fcr eure Hilfe!/Many thanks for your help! :)",
