And I did not have much luck getting good information from professors about this.\n\nA recent discussion on /r/gradschool made me realize that some of what I learned while struggling with this might be useful to others. So here are some suggestions from someone who used to spend a lot of time obsessing on this stuff, but wound up deciding to stay in and graduate and am now very glad that I did:\n\n1. Pick 15-25 papers published in your field in the past 2 years, and look up where each author is and what their job title is. Not just the first and last author, the ones in the middle too. (Hint: Some middle authors may not be as easily Googled, try the staff directory at the institution they work at.) Make a list/keep track of what job titles you find.\n2. Get a list of names of people who graduated from your PhD program 6-12 years ago (long enough ago they won\u2019t all be postdocs). If your program can\u2019t provide this, make your own list using your university\u2019s online repository of dissertations, or ask a librarian for help. Look up where these people are now and what their job titles are. Put in extra time and effort to find as many as possible, not just the ones who are easily-Googlable/on LinkedIn. Make a list/keep track of what job titles you find.\n3. Read Melanie Sinche\u2019s book \u201cNext Gen PhD\u201d. Take the time to do the exercises and really think about your answers. I have no affiliation with her/nothing to gain from promoting her book - I\u2019m recommending it because it really helped me and was a big part of my decision to stay and finish my PhD.\n4. Talk to people who have careers you might be interested in. Don\u2019t call it \u201cinformational interviewing\u201d, that\u2019s cringe-y and awkward - tell them you\u2019re a PhD student looking into career paths and invite them \u201ccoffee\u201d or \u201cZoom coffee\u201d to discuss their experiences with careers in your field. Ask them how they got where they are, what they like and dislike about their job, what else they would have considered doing/what other people they know wound up doing, and what advice they have for a student interested in this career path. Take notes, and type up the notes while your memory of the details is still fresh, this is information worth hanging onto long-term.\n\nA big part of what made the \u201cPhD careers\u201d thing so scary for me was the lack of information/the not knowing. Using these steps to go find the information I was lacking helped me **a lot** - I hope it will also be helpful to other people struggling with similar doubts. Whether you end up deciding to stay/finish or to leave, having information to base that decision on feels much, much better than just not knowing.\n\n\nFinal note: When talking to people, pay special attention to who planned out their career path and stuck to the plan, and who followed unexpected opportunities and made decisions as they went. Think about which approach you prefer - do you want to decide on/plan for a specific career, or do you just want to know whether there are good options out there and what you need to do to have those options open to you?", "author": "tentkeys", "created": 1627126340, "retrieved": 1632845265, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 634, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h8v5idv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oqo9ii/if_youre_worried_about_your_career_path_postphd/h8v5idv/", "text": "Don\u2019t get a PhD.

(I live in California, so those numbers may change depending on where you are). It makes me so sad. These are smart people who are just too afraid to leave. They think it's their lot in life to study a tiny subject with little marketable value. \n\nWhy bother getting an advanced degree if you get nothing from it? Every industry job I interviewed offered over $100,000/year (assuming your doctorate is in STEM). Industry *LOVES* PhDs. I was hesitant to accept, thinking I wouldn't be good at my job because it wasn't related to my research- not true. There are a million and one tiny advantages you have over any other new hire.

People graduating from my lab all had wildly different experiences- One person got a job at a federal lab, another person was still a barista last time I heard. The most important thing are skills and some projects use more relevant skills than others. All of things done in academia are academic niche. Of course, anyone with a PhD is capable of learning whatever skills they need to but the reality is, most hiring managers don't look at your potential they just look at you as you are. \n\nThe catch is as a PhD student you usually don't get to pick your project.", "author": "throwawaygrad001", "created": 1627130819, "upvotes": 110}, "h6cuug2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oqo9ii/if_youre_worried_about_your_career_path_postphd/h6cuug2/", "text": "Thank you for this!
