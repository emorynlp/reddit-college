I do, however, have a final paper for my mandatory research ethics course due that is worth 35% of my grade.\n\nI\u2019m prideful to a fault so it took a lot to e-mail my professors explaining some about my appointment today and that I might not be able to finish the final page or two and polish it all off by the due date.
