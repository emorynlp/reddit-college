  "text": "Hi, I'm a first-year PhD student in Political Science and I'd like to connect with other grad students in similar fields. It would be cool to have a regular time to check in each week and just chat about what we're doing. I love my cohort but it is very small due to small admission rates from Covid and it would be great to have some other people outside of my little circle to help hold each other accountable, share ideas, etc. Anyone interested or know of an existing group I could join? Thanks!",
