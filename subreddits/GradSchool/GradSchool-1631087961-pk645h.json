Here\u2019s a secret. Once you\u2019re in grad school\u2026you can do whatever you want! If you want to do computer science and art\u2026.no one is going to stop you!\n\nWhen you\u2019re a PhD student, you are a contributing to academics as a whole and are free to do anything as long as it meets academic standards. To give an example, you can join a computer science PhD and still work with the art faculty while using your computer science perspective. Alternatively, you can get an Art PhD and work with computer science faculty on a project. \n\nI am an English PhD student but a professor of mine is working with computer science PhD students to help digitize archival work and experiment on how best to merge physical things like books and letters and even lost works to modern forms of reading and storage. \n\nTrust me, there\u2019s space out there. But the bad news is that you kind of have to go out and carve that space for yourself. No one can really give you a program that does that.
