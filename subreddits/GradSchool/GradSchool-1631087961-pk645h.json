  "text": " I need your advice, I'm currently very lost. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science but my interests really lie in Art. In order to fulfill my dream of being a professor, I have to take a PH.D. I would just like to ask what programs I could probably take. Suggestions for universities will also be greatly appreciated.",

If you want to do computer science and art\u2026.no one is going to stop you!\n\nWhen you\u2019re a PhD student, you are a contributing to academics as a whole and are free to do anything as long as it meets academic standards. To give an example, you can join a computer science PhD and still work with the art faculty while using your computer science perspective. Alternatively, you can get an Art PhD and work with computer science faculty on a project. \n\nI am an English PhD student but a professor of mine is working with computer science PhD students to help digitize archival work and experiment on how best to merge physical things like books and letters and even lost works to modern forms of reading and storage. \n\nTrust me, there\u2019s space out there. But the bad news is that you kind of have to go out and carve that space for yourself. No one can really give you a program that does that. You kinda have to just do it for you",

              "text": "You might also be familiar with Cryptopunks, and Bored Apes\u2026 those are all also generative. There\u2019s three things you must know before you call bullshit on either:\n- They are made by a contract where the artist has no selective control over output, thus the algorithm must produce consistently high quality pieces. (In contrast to something where the algorithm makes, say, 100K pieces and the artist combs through and selects the best 1000 to sell.) \n- Cryptopunks was one of the first NFTs. This means that they are historical artifacts with respect to blockchain technology. Think about the high valuation society puts on culturally important art pieces and relics (in a general sense).\n- There is a massive community around both. This might not make immediate sense within this context, but social membership is highly valued by society. Sports is a prime example of this, as is the virtue signaling of best employer, best school, etc. \n\nMy point here is that you don\u2019t necessarily need to create something that is jaw-droppingly beautiful like Fidenza (though if you want to and have the expertise necessary to do so, then please do!). I\u2019m just saying that there\u2019s a lot of divergent ways of attacking generative art that seem to work very well and may not be immediately apparent to those who are unfamiliar with the space.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know and I\u2019ll clarify or give resources. Best of luck!",
