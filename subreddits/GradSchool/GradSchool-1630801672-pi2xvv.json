Due to data sharing setbacks, COVID19 BS, a late in life ADHD diagnosis (I'm 36 now and just diagnosed last year), and just general anxiety/work/procrastination issues I am way behind schedule on everything and will be unable to complete my project in time to meet the grant deadline. Without making this too long and sharing every detail, I want to take responsibility for these setbacks without making it seem like an excuse/sob story. I'm writing up the extension request right now and wanted some opinions.\n\nHow much information about my mental health should I give to the grant agency in an extension request? On top of the ADHD, my psychologist also diagnosed me with mild to moderate anxiety and depression. These may be caused by ADHD symptoms but we are unsure as I have not found a successful treatment yet and am still working through medication dosing. Also, access to treatment and counseling has been difficult because I started this process a couple months before COVID really kicked in. \n\nA second and more minor question, should I write the extension request as if it is coming from myself or coming from my committee (I vs. we). \n\nThanks!", "author": "Mikhail_TD", "created": 1630801672, "retrieved": 1632953142, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
