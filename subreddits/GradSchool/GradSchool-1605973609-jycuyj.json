  "text": "In the span of a couple hours haha: https://i.imgur.com/BJsHNBm.png, made for some excellent vibes. Even with the anticlimax that is pandemic celebrations. Dat Dr. --MCMC--!\n\nHad a total blast in grad school but it's good to be PhDone! (well, not really, still have to actually publish my dissertation chapters and give an exit talk haha, but there's plenty of time for that). Ended up dedicating the dissertation to [this moste anciente creatur](https://imgur.com/a/a1EtY4x) and labmate. Really excited -- and a bit nervous -- for these next steps! Lotsa learns ahead but I'm hopeful (from early conversations with my awesome new PI) that this pivot to a new field will go smoothly! AMA if you want me to drop any of this recently graduated wisdom.",

I think what I've achieved due to my side projects way outweighs anything that I could have accomplished due to my thesis topic. \n\n\nReally cool! I've worked on computational pathology as one of the side projects. Basically, using machine learning on edge devices to detect/classify cancer cells on pathology slides. What type of projects were you working on?   \n\n\nThese views are just stunning!! Where are these taken? It looks like it's in BC, Canada...",

          "text": "Thanks! Yeah, I think the side projects were what really helped my case here, though they were by no means entirely biomedical -- I had stuff in agriculture, consumer media, advertising, etc. to lean back on, and was probably gonna go work as a data scientist for a friend's nonprofit if the postdoc app didn't work out. On the biomedical side, I'd assisted in a workshop on medical NLP during a healthcare data science conference, served as stats author on a transplant immunology paper, consulted a bit on viral epidemiology papers, and was actually also designing a workshop for [medical image (skin lesion) classification w/ Bayesian CNNs](https://i.imgur.com/Zs8NZJ5.jpg) (using the HAM10000 dataset instead of e.g. the more conventional MNIST -- unfortunately when COVID hit I decided to put it on pause for the moment). \n\nThe pup photos were all taken in central CA! (though some call it \"northern\" CA, but they're mostly from the Sierra Nevada in the rough middle of the state). We've taken him to e.g. Vancouver but none of those were from there :] (otherwise, they're all from our weekend hikes -- one habit I formed in HS and never let go of was going hiking each weekend)",

I'd have been happy doing a bunch of different stuff, but this was the uni my wife matched to for her residency and this was the lab / PI most highly recommended to me by a friend who'd done all her post-secondary education there! And the lab looked to be doing tons of really neat and important work (w/ lots of translational implications)! Nothing that I'd really had any direct experience in -- I'm being brought on as a generalist who can pick from a wide selection of projects (they've been really lucky with grants lately) or else design my own within reasonable arm's reach. Otherwise, my PhD was in nominally in paleoanthropology, but more-or-less all my projects were in computational methods development.",

While I do think that work is valuable, there's a lot more to the field than that! I think it's also that other taxa don't get pinched off into their own dept, regardless of the methods or tools used to study them (e.g. you don't have an \"oleracealogy\" department, or even a \"botany\" department, but you do have botanists in biology, chemistry, geology, food science, etc. departments, where their day-to-day lives may more easily be compartmentalized). Anthropocentric preoccupation is understandable, but it does lead to some confusion!",
