(well, not really, still have to actually publish my dissertation chapters and give an exit talk haha, but there's plenty of time for that). Ended up dedicating the dissertation to [this moste anciente creatur](https://imgur.com/a/a1EtY4x) and labmate. Really excited -- and a bit nervous -- for these next steps! Lotsa learns ahead but I'm hopeful (from early conversations with my awesome new PI) that this pivot to a new field will go smoothly!

I'm looking for something like that actually, working in an area related to side projects. I think what I've achieved due to my side projects way outweighs anything that I could have accomplished due to my thesis topic. \n\n\nReally cool! I've worked on computational pathology as one of the side projects. Basically, using machine learning on edge devices to detect/classify cancer cells on pathology slides. What type of projects were you working on?   \n\n\nThese views are just stunning!! Where are these taken?
