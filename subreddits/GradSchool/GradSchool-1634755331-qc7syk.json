  "text": "Hello all! I'm just starting the process of seriously considering grad school, and I need some help picking a program. I'm in my second year of teaching PE at a middle school and my school district doesn't offer any financial assistance for further education (Super lame). That's fine though because 1- I don't really plan to stay here too long. 2- The reasons I want my masters are so I can leave this place lol. My goals are to teach at a community college and eventually open my own gymnastics gym with my husband. He's a business man and could easily handle to business side of things, but I still want to have some knowledge of the field, so I was looking at graduate programs that are PE & business oriented.\n\nThe ones I've looked at that sound promising are (all online):\n\n1. M.S. in Sports Administration \u2013 Business concentration at Southeastern Oklahoma State University;\n2. M.Ed. in Positive Coaching and Athletic Leadership at University of Missouri;\n3. M.S. in Sports Management at American Public University.\n\nMy questions are\n\n1. Which one seems like it would best align with my goals?\n2. How heavy is the weight of the school name? University of Missouri is obviously a more renowned name than APU, but does that really even matter?\n3. Are there other degrees/programs I maybe haven't thought about that would be better than these?\n4. What's the average course load of masters program classes and how hard is it to manage while teaching/working full time?\n5. Where are the best places to look for financial aid? The only grants/fellowships I've seen are for minorities. I'm white so that kind of fucks me. \n6. What advice can you offer for researching schools, programs, and financial aid? \n\nTIA for any and all help!",
