I got through my first semester!", "text": "In the first three weeks I had no clue how I was going to complete the full 15 weeks. I felt like such an imposter. For a supposedly prestigious school, I\u2019m still amazed they accepted me and that I did moderately well trying to keep up with the readings and assignments. \n\nMy grandfather died from Covid during the last two weeks of the semester and it really smashed my world apart. With so many assignments to do, I fell into a deep depression and was completely unable to focus on anything expected of me. Thankfully my professors have been very supportive and gave me extensions on my papers. I eventually pulled myself together to get my work done, and got really great feedback. \n\nI didn\u2019t manage to complete everything 100%, but I did my best despite the circumstances. I know my grandfather would be proud of me.
