  "text": "My classes in undergrad never prepared me to do one, and now I have an assignment wherein our classmates have to peer review each others assignment.\n\nHow do you do a peer review? In fact, what exactly is a peer review \ud83d\ude2c I feel like I should know all these but I never learned it!\n\nI thought I \"peer-reviewed\" my classmate's article by editing their grammar, formatting, commenting on certain word choices, moving certain concepts from here to here to make similar discussions together, making methods suggestions, and overall feedback. \nBut then someone else did mine and all they put in was an one sentence speaking to the overall. I feel like I'm an asshole now for being over critical and editing things that I should not.\n\nWhat's the correct thing to do in this situation? (Please don't judge)",

      "text": "I had to do similar things for some of my seminars and it really differed between professors regarding what their expectations were. For one, it was more like read your classmate's paper and edit for grammar, spelling, and give your thoughts. That was similar to stuff we did in undergrad and wasn't at all helpful to me personally. \n\nAnother professor had a more structured assignment where each person's paper was to be read and discussed by two classmates. Those two peer reviewers would type up a document similar to what a reviewer would send to an author. There may be some grammatical corrections or suggestions, but the vast majority was focusing on a.) does the literature review provide enough support for why this paper is worth writing?, b.) do the hypotheses make sense in the context of the lit review?, c.) are concepts explained thoroughly?, d.) (if applicable) is the methodology appropriate for the research question? e.) what could improve this paper, and how?\n\nI think a more thorough review is actually being considerate because you are engaging with your peer's work and trying to give them constructive suggestions. Someone who reads an entire paper and says \"yours is really good!\" or who only bothers to write a single sentence is the one who is the asshole. Even an extremely well-written paper by a renowned professor will have more than 1 line of comments. Personally, I'm always thankful when I get a lot of comments (as long as they are constructive) because, while I may not incorporate some into my next draft, it shows someone cared enough to critically think about it and sometimes it gets me to see something I didn't see previously.",

      "text": "The way you are going about it is about the same way I do it. Pretty much any prominent flaws you see in their work you just make a polite note of. The point of a peer review is to make their work better. A one sentence overall situation would be a good addition but imo not something that constitutes an entire review. \nSidenote: I was regarded as one of the smarter kids in my classes and would give reviews like yours to people, but anyone reviewing mine would hand it back saying \"nice job looks good to me\" with almost zero corrections. So i was annoyed in a sense that my paper never got marked up as much. \nBottom line, do you what you feel is necessary to make their paper better. I think it's great that you're going beyond strict grammar or editing by also diving into flow and content. As long as you are polite and humble with your suggestions, I think you're doing fine the way you're going about it now!",

      "text": "I agree with the others.  The only thing I would add is to try and focus on structural or methodological flaws over style. So you can correct clear grammar errors, but I would not change sentence structure. You could say something overarching about convoluted sentences  though. The more useful is to identify flaws in reasoning. What in the paper would make you think \"I don't believe that\" or \"I don't trust the results\"",

The second paragraph outlines implications, contributions, and critiques. My third paragraph draws connections between the paper and other concepts we have discussed  as well as how the findings connect to the overall theory that drives the investigation. \n\nJust kidding, I always run out of room for the third paragraph and refuse to give my peers more than I am willing to read myself (about one page). I did have a professor provide this feedback a little while ago: \"This is good, but you are doing more than you need to.\" I'm not sure if she said this because it was really too much, or if it was because I ripped into a paper in which she was the co-author.",
