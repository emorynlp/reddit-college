  "text": "So I am in grad school and I am not getting anything of substance from the program. I have passed all my courses without problem until this semester (still passing, but the grades are not where I would like them). I have one TA that seems to be causing problems and when I brought up my concerns another TA from another class now seems to have problems as well. \n\nEverything seems to be resolved but I am debating to continue on with the program ( I only have one semester left) and the head of the program basically said I shouldn't continue because I cause problems. And the only thing I did was complain about the grading (Which I was told would be corrected).\n\nI tried to see if there were ways to sue or something because I feel like Im paying for something that hasn't given anything. Im just lost on what to do. I do know grad school isn't worth it and I wish I had done my research better. But here we are. \n\nHas anyone had any problems that they had to seek legal help?  Whats some advice you can give?",
