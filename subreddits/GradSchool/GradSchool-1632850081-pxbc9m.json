  "text": "This might be a little vent-y so please bear with me. Basically, I graduated with a bachelors degree in Biology from a decent state uni at the beginning of this year. I'm particularly interested in research in the molecular/cell bio field especially in genomics. During that time I tried to get myself prepared for going into possible graduate work but by the time I got on it it was well into my junior year and because I transferred from a community college, I didn't have that many contacts at the state school and thus couldn't secure any solid research experience. As of now I've been working as a lab tech/data reviewer for a industrial pharma lab for about a year now and I think I would like to go back for a thesis Master's degree at the same state school. The reason I don't go for a PhD is because I imagine my app would be binned instantly, so at least a Master's might consider me and give me some of the research experience for a PhD if I so choose. I understand Master's programs are generally considered unwise due to their steep costs but I do have some savings that I could throw towards it that could offset most of the debt. I do have a few professors who might write me letters but as I said, I don't have any concrete research experience unfortunately. FWIW I did good in most of my classes and have a 3.8 GPA so that is not an issue.\n\nThe other option would to be to try and find a research focused job but it seems like the grand majority of them expect you to already have a couple years of research experience under your belt. Its very stressful because I would really like to try and cut my teeth on this but it feels like most of those opportunities have already passed me by because I was too stupid or naive to act on them as an 18 year old. l guess right now I'm at an impasse in my life where I want to find at least semi-meaningful career work and not just the same old drudgery I've been doing all my life but at the same time I'm just not sure if I am or was ever cut out for something like graduate school and perhaps if its better to give up on this and focus my efforts elsewhere instead. I know there are other ways to get through life besides this but it feels like the best option to get where I wanna be right now. Any advice or maybe related experience would be appreciated. Thank you",

      "text": "Sup, I'm a 4th year bio PhD student and my research is specifically in population genomics and evolution/ecology, so pretty close I would expect to what you're interested it.\n\nThere are some differences between different types of bio departments. I'm in more of a general department, so we do have people doing cell bio/biophysics/etc in our department and the closely associated departments, but there's also a Department of Medicine and Molecular Genetics that operates very differently. If you're interested in cell bio and molecular genetics, you would probably fit in an MMG department or a more general bio department.\n\nIn departments like mine, basically ones that lean ecology and evolution, the standard is that master's students are paid. It's bullshit that they often get paid less than PhD students, but master's students usually get either a research assistantship or a teaching assistantship that's functionally the same besides the pay. Different schools do it a little differently, but it's usually like PhD students are guaranteed funding and Master's students are after them in line but there are plenty of spots for TAing so it's pretty unlikely they won't get it (that would be something to ask the students in departments you apply to though). I can't make the same generalization about MMG departments because I'm just not sure.\n\nSo basically, you should look around at specific schools and make getting paid a specific thing you look for. You might have to rule out a few schools, but tbh not going to a school that won't pay Master's students is just better because it's not really standard in bio anymore and you like... have to live and stuff. Also, even in schools where Master's students aren't assured a stipend, they do always (that I've seen) waive tuition. But you should look for programs with the whole package.\n\nI don't think you should rule yourself out for PhD programs either, but it's not a bad idea to go for a Master's first if you think it would open up more doors for you. It's also often possible for people to switch to a PhD after starting their Master's (it happens a lot in my department). Either way, when you're ready to start applying, you should reach out to professors in the department who you're interested in working with. There are two ways bio departments typically accept students. Either the traditional submit an app and your test scores and then you have to do a rotation to figure out your advisor or the submit an app but contact professors you want to work with and if you have someone interested in accepting you into their lab, you will probably get accepted. My department and most bio departments do the latter method and most professors just won't accept students who didn't contact them ahead of time. The MMG program at my school technically does it the traditional route with rotations, but I do know some students who had contacted the person they wanted to be their advisor ahead of time and didn't have to rotate or only did them as a formality. So I think reaching out to professors is good either way.\n\nJob hunting with only a bachelor's in bio honestly sucks. Any lab tech job that say they will hire bachelor's holders will also be getting tons of people applying who already have master's degrees :/ I know from experience it's very difficult to find anything that's not temporary and the reason I found something temporary in the first place is that I was an undergrad at the associated university. I wouldn't have been able to apply if I was a year out of school.\n\nLastly, don't worry too much about being cut out for grad school. You don't have to be a genius, you just have to be tenacious. If you have a career goal that a Master's or PhD would help you achieve and you find a good and supportive advisor, you'll be able to do it. I have to run to a meeting, but let me know if there are other questions you have and I'll try to answer them!",

          "text": "Just wanted to say thanks for the comprehensive response. I hadn't considered reaching out to faculty beforehand so that is good to note. The college I'm looking into lets people test into a PhD program at the end of their Master's if they want and I reached out to the director of the program who suggested I do the same. This is just something I've been mulling over for a while but I know I just gotta get over my own anxiety and get the ball rolling and see where it takes me. Thank you for the reassurance.",

      "text": "I\u2019d recommend apply for a PhD at programs around the country \u2014 aim for 10-15 less competitive programs. That way they\u2019ll pay you an RA or TA position, and you can leave with just the Master\u2019s if you want, including applying for a more competitive PhD program elsewhere. You need to be willing to relocate to get a place with an assistantship to cover tuition and a stipend for room and board. If you live frugally on the stipend, you can still save money (unless you\u2019re in a major expensive city).",
