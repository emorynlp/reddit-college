Especially since I\u2019m only 25, almost 26. I\u2019ve also been an instructor and faced snobbery. I was a grad student at an Ivy League and an adjunct for another. As a humanities scholar, I also teach the classes that students regard as the electives they don\u2019t want to take.\n\nI once created the class text book by compiling open source material and my own personal book scans, and sending it to a printing company. So the book was free digitally or they could get a printed copy with a ticket for like $5. I had a student email the DEAN and say that free open source material wasn\u2019t rigorous enough for the class standard. Whether this was because ITV was Ivy leaguer or that student was a dick but the dean called me to laugh. He saw the textbook was anything but.\n\nBut on a regular basis, undergrads wouldn\u2019t necessarily know I was a grad student or a professor.
