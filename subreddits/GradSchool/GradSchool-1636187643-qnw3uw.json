He went as far as telling that some models won't require any data and will learn while in the real world. When this was brought up in the meeting, the CEO asked me if this could be done. I told him that even if it was possible, this would have been the most horseshit technique to do trading. The kid got all defensive and said that he had read about it in one of his circlejerk newsletters and then ended by saying \"if you don't know stuff, own up to it\". The CEO then asked him to forward the newsletter and when I got to it, it was just an automation script containing if else loops which was even worse. I sometimes think to myself why do these business students even get a degree when half the time they're going to spew bullshit.",

If it's someone well above me in an organizational structure, I'll be polite without correcting him or her and just say that I have heard of that idea and leave it at that.",
