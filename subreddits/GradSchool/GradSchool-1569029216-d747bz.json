  "text": "I finished my application for a fellowship today that is super competitive and I have no chance of winning. But writing up my research statement was an amazing exercise in seeing how far I've come in my program and reminding myself of my long term goals. I'm pumped up and feel like I want to write my next three papers all at once now!",

But just preparing the application helped my define my project and forced me to really think about my career goals/why I\u2019m doing grad school. So congrats on applying, and good luck!",

She told me that it was at the cost of squandering the good will of those who write my letters of rec. I went from feeling great to feeling terrible in 20 seconds.",

She didn't at all expect to get the MC Fellowship, but she did have some hope for the other one.\n\nShe got rejected for the other one, and a few weeks later learned that she got the MC Fellowship.\n\nSo basically, don't be too sure yet. :)",
