However, I believe the application was open to those who want to submit their research proposals as of a few days ago. Above my application, it states \"Your application has been submitted and can only be viewed. You can manage your individual applications on this page.\" \n\nDoes this mean my application is still under review, and that I don't need to submit another research proposal, or should I still submit a new research proposal? I am just starting grad school, so I have no idea which profs to approach for reference letters. \n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated!

I don't think applications transfer over from previous years, even if you were on alternate. I've been on alternate before and definitely had to resubmit. It was for NSERC but I'm 99% sure they all work the same way.\n\nBtw, CGS M is NSERC not SSHRC, so I'm a little confused by your title saying SHEC and then mentioning CGS M in your description.", "author": "cm0011", "created": 1630739233, "upvotes": 0}, "hbhkqan": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgxprt/recent_update_from_sshrc_but_i_have_no_idea_what/hbhkqan/", "text": "It would be best to contact your scholarship office. At most institutions, there is someone in that office whose specific role is SSHRC applications. Otherwise, contact your grad advisor or whoever is workshopping or coaching applications this year. My inkling is that because we are entering a new SSHRC application round, that some of the portal views changed. You would have to submit a new application for the next round of applications. If you are an alternate, you can pretty much be one indefinitely, but it won't carry over to the next round of applications if that makes sense.", "author": "GeneSafe4674", "created": 1630699871, "upvotes": 1}}}
