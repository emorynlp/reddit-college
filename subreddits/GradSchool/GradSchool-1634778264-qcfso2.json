  "text": "I just got an A- for an assignment. I know this would be considered a \u201cgood grade\u201d for most undergrad students, but I don\u2019t know if things change in a masters program. I keep thinking it\u2019s a bad grade and every single student has to get an A or A+ to be good. Thoughts and stories from experienced grads? Thanks!",
