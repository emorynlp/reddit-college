  "title:": "Letter of recommendation 7 years after undergrad",
  "text": "I finished my undergraduate studies in 2014, and after a long hiatus am currently applying to graduate programs for next fall. \n\nConsidering it's been so long since undergrad, I initially emailed the three professors I was closest with at the time. I sent them an email with some details about my time in undergrad and my intentions for grad school. 2/3 never responded, and the one that did asked me a few questions which I answered, and then he never responded even after a follow up email a week later.\n\nI had excellent grades in undergrad, and felt like I had decent connections with my professors, but am feeling worried about the required letter of recommendation from a previous academic faculty member. My other letters are all taken care of, but I'm stumped about this one.\n\nI know Im not the only one who took a break after undergrad, and any advice would be appreciated. \n\nAlso, to note, I no longer live in the state that I did undergrad in, so tracking someone down in person isn't really an option. \n\nThanks for your time!",

      "text": "I can say that I have been in the exact same boat. I'm currently working on my M.S.Ed. in Elementary Education, 14 years after graduating with my B.A., a 4.0 GPA, and many great connections in college that slipped through the cracks in the following years. I will say that I ultimately took the \"easy\" way out. I had considered applying for the Early Childhood Education Master's, which required two recommendation letters, but I ended up applying for Elementary Education, which required no letters. (I was torn between the two programs anyway but I'm happy I decided on Elem.) However, my advice is to take a course or two at a community college and get to know those professors super well. I know recommendation letters can be important, but at the same time, they make things so rough for people like me who are introverted, dealing with issues that make it hard to stay connected with others, etc. Everyone has always said I'm an excellent employee and student, but it's still hard to maintain a solid group of people to ask for references. Best of luck to you.",

Are there any others professors who you can try? \n\nMy program didn\u2019t require an academic recommendation so all of mine were written by work people - if the above doesn\u2019t work perhaps you could contact admissions and see if there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll waive the requirement and allow the letter to come from a professional contact?",

          "text": "I did, no response. Its strange that I got the response and then nothing...honestly feel like I got ghosted by an academic contact it's a strange feeling. I would at least an \"I don't remember you well enough to feel comfortable writing you a letter\" but who knows. Maybe my long lost undergraduate self did something to offend him that I don't remember. I guess that is the next step. I just hope I can explain in some way why I don't have a letter from the academic world so it doesn't weaken my application.",

      "text": "I was in this same boat, except I was slightly more recent. However, I\u2019ve never been loud or outspoken in class and I never felt the need to make \u201clasting\u201d connections with professors. I emailed my advisor, who I was closest to and he never responded to emails. I ended up calling his office and he actually answered\u2026he asked me about my love life and if I wanted to be a professional student my whole life. SO at that point I said fuck this guy. \n\nI sent MASS emails out to literally every professor I could remember, even from my online prereqs\u2026only 3 responded and 2/3 send them in (I wasn\u2019t a big fan of 1 so I can only imagine her recommendation). \n\nBut during that stressful time, I did some research and I believe if you call admin or registrar or any department from your undergrad and ask for a recommendation, I think they give a very basic one after looking up your transcript. \n\nAt the end of the day, it looks bad on the university\u2019s part because not only does it look bad on them and their professors, it can hinder their claim of \u201cx percentage of our graduates go onto higher level research or education\u201d.",

      "text": "I used a professional/work reference for one of my two (it was stated that only one had to be academic). I asked if I could use two professional references in case I could not get an academic reference (I was very far removed from when I did my undergrad), and I was told that an exception could be made (I was able to find academic reference though in the end). It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask if you can use an alternative.",
