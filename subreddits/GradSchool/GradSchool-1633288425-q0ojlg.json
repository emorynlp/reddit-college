  "text": "I'm having a pretty decent GPA so far (4.16/4.3), but I'm going on a study abroad program where they don't offer A+(4.3)'s, so that means that semester would definitely bring my GPA down to around 4 even if I got all A(4)'s.\n\nI'm wondering how closely would grad schools look at GPA, or as long as you're in a \"good\" range then you're fine. Would 0.2 difference in GPA impact much?",

          "text": "Yeah, I've also found this to be the case. My program cuts off MS students at a 3.0 (with the option to continue to the PhD after defending and MS coursework), or direct entry into the PhD program with a 3.3.   \nPretty much if you have the GPA, and a good couple letters of recommendation, it's a no-brainer for a program to admit you. When I was applying, I was very nervous as to whether or not I'd get accepted... the reality is (in my experience), most programs will admit people if they meet the requirements, as grad school is a somewhat more voluntary venture. If you're willing to make the school look good (e.g. publishing, research, conferences, etc), then they'll be happy to have you.",

      "text": "You GPA is enough to go to gradschool that's for sure. In general, very high GPAs are important if you aim for top ivy schools in my experience unfortunately. It seems ridiculous to think that 0.2 can make a difference, but when your competition is extremely high (perfect GPA students) every little details can unfortunately matter. If you don't aim for IVY school, then a 0.2 difference is not a big deal considering you are so high. However, if you stay and increase your GPA, it would bring you close to a perfect GPA which can be important for a top school and help a lot get funding and scholarships from funding bodies. Just something to consider but you will be accepted to gradschool for sure\n\n(*Edit since some do not understand what I meant*) That being said, the way GPAs are calculated varies a lot by country and even by universities within the same country. Are you sure they don't give anything equivalent to A+ (impossible to get 100%)? Or do you mean their grading system stops at A (A=100%=4/4GPA)? If you meant the latter, then your University (assuming they have minimum logic in their administration), will convert the grade to your system or not take it into account so that it does not affect your grades at all. What you seem to forget here is that you need to convert their grading system to yours. Universities are used to convert systems because of international students. That means If you get 100% on your exams there and thet convert it, you should be getting 100% here too. It doesn't mean 80% (4/4.3). A perfect GPA means in their system what a 4.3 means in your system (4.3/4.3).\n\nUsually, because of the disparity in how GPAs are calculated, when a student goes abroad for a semester they only get the classes credited, they do not get any grades for that class in their home university system. Have you verified if this is the case for your university? Actually, you should just email your university to get answers on how going abroad will affect your grades. It also varies a lot by University, so someone's experience with that might not apply to you at all.",

          "text": ">Are you sure they don't give A+? or is it just that their GPA is calculated differently and on 4 instead of 4.3?\n\nIt definitely happens. In my country, the translation to American grades is roughly as follows;\n\n* A = 8/10 or higher\n* B = 7/10\n* C = 6/10\n* Everything else = insufficient\n\nThere is no A+ translation. A friend of mine who went to do an internship in the US actually lowered her average (as the max she could come back with was an 8/10), and this was essentially a 'tough luck' situation. I'm 100% sure they would not make special arrangements for the opposite.",

              "text": "I am aware of that. What I meant is their grading system is different and that it's not like there is an A+ grade and they won't give it to you.  If you get an A for them it's like an A+ at OPs school. IT wouldn't translate to an A in OPs grading system, but a 4.3 since that's what they associate with 100%. If you get 4/4, technically with the rule of 3 you get 4.3/4.3. It's not like OP would be getting 4/4.3 as they seem to think, but it really depends on the school. At my uni, they wouldn't be getting 4/4.3, but 4.3/4.3. At my friend's uni, they just did not count the grade towards the official transcript because the calculation was too different. That's what I meant. OP can't just assume that their grading system is equivalent in terms of A and A+ to see how it would impact their own grade. 100% is 100%. If it means A in one country, it means A+ in another. It is not likely that 100% would be seen as A in OP's country.",
