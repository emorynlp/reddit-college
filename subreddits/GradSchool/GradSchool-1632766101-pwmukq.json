It takes time to become good at reading papers. For me personally it really took me having hands on lab experience (full time job in lab not just undergraduate part time work) to really understand experimental process and how to write it up (which in turn helped me read papers and read between the lines in papers).\n\nIf you want practice, find a review article on a topic that you are very interested in. Read the review and highlight articles referenced in it that you'd like to dive deeper in, then do that. You should already have the gist of what the article is about and since it's something you're pationate about it should be easier.\n\n\nWhat I found helped me a lot was focusing on the materials and methods section. For me personally I have a hard time getting past the question \"why is this being done this way\" and it really hindered me understanding the papers. So for each method I looked up what it involves and why it was done. What results you can get and what conclusions are. Once I had that infor it was much easier for me to read and understand the papers.
