  "text": "I absolutely hate seminars\n\nGranted I knew what I was getting into when I joined my program and my field of study but with every class I attend the more I hate it. I've always been one of those students who likes to keep my head down and do my work and expand my ideas through writing. Sitting in a room for three hours talking about things that aren't relevant to my field is absolute hell. Before I go to class I feel sick, after I class I feel sick, when I get comments saying \"i\"d love to hear more from you\" I feel sick. \n\nI'm one of those people who doesn't like wasting time by restating the same thing someone else has already said or chiming in and saying \"oh yeah I agree with so and so\" just for the sake of opening my mouth. It's a giant waste of time that we as graduate students don't have and I feel like we could be a million times more productive doing other things. \n\nI don't have social anxiety, but I have general performance anxiety/perfectionism and just am a quiet person. I don't open my mouth unless I have something to say and 99% of the time I don't have anything to say. It doesn't help I'm in seminars with people who don't know how to stop talking any anything I want to say, they happen to say it before I do and if you make one misstep or can't get your thoughts together it will absolutely be held against you. \n\nSorry about the rant but I just needed to get that off my chest. I only have a year and a half of coursework left but I just get so annoyed with these types of classes and I halfway regret not going to Europe where I can just write my dissertation and be done with it.",

          "text": "I rationally get that and I know that sitting around at conferences discussing things and writing angry papers criticizing each other's work is 99% of what we do. I'm just a very internal person. I prefer the written form. I got sick a week and had to end up emailing my professor some questions and thoughts I had on the reading and we got into a great discussion over email. It was great when there weren't men yelling over me and stealing my thoughts and I didn't actually have to talk. \n\nIt boils down to I'm a sucky conversationalist and I know that is something I need to work on to make it in the professional world. Nodding my head and being an over productive shadow who only opens their mouth when they're lecturing will never get me anywhere in life. I had a really bad day of leading discussion because of this. My go to strategy is to just set one of my classmates off and let them talk so I don't have to and then panic until I can set one of them off on another tangent. It's horrible and I always walk out of classes feeling like an idiot.",

      "text": "That sounds unpleasant, sorry!\n\nAlso, that sounds like kind of the point of seminars, to get better at finding worthwhile things to say and productive ways to engage in conversation with other people.\n\nAlso, some of this just sounds like maybe legit anxiety issues that might merit conversation with a counselor/therapist/psychiatrist.",

          "text": "I'm probably being more dramatic than it actually is. I come from a different background too so I think very differently than most of them and it makes it a pain. I finally got the courage to open my mouth and say something about a book because I made a connection the author hadn't and built this model framework and I was explaining it and they looked at me like I was crazy and confused. The professor had to come in and salvage it. When I have my own thought no one can respond to them and when I have something else, someone else says it first and I hate being in that position which I need to get over. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy school also has a habit of pulling teeth to make us discuss. Like sometimes we get into a really in depth discussion for an hour and a half and get through the content and have nothing else to say but they drag it out and basically force us to say the same things over and over and get mad at us as if we haven't read. I have one professor who lets us derail from time to time and we end up actually having good and productive conversations in there because we end up on useful tangents about careers and the craft and projects while still discussing in depth instead of painfully pulling teeth over readings that we've already torn apart.",
