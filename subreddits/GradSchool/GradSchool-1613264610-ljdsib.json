Four pages and who knows how many in-paragraph edits gone into the void, no unsaved document versions to be recovered, and I have no idea how it happened.  I usually back up everything to an external harddrive weekly but thanks to this incident I bit the bullet on cloud backup as well. Thank God for citation managers-if I didn't have one I'd really be up shit creek on the re-write. \n\nAnyways, don't be like me!
