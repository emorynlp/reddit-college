You can only do so much each day and a little everyday is all you need anyways. \n\nHope everybody has a great week and finds a moment for rest and reflection!", "author": "Apprehensive_Crow500", "created": 1620056491, "retrieved": 1632953873, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 390, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gwwmdgk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n3za29/remember_to_take_time_to_reflect_on_how_far_youve/gwwmdgk/", "text": "Thank-you for this.
