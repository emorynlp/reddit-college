So, I decided to study for masters in finance, but rn I study international relations (I'm a 4th year student) with 3.1GPA (from 4). So, realistically is there a chance to get accepted at a good university with my background studies and GPA? Also, I had several internships in field of finance (Bank and financial audit company). I also think, that I'll get 650+ in GMAT exam and I have 115 in Toefl exam. I'll be grateful for any advice.  \nThanks in advance guys ;)", "author": "IDK23DUDE", "created": 1631036669, "retrieved": 1632952784, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbykfgp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjs0cm/looking_to_study_for_masters/hbykfgp/", "text": "\u10d0\u10e0 \u10d5\u10d8\u10ea\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10ec\u10e3\u10ee\u10d0\u10e0\u10dd\u10d3:)", "author": "Academic-Air-3376", "created": 1631038410, "upvotes": 2}}}
