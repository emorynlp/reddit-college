  "text": "Maybe this sounds a little alarmist, but really -- [you never know what could happen](https://i.imgur.com/tW4s3rc.jpg). You are early-career academics and you don't want to lose years of your hard work, or data for future projects. We lost our personal desktops and a portion of the department servers/storage, and for some of us, those were the only backups in existence. No one was physically harmed in the fire, but the mental and career blow for some has been substantial. It's truly terrible.\n\nPersonally, I avoided buying a cloud storage subscription for the silly reason that I didn't have funding for it. It totally would have been worth it to pay out of my own pocket.\n\nKeep a couple physical backups *in different locations* and a cloud backup.",

          "text": "It's a mixed bag, to be honest. The work itself is pretty incredible -- I work with imaging data, so I get to check out fascinating pictures of galaxies as I'm analyzing them. Plus occasionally I get to travel to telescopes in amazing locations to gather more observations. My collaborators are generally very friendly, supportive, and relaxed, which is great -- although I know that is not always the case in the field. Otherwise I spend a lot of time programming, but I enjoy it. I feel like astronomers are one of those professions where you sort of become a jack of all trades -- you need to code, know some math and fundamental physics, do critical thinking, and have the communication skills to write or present your work in a clear, accesible way. I find that I have a lot of flexibility and variety in what I choose to work on, so it's never (ok, rarely) boring or repetitive.\n\nThe less great stuff are the \"side effects\" of being an astronomer. I like traveling, for sure! But I don't think I'm the type of person cut out to live in foreign countries for ~3 years at a time, especially when a new language is involved. But that is often part of the career if you want to stay employed. I could have limited my postdoc search to English-speaking countries, but that really cuts down the options (especially with I'm further limited by looking for positions relevant to my particular area of knowledge). Plus, it's simply stressful making frequent moves -- especially when they're international! A year ago I finally adopted a cat, after avoiding it for years because of the impermanence of my living situation. I'm so glad I have her now because she brings so much joy, but it's a lot of extra effort to make sure I have all the paperwork and everything she needs to fly with me whenever I move next.\n\nAlso, academic culture as a whole is pretty broken. This whole publish-or-perish mindset and the way a researcher's performance is judged is pretty unhealthy and does not support a good work-life balance. I think it is very slowly changing, but in its current state, I'm not sure I want to keep participating. I'm thinking a lot about whether or not I leave astronomy after this current postdoc. But, I'm also not terribly concerned about finding a job, because I know I have a variety of valuable skills.\n\ntl;dr: the concept of being an astronomer is great and it's super cool chipping away at your own personal contribution to our understanding of the universe. The reality of it comes with some hardships that can really affect your life satisfaction, depending on what you want in your life outside of your career.\n\nedit: also I gotta admit that it's pretty cool when being an astronomer comes up in conversation (especially around kids) because people always have so many questions and you can blow their minds with super cool space facts. I love being able to engage people's curiosity like that.",

      "text": "You don't even need to buy anything. Here's how to get encrypted cloud backups for absolutely free:\n\n1. Locate the folders that have the most important files. Try to stay below 10 gigabytes in total.\n\n2. Have a Google / OneDrive / etc. account.\n\n3. Install and set up [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/) (open source software).\n\n4. Duplicati will back up all your data in encrypted format (both filenames and contents) to whichever service you picked up (I use Google Drive as I inevitably have one and it gives 15Gb free space which is plenty enough for my most important stuff).\n\nIf you are more of a techie, you can also go with rclone. I recently switched to rclone because it's in Debian's package repositories, but either is a good choice. Duplicati is easier, rclone is more configurable. I have rclone run automatically every other hour, on the half hour.\n\nNow, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, etc. are not backup systems. They are for syncing. They aren't encrypted, they don't run on all systems, and they are not great at preserving file metadata. They can also corrupt your data. They are useful, and you can use backups and these cloud sync stuff in tandem, but they don't replace each other.\n\nTogether with the above, try to set up full local backups too. I have a Raspberry Pi 3B+ single board computer. It just sits by the router and has a 128Gb USB stick plugged in, and I do full backups of all my data to it (roughly) daily.\n\nNow, some of you may be using git or other version control systems, but they are not a replacement either. If an HDD gets corrupted, your repository (the .git/ subdirectory) can get corrupted too, in which case your history will get corrupted, and if there's enough corruption, your repo will become unusable. Had that happen to me.\n\n**tl;dr** cloud sync =/= cloud backups =/= git =/= local backups. Ideally you want to use all of them. Trust me, I've learned my lesson the hard way for each of those \"=/=\"s.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I got carried away by the memories of my horrible past of data losses and forgot to say: really sorry about what happened and lucky none of you were physically harmed. Sad that such a beautiful place burned down too.",

A little thanks and good fortune that nobody was hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm possibly more paranoid than most people about data loss and I'm possibly more tech savvy than most people but my advice in order of complexity (mind you I do *all* of these things):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) on your computer(s). I pay out of pocket because the school doesn't cover it.\n2. An external backup drive (USB plugged variety) that you connect every so often. (Time Machine or similar)\n3. A local NAS drive that your computer syncs to automatically ([Time Machine can talk to these usually](https://www.ixsystems.com/documentation/truenas/11.1/sharing.html))\n4. If the NAS runs TrueNAS then you can easily setup [cloud sync tasks](https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/tasks/cloudsynctasks/) like this one to download a copy of your Google Drive, Box, DropBox, or anything else onto local storage if your account is hacked or deleted.\n5. And if you are worried about having your actual email address hacked and deleted, or if you run your own domain then use something like [Cloudally](https://www.cloudally.com) or [Backupify](https://www.backupify.com). They sync your email account to a separate service online. Of course you need to trust them.... Trust... It all boils down to trust?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm a little paranoid about data loss. As a tangent to the home NAS I actually run a second home NAS which is just a backup target of the first home NAS if the home NAS fails..... I worked in IT before graduate school. Data loss is real.",

There's no way I can store than on harddrives or the cloud, but I also wouldn't *want* to store it on the cloud because it's private data and we have particular rules about data security. So unless you're going to pay for private server space somewhere else in the country and also pay to have your data transferred there with harddrives on a plane, it's not happening. You really do just have to trust that the supercomputer and servers won't go up in flames.\n\nI keep very time-limited, low resolution copies of my data and the files I used to make it (plus all the restart files), but that's all I can possibly save outside of my dedicated server space.",
