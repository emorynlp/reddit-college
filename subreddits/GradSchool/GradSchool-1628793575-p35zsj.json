Here's how to get encrypted cloud backups for absolutely free:\n\n1. Locate the folders that have the most important files. Try to stay below 10 gigabytes in total.\n\n2. Have a Google / OneDrive / etc. account.\n\n3. Install and set up [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/) (open source software).\n\n4. Duplicati will back up all your data in encrypted format (both filenames and contents) to whichever service you picked up (I use Google Drive as I inevitably have one and it gives 15Gb free space which is plenty enough for my most important stuff).\n\nIf you are more of a techie, you can also go with rclone. I recently switched to rclone because it's in Debian's package repositories, but either is a good choice. Duplicati is easier, rclone is more configurable. I have rclone run automatically every other hour, on the half hour.\n\nNow, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, etc. are not backup systems. They are for syncing. They aren't encrypted, they don't run on all systems, and they are not great at preserving file metadata. They can also corrupt your data. They are useful, and you can use backups and these cloud sync stuff in tandem, but they don't replace each other.\n\nTogether with the above, try to set up full local backups too. I have a Raspberry Pi 3B+ single board computer. It just sits by the router and has a 128Gb USB stick plugged in, and I do full backups of all my data to it (roughly) daily.\n\nNow, some of you may be using git or other version control systems, but they are not a replacement either. If an HDD gets corrupted, your repository (the .git/ subdirectory) can get corrupted too, in which case your history will get corrupted, and if there's enough corruption, your repo will become unusable. Had that happen to me.\n\n**tl;dr** cloud sync =/= cloud backups =/= git =/= local backups. Ideally you want to use all of them. Trust me, I've learned my lesson the hard way for each of those \"=/=\"s.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I got carried away by the memories of my horrible past of data losses and forgot to say: really sorry about what happened and lucky none of you were physically harmed.

[Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) on your computer(s). I pay out of pocket because the school doesn't cover it.\n2. An external backup drive (USB plugged variety) that you connect every so often. (Time Machine or similar)\n3. A local NAS drive that your computer syncs to automatically ([Time Machine can talk to these usually](https://www.ixsystems.com/documentation/truenas/11.1/sharing.html))\n4. If the NAS runs TrueNAS then you can easily setup [cloud sync tasks](https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/tasks/cloudsynctasks/) like this one to download a copy of your Google Drive, Box, DropBox, or anything else onto local storage if your account is hacked or deleted.\n5. And if you are worried about having your actual email address hacked and deleted, or if you run your own domain then use something like [Cloudally](https://www.cloudally.com) or [Backupify](https://www.backupify.com). They sync your email account to a separate service online. Of course you need to trust them.... Trust... It all boils down to trust?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm a little paranoid about data loss.
