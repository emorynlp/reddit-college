  "text": "Hey everyone,   \nI want to ask the board for your personal strategies in dealing with presentation anxiety. The issue is not one of capability; I am able to complete my work and to do it well, but whenever it comes to speaking in front of an audience of my peers, I feel quite anxious and feel the need for constant reassurance (I suspect this is because I am the type of person that wants to please others whenever possible). For anyone else here who has dealt with such feelings, what did you do to help yourself?",

      "text": "In Grad school we were required to go to Journal club on Wednesday nights. Two students were picked to present and we had a week to prepare. Usually a major paper from a big time Chemist. One had to analyze and dissect the paper and understand every single step of synthesis, why they did it this way, why not another way, What could the side products be, what could affect the yield....etc. it was all fair game. Profs, peers, visitors, anyone that wanted to attend, everyone was expected to participate and ask questions. New Grads would get maybe 2-3 presentations a quarter and the questions, while at the time punishing, were meant to teach several things. 1) presentation skills 2) nerves of steel when fielding questions that you both know and don't know the answers to 3) thinking on your feet 4) Developing a lightning fast analysis of synthesis....among other things.\n\nOne thing that I have found that is missing in modern Ph.D. programs (and MS programs) is presentation skills this way. Standing at a chalk/white board and being able to draw structures or other diagrams on the fly legibly, deduce outcomes, and field questions at the same time, and maintain a flowing presentation while doing it. it's a shame that it is not taught anymore to my knowledge....\n\nWe would be so shot full of holes by the end of our presentation that you would think they wouldn't be able to hit you anymore...you would be wrong. Once there is blood in the water the sharks circle and everyone takes a bite. But you see this wasn't meant to be cruel it was meant to prepare one for life outside of grad school and teach the lessons outlined above. When the time comes to be one of the peers in the audience it is expected that you provide the same education to the next generation of grad students.\n\nIn short please get some of your peers together and practice in front of them. Eventually it becomes inconsequential that you are presenting in front of someone much less your peers. I just read that someone mentioned beta blockers!!!!! Repetition in front of people will prepare you for it and you won't have to rely on meds.",

It is your subject, your prep, your presentation....You are the expert and everyone is there to hear you present. You might be nervous but you will do fine.",

I also always dress up in professional/semi-professional clothes that make me feel good and I know I look good in.",

      "text": "There are a lot of things you can try, some might even work, but in my experience, when the rubber really meets the road, no breathing exercises, happy place, or other tricks work. What has never failed me are beta blockers. An innocuous minimal dose taken sporadically, just an hour before big presentations, zero repercussions, and you'll appear as calm as if you're presenting to a mirror.",

      "text": "Exposure is really the only way to get over this without pharmacological intervention. I am always anxious before presenting, but I have gotten much better! If you can teach as part of your program I advise you do it. My public speaking skills skyrocketed after a single semester of teaching. Undergrads think post-grads are geniuses with all the answers and you are very rarely challenged, so it boosts your confidence considerably!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFew things I do before I actually start speaking: try to get into the room before anyone else if you can and just stand where you'll be presenting. For whatever reason, just being in the environment and figuring out where I am going to be helps me feel more comfortable when it is time to go. Deep breathing a few seconds before you begin, I will just have my slides up if I have them, or I will be looking at my notes and breathing - the audience thinks you're just prepping by looking at your notes. Bring a cup or water bottle and sip it every few sentences. This gives the illusion that you're calm and also slows you down, ensuring you don't just spew your words out and rush your presentation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt all costs try to avoid script reading - if you script read or read word for word from the slides you're going to have a bad presentation. A presentation is just a conversation with a large group of people where the whole audience has asked \"what is going on with your project\". No one knows your project like you, it's a simple fact.",
