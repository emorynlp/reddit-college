  "text": "So the main school I have my eye on is USC, although of course I\u2019m also applying to back ups. So far I noticed that USC does not require the GRE as it has been waived, but I took the exam already and scored pretty well (334). I was wondering if they\u2019ll still accept to look at scores? I feel like this will help my application and I\u2019ve been studying for this exam for the past two years.",
