You are 100 percent correct. Try and think about it differently though.....instead of thinking there is something you're forgetting, instead....think of it as...you have one billion different things to do. As a grad student who needs results, and mostly likely, publications, only a subset of those are actually necessary, and in fact, more than half of those billion things will either be not productive at all or productive and \"not interesting\". At least in my case, although I was given a billion things to do, only a few of them were the right and necessary ones to fully see out. In your case - you're doing the tasks and experiments (or whatever it is) that are worth remembering. Honestly this sounds very normal for a grad student, although it does suck....\n\nBut then again, I had an advisor that would take diametrically opposed opinions to my research f tells you to do something means you should actually do it. That sounds weird in maybe a commercial/job perspective but is really useful in an academic/student setting.\n\nEdit: sorry...but really talk, you're right.
