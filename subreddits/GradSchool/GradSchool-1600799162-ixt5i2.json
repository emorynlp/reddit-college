I\u2019ve cleaned the kitchen, done laundry, and cleaned the bathrooms. \n\nI have been dressed with make up and hair done since noon. And now I have been watching YouTube and trying to stay calm. I spent two years researching and writing a 92 page document. And was just told yesterday that there\u2019s a handful of typos :( so now I\u2019m kinda freaked out. I researched a very small area of history that has just been studied in the last handful of years. So my argument was very much a creative one based upon data from marriage records and artwork. I\u2019m prepared for any kind of questions that come my way, but UHG typos?!? :( \n\nI\u2019m the first in my family to earn an MA (in World and European History) and I am so proud but also, wow, it\u2019s been challenging to get this thesis done in the middle of COVID and a health scare that required major surgery two months ago. But I did it! This wait to defend is absolute torture! \n\nI have a bottle of wine and a yummy dinner to make right after the defense! I\u2019m freaked out but I know deep down it\u2019ll go well and all my hard work has led to this milestone.\n\nEdit: I am on standby as they discuss my fate lol.Omg. this is wild.", "author": "bookish0378", "created": 1600799162, "retrieved": 1632953389, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 505, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g6bg5pk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ixt5i2/defense_in_one_hour/g6bg5pk/", "text": "How\u2019d it go?!!", "author": "HawkExtreme", "created": 1600869362, "upvotes": 1}, "g6a9wb1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ixt5i2/defense_in_one_hour/g6a9wb1/", "text": "Congrats", "author": "Expatat40something", "created": 1600832083, "upvotes": 1}, "g6a19yt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ixt5i2/defense_in_one_hour/g6a19yt/", "text": "Congratulations.... :)", "author": "the_traumatized_kid", "created": 1600826815, "upvotes": 1}, "g69p2zf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ixt5i2/defense_in_one_hour/g69p2zf/", "text": "Good luck!", "author": "MrUnknown1996", "created": 1600819732, "upvotes": 1}, "g69lcfe": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ixt5i2/defense_in_one_hour/g69lcfe/", "text": "Update!
