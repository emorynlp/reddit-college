  "text": "So far today: I went to Dunkin and got a PSL. I\u2019ve cleaned the kitchen, done laundry, and cleaned the bathrooms. \n\nI have been dressed with make up and hair done since noon. And now I have been watching YouTube and trying to stay calm. I spent two years researching and writing a 92 page document. And was just told yesterday that there\u2019s a handful of typos :( so now I\u2019m kinda freaked out. I researched a very small area of history that has just been studied in the last handful of years. So my argument was very much a creative one based upon data from marriage records and artwork. I\u2019m prepared for any kind of questions that come my way, but UHG typos?!? :( \n\nI\u2019m the first in my family to earn an MA (in World and European History) and I am so proud but also, wow, it\u2019s been challenging to get this thesis done in the middle of COVID and a health scare that required major surgery two months ago. But I did it! This wait to defend is absolute torture! \n\nI have a bottle of wine and a yummy dinner to make right after the defense! I\u2019m freaked out but I know deep down it\u2019ll go well and all my hard work has led to this milestone.\n\nEdit: I am on standby as they discuss my fate lol.Omg. this is wild.",
