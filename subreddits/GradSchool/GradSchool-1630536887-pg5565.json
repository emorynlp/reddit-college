  "text": "Since starting my PhD, I have struggled with being consistent with my writing. It's gotten a lot better, but I still feel that I could be more disciplined about it.\n\nThis semester, my advisor asked if I would be interested in teaching a course on my own, which I was really excited about as I like working with students and it would look great on my resume.\n\nThe class has been going well, but it's 100 level, which means I have to remind students how to things like finding the intersection of two lines.\n\nI've never been more excited to open my dissertation file!",

It has opened my eyes a lot, about how others that know very little about what you are about to introduce, view my work. I learnt so much from my students and it has honestly put some colours into my blurry and mundane days of PhD to-do lists.",

I do 2 hours lectures and I used to think \"What would I talk about for 2 hours?\"\n\nTurns out 2 hours is just not enough... lol. It's a great experience to teach. I learn so much from this experience and my students.",

      "text": "On a somewhat related note, teaching a  course reminded me a lot about good practices in academic writing. For example, I emphasized to students that a layperson should be able to spot their argument(s) with little effort. When grading essays, I noted points where their description of evidence ends without any real analysis. Both are points that I have to remind myself of when writing, and teaching reinforced why it is important.",
