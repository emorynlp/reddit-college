The F31's timeline is pretty easy to find, which I find surprising for a federal system. Anyway, I was wondering if any of you science grads like me have any experience on when study section is for the AHA. The funding period starts on January first, so it can't be too long after submission.", "author": "CellMacabre", "created": 1631374574, "retrieved": 1632844647, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hcgl5f4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pm9kck/aha_study_section_timeline/hcgl5f4/", "text": "I think I found out about my funding from AHA in November or December after submitting in the summer.
