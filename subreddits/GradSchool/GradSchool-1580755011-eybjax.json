  "text": "I might have to miss class this week. I wrote this but haven't sent it yet. It is my first year in Medical school and I don't want to mess it up:\n\nDear Professor,\n\nMy Great Uncle is in the hospital right now and it's not looking good. If, God forbid, he dies in the next couple days before Thursday, then I will miss class next Tuesday for the funeral. If he dies on Friday or Saturday, then I will miss class on Thursday. I hope he can make it, but I am letting you know in advance just in case he doesn't. You know how important Medical School is to me, but unfortunately this is out of my control. I understand that this is an inconvenient time, but I can make the class up if necessary. If he can't make it past Saturday, then I can be on call the next class I am in. If he makes it past Saturday, and dies next week then the funeral will probably be on a Monday or Wednesday so I would not be missing class. However, it is impossible to know at this time if the funeral will be on a Tuesday or Thursday if he dies after two weeks from today. I will keep you in the know. Thank you for understanding.\n\nLove,\n\nStudent",

A family member is in the hospital and could be serious. I will let you know if the situation changes and will contact some classmates regarding missed lectures or assignments.\n\nThank you,\n\nMe\"\n\nI feel like your draft is a big long and contains information that is honestly none of the instructor's business. I find it's better to keep it simple and you can choose to disclose more later depending on the context or whether it's appropriate (i.e. if, god forbid, your family member passes away then you may mention missing class for a funeral but if he hasn't yet then there's no need).",
