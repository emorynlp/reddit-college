      "text": "I\u2019m currently in an MS statistics program and my undergrad was not in math or stats. Look up the prerequisites for the schools you are applying to. You most likely can\u2019t take at least a few of them at CC since upper div courses are only taught at 4 years, at least as far as Ik. If you\u2019re lacking any lower div, like calculus or linear, you can take those at CC. The rest of the upper div courses you can look for (or equivalent courses) at your current school",
