  "text": "I was up late last night trying to upload my docs in case I'd run in to trouble, and I ran into two particular errors. \n1. My file was not in TNR font. **\n2. Font size was not correct. \n\nFor 2, it may be your footnotes if this is how you are chosing to cite/reference. I screenshot mines and posted it as a figure, and the problem went away.\n\n**For 1, now this is the one that had me frustrated bc my doc was literally all TNR but I still ran into the error. The way I bypassed it was, \ni. sending the word doc to someone with a Mac\nii. having them save it as a PDF and check the box for online distribution and accessibility. \niii. Have them send it back then upload.\n\nGood luck to all of you applying. \n\n:)",
