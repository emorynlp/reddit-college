However, I just left for phd program this week and we both feel pretty miserable because of the long distance thing. We both miss each other very much. My wife is extremely not used to not living together while I\u2019m somewhat better than her in this regard. She was against me going to another state for phd before we got engaged but then she felt more confident about after the engagement. However, in March I received two offers, one is a program in a university that is 5 hours away by plane, and another one is a research associate position at a university 2 hours away by car but it has no guarantee of admission to phd next cycle. Later we decided that I would attend the university that is further away. The thing is, there is no chance she moves here since there is no job opportunities for her here. If I quit now I will not be able to work in US as I am not a US citizen. I probably made to wrong decision coming here but there\u2019s no way back now. I\u2019m not sure what is the correct thing for me to do. I really like the research I will be doing but I love my wife more. I miss her very much and on top of that I can\u2019t take her not being in a good shape because of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this is hard to follow, I am a bad story teller and I am typing on my phone", "author": "alex_o_O_Hung", "created": 1631246130, "retrieved": 1632952733, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"hccg13m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pldi7x/long_distance_marriage/hccg13m/", "text": "I'm a first year PhD student and my boyfriend is also a PhD student about a 12 hour drive away (thankfully, only a 2 hour flight).

This problem is more common than you might think and I know it can be very difficult. \n\nI'm currently long distance from my spouse, but my program is only a 2 hour drive from home and I can go home every weekend. For me, I couldn't have handled being far away and so I chose a program close enough to make it bearable. It has been tough on my husband (and me too), but we've made it work.\n\nI would have a pretty lengthy discussion with your spouse - and maybe a couples therapist - to help you figure out what to do. I followed my husband around for his degrees and I did sacrifice career opportunities along the way, but that is the choice I made. Being together was more important to me at the time. One person will probably have to compromise if you need to be in the same place or one person (or both of you) will have to compromise their expectations. \n\nIf you do stay long distance, definitely make plans for weekend visits and video calls. Also, the first few weeks are always the worst, and the more you both find activities and friends in your towns, the easier it gets. It just takes time to adjust.

My husband is doing a postdoc 8 hours away. It's incredibly difficult.  We've only been long-distance for two months, but we set expectations for how we would proceed a year ago when he got the postdoc.   We try and see each other once a month.  I think that knowing we are going to still be able to see each other has helped a lot. \n\nI would take a hard look at your career goals and see if you actually need a Ph.D. for it.

My hubby and I did long-distance for 2 years while in undergrad and during his masters. I went off for my masters and we did another semester apart before we decided that it wasn't worth it and I dropped out so that we could be together. I do hope to someday go back and finish my masters but I won't if I have to do long-distance again. Being together is more important to both of us right now. \n\nIt might be worth writing up a list of pros and cons to see what the benefits of continuing your PhD versus dropping out would be. Things like potential better jobs down the road or more opportunities might be pros while things like spending more time apart and missing out on being able to spend those few years with your wife (because long-distance is really hard emotionally for both of you) might be a few of the cons. Talk to your wife too and see what she thinks about those pros and cons and how you leaving your PhD might affect your combined future. \n\nBest of luck to you both, it's a hard decision but I hope you are both happy with whatever you decide.", "author": "RonnyTwoShoes", "created": 1631253907, "upvotes": 3}, "hca336z": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pldi7x/long_distance_marriage/hca336z/", "text": "Could really use some advice", "author": "alex_o_O_Hung", "created": 1631252955, "upvotes": 2}}}
