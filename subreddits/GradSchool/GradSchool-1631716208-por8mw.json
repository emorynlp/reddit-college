In my country, only my University has a bioinformatics major, so It's not popular here, and there are fewer opportunities in the research and job field. I wanted to do some research in bioinformatics but couldn\u2019t do so. However, one of my professors approached me to write a review paper. But this review paper is in the environmental science field and not related to bioinformatics whatsoever.\n\nI want to go to grad school in the USA after graduating. So I am really just confused that this kind of paper unrelated to my field will help me get into grad school.", "author": "Sunflower361", "created": 1631716208, "retrieved": 1632952586, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hd1s8wu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/por8mw/is_a_review_paper_unrelated_to_my_major_worth/hd1s8wu/", "text": "It's kind of a good and bad situation at the same time. Having published papers is always helpful for getting into grad school and generally for your academic career. However, in the interview process, they could ask you what prompted you to write a review paper in an area that wasn't related to your field per say. I think to publishing it would be worse. If asked in an interview, you can craft logic to establish relevance and connectivity of the paper with your desired filed. As a researcher and academic writer, you should be able to do that.", "author": "razingcheeses", "created": 1631773199, "upvotes": 2}, "hcyycdg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/por8mw/is_a_review_paper_unrelated_to_my_major_worth/hcyycdg/", "text": "Some grad school application pages actually mention this explicitly: they very much prefer research papers to review papers. Some even mention how they prefer research papers from other, less relevant fields more than review papers from the particular field of the grad programme.
