Maybe this is also why there are widespread misconceptions about scientific results etc? Perhaps there ought to be more movies/TV shows that take place within the context of academia that dispel some of these notions (Sort of like what the West Wing was for politics), which may also be useful for grad student problems etc to be taken more seriously.", "author": "universaladaptoid", "created": 1594156922, "retrieved": 1632845752, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 459, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fxbvurq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hn3ehd/the_various_discussions_online_about_the_recent/fxbvurq/", "text": "Yea, people don't know shit about how any of this works.

I was *shocked* when I found out that I didn\u2019t have to pay for anything!! I listen to a handful of science and tech podcasts that I think could benefit from some episodes and interviews on careers in research, academia, etc. Something like how Darknet Diaries does a good job at shedding light some uncommon and really cool jobs in cyber security and how you can get them.

The main drive behind it is that a portion of the US population feels that \"foreigners\" are invading the US and stealing jobs and education spots from them. They feel that that's why the country is suffering from economic downturn and why quality of life has decreased for some populations over the past decades. Those foreigners are less human than \"''Muricans\" and need to know their place.
