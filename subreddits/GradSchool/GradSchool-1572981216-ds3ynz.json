In grad school, not only do you have a lot of actual tasks, but as you're doing those tasks, your worth as a scientist and ability to think critically is constantly being judged and evaluated, and it can have a toll on your self-esteem.", "author": "krystalrose219", "created": 1572981216, "retrieved": 1632953225, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 760, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"f79aqic": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ds3ynz/i_feel_like_people_dont_understand_that_the/f79aqic/", "text": "Wambulance on the way", "author": "NewGuy4buds", "created": 1573504930, "upvotes": 1}, "f6piym6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ds3ynz/i_feel_like_people_dont_understand_that_the/f6piym6/", "text": "I did 3x the more experiments i do now when i worked as lab tech, but that was simple because i only had to be good at techniques.
