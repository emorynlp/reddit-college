  "title:": "To do Masters in Mathematics as a software engineer?",
  "text": "Hi all, I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in 4 different companies, so I have reasonable experiences in both breadth and depth (frontend, backend, infrastructure, devops, Golang, python, Java, typescript, c++, mysql, Elasticsearch, kubernetes, aws etc)\n\nWith finally enough savings, I want to find work opportunities in the US, either directly or via school admission as a backup. \n\nI noticed that the computer science masters admission across US have been cutthroat competitive, even rank 50+ requires a gpa ~ 3.6 and gre q:166 v:155.\n\nGiven that my gpa is ~2.7 range and in a totally unrelated major, I want to look for alternatives to improve my chance of admission. So I am looking at less competitive courses like Mathematics, and also due to interest.\n\nHow will employers in US look at a software engineer with a maths major compared to a computer science major? Will I be disadvantaged?",
