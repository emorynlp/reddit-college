  "text": "I'm a senior undergrad in biotech and I am at an impasse. \n\nDo I do a master's or a Ph.D.?\n\nMy goal is to work in the industry, hopefully working with a company that focuses on developing new treatments for disease. \n\nI've received opinions from advisors for both and I'm really not sure. A Ph.D. takes a lot longer but most are funded. Masters are shorter but finding funding is much more difficult. \n\nGiven my career aspirations, what would you recommend?",

      "text": "You can get a funded Master's in Canada easily enough. I wouldn't recommend taking a funded PhD spot with the intention of mastering out, it feels skeezy and you're taking the spot of someone who was actually intending to complete the degree, being dishonest with your advisor, etc. Don't do a PhD unless either you really want to, or your job requires it.",
