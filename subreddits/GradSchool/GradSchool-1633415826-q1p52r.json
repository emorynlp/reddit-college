But I can\u2019t imagine going part time with work either.\n\nI know I can handle 1 course at a time along with work, but then I won\u2019t finish for another 5-6 years. Has anyone tried this? Is this more costly in the long run in any way?",

      "text": "In terms of financial cost, it may be more expensive to complete your program over a longer period because of how fees are charged. For instance, many programs charge a flat rate for things like academic support fees, health and wellness fees, and the like. Some programs also charge a continuation fee if students do not take at least a certain number of credits in a specific length of time. While these fees are relatively low when compared to tuition but they can add up.\n\nIn terms of lost time and potential earnings, this would vary drastically by field. If you are currently working in the field you wish to be in, and your program is the next step to advancing in your career, then the experience may cover any sort of perceived lost potential.\n\nMuch like any difficult choice in life, there is no right answer here. Personally, 5-6 years does feel like a long time for what I assume is a \"2-year\" master's program. But even if you go down to 1 course a term now, there is nothing stopping you from going up to 2 or 3 later in your program should you feel like you can better handle the workload or your circumstances change.",
