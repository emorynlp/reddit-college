  "title:": "Should I drop my MA? (I\u2019m in a dual degree program getting my masters in WGSS and my JD)",
  "text": "As the end of the semester nears I am plagued with anxiety about completing my final papers for my courses and I\u2019m having major doubts about even completing my MA program. I decided to pursue my Masters in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies so that I could retain my ability to critically analyze material from an intersectional feminist lens and carry it with me to law school. \nHowever, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve actually been LEARNING anything in my classes. 90% of my responsibilities include reading, annotating, and writing, but with little to no feedback it is impossible to determine my progress. I hate teaching myself and forcing meaning out of things bc I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m getting the gist of the articles correctly. And when I get to a topic or set of readings that is too dense for me I just use a skip on my reflection assignment. I feel like I\u2019m cheating myself by doing this but I have no other way to learn the material. I\u2019m tired of doing busy work every single week that doesn\u2019t even connect to my thesis. Mind you, I have gotten minimal direction in the development of my thesis, I have no secured mentors, and I\u2019m not even fully confident in my selected topic. When I voiced my concerns the head of my department dismissed them as being \u201cnormal\u201d for first year grad students. But I didn\u2019t walk away with any concrete solutions to my dilemma other than reaching out to my professors and seeing if they can help me develop a topic for my final papers that correlates to my thesis. (Again, I feel like I\u2019m being forced to make my own meaning out of things that are supposed to be being TAUGHT to me. I am also concerned that if this lack of direction continues my MA thesis will detract from completing my JD (the dual degree program is 4 years rather than 5 if I completed the degrees separately so naturally there is a year of overlap). \nFurthermore, the more I\u2019ve been learning about the ins and outs of conducting research and the insanely bureaucratic processes within the IRB the less passionate I become about doing research. It seems inherently exploitative and unethical to me to be completing research on vulnerable populations just for my own academic benefit. If I can\u2019t do anything with my research findings to help these populations then I\u2019m doing them an incredible disservice.\nShould I finish out the semester and then drop my program? Or should I just drop now and save myself the unnecessary stress?",
