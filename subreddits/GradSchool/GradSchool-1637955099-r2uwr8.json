  "text": "Hi Reddit \n\nI need some advice and/or to vent or something. This semester, I\u2019ve really been struggling with major feelings of self doubt and negative self talk. It doesn\u2019t feel like \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d so much as just really bad doubt. I say it doesn\u2019t feel like imposter syndrome because in these feelings of self doubt, I can see, objectively, how much I\u2019ve learned in my short 1.5 years of my PhD. I also don\u2019t doubt that when I applied, I was qualified, and that I was admitted to the program because I was qualified. I guess I just doubt my ability to succeed now that I\u2019m here. \n\nThe sources of these feelings are one class that I\u2019m taking that is particularly intimidating and my research that just feels like one road block after another. I\u2019m at a point where I dread waking up, I dread going to class, I dread doing my work, and generally I dread being here. I also dread my future, because I have found since starting grad school that I don\u2019t want to do academia, but my options for industry are basically limited to what this class that I hate so much is about. Now I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing this PhD for if I don\u2019t like what I can do with, or without it. It\u2019s hard to feel motivated to do a PhD when you no longer see an end goal. \n\nBasically, I look at everyone else, either friends or just random strangers that I see going about their day, and I think \u201cI wonder if they are confident in their intelligence\u201d or \u201cI wonder if they like their life\u201d and also \u201cI wonder what it is like to be so smart you know you\u2019re smart\u201d or \u201cI wonder what it is like to like your life and to see what you\u2019re waking up for.\u201d \n\nI am seeing a therapist and we\u2019re slowly working through a lot of stuff together, excluding and including this. I recently told her about all of this so I know we\u2019re going to be working on this when I see her next (which unfortunately can\u2019t be until January). She suggested the Coursera \u201cthe science of well-being course\u201d which I\u2019ve enrolled in to audit. But in the meantime, those of you who\u2019ve been here before, do you have advice?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t have many words of advice, but just came here to say I feel your pain. A lot of what you are experiencing resonates with me. I\u2019m also 1.5 years in and am trying to crawl out of this hole too. \n\nWhat you just described is a VERY common experience. I also think it comes in waves. Remember that if most people feel this way at some point in their program, we ALL have doubted our abilities at some point. And yet somehow, we still make it through! Think of all the people you know with a PhD\u2026there\u2019s some great ones, some mediocre ones, and some awful ones. You will decide which one you will be! And, if the awful ones could do it, you can too!!!\n\nI hope your therapist helps, and I also hope you find your \u201cpurpose\u201d again.",
