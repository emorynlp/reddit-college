Odds are you\u2019ll realize you were completely wrong about yourself in 4 years. For example, I applied to transfer freshman year thinking surely that\u2019s all I wanted to do. Ended up getting in everywhere I applied and not even submitting half the apps I prepared. Then ended up staying where I was. Then ended up changing my gradschool plans and even moving somewhere completely different than I thought I wanted to live. Now I\u2019m rethinking things again lol. Only now after like 5 difference instances of realizing I was too narrow minded have I started to relax my constraints on my expectations for myself and realize that there\u2019s probably things in my future that I haven\u2019t even considered yet. \n\nSecondly, just do research in a lab. That\u2019s the only answer. Forget science club, grad schools don\u2019t care about that. Google search every faculty in your department and find someone who\u2019s doing research that you can get behind. Then work for them. It\u2019ll take some time to get a publication, but that\u2019s your ticket into grad school (also their letter of recommendation). That\u2019s literally it.", "author": "gentleboys", "created": 1631625274, "upvotes": 1}, "hcr3025": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnn3jq/hello_guysss_i_am_a_first_year_bachelor_student_i/hcr3025/", "text": "Maintain a positive close professional relationship with your professors (Very good for recommendations later on.), make sure to take courses that require more research than multiple choice or short answers for exam, make sure your GPA is above 3.5 to be competitive, make sure to conduct a capstone project that you are passionate about and with a professor whom you have an interest in their research, make sure to volunteer as a tutor for a couple of semesters if you can (good for work experience in your resume). If you do all of these, mention them in your CV and statement of purpose/intent, you'd have an attractive file.
