I gotta do part time job and since i am in foreign country and live independently, i gotta cook, clean, go to the shops and do lots of self study. I can join that club and find time from my busy schedule if it helps me in the future during application to masters",

      "text": "Firstly, you\u2019re a freshman so don\u2019t hold yourself to any ideas of what you think you want now. Odds are you\u2019ll realize you were completely wrong about yourself in 4 years. For example, I applied to transfer freshman year thinking surely that\u2019s all I wanted to do. Ended up getting in everywhere I applied and not even submitting half the apps I prepared. Then ended up staying where I was. Then ended up changing my gradschool plans and even moving somewhere completely different than I thought I wanted to live. Now I\u2019m rethinking things again lol. Only now after like 5 difference instances of realizing I was too narrow minded have I started to relax my constraints on my expectations for myself and realize that there\u2019s probably things in my future that I haven\u2019t even considered yet. \n\nSecondly, just do research in a lab. That\u2019s the only answer. Forget science club, grad schools don\u2019t care about that. Google search every faculty in your department and find someone who\u2019s doing research that you can get behind. Then work for them. It\u2019ll take some time to get a publication, but that\u2019s your ticket into grad school (also their letter of recommendation). That\u2019s literally it.",

      "text": "Maintain a positive close professional relationship with your professors (Very good for recommendations later on.), make sure to take courses that require more research than multiple choice or short answers for exam, make sure your GPA is above 3.5 to be competitive, make sure to conduct a capstone project that you are passionate about and with a professor whom you have an interest in their research, make sure to volunteer as a tutor for a couple of semesters if you can (good for work experience in your resume). If you do all of these, mention them in your CV and statement of purpose/intent, you'd have an attractive file. Also optional, but you could also read books in relation to what you are interested in and can bring them up as a sidenote in your statement of interest/purpose, to emphasize that you are an avid reader and are capable of taking in readings.",

              "text": "That's awesome, I believe that biochemical engineers have amazing job prospects!\n\nI would still recommend getting experience in some type of laboratory/research setting. This makes it easier to get close to professors and other researchers that can write good letters of recommendation. Plus it'll give you a better idea of what area you want to work in. I have a lot of lab experience as a biology major and it really helped me to cross some research fields off of my list, since biology can cover so many different areas. Like others said, GPA is important, so you should do your best to maintain your grades. However, GPA is not everything so do not stress too much. You can get into a good graduate program with a low GPA if you have a great personal statement and relevant experience. Involvement in clubs and extracurriculars is also great, because it shows you are not just defined by your studies so I definitely recommend that for balancing your application.",
