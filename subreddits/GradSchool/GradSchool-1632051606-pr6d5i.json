Currently, I'm doing my masters in Philosophy with some courses from social sciences.\n\nWhen I was applying for grad schools the previous fall, I realised that grad schools in social sciences usually require atleast some coursework in statistics, some maths, research methods, and of course, genuine interest in topics of social sciences and how they connect to what you're studying now. \n\nProbably you don't need to worry too much at this point, but just keep taking courses which will help broaden your understanding of social sciences and how it can be connected to philosophy and french. For example, a course in Philosophy of Social Science, Social Metaphysics, Philosophy of Science, etc. will definitely help. If possible, audit courses or take electives from the department of sociology. Just stay in touch with people from multiple backgrounds and try to attend their events! In your grad school applications, you can always stand out because of your diverse background and interests, rather than thinking of it as a 'weakeness'. Just depends on what you can bring to the table.", "author": "breadjupiter", "created": 1632055049, "upvotes": 2}}}
