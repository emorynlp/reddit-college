  "title:": "I switched advisors half way through my Masters. I am happier but very pressed for time. My family wants to visit for a week during my 3 week winter break when I am supposed to put in the most lab time.",
  "text": "I don't know what to do. My mom starts crying when I tell her I can't host her for a week and that I am very busy. I live in a one bedroom apartment and can't get any work done while having three people stay with me. If they got a hotel and spent some days entertaining themselves I would be fine, but my mom wants to stay in my apartment and do something with me every day. The last time she visited she stayed a full week longer than planned. \n\nI really can't host her. I was planning on just taking Christmas off since my PI won't be around. My boyfriend is talking about visiting for a long weekend during the holidays which I am fine with. My mom thinks if I let him visit than I should agree to host my entire nuclear family for a week. She can't seem to wrap her head around the difference in time commitment she is asking. Not to mention that my family is messy and I always need to spend a full day cleaning after they leave.\n\nShe never was good about understanding my workload. As an undergrad my birthday always fell during midterms, and she would freak out until I agreed to do a week of birthday celebrations at the expense of my midterms. I feel the celebrations are for her, not for me. I would try and get her to celebrate the next week or the week before but it always resulted in tears and rage from her.",

If they do show up and you have to host them an entire week you'll be nothing but stressed about the the work you're not doing and how much harder you're going to have to work to catch up the whole time. Trust me on that one when my family comes to visit and I've procrastinated Im always stressed about skipping out on work I need to be doing.   \nI'd be blunt with your mom that you need the winter break time to catch up on lab work and losing an entire week or more would set you back and be really stressful for you.",

She is destroying the family by minimizing your needs, boundaries, and autonomy. We just had this exact conversation with a family member in the past year. It was awful but they needed to be told no. There is still zero respect for our decisions but atleast they no longer attempt to manipulate us. All gatherings are mutually agreed on now. We ended up just hanging up on the person and ignoring all attempts at contact for a period of time but that's not for everyone.\n\nOn a personal note, therapy could help you explore how you want to handle this. My school does free zoom sessions to help it be less time consuming if that's an option for you. It is so hard to create boundaries with people you care about.",
