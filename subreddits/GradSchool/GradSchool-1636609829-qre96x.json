  "title:": "Carrier Advice : MS in CS or MS in Robotics",
  "text": "Hi Guys,\n\nI need your suggestions on my carrier path for Masters, if what I am thinking below is rational or illogical. Please provide ur inputs. It means a lot to me.\n\n**My Story:**\n\nI did my BTech in Mechnical Engineering and I mostly worked with FSAE and BAJA cars. There we were design, test and built ATV and formula-style vehicles.\n\nThen I switched the stream to explore software as it was booming and want to learn it because even the mech industry is shifting towards that. And now I (25 years) am working as a software development engineer in a good MNC.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nIn software, I feel the physical aspects of design and seeing something working in real life is missing. And I think I miss it. Because from the early life I mostly adore cars and bikes :P\n\n**Your Suggestions:**\n\nI think in future I may be looking for work in Robotics, but I am very afraid to join MS in Robotics. And I am deciding to choose MS in CS.\n\nThe logic behind that with CS I am gaining a new skill set in a very big arena instead of Robotics which is specialised to Robotics.\n\nThough I know I can't master everything but at least having some knowledge of CS and ME would be better than MS in specialised field of Robotics.\n\nThe big doubt here is I am not sure of what I like in the future and I am still in the exploratory phase and I guess that is the root cause of all this.\n\nPlease let me know ur thoughts on this.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for ur help. :)",
