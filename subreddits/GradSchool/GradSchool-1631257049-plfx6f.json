Also, everything is so overwhelming that I just want to drop out and move back to my city. \n\nDo you guys have tips? Were any of you simply terrible in stats and somehow improved? If so, how? At this point I don't know if I'm just too dumb or if it's a self fulfilling prophecy of assuming I can't do it and it's too hard and as a result not studying. Especially when it comes to exams... my mind just blanks. So clearly, I'm not understanding anything *(at least back in undergrad). \n\nAlso how the heck am I supposed to turn a bunch of data into a paper? Conduct multiple studies while doing a masters and churning out papers while doing the stupid stats course. \n\nIt's all just so overwhelming...", "author": "wkdus03", "created": 1631257049, "retrieved": 1632844671, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hcc2a8i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plfx6f/i_dont_know_if_im_cut_out_for_grad_school/hcc2a8i/", "text": "Let's start with the first part.\n\nNoone came into grad school kicking ass on anything.  Some people might have had a leg up, sure.  But most of those skillsets were fostered by slogging through and building those skills one brick at a time.  \n\nStart with something.  Just anything.  Get feedback (advisor, other grad student, people).  Try to think why they're saying X, Y, and Z.  Read research papers, but not with a focus on fully understanding the content, but rather how did they structure their arguments and their paper.  Usually, Introduction talks about why this is important.  Background is about the actual background of the methods.  Methodology is just what they did.  Results is the numbers and an analysis.  Conclusion is the answers your results show.  Look how each writer paints the picture using this base framework, how they approach these arguments.  \n\nThis is difficult.  The way I see it, part of understanding this will include sweats and tears.  But over time it'll get easier.  You'll get the general idea and structure.  You'll recognize that almost everyone uses this structure, but each author has varying levels of quality in how they're able to pain the picture clearly.\n\nYou'll do great.  If you feel overwhelmed, always ask questions and try to address the things that you don't know about.  Most people don't ask questions in class because they don't want to ask what might get an obvious answer.  But by asking you're getting the guidance you need to move forward.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1631294109, "upvotes": 1}, "hcb9lfo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plfx6f/i_dont_know_if_im_cut_out_for_grad_school/hcb9lfo/", "text": "Listen, graduate school is completely overwhelming by nature. It isn\u2019t supposed to be easy and, trust me, it won\u2019t be but you\u2019ll find your strengths along the way. I am also god awful at statistics. I genuinely believed my statistics class was going to be the end of me. That said, there were plenty of other classes and opportunities I had that made me feel like I was meant to be in grad school because I enjoyed them so much and they came so easily to me. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel the same eventually. \n\nYou\u2019re going to improve. You\u2019re going to find your strengths. Your weaknesses are going to get less weak over time. \n\nI always say that the most difficult part of grad school is learning how to be a grad student. It is all encompassing and it takes awhile to acclimate. You\u2019ll be just fine.

At one point I got a 42% on an exam. I felt like my heart would beat out of my chest during class. You've gotta separate the anxiety from the content. Not to recommend better living through chemistry, but going on propranolol for a bit really helped with that. In any case, anxiety at this point is normal. Work through it and don't let it control you. \n\nYour ability to perform analysis on command in a stats exam does not determine your abilities as a scientist. My stats professor even agreed.  It is certainly an essential part of our work, but so is experimental design, lab techniques, lit research, writing, presenting, and communicating. You'll be better at some things than others. Find colleagues or people in you cohort to work with so you can share strengths - which is another essential skill as a scientist - collaboration.", "author": "Pr0gr3s", "created": 1631278929, "upvotes": 3}, "hcaowiz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plfx6f/i_dont_know_if_im_cut_out_for_grad_school/hcaowiz/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1631270969, "upvotes": -14}}}
