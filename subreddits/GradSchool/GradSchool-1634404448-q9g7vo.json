But my masters advisor wanted me to take an electrical math class which I don't even meet pre-requisites for and bombed the first exam.\n\nI don't know how to get back from here? Any advice from who was in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.",

It really is important to learn. \n\nIf you're struggling with the math, then I'm afraid there is little to do except practice. \n\nOne thing I will say though, is that I've found that when things are boring, it's typically because it's being communicated in a way that doesn't appeal to me. I've been in school for over ten years now - I've had subjects that bored the shit out of me, but when I took a similar class it was fascinating. Sometimes it's just a crappy teacher, or a medium of learning that doesn't work for me. \n\nThere's a bunch of learning models out there (e.g. kolbe, Silverman etc) and they all show a spectrum. This means that depending on where you lie, the class may not match up. \n\nSo you may want to watch some YouTube lectures or read some interesting papers to spark your interest. Worked for me pretty often, particularly when I had a boring teacher.",

But that doesn't mean you half ass them.\n\nSo think of it as the emerging professional you are becoming in grad school, not with with an undergraduate mentality. It doesn't all have to be about what excites you. Unless you're prepared to take a W in the class, you put in the effort because you've already made the commitment by signing up for the class.\n\nPlus, as Warren Buffett famously says, the best investment you make is in yourself. He encourages people to put forth their best into their coursework, because you don't know for sure what you're going to get out of it until later.",
