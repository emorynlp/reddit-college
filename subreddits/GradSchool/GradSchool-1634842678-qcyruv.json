  "text": "Sitting in lectures,  its obvious that I am amongst the smartest people there.\n\nAll my professors tell me that they like the interaction and questions I bring to their class.\n\n\nI'm not trying to brag or anything. I hope I don't come off that way.\n\nIt's just... I'm trying to paint this picture of where I am as a student. I do great on all my assignments, I do my pre class readings. Others complain about how long an assignment takes them and I end up finishing the same assignment in half the time they took.\n\n\nBut come exam season? nope.\n\nIt's midterm season and I just have panic attack after panic attack to the point of being unable to study. This is exactly what happened in my under graduate course too.\n\nI know my shit and it shows. I understand concepts as well as anyone else.\n\n\nBut when it comes to exam season and I have three courses and 6 modules to study from while feeling the pressure of \"if I don't do well I won't get a good GPA and I need a 3.5 at the very least\"\n\nThen things stop being so fun. I have an assignment due tonight and I haven't gotten close to finishing it cause there is two questions that confuse me and even thinking about it causes me a panic attack.\n\nI just simply do not believe that I belong here anymore. I can't do it. I'm not calm and collected like others. \n\n\nI've seen it a million times before.\n\nPeople who don't understand the material are good at memorizing a bunch of facts and find themselves scoring 90/100. I do not like what I am here",

      "text": "Sounds like you have bad anxiety and should talk to a friend psychiatrist. My anxiety got really bad during grad school until I finally gave in and saw one and we decided that getting on anti-anxiety meds would be helpful. The medication and counseling definitely helped with the anxiety, and even though I still have it I can deal with it much more efficiently than I could before I got help.",

I know plenty of people at my school that had similar issues as me and went on medication and saw improvements in anxiety and mental health.",
