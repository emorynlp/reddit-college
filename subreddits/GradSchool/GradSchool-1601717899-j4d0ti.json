I\u2019ve always believed that the biggest problem lies in these facts:\n\nA) Most professors in the real world will not be at big R1s and will therefore have more teaching-focused jobs.\n\nB) Terminal degrees are overwhelmingly awarded at big R1s, where professors\u2019 advancement, pay and job security is rarely tied to teaching performance. These professors tend to have very little teacher training and are even disincentivized to be dedicated to their teaching. \n\nIt follows that with the exception of rare bright spots, grad students are trained as if they will work at research-focused jobs and given very little formalized teacher training. Good teachers coming out of R1s are more often than not autodidacts, people with previous teaching experience, or the people who didn\u2019t really fit into their terminal degree program to begin with.", "author": "Harmania", "created": 1601730621, "upvotes": 28}, "g7idjs3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/j4d0ti/rprofessors_is_a_scary_scary_place/g7idjs3/", "text": "I follow both of those subs (I just graduated grad school and am starting my job as an assistant professor). I actually think that sub is a lot better. This one is 70% venting about grad school sucking, bad advisors, and a lack of a social life, and then it\u2019s 30% really helpful resources or legitimate questions. That sub is a good 50% venting, and don\u2019t get me wrong I definitely don\u2019t agree with all of it, but it\u2019s also a good 50% resources.\n\nThe more you teach, the more I think the venting will make sense to you. And if you look through the thread you highlighted you\u2019ll notice that the OP did get critiqued for that point about prioritizing his class. So it\u2019s not like the sub is a toxic pool of hate\u2014they call out the BS a lot more than I\u2019ve seen on this sub.\n\nThat sub has also been so helpful in giving me ideas about how to write good exam questions, how to encourage students to come to office hours, what kind of boiler plate language to put in my syllabus, how to handle student cheating, how to be compassionate towards students, how to talk to your colleagues and navigate office politics, how to balance teaching and research, etc. There\u2019s some bad posts every now and then, but they tend to get called out in the comments and there\u2019s way more bad than good.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe that happens here, look for one of the meta posts that gets posted every so often where someone basically says \u201cI read all these posts and grad school sounds so awful, why would I ever want to go?!\u201d And then the comments are people going, \u201cno, it\u2019s not that bad, there\u2019s lots of good stuff too...\u201d The overwhelming view on this sub is negative, it\u2019s just directed at ourselves and sometimes our advisors instead of students so you think it\u2019s somehow better. It\u2019s not.\n\nAlso, I see one of these posts here every now and then about r/professors being toxic. Look, if a sub isn\u2019t for you then it isn\u2019t for you. But as you teach more and more I encourage to you lurk there and look for tips. And yes, when you\u2019re having a bad day it\u2019ll be much healthier to go vent there than to take it out on your students or anyone else.\n\nTLDR: rhat post you highlighted was dumb but hardly representative of the sub as a whole, and overall I think that sub is more useful and less venting than this sub", "author": "zarza_mora", "created": 1601730467, "upvotes": 168}, "g7idinq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/j4d0ti/rprofessors_is_a_scary_scary_place/g7idinq/", "text": "Holy shit, OP in that thread was a total asshole.
