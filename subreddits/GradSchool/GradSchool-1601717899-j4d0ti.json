Also academia seems not much different than any other industry. Research topics & fundings are often driven by money/corporate interests and trends. So for example, a lot of academics jumped at the opportunity to write a COVID research paper asap, but most of those papers turn out to be garbage. People form committees to look good, and not because they genuinely want to improve the quality of education they're providing. I'm honestly kinda afraid to spill all the juicy details I've heard from her over the years in case anyone online can identify her from the stories \ud83d\ude05",

Professors should be compassionate with students that have jobs and are paying their own way, etc. I've heard some pretty terrible reasons from students as to why their work wasn't done.

The prof I had who was like this, I had 2 classes with. Emailed him explaining how I had to work to pay for school, rent and food and he didn't care. Told the classmates in my final project group that \"i had just disappeared\". They know him for who he is now and no one has gone to him for undergrad research.

However if you honestly think teaching is all roses and daisies and if you just love and value your students and give it your 100% best and they'll do they same, you're believing in a fairy tale and you're going to be extremely disillusioned. Especially with the classes we grad students teach (usually 100 level gen ed requirements like freshman comp or whatever) our classes are hoops to jump through. Maybe 2/20 will want to be there because they're nerds like us, 14/20 will just keep their heads down and do the work, and then the last 4 will be actively resisting you the entire way because they resent they'll have to take your class at all. They will fail, not at the skills you're trying to teach, which is understandable--they will fail at READING AND FOLLOWING BASIC DIRECTIONS. And then they'll blame YOU because they didn't show up to class all semester or turn in homework, and best case scenario they just send you passive aggressive, blame-deflecting emails, worst case scenario, they'll escalate and try to make your life hell. And heaven help you if you happen to get a football player who tries to leverage THAT. All this to say, there are a lot of terrible students out there, and teachers deserve a place to vent about it. Don't judge them until you've taught classes yourself.",

Considering what he did before teaching (heading up Disney's live entertainment efforts and creating basically every nighttime and daytime show the company ever had), he deserves every penny. Plus he's a nice person, which always helps. I'm about the only person who calls him professor (but I'm probably a bit too formal at times). There's a reason why people say to take his classes - they're easy, but if you want to learn about what it actually takes to produce entertainment in a theme park setting, he's basically the only one willing to talk about it. Stories are incredible. Way too many to even start sharing. I'd be here all day!\n\nDoctor is a title very rarely used here, even if you have it, or else students and teaching-focused faculty consider you to have your head up your own asshole. Now the administration likes the money they provide in research, but they always value teaching more. Makes sense too, considering that otherwise UCF is just a mid-tier R1 with not much else going for it in terms of teaching.\n\nUnfortunately... The majority of even adjunct spots at the particular college are required to have a JD or PhD for any particular chance at landing an interview. Masters at minimum, but you better have a decade of experience instead of a PhD. Although they can never fill this requirement, despite people from the industry literally asking to teach classes, so they default to PhD students, who are often unprepared, unknowledgeable, and who can barely speak or understand English, to fill in.",

Don't ask me why, but it's easier for the people getting them, particularly if they actually teach instead of research. There's a few adjuncts with JDs at my school. The only one listed on the actual faculty page has his from Cornell, another has a PhD in hospitality management from UNLV and a JD from FAMU (there's a completely different adjunct who went to FAMU as well), which is notoriously low ranked for actual prospects (he also has a few degrees from a for-profit online school he works for that oddly enough that are completely unrelated to hospitality), and a 4th from a different FL law school that isn't horrible but still ranks around 150. The final one, who's actually got a respectful school (UF), is actually the best teacher of the lot. Most of these adjunct, except for the last one, don't just teach law courses, but courses PhD-holders could, and should. Not my choice unfortunately, I just go to the school.\n\n> That's a shame.

Only reason why I'm thinking of heading the Masters route atm is because of the lousy economy (nobody goes to theme parks in a shit economy even without a pandemic), and because I actually would like to teach hospitality at some point once I get enough experience. I think that my discipline really isn't taken seriously on the academic end - and even if they do, it's mostly because it makes money for the school instead of the students learning anything (if I charged a dollar each for the amount of people who make snide comments on Reddit whenever I mention it ought to be enough to buy me a small home in San Francisco by now). Foreign PhD students love our program at the PhD level because it's seen as a gold standard (even more, somehow, than Cornell - an actual Ivy) and an easy pass to get to a tenure track post in their home countries or a different university. I 100% agree with you - although there's the rare exception of somebody who did the work outside academia, and then got the PhD later. Rare but very helpful.",

If you hear a bunch of paramedics talking on break you'd probably think that they are the worst people, because they are on break and letting off steam, not constantly taking an oath to serve the public and sharing grandiose stories about how they decided to do such a noble job. Paramedics, like professors and many other people, have difficult, shit jobs, and how they cope with those jobs as a group is a) none of my business and b) not fair to use as a judgment on the profession in general.

All of your classmates also have some life outside of class, all of them realize that they voluntarily decided to pursue a degree, and that they have to prioritize it within the rest of their life, or make the realization that it may not be the right time to be trying for a degree for them personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a good student, the kinds of things your classmates attempt will blow your mind.  I recall in my undergraduate time I overloaded every semester, but took a theater class in the middle of the day as a mental break.  One year another student in the class came for the first 2 classes of the semester, then disappeared.  They came back for the last class of the semester and said \"Yeah, I broke my leg, so I missed a few classes, is that cool?\" And the teacher asked if he was sure he could handle being back or not.  \n\n\nNow... for all I know the dude was a theater major, and regularly met outside of class with the professor.  But in that moment, I saw a guy who showed up for 3 classes out of the 48 in the semester, and still passed.  \n\n\nAs a TA, I have seen similar, in the sciences even.  I ran some labs, we would have 13 in the semester.  Had a student miss the first 5 because they had various medical appointments, the next 3 because of family emergency, and then showed up for the last 5.  They dodged all questions about the work missed, ignored all emails and discussions indicating they had already failed the course.  Then on the Friday of finals week, at 1pm, asked when they could schedule make up labs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah... professors start out all sunshine and rainbows with idealistic hopes and dreams.  The few bad students each semester slowly beat the professors down until they are jaded bastards who are completely inflexible.",

There's a wide range of experience with students within r/professors and in the real world, and at many schools there is a culture of students really, really trying to shirk their work, leaving instructors feeling like the students are the ones entitled.\n\nThere's a big disconnect between profs and students. Most students have little to no idea what life is like as an academic and how demoralizing it is when they offer to help a student only to be ignored until immature pleas right when grades are due. Most profs have little to no idea what it's like to be an average student; you're able to become a professor in part because you were good at school, but that doesn't come naturally for many students.\n\nThe tone you saw in that post wasn't so much entitlement as anger and frustration. That prof needs a leave, and I hope they have a mentor or peer who can help them. The question isn't \"how do these people end up in teaching positions\" but rather \"how did someone become this kind of teacher\"?",

These professors tend to have very little teacher training and are even disincentivized to be dedicated to their teaching. \n\nIt follows that with the exception of rare bright spots, grad students are trained as if they will work at research-focused jobs and given very little formalized teacher training. Good teachers coming out of R1s are more often than not autodidacts, people with previous teaching experience, or the people who didn\u2019t really fit into their terminal degree program to begin with.",

I've been serving on hiring committees in liberal arts colleges for 30 years now and every single shortlisted candidate I can recall from now far too many searches came from a top ten program, no matter what the field. It's a catch 22: we know most grads aren't going to get good teacher training in their top R1 program, but we want them to be good researchers too. Often we can train them in as teachers, but we can't train them as researchers.",

That sub is a good 50% venting, and don\u2019t get me wrong I definitely don\u2019t agree with all of it, but it\u2019s also a good 50% resources.\n\nThe more you teach, the more I think the venting will make sense to you. And if you look through the thread you highlighted you\u2019ll notice that the OP did get critiqued for that point about prioritizing his class. So it\u2019s not like the sub is a toxic pool of hate\u2014they call out the BS a lot more than I\u2019ve seen on this sub.\n\nThat sub has also been so helpful in giving me ideas about how to write good exam questions, how to encourage students to come to office hours, what kind of boiler plate language to put in my syllabus, how to handle student cheating, how to be compassionate towards students, how to talk to your colleagues and navigate office politics, how to balance teaching and research, etc. There\u2019s some bad posts every now and then, but they tend to get called out in the comments and there\u2019s way more bad than good.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe that happens here, look for one of the meta posts that gets posted every so often where someone basically says \u201cI read all these posts and grad school sounds so awful, why would I ever want to go?!\u201d And then the comments are people going, \u201cno, it\u2019s not that bad, there\u2019s lots of good stuff too...\u201d The overwhelming view on this sub is negative, it\u2019s just directed at ourselves and sometimes our advisors instead of students so you think it\u2019s somehow better. It\u2019s not.\n\nAlso, I see one of these posts here every now and then about r/professors being toxic. Look, if a sub isn\u2019t for you then it isn\u2019t for you. But as you teach more and more I encourage to you lurk there and look for tips. And yes, when you\u2019re having a bad day it\u2019ll be much healthier to go vent there than to take it out on your students or anyone else.\n\nTLDR: rhat post you highlighted was dumb but hardly representative of the sub as a whole, and overall I think that sub is more useful and less venting than this sub",

Professionalism to us was about being polite, timely in your work, and collegiality. \n\nI also know other programs where the students were ultra competitive, would mess with each other\u2019s work, and were soooo ultra professional that it was like they were trying to make each other look bad.\n\nThe good news is that not all programs suck, but the bad news is of course some do and it can be hard to tell ahead of time. If you can, consider reaching out to current or former students to ask their opinion. And if you do end up somewhere bad, don\u2019t be afraid to prioritize your own mental health and transfer somewhere else if needed.",

I am a new graduate student but really love it so far and am looking forward to developing my focuses and hopefully putting out some good science. I too have noticed the bias in the subs and have also seen the posts in this particular sub referencing r/professors. However, although a large portion of posts in both subs seem to be biased, it does seem that a lot of people here have issues with toxicity with their professors or in the academic world. I would actually say that the majority of posts here are geared towards this topic, which I find slightly unsettling given that these are all people just entering the academic environment. I do feel that my post is a pretty solid example of how badly students can be treated in academia and less of an example of bias as this is a professor\u2019s written syllabus and not just someone venting (which I totally understand, we are idiots). As someone who really wants to do well and succeed in my field, this attitude can be really discouraging when encountered.",

Go do it\"  \n\n\nClassroom management is an actual skill.  Handling the aspects outside of class which amount to being a social worker is another skill. Understanding classroom dynamics is yet another skill. Understanding how people other than yourself might learn is yet another one. Communicating expectations clearly, writing effective assessments, planning a full semester of learning objectives, understanding how to structure a long term learning goal to fit in 50 minute (or whatever your institution uses) chunks, complete with review and practice... each of these are distinct skills, and this barely scratches the surface of all the things that a professor COULD be prepared for, but never is (outside of a few exceptions which surely exist, but don't get recognition or have a spreading influence).",

Most PUIs have teaching/learning centers or at least some sort of mentoring programs for new faculty. Every school I've worked at has not only offered such resources but *required* new/junior faculty to use them. At PUIs in general faculty are evaluated on their teaching to earn tenure; at many schools (SLACs in particular) teaching is weighed more heavily than research in tenure decisions.\n\nBig research institutions generally don't give a damn about teaching, sure, but they are not a majority of the 4,500 colleges/universities in the US.",

I am in Physics, but have sat in on full college of science discussions and spoke with colleagues in all of the sciences and engineering.\n\nNone of those people have had any push for teaching.  Every time there is talk about how to improve our metrics, teaching is not brought up (yet oddly retention is, go figure how they discuss retention and don\u2019t discuss pathetic instruction).\n\nThe only time I ever heard of some departments actually pushing for professors to even have mentorship, let alone speak with the college of Ed was after I moved to work on a degree from the Ed department and spoke with some advisors about their experience at other institutions.",

This is at an r1 in its own right, but not many of the other colleges in the uni are as highly ranked in their field. It's the college where if you get a PhD from there, and you're applying for hospitality jobs, you'll get a look. The school loves research (as they make tons of money from their tourism consulting as well as research grants), but has a strong commitment to teaching, moreso than you'd expect from a big research college - probably having to do with the fact that the guy who's name is on the building is still heavily involved, and wants it to be a teaching institution first and foremost before research.\n\nSome professors seem to handle both research and teaching well, but may or may not detest the teaching. It's the ones who love teaching that I, and everyone else I know, take for classes. The research intensive ones? Yeah they keep the lights on, and do valuable work, but I don't want to take a class from them unless I don't have an option. These professors usually can't teach worth a damn anyway.",

If you put loads of effort into teaching then you're doing less research and worse research just by definition, and you're harming your career. The problem with academia is that it forces you to teach but doesn't reward good teaching, it only punishes it through time penalties. \n\nPeople who truly care about teaching are going to face an uphill battle where the thing they care about is de-emphasised. People who don't care about teaching are going to despise it because they're forced to do a mediocre job with no support or training, and no institutional interest in ever providing support or training.\n\nPeople have a disdain for teaching because we don't want to do it in the first place. We apply to **research** jobs and get saddled with teaching requirements that really don't need *us* specifically. Basically no one is teaching a course on their field of expertise. Institutions could hire people who want to do full-time teaching. They choose to give that job to people who aren't trained.\n\nI know plenty of academics who enjoy teaching at the postgraduate level and enjoy mentoring students, but they don't enjoy teaching introductory physics for non-majors. They don't have a great skillset for it anyway and it makes no sense why they should teach it.",

                  "text": "I should give this a bit more context because I've apparently framed this rather controversially.  I worked in a history department at an R1 in the US at the time.  I can totally understand the differences between pedagogy and many of the sciences (and I agree those are very different skills), but in history the technical skills which bind much of our research presentation are similar to education: how concisely but effectively can we speak on specific details, rhetorical skill, and presentation of evidence to support an argument.  I was once told by one excellent colleague: every book can be a lecture and vice versa - what matters is presentation and detail.\n\nAll of that said, the professor I mentioned in my first comment was, by all definitions, an excellent lecturer.  The notes I took as a TA are as detailed as some of the notes I took for graduate courses.  Each lecture had a thesis with complex -- yet understandable -- supporting details.  What put me off was not that they could not teach, but that they genuinely seemed to despise it.\n\nWhy?  Well, in our field there is a considerable amount of bad history available to the public.  I imagine it's similar to many fields in that regard.  I have sat in countless talks where historians sit there and ask ourselves and other disciplines how we can better make available research that has far-reaching social, political, and historical relevance to the public?  Most historians I've met tend to emphasize the importance of proper understanding of history in public discourse and can acknowledge that the university system holds some responsibility to aid in that end.  As such, lectures on US history tend to de-emphasize the hagiography of its founding fathers, outright disprove Lost Cause-ism (a claim that the Confederacy was not founded predominately on slavery), and acknowledge the complex history of American civil rights.  By many who doubt the veracity of LiBeRal eDucAtIon we are accused of being politically biased, but it is rarely the case of partisanship and much more the realities of the documentation in the archives. And these issues are not purely abstract: they have concrete social and political implications that are often obfuscated in US public education: mired as it is by local politics and mistruths.\n\nSo what stuck in my craw about that professor implying that they didn't care about actually teaching undergraduates?  It was less that they didn't like teaching but that they thought that the ideal of the academy was sitting in a room with other smart, well-researched folk.  What students learned was of no concern to them.  Within the context of the field, it read more like elitism.  Again, this person was an excellent lecturer, I was just put off by their attitude.",

Can't be in the postdoc \u2014 that's not permitted at all. You couldn't get a *less* teaching-oriented background if you tried. No one is even lying about their willingness to teach, it literally never comes up. They don't even seem to care about teaching when they hire professors since no one has any trouble getting jobs with close to zero teaching experience. Teaching isn't an \"important metric on job placement\" at all. It's almost non-existent. But then you get the job and suddenly everyone's harping on your teaching skills when they never cared about them previously and still don't care enough to actually prioritise.\n\nThe balance may be different in your field, but remember that other fields are different and you can't judge them by the expectations of your humanities department.
