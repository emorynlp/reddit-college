  "title:": "Dating a PhD student when you're not in school?",
  "text": "I'm in my mid-20's. I finished my master's degree last year, but it was a one-year program. I currently work in a college town.\n\nI've been talking to this guy for almost a month. We've been on a few dates. We're the same age, but he's in the third year of his PhD and I am working. None of my friends pursued a PhD so I don't really know what PhD students go through. He told me that this year is the year where his program starts to get busy. He's in a STEM PhD, and I got my undergrad/masters in something very much not STEM lol.\n\nIn general, what are some things I should consider when dating a PhD student, as someone who doesn't understand PhD programs? How can I be an understanding (potential) partner to them?",

      "text": "I am dating someone who only has a high school diploma and honestly it's way better than when I dated a fellow PhD student. It helps me have work-life balance, I have a support system when things get crazy, he works in a field that exists literally everywhere so if I have to move for a job we don't have to worry about that sort of conflict (academic jobs are so few and far between that it can be hard for academic couples to end up in the same place). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt helps that he's an introvert who is happy to do his own thing when things get busy. I couldn't date someone who needed a LOT of attention. He played a lot of League of Legends while I was writing my dissertation and was fine with that, and he has his own group of friends he'll go off and play MTG or Warhammer with, giving me alone time in the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and I know you're only a month in so living together is way far down the road, but if you move in together in grad school don't be offended if he wants a two bedroom place. Having my own space is vital for writing.",

      "text": "As someone in a PhD in a relationship with a partner who is working, time/scheduling/personal space were all things that I appreciated. Since I don't have a 9-5, I work whenever I want and I work better in the evening as well as when everyone's asleep. That may mean that I spend time together with my partner during dinner time and weekends, possibly. We've structured weekly Wednesday evening dinner dates over a movie to spend more time but this is still something that is structured and I can work around and have that balance. Honestly, the lack of 9-5/structured work makes time management and boundaries the most important thing to work with.",

      "text": "1. Every PhD project is different. There is a huge variety even in supervisors within the same department at the same university. So if there are specifics that he tells you about the program that seem counter to what you are told here, he is probably right.\n2. Even though we call it 'PhD *student*', it really isn't being a student in any meaningful way. In your mind, model it as a 'Scientist Traineeship/apprenticeship'; hard work, low pay. Think of it as the scientist-equivalent of (medical) doctors doing hospital residencies, or fresh new lawyers joining their first firm.\n3. There will be very busy periods. Especially near the end, I've flat-out told my partner things like \"I'm not going to be available for any social activities in the coming two months\". It helped that we lived together though.\n4. Don't take it personally. With high workload and high stress comes decreased attention to our partners. It should be temporarily, but can still be weeks or a month at a time.",

If i am not working i am studying for my classes, preparing presentations. So, show sympathy when stuff doesn\u2019t go right. Don\u2019t get to personal when he doesn\u2019t have time or just a little time to be with you.

It generally means the end of taking classes as well, which means the rest of the program is less like school and more like a job.\n\nI think the only other thing is to respect that grad students don't really work a 9 to 5, so don't get mad if evenings/weekends are scheduled. But also, make sure to drag your grad student out of the lab sometimes for dates. They need it.",
