  "text": "\"Interface\" \"framework\" \"complexity\" \"navigating\" \"multidisciplinary\" \"resilience\" \"engagement\"\n\nI know academia is riddled with buzzwords, but due to the grant I'm on I feel I'm disproportionality exposed to them. At the risk of summoning the authors, here is the first sentence of a 40 page paper I had to read for class:\n\n*\"One of the key challenges for managers is navigating the contentious issues that periodically confront their organizations.\"*\n\nFuck dude, it sure is!\n\nTo their credit, the authors arent wrong, but I count 9 superfluous words there. To me, navigating, contentious, periodic, and organizations are all extremely vague words because of how they can be used to describe extremely different things. Dont even get me started on \"key\" and \"challenge.\" When you say \"navigating\" I dont know if you mean you're looking at a map, driving a car through traffic, choosing what fork in a hiking trail to take, clicking around a website, looking through a store, dealing with a racist department, or working through some mental problems. Navigating can be used to describe all of those.\n\nI know language is flexible and changes and is defined by its users and all that, and a word isnt necessarily \"bad\" or \"useless\" if it has multiple meanings, but I seriously feel like I dont even understand what people are saying to me anymore. Like they use terms that could mean fucking *anything* (ex: \"tool\"). Outside of school, it's fine. But I cannot audibly absorb much information in class. For whatever reason professors now eschew putting complete sentences and words on their powerpoints (if they even bother to make one and include more than just pictures in it). I worry that its health problems but like I said, I understand people outside of my university classes just fine. However, I feel there's been a marked decline in my ability to put ideas into words, the more I'm barraged with talk that doesnt make sense to me. Probably could still be a health issue on my end but given that I understand my boyfriend and classmates outside of class, its really just dense grad courses that are the problem, I dont think its \"just stress.\"\n\nMy hydrology and wetlands courses were fine, but those err on the side of being more organized and/more math and chemistry based than my class about \"complexity science\" is. Really the complexity science class is the one that I think is breaking my brain but unfortunately taking it is required by my grant. I know at least 2/3rds of my classmates think that class is bullshit, but I don't know if they think its bullshit for the same reasons as me or if they're as psychologically wounded by it as I appear to be. Theyre not the complaining-types who would ever say so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR I often dont understand what people in an academic setting are saying, and its negatively impacting my own ability to put my thoughts into words.p** (ex: \"tool\"). Outside of school, it's fine. But I cannot audibly absorb much information in class. For whatever reason professors now eschew put (ex: \"tool\"). Outside of school, it's fine.

      "text": "I appreciate literary language as much as any other nerd, but I think one difference between literary language and academic gobbledygook is that the former is used carefully to construct a scene and with deliberate intent, while the latter is just kind of haphazardly stapled together to *sound* careful and deliberate. A good literary writer may think \"how can I get the reader to picture what I am seeing\" and sometimes that requires sophisticated or complex language. A bad academic writer may think \"how can I make this sound smarter?\" and turn a sentence like \"Susan went to the store to buy a soda\" into \"Susan proceeded in a vector, via a locomotive process, towards a sustenance-proffering establishment to purchase a carbonated beverage, commonly known as *soda*\"\n\nCertain academics are notorious for this, and if I ever am in a position where I have to read their papers, I am more likely to just cite someone else who makes the same or a similar argument but does it more clearly and concisely. The clearer and more concise your writing is, the less likely it is people will misunderstand your argument. And if your reader, who is probably as educated as you, can't understand your argument, that is a sign of bad writing more than a deficiency on the part of the reader. \n\nI also personally have an aversion to this way of writing and talking because I knew someone who did this all the time and then was later revealed to be another Rachel Dolezal who claimed to be like 4 or 5 different races depending on who they talked to in order to weasel their way into social justice circles and gain notoriety, so I tend to associate this style with frauds and narcissists.",

          "text": "The number of times I've read an academic paper, squinty eyed, and said out loud, \"what the fuck?\", while wondering if I'm an idiot or the author had their head up their ass.... is absurdly high. \n\n\nSo, take that as a learning opportunity when you're the one writing. Clear and concise language has much more of an impact than word vomit to sound smart. \n\n\nFor reading papers, to \"navigate\" through the nonsense (see what I did there?), it's also important to know *how* to read them, and that you shouldn't be reading the whole entire thing. Read the abstract, skim the methods, look at the results, and most importantly the ~~pictures~~ figures. Piece together your own conclusion. Then, read the discussion and figure out if the authors are full of shit. Did their results match their conclusion? Did they answer the research question? Did they actually contribute anything worthwhile, or did they just toss another stack of paper into the research topic abyss? Are they reputable?\n\n\nIt's totally normal to feel like you're an idiot as you're reading papers. But, with time, you'll be able to confidently say \"what the fuck did they actually think they were doing here?\" :)",

Does the average academic in my department know that wetlands are important and why? Because a lot of people view them as dangerous, dirty stagnant water and I don't know how pervasive that mindset still is. I'd rather overexplain my point to where it seems pedantic than to leave my audience hanging because I assume they have a higher baseline level of knowledge than they do.",

      "text": "It's a fine line, but you can almost *always* tell who is talking out their ass and who isn't based on the precision with which they use words. Just because morons may use words they do not know how to use, does not mean that the *words* are the issue. don't make the mistake of thinking an author is bullshitting just because they are using words in a way  you are not used to seeing. Realistically, journal articles, grant proposals etc have CRAZY  tight word limits. No real author is using any superfluous words if they are published in a real journal. \n\nBourdieu made the point that we use special words in science because it is SCIENCE, and not common sense. We don't want to use common words because our words dont mean the same thing (i.e. they are not arrived at via the same theoretical framework) as common words. \n\n'Ritual' does not denote the same thing to a lay person as it does to victor turner. So, instead of allowing ideas and findings to be coopted or misunderstood by lay people, many argue that it's first better to simply learn 'the language' (of course there's not just one) rather than speaking in a plain language. Again, similar to learning a new language, if you are only ever taught 'Spanglish' (i.e. a more user-friendly version of the 'real' language of spanish) you'll never develop the sophistication you need to express your points precisely in real spanish. \n\nTLDR: lots of it is bullshit, but lots is not. You can always tell which is bullshit and not based on *the precision with which words are used to distinguish ideas from other (potentially close) ideas.* \n\nE.g. \"educators use multivalent strategies\" \n\nThis MAY be bullshit, it may not be. \n\nIs educator used instead of teacher for some specific reason? did the study include administrators and tutors as well? or does the study just flip back and forth between all these synonyms? \n\nSimilarly, has the author shown what is actually multivalent here? and how it differs  from simply 'complex' or complicated? \n\nSimilarly, are they distinguishing strategies from plans? or practices?  or beliefs? etc. \n\nTo people who know what they are talking about, they are very real and important distinctions. And you will know people will know what they are talking about based on the distinctions/analysis they make. \n\nDo they say something like \"social capital (Bourdieu 1986; Coleman 1988) is important for success in schooling\" ? \n\nor do they say something like \"social capital, as operationalized by Bourdieu (1986) and not like Coleman (1988), is important for school success\" ? \n\nand so on and so forth.",

It becomes aerialised\u2014and I think it's important that women's experiences be given a narrative.\"\n\nYes, Gloria, because a square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not a square. Same with discourse. In the next sentence she uses 'aerialised,' as if that's much better?  \n\n\nAnyhow, good write-up. It's not as if we can't take these high theoretical writers, apply their concepts, and write accessible literature. People do it all the time.

Only one has a PhD in poli sci, none of the profiled officers have a graduate degree in history. This could also explain it--if the senior brass all have management degrees, how many captains, majors and colonels have--or want to--acquire such degrees?",

      "text": "100% agree.  Academics who write in English should read *The Elements of Style* like it's the Bible.  I quote several relevant passages below.\n\n*****\n\n**-ize:** Do not coin verbs by adding this tempting suffix. Many good and useful verbs do end in *-ize: summarize, fraternize, harmonize, fertilize.* But there is a growing list of abominations: *containerize, prioritize, finalize,* to name three. Be suspicious of *-ize*; let your ear and your eye guide you. Never tack -*ize* onto a noun to create a verb. Usually you will discover that a useful verb already exists. Why say \"utilize\" when there is the simple, unpretentious word *use*?\n\n*****\n\n**Rule 17: Omit needless words.**\n\nVigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.\n\nMany expressions in common use violate this principle.\n\n|the question as to whether|whether (the question whether)|\n|:-|:-|\n|there is no doubt but that|no doubt (doubtless)|\n|used for fuel purposes|used for fuel|\n|he is a man who|he|\n|in a hasty manner|hastily|\n|this is a subject that|this subject|\n|Her story is a strange one.|Her story is strange.|\n|the reason why is that|because|\n\n*The fact that* is an especially debilitating expression. It should be revised out of every sentence in which it occurs.\n\n|owing to the fact that|since (because)|\n|:-|:-|\n|in spite of the fact that|though (although)|\n|call your attention to the fact that|remind you (notify you)|\n|I was unaware of the fact that|I was unaware that (did not know)|\n|the fact that he had not succeeded|his failure|\n|the fact that I had arrived|my arrival|\n\nSee also the words *case, character, nature* in Chapter IV. *Who is, which was,* and the like are often superfluous.\n\n|His cousin, who is a member of the same firm|His cousin, a member of the same firm|\n|:-|:-|\n|Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle|Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle|\n\nAs the active voice is more concise than the passive, and a positive statement more concise than a negative one, many of the examples given under Rules 14 and 15 illustrate this rule as well.\n\nA common way to fall into wordiness is to present a single complex idea, step by step, in a series of sentences that might to advantage be combined into one.\n\n|Macbeth was very ambitious.  This led him to wish to become king of Scotland.  The witches told him that this wish of his would come true.  The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan.  Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan.  He was thus able to succeed Duncan as king. (51 words)|Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in his place. (26 words)|\n|:-|:-|\n\n\n*****\n\n**Reminder 14: Avoid fancy words.**\n\nAvoid the elaborate, the pretentious, the coy, and the cute. Do not be tempted by a twenty- dollar word when there is a ten-center handy, ready and able. Anglo-Saxon is a livelier tongue than Latin, so use Anglo-Saxon words. In this, as in so many matters pertaining to style, one's ear must be one's guide: *gut* is a lustier noun than *intestine*, but the two words are not interchangeable, because *gut* is often inappropriate, being too coarse for the context. Never call a stomach a tummy without good reason.\n\nIf you admire fancy words, if every sky is *beauteous*, every blonde *curvaceous*, every intelligent child *prodigious*, if you are tickled by *discombobulate*, you will have a bad time with Reminder 14. What is wrong, you ask, with *beauteous*? No one knows, for sure. There is nothing wrong, really, with any word \u2014 all are good, but some are better than others. A matter of ear, a matter of reading the books that sharpen the ear.\n\nThe line between the fancy and the plain, between the atrocious and the felicitous, is sometimes alarmingly fine. The opening phrase of the Gettysburg address is close to the line, at least by our standards today, and Mr. Lincoln, knowingly or unknowingly, was flirting with disaster when he wrote \"Four score and seven years ago.\" The President could have got into his sentence with plain \"Eighty-seven\" \u2014 a saving of two words and less of a strain on the listeners' powers of multiplication. But Lincoln's ear must have told him to go ahead with four score and seven. By doing so, he achieved cadence while skirting the edge of fanciness. Suppose he had blundered over the line and written, \"In the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and seventy-six.\" His speech would have sustained a heavy blow. Or suppose he had settled for \"Eighty-seven.\" In that case he would have got into his introductory sentence too quickly; the timing would have been bad.\n\nThe question of ear is vital. Only the writer whose ear is reliable is in a position to use bad grammar deliberately; this writer knows for sure when a colloquialism is better than formal phrasing and is able to sustain the work at a level of good taste. So cock your ear. Years ago, students were warned not to end a sentence with a preposition; time, of course, has softened that rigid decree. Not only is the preposition acceptable at the end, sometimes it is more effective in that spot than anywhere else. \"A claw hammer, not an ax, was the tool he murdered her with.\" This is preferable to \"A claw hammer, not an ax, was the tool with which he murdered her.\" Why? Because it sounds more violent, more like murder. A matter of ear.\n\nAnd would you write \"The worst tennis player around here is I\" or \"The worst tennis player around here is me\"? The first is good grammar, the second is good judgment \u2014 although the *me* might not do in all contexts.\n\nThe split infinitive is another trick of rhetoric in which the ear must be quicker than the handbook. Some infinitives seem to improve on being split, just as a stick of round stovewood does. \"I cannot bring myself to really like the fellow.\" The sentence is relaxed, the meaning is clear, the violation is harmless and scarcely perceptible. Put the other way, the sentence becomes stiff, needlessly formal. A matter of ear.\n\nThere are times when the ear not only guides us through difficult situations but also saves us from minor or major embarrassments of prose. The ear, for example, must decide when to omit *that* from a sentence, when to retain it. \"She knew she could do it\" is preferable to \"She knew that she could do it\" \u2014 simpler and just as clear. But in many cases the that is needed. \"He felt that his big nose, which was sunburned, made him look ridiculous.\" Omit the *that* and you have \"He felt his big nose....\"",

Maybe its obvious and doesn't need to be said. But I feel like I often see \"multidisciplinary approach\" but they don't specify what those multiple disciplines are. Like does the subject broach both sociology and hydrology? Or are we talking about anthropology and nutritional science and physics? Even hydrology itself is \"interdisciplinary\" since its comprised of math, physics (also math), chemistry, biology, and computer modeling (also kinda math).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIntersectionality seems to have a specific meaning in terms of culture, race, disabilities (probably a better term but I don't know it) and feminism if I'm not mistaken, but it does seem highly prone to misuse because people use it to mean the \"intersection of different disciplines\" instead.",

          "text": "I get the vibe that you think non-math-related things are lesser in some way. Maybe for dumber people? Not to be an ass, but I suspect you just misunderstand what is going on.\n\nI'm going to take another wild leap here and say you likely value coding. Language is just coding dude. The underlying logic is the same, except you can layer in different ways and play with different things. (Not everyone does this, sure, but still.) All the layers form feedback loops. It is incredibly beautiful if done correctly!\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that one way of doing something (only small words) is not the only way. Small words can convey a lot of excellent things, depending on how all the other layers interact, but the key word is *depending.*\n\nIn my experience, math PhDs tend to find math beautiful for similar aesthetic reasons, so hopefully this makes sense to you, as a math-oriented person.",

      "text": "I\u2019ll get downvoted for this but imma say it anyways. Many humanities and soft science fields are corrupt, dead, and unscientific as of late. Back then, these soft topics used to revolve around actually facts and evidence. Now it\u2019s just buzzwords and academic incest, coming up with BS concepts to pretend they are relevant. And it\u2019s seeped into these grant proposals. I agree with you as I\u2019ve been applying to them as well. It\u2019s absolute BS, all of it. I genuinely don\u2019t recall taking a non-STEM class that wasn\u2019t filled with these intently ambiguous bullshit concepts. The only exception is history, which is very evidence-based. But goddamn, I took this English and architecture courses last year and they were just insane. The concepts were ambiguous and such bullshit. I remember going to office hours asking for a concrete definition multiple times from the professor, and they\u2019d respond with completely different explanations each time. I wanna say that there isn\u2019t really anything more to explore there lmao. It\u2019s just these people are making up bullshit concepts to pretend they are relevant and get funding.",

I\u2019m upset about the oppression that\u2019s inherent to such a privileged location as high academia. The higher up you go, the whiter and wealthier the cohorts become. I\u2019m horrified that people don\u2019t notice or care.\n\nI\u2019m researching a stigmatized topic and am incessantly disgusted with the biased bullshit that gets recognized as credible, objective, sought after, well regarded literature. Maybe it\u2019s published in legitimate journals because they use all of their meticulous, migraine inducing language.\n\nMaybe if you thought a little more critically, you\u2019d be capable of arguing against my comment with something a little more substantial than an ignorant insult.
