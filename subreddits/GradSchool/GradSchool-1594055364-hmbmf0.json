I\u2019m also just a first year masters student not in STEM, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. . .\n\nOne of my favorite types of stories to read are fantasy, and while a lot of \u201cliterature people\u201d may find it low brow, I think it has a lot to teach us about the human condition. My favorite fantasy series is *The Wheel of Time*. If you\u2019re familiar with fantasy, you\u2019ve probably read it or at least heard of it. It\u2019s considered one of the foundational works of the genre among *Lord of the Rings*, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, etc.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a fourteen long epic about the battle between the reborn soul of The Dragon - a powerful male channeler - and the Dark One. Pretty stereotypical battle of good vs. evil, at least on the surface. Now The Dragon (I\u2019m avoiding names to avoid spoilers) pretty much went insane and destroyed the world as they knew it after barely imprisoning the Dark One the first time. While the \u2018new\u2019 Dragon has no memory of doing this, it\u2019s been passed down through the world\u2019s mythology for thousands of years. This time around, when the battle with the Dark One comes again, he is determined to leave the world in a better state. He doesn\u2019t want to save the world just to destroy again. He wants a legacy. So, one of the things he does is establish. . . schools. You see, knowledge has been on a slow decline for millennia. Everybody hoards it, nobody shares it. He tours them every once in a while to see what the students invent. One of the most worthless inventions he sees is a wagon powered by steam. Pretty dumb in his mind when there are plenty of good horses around. . .\n\nSo during this climactic battle of good vs. evil where the world hangs in the balance, The Dragon is worried about small advances in science and philosophy and other subjects to leave the world a better place when he (hopefully) wins this battle and is gone.\n\nI guess the point I\u2019m getting at is right now the world is in a battle of good vs. evil. Maybe not quite as dire or climactic, but important all the same. And just because you feel like your work is unimportant (like a steam powered wagon, pft), who knows what kind of impact it can make on the world?", "author": null, "created": 1594072463, "upvotes": 21}, "fx51p76": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hmbmf0/not_sure_if_im_burnt_out_from_the_hell_that_is/fx51p76/", "text": "I feel this deeply.
