  "title:": "PhD in Molecular Biology, and I just got put on academic probation",
  "text": "I've struggled since my first semester. Problems have included:\n\n1) Many focus, organization and procrastination issues related to previously-undiagnosed ADHD and anxiety\n\n2) Being cheated on and losing a 6-year-long relationship, followed by deep depression\n\n3) Advisor's hands-off style at complete odds with my need for guided direction\n\n4) The global pandemic interrupting and essentially stealing a year's worth of time; isolation\n\n5) Trying to find medical professionals, psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, etc. who would accept me as a patient and could execute the right treatment with my insurance\n\n6) Not being able to regain enthusiasm for research and not sticking with a project\n\n7) Building myself back up emotionally while attending to my mental issues associated with my disorders\n\nI just had my committee meeting which I had been utterly fearful of, knowing full-well I couldn't possibly present anything of real substance to them, and I was going to have to provide an explanation, and hope they would be semi-satisfied with a half-assed (but not really half-assed) start on a new project. The result: if I don't have an incredibly-improved spring semester, and my research doesn't hit its stride, I will be removed from the program. My department won't recuse me from my research duties, to instead just be a graduate teaching assistant, while I work on myself. I have to do all or none.\n\nI want to do research. I've only ever had one plan in my life, to research epigenetic effects in humans. Since I was in high school. I don't know what else I would even try to do. And now I'm on the cusp of realizing that I do not have the ability to be a scientist, to be in my chosen profession. \n\nI'm not looking for answers or solutions, because I know there really isn't a solution in that simplistic sense. I just needed to write put this out and be in my feelings, because I am scared now.",

As another person suggested if you can take a term off to just get you some time to sort things out that would be ideal. I don\u2019t know how long you are in the program but if it\u2019s still in the first year or two and you don\u2019t really like your advisor, I would recommend finding another lab to switch into and maybe taking that time off to find another professor who would be a better fit. It might help overall with your motivation too if the advisor fit is better. Good luck I know it\u2019s not easy.",

Academia has a way of making it seem that the only \u201cofficial\u201d scientists are those with PhD does active theoretical research. \nHaving gone through academia and seen the other side, I can tell you that\u2019s culty bullshit. \nThere are so many scientists out there. I am actively working with people who don\u2019t have PhDs and are actively doing research. The don\u2019t get to be first author on most papers, but they ARE Scientists! \nIf you are honest when you say your goal is to research human epigenetics, and being a highly cited PI doesn\u2019t matter, then realized our goal is actually pretty broad. And there are many paths to being a Capital-S Scientist. \nAcademia doesn\u2019t own science, even though they pretend to most of the time.",

Getting through a PhD should have trained you how to identify research questions, design studies, craft a narrative, and write that shit up. Getting a PhD makes you real good at those qualities. So that you can do them all over again on a shorter time-scale at a post-doc.\n\nHowever, now that I have seen a few colleagues become assistant professors, ALL of them have said that they were totally unprepared for the realities of being a professor. The committees, the paperwork, the active managing of students/mentees/collaborators, the bureaucracy of managing where your money comes from were are all massive parts of the job that grad school gives you ZERO training in (probably why there are a lot of PI's are horrible at working with students).",

Medication helped me immensely. I also have regular appointments with a psychologist/psychiatrist. When dealing with ADHD and anxiety of any sort, having this sort of support helps reduce the burden. I know you aren't looking for solutions; don't feel the need to respond to this if you're already overwhelmed. Just know you're not alone out here. I'm sorry you're dealing with these issues, and I hope that things begin to turn around for you soon!",

I would suggest the department head, graduate student office or even counselling services. \n\nOften times the PhD committee will do things that are inappropriate in your setting and they need to get \u201cdisciplined\u201d from the dean. For example, if they indicate that you are failing your PhD there needs to be a clear action plan and reasonable amount of time for you to address those items. Not to mention it seems you are also struggling with some personal issues, and there are definitely dedicated resources in you uni that will help you navigate those issues *in the context of your situation*. \n\nAnother option is that your supervisor is not the right person to guide you in this journey. Have you any other opportunities to switch to another person that does research that is interesting to you. Supervisors can make or break your career (and love for research)",
