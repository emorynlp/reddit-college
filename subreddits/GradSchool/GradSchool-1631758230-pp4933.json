  "title:": "Navigating dating another PhD Student",
  "text": "I\u2019m a first year PhD who wasn\u2019t planning on finding a romantic partner before I began my degree but began seeing another PhD student at my institution right before the semester began. Life works is mysterious ways I guess. \n\nI really enjoy this person whoever it\u2019s been challenging navigating the academics, teaching, research, and getting settled in a new environment all while trying to spend time with friends and each other. We\u2019ve tried studying together on one or two occasions but ultimately that has become unsuccessful as we work for a bit and then get caught up talking. Given the amount of time we spend on academics / grading right now (both STEM) I would like to be able to do that together as it\u2019s a huge chunk of my time. \n\n\nI really want to make this work and I\u2019m worried as we start lab work next week that things are only going to get more busy. Does anyone have general advice on dating generally or other PhD students over the course of their degree? I\u2019m aware this will be challenging but I\u2019m willing to put in the work. I just want to make sure the time we are spending together is constructive and doesn\u2019t take away from either of our academic successes.",
