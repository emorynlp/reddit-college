Ironic memes are fun, but the good memes don't have a hint of irony in them, and the great memes are the ones that have a good joke and some truth to them.\n\nAnd also don't oversaturate your memes in a powerpoint. It's made to get the point across, not to debut your stand-up routine. No one is happy.\n\nAnd if you want to be the funny and cool TA, be content with sometimes whiffing a joke and not forcing yourself to land the next one. Don't focus on a dead joke, move on. BUT BALANCE FUN TIME WITH EDUCATION TIME. If it's even close to 50/50 instead of an appropriate 60/40 of a meme to content ratio, you're doing it wrong.",
