  "text": "Does anyone else struggle with finding meaning in life after grad school? After eight years of college, I've found myself at a loss to find meaning and fulfillment in life without classes that assign grades, deadlines to meet, grants to write, and projects to manage. I have been trying to redevelop my old hobbies and learn what things I actually enjoy again, but all of it feels empty and meaningless without the oh-so-familiar stick and carrot hovering around it. I feel like Ben Wyatt making claymation videos in Parks and Rec. Does anyone else feel like this?",

I'm taking a break from grad school at the moment and I'm pretty good at enjoying my hobbies and living life at a much slower pace and with less intensity - I've always been pretty good at that.\n\nBut what I really, truly miss is having engaging intellectual discussions with others equally as passionate and obsessive about the same topics I'm passionate and obsessive about. I keep trying to find people outside of academia who are willing to even just entertain the topics I'm interested in (social sciences) but most people are neither interested nor informed enough to dive to the same level of depth that you go into in grad school.\n\nConsequently, I find most of my interactions with non-academics (which is most of the people I interact with) dull and meaningless and that makes me feel utterly alone and disconnected. I wish there were clubs for former academics... P.S. are there?",

I'd like to hear them!\n\nI can completely relate to conversations with others feeling dull and meaningless because they're all at the surface level. One thing I always enjoyed about field work was the ability to have much more free and meaningful conversations with colleagues who might otherwise feel obliged to keep things impersonal and bland in the workplace. I worked one field job for a year and it surprises the shit out of me that, after all that time, I had so few meaningful conversations with my colleagues there. No kidding, the majority of the talk was, \"Wwweeelll fellas, how'd it go out there today?\", \"I got a new mower, uuhh-huuhh,\" or \"It sure is a hot one, mmhhmm.\" Banal shit like that. And banal shit like that is fine, even expected, but, at least for me, it doesn't lead to any meaningful connections to others or deeper insights into life (or death). It occurred to me that these people maybe just had a difficult time thinking at a deeper level. They also may have not had any interest in it at all. I think a good deal of people fall into those two categories, which leaves the rest of us wishing we could shut down parts of ourselves so we could be happy with the things that apparently make everyone else happy.",

Learn to find joy and gratitude in small things. There are so many hobbies out there that allow for the same kind of mastery we have in grad school. And if you continue trying to seek fulfillment and external validation--I'm in the same boat, kind of--then learn how to give yourself that kind of validation. Practice daily self-affirmations, practice self-care and learn very slowly how to love yourself.",
