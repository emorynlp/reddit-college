After eight years of college, I've found myself at a loss to find meaning and fulfillment in life without classes that assign grades, deadlines to meet, grants to write, and projects to manage. I have been trying to redevelop my old hobbies and learn what things I actually enjoy again, but all of it feels empty and meaningless without the oh-so-familiar stick and carrot hovering around it. I feel like Ben Wyatt making claymation videos in Parks and Rec.

I'm taking a break from grad school at the moment and I'm pretty good at enjoying my hobbies and living life at a much slower pace and with less intensity - I've always been pretty good at that.\n\nBut what I really, truly miss is having engaging intellectual discussions with others equally as passionate and obsessive about the same topics I'm passionate and obsessive about. I keep trying to find people outside of academia who are willing to even just entertain the topics I'm interested in (social sciences) but most people are neither interested nor informed enough to dive to the same level of depth that you go into in grad school.\n\nConsequently, I find most of my interactions with non-academics (which is most of the people I interact with) dull and meaningless and that makes me feel utterly alone and disconnected.

When you're in school for so long of your life, and so much of your self-image and self-worth is tied to acing tests or whatever, it can hit you like a ton of bricks when you're suddenly out of that environment.\n\nBe patient and kind with yourself. Learn to find joy and gratitude in small things. There are so many hobbies out there that allow for the same kind of mastery we have in grad school. And if you continue trying to seek fulfillment and external validation--I'm in the same boat, kind of--then learn how to give yourself that kind of validation. Practice daily self-affirmations, practice self-care and learn very slowly how to love yourself.", "author": "lurkergroove2", "created": 1631739075, "upvotes": 6}, "hczbbc2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pothgb/meaning_of_life_outside_school/hczbbc2/", "text": "Yeah. It took me around 6 months to recover from the trauma of grad school. The I was bored/angry/frustrated.
