Can anyone relate?", "text": "My whole undergraduate career has been a gradual move towards more biological/life science research. I started out as Aerospace Engineering and interned at Boeing/NASA my first UG summer, changed to Materials Science and did REUs in biosensor development and protein engineering. I fell in love with Neuroscience, and eventually joined a Bioengineering program and neural tissue engineering lab.   \n\n\nNow, I do love neuroscience, but I feel like I don't have the skills/characteristics of a someone who can thrive in this field. **I am now starting my 4th year in the program**.   \n\n\n1. **I dislike, and am terrible at, mathematics.** I dislike high level mathematics/statistics, which is what a lot of my electrophysiology research necessitates. I've been able to get to this point in life by studying longer than my peers to do half as well in courses - I feel like this was a red flag. \n2. **I am a clumsy non-detail oriented individual.** I feel like I just suck at cell culture - I really try my best, but whenever something doesn't work out well, I just become overwhelmed with guilt and second guessing about everything that I could have done wrong. Maybe I pipetted new media little aggressively? Maybe I was imaging that plate too long and that hurt the cells? etc, etc. I just feel like I stumble and trip up so much more than my peers, even though my tissue culture work is less convoluted than theirs. Having a month of work just...die... it really fucks me up in the head. \n3. **I enjoy working with people.** As I have explored my neuroscience passions, I've become increasingly exposed to the world of psychology. I've become very well read on the research, I've attended a bunch of talks, and think that I would feel more engaged/satisfied by that work. \n4. **No one ever complemented my math/analytical skills, but they always complemented my \"people\" skills.** I can always hold space for my friends and help people work through their traumas and challenging experiences. I've been complimented on my ability to do this for years by different friends as I've helped them work through various life challenges. I always shrugged it off, but now I'm like \"Ya know what, I am really good at this, maybe much better than I ever was at math or engineering\". \n\nFor context, my culture I was maintaining started curling up on itself unexpectedly and I'm deeply bummed. Maybe I just want to rationalize this fuck up as the Universe telling me this isn't for me. I feel my research is inadequate, unoriginal, and unimportant. I can't imagine myself graduating, and thats sad. **I'm starting my 4th year right now.**", "author": "PsychedelicParamour", "created": 1632411839, "retrieved": 1632952102, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdzjq8z": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pty0cf/regretanxiety_did_i_go_into_the_wrong_field_can/hdzjq8z/", "text": "As already stated, no one is great at all of those things in the beginning.  They are skills that take time to develop.  If the work is hard, that may not be a great reason to quit.  But if you don't truly enjoy it anymore, that's a totally different thing.  Maybe introspect a little, look at some future jobs that this path would put you in line for.

That's what drives innovation, seeing the problem from various angles and perspectives. \n\nNoone starts off as being amazing at mathematics nor liking Mathematics (well some might).  But you can become proficient at mathematics by continuing to practice it and exercise it like a muscle.  You don't have to be perfect, you just have to be good enough.  You're on your journey in mathematics and it's fine.\n\nSimilar to mathematics, noone starts off being amazing at all of them.  Something might take a little bit more time but everyone has to go through the same trials of learning.  Don't be too hard on yourself and just keep working at it.  Just try and be self-aware and recognize where the biggest source of error or mistakes could be happening and change your procedures to mitigate against that.  Pipetting sucks but every time I help my SO in her wet lab (I'm a dry lab guy) I have to concentrate to make sure I'm not screwing up the procedure.  It's such a mundane task but a single misstep could cause issues that I don't even try to listen to music while I'm doing it.  \n\nGreat you love being a people person!  That's a natural skillset that seems to be working for you.  Brainstorm how you can use that within your field to make other parts/sides easier to do. \n\nYou're in a field where math and analytical skills are already at a high level.  You're comparing yourself to others who are also at a high level.  Your uniqueness is your people skill because that's what stands out.  Don't take this as \"Oh I'm bad at Math\", take it as \"that's one of my competitive advantages\".  You can learn and exercise your math skills, but people skills are harder to practice and master (especially for those who are too ingrained in the STEM field).  It's a huge asset.  \n\nLook, you got a lot going for you.  Rome wasn't built in a day and some of those skills aren't mastered in a few hours.  Just continue practicing it just like we did back in middle/high school.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1632412663, "upvotes": 5}}}
