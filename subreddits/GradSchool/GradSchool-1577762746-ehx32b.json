While I've always really enjoyed my research, now that it's almost New Year, I'm feeling this serious sense of dread on the thought of going back. I originally planned working over the break to get some powerpoint slides ready for a talk that I have to give when I get back, but of course, none of it has been done. Anyone else in the same boat?", "author": "PumpkinCrumpet", "created": 1577762746, "retrieved": 1632953963, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 349, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fcp4bwc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ehx32b/anyone_else_dreading_going_back_to_work_after_new/fcp4bwc/", "text": "I felt so great for a week of family visiting, and then the dread returned HARD the day after my parents left.

I was showing signs of burnout before the holiday break and was also feeling intense pressure to work over the break to get some key stuff done on some soft deadlines. But then I told my counselor that, and she helped me see that I was utterly exhausted -- I was devoting a ton of energy to my work, to family stuff, to my relationship, and to several other areas of my life too. And although I'd taken some breaks from my work, I would just re-allocate that energy into a different part of my life. I don't think I've had a true break, from everything, for years. And I was utterly burnt out. I was struggling to work even 2 hours a day, day after day.\n\nI realized that I needed a FULL break, from efforting in ANY area of my life. So I decided I absolutely *needed* the full two weeks off from at least work, and ideally from everything that requires effort, so I could give myself some desperately-needed rest. And not with the purpose of being able to work better in January, but for the purpose of nurturing my well-being. Because I deserve it.\n\nI managed to push myself (it was agony, honestly) to finish one major thing I wanted to finish, in the last work week, which felt good. For the other major thing I was supposed to have done for my thesis before the break, on the last work day before the holiday, I realized there was absolutely no way I could get it done that day because I was completely depleted and ran out of time. I realized if I didn't tell my supervisors that it'd be hanging over me over the break so I decided to email them letting them know I didn't finish it, which I know is disappointing, but it is what it is and I need the full holiday break so I'll be returning on Jan 6. \n\nAnd wow, that has helped SO MUCH. I am finally relaxing for the first time in a very long time. It took me about 8 days into the break to actually start being able to relax though with the holidays and 5 family get together plus gifts, and catching up on rest, and remembering *how* to relax. It's so clear this is what I needed.\n\nI have actually noticed excited impulses to return to work! I did NOT act on them, because this break time is sacred, but I did write them down to remember when I return. So I'm actually partially looking forward to going back to work. \n\nBUT the key thing is that I've also worked out a much more sustainable idea of how I will work. I have found in my first two years of my PhD that I am just literally not capable of working 40 hours a week. I have no lab or field work so it is all intellectual and my brain just can't work that many hours. I have 5 mental health disorders which reduce my abilities too, and I've finally realized I need to drastically reduce my expectations so they can actually be doable and sustainable. So my new plan is: take *every* Friday off for chores and health stuff (counseling and doctor appts, etc) so my two weekend days are actually restful and relaxing; work a maximum of 6 hours in the other two days; set my minimum goal for each workday as solely two 15 minute work blocks. The latter is because I get huge resistance to working if I think I HAVE to work 8 hours in a day, and I need a goal that is doable every single work day even if I feel like absolute shit. My ideal average will be eight 15 minute blocks, and a phenomenal day would be twenty 15 minute blocks. \n\nAnd I'm planning to get a group of other grad student friends to meet every Monday at 11am to discuss what we're planning on working on this week, what we're struggling with, and how we're generally doing, to have something to look forward to at the start of the week. \n\nI'm curious what others do to keep the workload sustainable, and to keep enthusiasm about work up!", "author": "SuperbFlight", "created": 1577829311, "upvotes": 2}, "fco1g96": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ehx32b/anyone_else_dreading_going_back_to_work_after_new/fco1g96/", "text": "I have a pile of stuff to do and spent the few days I took off work worrying about it.
