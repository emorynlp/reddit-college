      "text": "It's really important to *schedule* time to relax. I never took a full day off during the first semester of my PhD, and my mental health suffered as a result. I now work from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, M-F. I usually do a little work on Sundays, but nothing too intense (e.g., read an article or two). I will occasionally work later into the evening, but that doesn't happen very often. My happiness *and* productivity have improved immensely.\n\nI have had several more senior colleagues tell me that it is not possible to take the evenings and entire weekends off. This is nonsense. In my experience, most graduate students who complain about not having any personal time don't know how to effectively manage their time to begin with.",

      "text": "Not in grad school, but in a rigorous nursing program and I pretty much always have assignments due or tests that I need to be studying for, and really need to prioritize the importance of things. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to get stressed. And once that feeling starts it\u2019s nearly impossible to make it go away. This equals doing poorly (for me at least). Luckily the program I\u2019m in is HUGE on self care. \n\nTake a deep breath, trust yourself that you were competent enough to get into the grad program, so you\u2019re more than able to get everything done.  Prioritize your assignments based on importance and write everything down. \n\nI write daily to do lists(ordered based on importance), have a daily planner with due dates, and a whiteboard calendar with test schedules. I cross off/erase things when they\u2019re done and the feeling of satisfaction is unmatched. When I need a break, I take one. I\u2019ll do a 10 minute meditation, go for a walk, or just eat (lol). If I\u2019m really not feeling it one day, I\u2019ll do minimal work and makeup for it the following day. \n\nBottom line is this. You got this, trust yourself, stay organized, and most importantly take time to practice self care\u2764\ufe0f",

However, I'm mentally ill and currently unmedicated due to a variety of reasons so I kinda have to work overtime so to speak just to make up for the time I lose when the depression hits. I guess that shows how much of all of this is so individual - everyone has their own strategies for scheduling and executing their work. Also, all my friends are in my cohort (because I moved internationally for grad school), so even with them I'm often talking/thinking about work. It feels kind of impossible to build a life outside of it. Huh. Thinking about this is kind of depressing tbh",

All my friends were doing well for themselves in other labs AND had lives. Meanwhile, I worked myself into a hole and was in a bad place mentally. I ended up leaving that lab, took some time off and am returning this fall.\n\nIf you're ever in a bad enough mindset where you would rather get hit by a car or run away than go to your lab/work/whatever, there's something tremendously wrong with the situation that needs fixing. My case, I was burnt out and in a very toxic and controlling lab environment. It's hardly ever (or never) just you that's the problem. Feeling much better now and looking forward to returning. Best of luck to anyone who reads this!",

I still go back the old ones every now and then but yea, I tend to cycle through them. \n\nIt's not always fun, and sometimes you'll feel like you're just going through the motions, but the key is to get in the habit of doing something new that's not work.
