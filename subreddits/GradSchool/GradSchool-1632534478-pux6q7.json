Because of COVID, I chose to graduate college 2 years early and as a result didn't really build any strong relationships with faculty at my school (which I\"m really kicking myself for, but not much I can do about it now). I've taken a full gap year working in research since graduation and am planning on getting 2 letters of rec from that - 1 from my boss and 1 from the head of my research department. I am really struggling in figuring out who to ask for my 3rd letter. I think I really only have two options.. 1) another doctor/professor from the hospital I work at. She has mentored me in writing a protocol and manuscript, but I feel that other than that I haven't worked super closely with her. Would it be bad to have all three of my letters come from the same position/organization? Or 2) I recently started working in a lab at a university near me (and I mean REALLY recently as in mid-september). I could ask my supervisor there for one because I'd really like someone to write about my work/talents in a laboratory setting, but I will have known him for like 2 months by the time I'd need to ask him for a letter. Which would be a better option? Please help lol I don't know what to do and am worried i completely screwed myself", "author": "sarahdarah123", "created": 1632534478, "retrieved": 1632843999, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he8a231": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pux6q7/who_would_be_best_to_write_my_letter_of_rec_for/he8a231/", "text": "Pick whoever will write you the most enthusiastic letter.

You might also find some comfort to know that not all 3 rec letters need to be fantastic.
