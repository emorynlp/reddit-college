  "text": "I think I feel some anxieties I have are getting bigger and bigger as the semester goes on. Any interactions I have are starting to become daunting and I\u2019m overthinking every little thing. In my last class I knew the answer to the question the prof posed. I usually try not to answer because I\u2019m terrified of being wrong but I did know it. But then I spoke too quietly (although I felt like I was being louder than my usual self) and she couldn\u2019t hear me and then asked me to speak up several times and then I panicked and overthought my answer and then gave the wrong one because maybe she was giving me a chance to correct myself? And then I just embarrassed myself. And then someone else said the right answer that I had thought was correct in the beginning of it all. And now I\u2019m trying to do other work but my mind keeps drifting to that moment in class and my hand starts to shake uncontrollably. I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m overthinking this again.\n\nI just feel like everything I do here is wrong and I don\u2019t actually belong. I find myself tearing up randomly throughout the day thinking of all my little failures and I don\u2019t want to feel this incompetent anymore. Sometimes I feel like i really do understand what I\u2019m learning but then I choke at test time and maybe it wasn\u2019t just me choking, maybe I\u2019m just not good enough to be here and am actually just stupid. And this morning adds to it, people can see the failures I wear on my chest. Maybe a therapist can help me figure out how to move past these thoughts I have or even just definitively tell me I don\u2019t actually belong here. Either would be nice I think.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this really ran away from me. My point was to ask if there were apps to help connect to a therapist people found useful. Or other ones (like headspace?) I don\u2019t know if I can spare time to go see a therapist in person but would like to start talking to one",
