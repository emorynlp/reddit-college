  "text": "Well, I'm supposed to be defending my PhD in the next month and my journal paper was just rejected. I'm torn - I really don't have time to do finish my other paper and work my full time job, but my committee requires a journal paper for PhD students. \n\nI'm so beyond wanting to be finished it's not even funny.",

      "text": "Do they require publication or just evidence that you've submitted a manuscript for publication? My institution imposes the latter. IMO it just seems a bit much to require a pub when the entire process is a crapshoot that may take months/sometimes years at a time. I mean I know it's a PhD and you're meant to contribute new, original, publishable knowledge to the field but still.\n\nReally sorry you're going through this situation though.",

Venting accomplishes little.\n\nLook, in my program you had to come up with an original theoretical route to a molecule for orals. One month before my route was actually published by another group. Tough shit adviser said, find another route, I did. A day before presenting it THIS route was published! Tough shit, postpone and find another route, I did, two days after my oral THIS route was published. We all suffer setbacks it's how we address them that grad school teaches us.",
