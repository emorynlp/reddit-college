  "title:": "How do you deal with things when you feel like you might have been taken advantage ofby a colleague.",
  "text": "I know that this may come across as me being a very petty person but I can't help but feel that I have been taken advantage of. I am in the second year of my Master's degree in a very competitive biology program where we have to do lab rotations as a part of the curriculum. Lab rotations have been hard to get the past year because of the pandemic and students who were a year ahead were given a priority as they were the ones impacted the most because of labs not accepting interns/rotation students in the early days of the pandemic. \n\nUnder such circumstances it was very hard for me to land my 2 lab rotations that I found out by painstakingly sending nearly 50 applications a week. One of my batchmates who was struggling as well asked me what labs I got into and as I had previously been told by this person that they had no interest in any of these areas I didn't see any harm in sharing how I applied and how I prepared for interviews. \n\nTurns out this person applied to the same labs and got in. To be clear in all honesty, they are indeed there because of their own merit but I feel like they skipped through the anxious frenzy of applying and facing rejection and that makes me feel a bit \"used\". \n\nAlso now I feel like I can't really trust what they say and am not sure that's a healthy dynamic to have with a colleague.",
