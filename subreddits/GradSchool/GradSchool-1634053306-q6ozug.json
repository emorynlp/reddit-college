  "title:": "Anyone Do a Masters of Arts in Transatlantic Affairs or US/EU Joint Degree (MATA)?",
  "text": "Hey guys/gals, \n\nI am looking for anyone who has done a program like Transatlantic Affairs (MATA). If you are unfamiliar with it, essentially, it's an International Relations program its splits one year in the US and the other in the EU, for a joint degree program (some of them offered are dual-joint programs). Preferably I'm looking into the University of which offers Dual Masters with a Joint degree. But for anyone who has done a program similar to this, I want to know is worth it?\n\nAnd if you are someone who has is or has finished a degree in International Relations, would you have wanted to do this program? Or do you think this would be a waste of time and money? But this question extends out to anyone to see your input on this. Overall, I want to see if this is a good experience, and your information would be very much appreciated. \n\nExample links below to kind of show you a jist of these programs: \n\n[https://fletcher.tufts.edu/academics/dual-joint-and-exchange-programs/joint-and-dual-programs/MATA](https://fletcher.tufts.edu/academics/dual-joint-and-exchange-programs/joint-and-dual-programs/MATA)\n\n[https://atlantis.syr.edu/about-atlantis/](https://atlantis.syr.edu/about-atlantis/)",

      "text": "I'm a current IR MA student, but not in a transatlantic program. I have a couple thoughts.\n\nI think it would be really cool as far as variety of experience goes. Personally, I think I would place higher value on academic continuity, the ability to work with professors over the course of the program. \n\nWhat do you want to get out of the degree? Do you want to continue on and pursue a PhD afterward? Then I wouldn't do it, continuity of academic relationships will be very important. Are you hoping to work in government and have a subject expertise in transatlantic affairs or hope to develop one? Then this program's probably a good fit, so long as you have enough opportunity to network in the relevant cities (D.C., maybe Brussels?).\n\nI'm sure you won't go wrong with either option really, like if you do a traditional MA with a top program like Tufts or a MATA with Tufts or another top program.",

          "text": "Yea I have been thinking a lot of my next step, and with this MA program I mostly leaning toward my future with certain big named fellowships and scholarships. Some of them include the Boren, Critical Language Scholarship, or Pickering. So I was thinking that having something more international might help me in obtaining one of these scholarships. And if I obtain one of these scholarships I would either have a guaranteed career with the US Department of State or at least have someone else help pay for my degree \ud83d\ude02. \nLong term wise I think I want to find a career first, I mostly leaning towards becoming a diplomat/foreign service officer.",

              "text": "If you want to do the foreign service, why not got for it right now? You don\u2019t need a masters degree for a foreign service appointment, and the pay increase for having a masters isn\u2019t that big.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about the Boden or Pickering fellowships but for the critical languages fellowship, do you have a language in mind? The Transatlantic program is of course only helpful if the language you know or want to learn is spoken in or near where the European half of your degree would take place.",

                  "text": "Well why I suggested both Boren and CLS is that I semi know two different languages: Polish and Japanese. But to which one I would want to double down on has been a hard thought lol. Mainly because I am Polish American so I would want to learn more polish (thus getting the Boren) or double down on the extremely difficult Japanese (cls and a lot of other scholarships) \nFor the FSOT I don\u2019t feel ready for it per say, and the Pickering and Rangel if obtained will lead you to a FSOT career after completion of your masters. \n\nOh essentially the Pickering and Boren are Department of State paid for scholarships/fellowship opportunities. The Pickering is the opportunity for the state to pay for your masters, but you have to do 2-3 internships in the summer (one for department of defense/state and another in a foreign embassy). While the Boren is like CLS, but you can only sign up for it during the 1st year of your MA, it involves languages around Defense (such as Polish, German, Russian, etc)",
