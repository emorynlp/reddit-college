  "text": "Not quite sure what to do here, and google gives me various answers.  I recently got married and am transitioning to a new last name.  As of right now my social security card is my new last name, but all my forms of identification are under my old last name still (license, passport, etc).  If I apply in my new last name and they need some sort of identification my ID will be wrong, but applying in my old last name would lead to me changing my last name basically as soon as I start.  Wondering which I should go with",

I ended up having to upload a copy of my marriage license along with all of my application documents, but other places might have different procedures. My situation was that my name and ID had recently changed, but my past degrees and publications were under my maiden name. I guarantee they've seen similar situations before, so just explain to the admissions officer what you've explained here and they'll tell you what to do. Good luck!",

While it isn't a big deal to make that change, it saves a step. \n\nAll your records will be conneted to the same ID number so the application process will not be confusing.",

      "text": "I would apply with your married name, and either add a copy of your marriage license or a separate letter explaining that you recently got married. Presumably you will be using your married name in grad school, so if you were a Smith but are now a Jones, you don't want your university affiliated email assigned to you to be csmith@univerisity if it should be cjones@university. \n\nI'm not behind the scenes, but I don't imagine it's actually that complicated to pair your previous name records with your married name records. Whoever is responsible for forwarding the materials to the relevant department can probably just attach the record and say \"oh by the way, this student recently got married so this record is in their married name. Their current last name is Jones\". \n\nIt might not be extremely common, but it's probably common enough that they have dealt with this several times before.",
