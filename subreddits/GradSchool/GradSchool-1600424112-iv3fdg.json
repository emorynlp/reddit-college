I love my friends and famil, but they don't really get academia, and look, it's not even a big deal *within* academia either. \n\nI'm a Master's student in psychology. My heart beats for philosophy, but making sound decisions about my future involved not going down that route. But: I just got an acknowledgement. In a paper. Nestled right between the names of two of the biggest guys alive in the philosophy of science right now is my name. Referring to me. The prof I was just regularly chatting with, reading his manuscripts because I thought they were cool? Put me down as an acknowledgement, ranking my comments higher in order of helpfulness than the audience of two conference talks and his usual collaborator/co-author. \nI know it's not a big deal. Nobody will ever notice, or ask, or care, and I can't even put it into my CV and I feel a little cringy even just sharing it here. But boi. Boi boi boi.
