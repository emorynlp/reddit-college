  "text": "I am trying to go to graduate school next fall (2022) and have been struggling to find programs. I graduated a year ago and have been working in a lab since, where I wrote, developed, and implemented a biosecurity audit across our company. I don\u2019t mean this to be a discussion of whether or not I am \u2018ready\u2019 for grad school - how do I find a program in my interest areas (either sustainable ag or biosecurity/zoonotic and infectious disease)?I have tried contacting professors at my alma mater, with very little success. I routinely read recently published research papers in those areas and look up the authors for ongoing work. I have gotten contacts from friends at other universities. I\u2019ve sent out a lot of emails, but most of the responses are \u2018I\u2019m not taking any more grad students right now\u2019 or that there isn\u2019t funding. How do I find a program?",

      "text": "It's a numbers game, like anything else. If you're really interested in only those specific fields of study, you're going to have to keep trying (your methods sound fine tho). You may want to broaden your scope to acquiring skills that would be useful as a researcher in those fields (biotechnology, virology, pathology, molecular biology, population genetics, etc) and then join a more specific lab as a postdoc afterwards.",
