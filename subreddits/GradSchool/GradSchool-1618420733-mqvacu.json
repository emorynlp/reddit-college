There is nothing to help if the students are doing just fine without my help. I believe letting the students figure out on their own wihtin 10 minutes. \n\nEdit2: wow, some of you guys are fucking moral high horse dickweeds. half of this sub's posts are complaints about piss poor stipends, bad research progress, mental struggle and all I did was to make some small complaint, and yall tell me to \"grow up\"?

Perhaps frame it as \"I'm not sure what to do, can you help me find something useful to do in the lab?\"\n\nIf you've explored these options, and it really is just a waste of time and you really can only stand there, there is one more thing I recommend...\n\n...one thing I do when I have these downtimes is just try to build more positive emotions in myself. It sounds kinda funny, but it's better than standing there being annoying. I generate a sense of caring for the people in the room, for example.
