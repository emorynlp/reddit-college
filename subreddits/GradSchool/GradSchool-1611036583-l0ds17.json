  "text": "I'm also the primary author!!!\n\nThis is after 4 excruciating years of rejection and self-doubt, always wondering if I'm cut out for research even if I'm currently doing my master's right now. This just validated me! I'm just thankful that my co-author (also my adviser) is very supportive.\n\nEdit: Wow, your kind words and support elated me! I wish you all well \ud83e\udde1",
