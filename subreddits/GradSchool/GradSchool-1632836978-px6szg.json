One of the future advisors is a postdoc who I always call by his first name. The other is a full professor who I don't know as well, but he has always signed his emails to me with a nickname version of his first name (it's not a preset signature).\n\nI feel like its weird to write an email  to both of them saying \"Hi Prof. (last name) and (postdoc's first name)\", but I am nervous about calling the professor by a shortened version of his first name (I have never seen him use his full first name so I don't want to do that either)  without being explicitly invited to do so. Opinions?\n\nETA: I am in Austria, where formal titles are a big deal, but my previous advisor seemed almost annoyed with me when he had to explicitly ask me to call him by his first name.\n\nETA2: Haha I went with the safe option and just sent him a separate email where I addressed him as Prof. X, and he signed his response with only the first two letters of his first name.

But if he already signs his emails with his first name, my Austrian gut tells me it's okay to address him like that.\n\nMy best guess: If he signs all his Emails with his first name, he is okay with being addressed that way.
