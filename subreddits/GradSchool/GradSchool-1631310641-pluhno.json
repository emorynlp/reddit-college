  "text": "I've professionally worked with the entire creative suit, 3D Max, Quark, etc. All of those have been lightyears more user friendly than MS Word. MS Word seems to take the concept of UX and poop on it. There is no user control over formatting, and, instead, the user is forced to submit to the random logic of the word processor. Quark was for literally making F\\*cking books and it did writing, typography, and formatting way easier than Word. You could tell a paragraph to intent every paragraph EXACTLY the amount you wanted it to independent of the rest of the document. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWord is horrible.",

It's when you have dozens that it starts to get annoying. \n\nIf you send me the article for publication, I will want the Excel document or a very high quality image anyways.

Every time I bring up how dogshit Word is or how Excel's equation editor is a piece of trash, he'll bring up how great Word Perfect and Lotus 123 were and their intuitiveness.\n\nMicrosoft made deals with tons of businesses to license their software for cheap and also would do shady shit like Lotus software would magically stop working on a new windows update, and would maybe get patched weeks later. Basically they forced a company that made better products out of business, and didn't really have to deliver anything good from that point on.   \n\n\nAt least Word's a little better than it used to be. I remember writing papers in school in the 90's and 2000's was like pulling teeth. You have to constantly trick Word into doing the thing you want it to do. Still do, but it was even worse back then.",
