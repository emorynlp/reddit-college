  "text": "I\u2019ve been preparing for six or so months now to apply to grad school and I realized I haven\u2019t heard a super positive testimony about the grad school experience. \n\nI know this depends on a lot of things: everyone reacts differently to major life changes; expectations might not be met; it\u2019s rigorous; sometimes advisors, classmates, or the institution turn out to be not what you thought or wanted. \n\nBut is it possible to be enjoyable and a good experience? Do people find it fulfilling a good amount of the time? \n\nI have been in the workforce for a time now and some of the grad school testimonies reek like my time in a toxic workplace. Now my work is amazing and I\u2019ll be sad to leave it when I go back to school but going back is something I want to do for myself. \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to voluntarily go into debt to be in a toxic workplace!",

      "text": "It\u2019s possible if you have a good advisor.\n\nMy opinion is that grad school is so hit or miss because professors have so much individual power over their students - far more than any boss in any professional setting. Your entire future is in their hands while you\u2019re making next to nothing for money and they can make the most arbitrary demands ever with no oversight at all. Grad school is incredibly hit or miss because of it, and it can easily turn into one of the worst periods in your life if you get a particularly abhorrent advisor.\n\nI\u2019ve been a month away from graduating for the past year. Part of it is because my current advisor is picking at the most trivial things, but a bigger part of it is that my original advisor was a fucking idiot who mismanaged a gigantic code that a couple of his students developed that I got sucked into using for my thesis. He doesn\u2019t even understand the language it\u2019s designed in, *nor is he even remotely an expert in the specific field that the code falls under*, even though one of his students spent close to 8 years developing it. It\u2019s bug-riddled and has basically no documentation and hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) lines long. I got sucked into one of his hare-brained ideas in something to do with the code thinking he knew more than me, managed to slap together preliminary exam materials and passed, but now it\u2019s falling apart due to things I didn\u2019t foresee that someone more experienced would have. I had to switch to someone who is an expert because the idiot kept making ridiculously unreasonable demands of me, and he was incapable of understanding how unreasonable they were.\n\nI\u2019m just trying to hold on now and put a thesis together and graduate, but this would have been so much smoother if I had a decent advisor from the start who knew about the subject he claimed to be researching. So yeah\u2026 figure that part out early enough and your experience should go a lot smoother.",

      "text": "From my personal experience, it really depends on your luck. A lot of stars have to align for you to have a good gradschool experience. Your supervisors need to be supportive, your management needs to actually care about students, your faculty members need to not be toxic. Unfortunately, this does not happen most of the time which means there is a big possibility that things will more often than not turn sour.\n\nI think for myself, I expected the chaos of gradschool when I started out my PhD so I always had 1,2,3,4 backup plans. I always did things veryyyy early and I don't rely on others to get things done. It's a highly independent journey. \n\nMy thoughts, expect toxic behavior from people in your faculty but think about how you will deal with it. I personally stay away from toxic people and I build good relationships with those that are genuine (there are only one or two anyways). Other than that, keep on reading and writing!",

I did have emotional break downs. I did struggle to finish my thesis. BUT those \"common\" grad school experiences were the result of pre-existing behavioral and personal factors that I finally had to address in order to achieve the milestones I wanted rather then being direct products of the grad school environment. Those factors would have been present whether I was in grad school or not, and frankly, I'm so happy I was. I'm a much more competent professional, analytic thinker, and kinder person for having done so.",

      "text": "Grad school is emotionally, psychologically, financially, and physically challenging while the dominant narrative pushes for more intellectual rigor. \n\nI LOVED my MA. And HATE my PhD. I think that all comes down to my fit within a certain department. My had program is pretty damn conservative and often hypocritical\u2014which are two ideological orientations that really do not mesh well with my own personality. I\u2019ve grown a lot as a scholar, and that\u2019s expected, but my experience has not been good because of that growth.\n\nI agree with people that it comes down to selecting the right program, but people don\u2019t often discuss the amount of sheer fucking luck that goes into being admitted, and a complete inability to really know the culture of a department until you\u2019re in it. \n\nI have made some of the greatest friends in my PhD program. I\u2019ve had a lot of successes and failures. For me, the five years of PhD work and the stagnation it has on other aspects of life has been really difficult to reconcile. Is it possible for it to not suck? Sure, it\u2019s possible. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s probable though.",

It often comes form unanticipated sources: reviewers, equipment, PIs, collaborators, colleagues, funding agencies,administrators....\n\nThe publish or perish culture has turned academia into a toxic cesspool. In my experience, there are still a small minority who genuinely care about their students and research. They tend to be younger and less established.",

I'm working on a topic I really love and enjoy the day to day work of my field. The work is pretty individual, which can get a bit isolating especially in a new city and as college and high school friends seem to be \"moving on\" but it's work that I enjoy so overall, a good experience. The pandemic aspect has sucked but that would suck anywhere. I don't think you're any more likely to find a toxic workplace in academia than elsewhere, but we here more because the low pay, long hours, and limited career opportunities make the toxic workplaces less worth it when you do.",

              "text": "Sure! It really depends what degree, what country, etc but most PhD students in the US have a full scholarship for tuition and then either a teaching assistant job (TA), research assistant job (RA), or fellowship through school that provides a small stipend for living expenses. Those stipends can vary a lot, but usually in the sciences it's enough to live on though it's a pretty modest life.",

          "text": "I think it\u2019s possible to have a good advisor and department, and a lot of people have positive grad school experiences, but there are factors about academia that absolutely do make it a breeding ground for toxic work spaces. For one, if you have a normal job with a bad boss, you can just quit and find a new job with relatively few consequences. Whereas is grad school, quitting without the degree can feel like throwing years of your life in the garbage. This leads to a lot of unhappy people sticking around and breeding resentment. Not to mention professors being selected for their scientific prowess not their leadership skills which makes them a lot less qualified to lead a group than managers in an industry setting. And the fact that tenure makes them almost impossible to fire for poor leadership or even harassment and toxic behaviors\u2026 anyway, I don\u2019t want to keep ranting, but there are a lot of differences between a normal job and academia that I don\u2019t think people who haven\u2019t been through it would consider. And I wish I had been warned of these things before I joined.",
