  "text": "I\u2019m not yet in grad school, but see so many grad students with advisors or administration that are either passively or actively screwing then over in various ways. \n\nI don\u2019t presently foresee any such issues from my own future experience, but it\u2019s only so possible to foresee issues like the ones students face until you\u2019re already knee deep. \n\nSo, it seems smart to work to develop an understanding of grad student politics *in advance*, so that if anything arises, I\u2019ll have an idea of how to handle it or whom to turn to. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that I have an advisor lined up for grad school, we\u2019ve already worked together and everything I hear from everyone leads me to believe he\u2019s the real deal \u2014 I fully expect any possible issues to come from another source. \n\nIs there any good way to develop this understanding in advance, or is it really situation-dependent?\n\nThanks!",

Even innocuous things like \"so-and-so's class isn't my favorite\" or \"we have a lot of discussion posts in such-and-such class\" can be seen as criticizing\n\n2) Ask other grad students who they go to for help or advice. That'll help you in knowing who in the department is a good mentor.",

      "text": "Step zero is be aware that it is possible to be majorly screwed over.\n\nStep one is learn the rules everyone is playing by. \n\n* What are the explicit graduation requirements for your program? This should be found in your catalogue and your guidebook that they give you the first week at orientation.\n* What are the implicit requirements?\nThis includes anything that is individual to your PI and any publications submissions. Not every department has a publication requirement, some do, and some only require that you have submitted a paper to a publisher.\n* How are disputes handled? Both for grades and everything else. \n\nStep two is evaluate who you want to work with. Pick the person that you can see yourself thriving with. Projects or topics matter way less than the quality of the mentorship you get. \n\n* Interview current and former mentees away from the school. \n* Check out the publications is the quality, quantity, and content something that looks good for your field?\n* Take your time and see if the group you'll be joining has a work style you can work with and people you feel like you can be around for long hours comfortably. It isn't just your PI that you'll be handling after all. If the group culture feels toxic, move on. \n\nStep three is all about communication and setting and following through on expectations. \n\n* Talk to your PI about what you want out of the degree.\n* Work together to figure out how to get those things.\n* Set up regular expectations about how and when work is done. This can be a hard one because some people expect to have constant contact and some can't stand it. What level of hands on supervision do you really want or need? How do you want to be managed? It takes a bit of introspection, but think about how you can set yourself up to thrive. Be adults and have that discussion before it becomes an issue. \n\nKeep your PI / supervisors in the loop. I frequently would ask my PI to prioritize me with a list of projects so that he would know exactly what was on my plate and what stage everything was at. By being proactive and self-managing you set yourself up for success from the start. \n\nRemember, you rarely hear the stories of the people who had a positive experience because they don't feel the need to tell everyone they had a wonderful time. Here on /r/gradschool you hear a lot of people asking for advice and for help. There are myriad flaws with the system, but it should not be so hard as to be destructive to your mental and physical health. \n\nThis said, it can help to have a therapist you like around somewhere to, again, be proactive about your mental health.",

      "text": "I think *most* advisors are generally good but flawed people, just like everybody else. There definitely are ones that are actually horrible people, but you're more likely to hear about and remember those stories than the people who have good or neutral experiences. So even though you should be smart about warning signs and stand up for yourself, don't expect everyone to be awful!\n\nI think the best way to avoid that kind of stuff is to talk with potential advisors and their students ahead of entering a program and learn how to read in between the lines. Toxic people are often very good at misrepresenting themselves, but if something seems off, listen to your gut. Students will also hesitate to say bad things, especially over email, but if you can meet them in person maybe at the interview stage or talk to them over the phone, you should be aware that things that sound slightly bad are probably worse in reality. They're going to understate it because these are people who have control over their careers. So for example, if someone says, \"he can be a little difficult at times\" you can assume he's actually very difficult to work with in general. If it wasn't a pattern, people wouldn't mention it. \n\nBut on the other hand, if students have nothing but praise for their advisors, that's a great sign! Having a good advisor in your corner is honestly crucial. They're the person you're going to be working with the most probably and you can see how they handle issues and learn from them. The type of advisor you have can make or break your grad school experience.\n\nAnother thing is if you can meet all/most of the grad students at like a lunch or something during the interviews, make sure to pay attention to the general feel in the room. When we have lunch with the prospective students in my department, we're all super excited to talk about school and when I was doing my interviews, it was pretty obvious that people had good relationships. At another school I interviewed at, the advisor and his lab seemed great, but the lunch with the students was really weird, like there were a lot of passive aggressive comments and getting people to talk was like pulling teeth. I think the general atmosphere of the department can tell you a lot about how people work together. Like some departments have a really toxic culture of competition between students but others have a culture of collaboration and friendliness. You don't have to be best friends with everyone in the department, but having a generally supportive group around you will make things a lot better.",

      "text": "In general, my practice is to keep my ears open and my mouth closed. I'm nosy, not a gossip. There's also a non-negligible change that you won't have any problems regarding department dynamics. In my department, the only real \"politics\" are that certain professors can't serve on a committee together for personal reasons, but it doesn't impact graduate students because it's not something that is talked about openly. New folks who mistakenly want Professor Petty and Doctor Snooty on a committee together are just gently, but firmly, told to pick someone else. \n\nAlso, I make it a practice never say anything about someone I wouldn't want them to overhear. This actually served me really well in my master's program when a really annoying classmate was complaining nonstop about the dean and she ended up walking by. This is mostly a support forum, so people will complain here because they have nobody else to go to, and contrary to what one may think from posts here, in my own experience most conflict stems more from personality differences or miscommunication than actual abuse or malicious conduct. If you try to give people the benefit of the doubt, you might be right.",

My advisor was amazing for me and my career, but had very high expectations for output, it did not matter if that meant extra effort if it was something that wasn't the students strong area, and she rubbed off on people the wrong way a lot depending on personalities. Again: talk to the current grad students; when we were requiting, we always had one-on-one time b/c my advisor wanted to see how they'd fit in the group, see what they were like when not 'on' being around her, and wanted them to be able to ask more blunt questions. She'd rather me tell someone she was a hard ass/abrasive at time, but great at making sure you succeed, and it was better scaring someone away than taking someone on who couldn't take that style.\n\n>so that if anything arises, I\u2019ll have an idea of how to handle it or whom to turn to.\n\nStart with turning to other students, then other advisors you feel are approachable (my advisor had just moved to the school, was full prof already though, and immediately butted heads with one of the top profs) and I still went to the other advisor at times for career advise, then if those fail most schools have an ombudsman.\n\n>It\u2019s worth noting that I have an advisor lined up for grad school, we\u2019ve already worked together and everything I hear from everyone leads me to believe he\u2019s the real deal\n\nThat's a pretty big non-red flag (is there a saying for the opposite of a red flag?)\n\n>is it really situation-dependent?\n\nYes",
