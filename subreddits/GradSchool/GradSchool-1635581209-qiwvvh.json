  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a recently graduated student with a B.S. in mathematics (along with 2 associate degrees). My original plan was to obtain a graduate teaching assistantship at a university in my area but this fell through due to, apparently, those being very hard to obtain at American universities (I live in the US). This sucks because even a cheaper 4 year in the US charges well over $15,000 for a single year of grad school excluding the housing.\n\nI thought I would look into post-Bachelor opportunities overseas. Not only because they are potentially cheaper but because of a better socioeconomic climate and life experiences which I have not really had. I don't have any specific country in mind but the UK or Australia would be ideal since I only speak English. I can only afford it, though, if I'm able to obtain an assistantship.\n\nDoes anyone know of any opportunities in this regard or just advice in general? Thanks",

      "text": "Masters students (in research programs, not professional programs) in Canada are often paid a stipend which covers their tuition & some basic costs of living.  If you're a competitive applicant and worried about money, that seems like it would be a good option.  Some mainalnd European countries offer some masters degrees in English (e.g. the Netherlands) and may cost a lot less than the UK.\n\nDo note that many (most?) countries expect you to have done a masters before starting a PhD, so you'll need to look carefully into what degrees you're qualified to apply for in each country.",

It's probably the most common basic requirement. And it's often taught by TAs.\n\nSo there are generally lots of TA assistantship opportunities to teach math in the United States to go to grad school in math. Although they are going to be more commonly given to PhDs, as accreditation typically requires that anyone teaching a class have a certain number of graduate hours under their belt.",

They were both due to the same issue: too little funding and too many graduates (one university, about a third of all of their graduates in the math department were TAs or research assistants)",

At many universities, there are lots of teaching assistantships in math. You can either take that information and use it or not.",
