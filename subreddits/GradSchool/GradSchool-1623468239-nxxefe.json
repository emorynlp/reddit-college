I initially was found to have a carcinoid that was ultimately found to have been caused by a gastrinoma they're having trouble locating. Right now I'm trying to balance studying for my GRE, finding possible grad schools, taking summer classes, and dealing with the uncertainty of cancer all at once, and it's been really difficult. I can't thank you enough for sharing what you've gone through, and it honestly gives me a lot of hope that I'll be okay and can manage as I go through this process. I've been super nervous about if I can maintain my academic standing and dexide my future while going through whatever treatment I may need, but straight up if you can do it, I can too. You've given me a lot of hope, thank you so so much. You're a complete superstar, congratulations on doing so well and getting through everything you've been through! You're incredibly strong! I wish you the absolute best!",

          "text": "Different cancer treatments cause different side effects. Most women can work throughout breast cancer treatment, except for time off after surgery and for a couple of weeks after radiation, if they have accommodations to attend treatment and take off the day or two after chemo. Except - for some reason, some men and women get extremely nauseous from chemo - way more so than others. They can barely work. I was told by a nurse that it can be genetic, and that women who get really bad nausea during pregnancy are also much more likely to experience extreme nausea during treatment. I have no idea how true that is, but I know some people\u2019s nausea is barely controlled the entire course while experience arely any nausea at all.\n\nAnyway - don\u2019t beat yourself up about deferring a year. And congrats on your remission and graduating!",

Besides the whole cancer thing, it was a pretty chill year hah \n\n(but I was lucky to be 23, still on my parent's health insurance, and able to just spend the year living at home with my parents - some people don't have the luxury of that option)",
