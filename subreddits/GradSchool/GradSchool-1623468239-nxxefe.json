I'm entering my senior year of undergrad and was diagnosed with cancer two months ago. I initially was found to have a carcinoid that was ultimately found to have been caused by a gastrinoma they're having trouble locating. Right now I'm trying to balance studying for my GRE, finding possible grad schools, taking summer classes, and dealing with the uncertainty of cancer all at once, and it's been really difficult. I can't thank you enough for sharing what you've gone through, and it honestly gives me a lot of hope that I'll be okay and can manage as I go through this process. I've been super nervous about if I can maintain my academic standing and dexide my future while going through whatever treatment I may need, but straight up if you can do it, I can too. You've given me a lot of hope, thank you so so much. You're a complete superstar, congratulations on doing so well and getting through everything you've been through! You're incredibly strong!
