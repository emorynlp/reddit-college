I loved my thesis project, but I had a massive mental health roadblock hit me head on while I was working on it, and of course, I attempted to power my way through rather than handling it at the onset.  So 2 weeks before my thesis was due, I had a vague outline and nothing else - I was even missing some key sources.  But I buckled down, locked myself in my office for those 2 weeks, made sure I got good sleep (because the writing mojo just doesn't come if I'm not well rested), told my husband we were doing takeout for every meal until it was done, and he brought me a fresh cup of tea every couple of hours while I banged away at it until it was done.  It was fairly rough by my standards, but my committee loved it, and eventually I'll get around to cleaning it up and preparing it for publication.  So it can absolutely be done.  Do you know any things which help make writing easier for you?  Do you write better at home, in a coffee shop, in the library?  Do you write better in the morning, at night, at 3am?  Once you start building an environment that's conducive to writing for you, it's just a matter of setting small goals and not allowing yourself to get up (not even to pee) until you've met that goal.  You'll be amazed how fast you can whip out 3 paragraphs if you're in desperate need of going to the bathroom and your goal was to finish off the page (the answer for me was just over 11 minutes).  Prioritize anything you can't function without - sleep, nutrient dense meals, caffeinated beverages of choice (but be careful of these within 4-6 hours of bedtime), etc. - then anything else can be used as an incentive for completing a goal.  Also, accountability is super helpful for lighting a fire under your rear.  You've made the public declaration and we believe you can do this.

Like \u201cspend ten minutes reading this theory\u201d, \u201csend an email to my supervisor\u201d, \u201ctype all the of subheadings for chapter 3 into a word document\u201d. Really, you must make these tasks super small things, not anything that takes you more than 15 minutes or so. Also it\u2019s a great idea to put other basic life tasks on this wall during very stressful periods, like \u201cgo and buy groceries\u201d, \u201ccook a lasagne to last me a few days\u201d.\nNow add a few things to your \u201ctoday\u201d and \u201ctomorrow\u201d sections. Don\u2019t add too much, you can always do a few extra tasks if you complete everything and still feel motivated. Once you completed a task, move it to the \u201ccompleted\u201d section, don\u2019t throw away the post it notes.    \nAs you slowly start to see your tasks shift into the \u201ccompleted\u201d part, you realise that you are progressing and you are not failing to do this.
