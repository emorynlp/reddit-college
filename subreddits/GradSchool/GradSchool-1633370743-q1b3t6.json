  "text": "I can't remember the last time a faculty member was on time to a meeting with me or others.  When they attend meetings, they have forgotten all details of things we were supposed to discuss. Some faculty gossip about one another to students.  My biggest current issue is that my 2 co-advisors continually lie directly to my face without remorse Re: \"You'll have it by the end of the day\" \"I'm almost done, I'll email it to you in a minute\" \"Don't worry about hiring undergrads, I will take care of it\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not setting unreasonable expectations for anyone.  Most of the time they are not even my expectations, my advisors just continually make promises they can't keep.  They will keep a paper for 3+ months before sending me edits, then give me 24 hours to address the edits. I want to graduate and they do not care.  They already have their degrees.  They already have their jobs and make an actual salary. They face absolutely no consequences for any of this behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm disillusioned.  I'm disappointed.  I do not trust my advisors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrad School is hard enough.  I feel hopeless at times because I feel like I have little to no support. Am I alone here?",

      "text": "This is very common, and I agree with other commenters, it's not intentional that they don't meet the deadlines they promise. The higher up you get in academia, the more you are snowed under with a constant stream of paperwork, grant deadlines and demands from the people you look after, before you can even get to your own research work, and it is usually a case of just doing what is most urgent first and working down the list in order of deadline /urgency.\n\nI am not very senior but am already busy in this respect and sometimes get emails from undergrads / PhD students wanting substantial things from me with a day or twos notice, as if their personal preferred time lines are more important than everyone else's and frankly it comes across as rude and selfish (not saying you are doing this).\n\nIn my experience on both sides of this, the most effective thing to do is email the person you need something from with as much notice as possible (at least a week, multiple weeks if it's something like a publication draft that doesn't have a hard deadline) and:\n\n(a) if there's a real deadline, like a revision deadline, highlight that you really need it back by [that date minus enough time for you do work on it afterwards] as that's the latest you can submit it (i.e. Emphasise the deadline but make it clear that it's the external person/entity applying this pressure, not you)\n\nOr\n\n(b) if there is no hard deadline but you just want to get shit done (for example submitting a paper to a journal), phrase it as 'I am aiming to submit this on X date and would be very grateful to receive any revisions/comments before then' (i.e. If I don't hear back from you I'll assume you're fine with it and am going ahead)\n\nBasically, always give a date you need it back by as far in advance as possible, and it doesn't hurt to send a polite reminder a few days before if you haven't heard anything back, putting the deadline in the email subject to catch their attention.\n\nAnd importantly, always be respectful and thankful for their time in advance and afterwards, your deadline and needs are just a drop in the ocean of deadlines they have to meet",

Several reasons.\n\n- they\u2019ve possibly never been in an enterprise setting and therefore don\u2019t have any experience outside of areas with academic influences\n- universities don\u2019t instill a sense of professionalism in students nor teachers and almost no one is held accountable (\u2026 usually)\n- professors are\u2026 professors, and not professionals. I wouldn\u2019t expect a dance instructor to be on her A-game with her accounting (typically), but there are some that are; likewise, I wouldn\u2019t expect a professor to really have super great social skills (strongly depends on field) or project management skills (i.e. efficiently managing many personal projects and student projects).\n\nSo, all of that said, let alone the plethora of other things left unsaid, paints a picture of expectations. Some professors will respond quickly, professionally, fairly, give reasonable expectations & deadlines, explain things concisely, etc., but the vast majority will not because those skills are not what they got hired for, nor what they likely spent their time teaching or instilling in themselves.\n\nI long ago changed my perspective on how I view research professors and my bar was exceedingly lowered. Since I did that, I don\u2019t really get too frustrated any more and relationships have improved (some of my profs are great anyways though). That said, *you* should *always* act with professionalism because that\u2019s how the setting ought to be.\n\nPersonal note: I left a fully funded dream GRA & prestigious professor on a stupidly prestigious project because, among many other reasons, the lack of professionalism was *exceedingly* bad and was drastically lowering my quality of life. Leaving the advisor was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made in my academic career. I don\u2019t suggest such extreme measures, but there are times when you need to stand up for yourself quite firmly.\n\nFeel free to dm if you want to talk about it or ask questions.\n\nGood luck over there :)\n\nEdit: tangible advise in & out of academia - get ***everything*** in writing. *Especially* expectations for work/projects/milestones. I used this to present irrefutable evidence to the board that allowed me to leave my advisor. I wouldn\u2019t have had so many behind my back if it was all just hearsay.",

      "text": "It can be really frustrating but faculty are overwhelmed, not lying to you or being unprofessional. You have one or two projects to work on so it's top priority and all you think and meet about. They could easily have a dozen projects plus classes to teach plus getting grants plus other departmental work. \n\nRe: meetings, part of a PhD is actively managing and running meetings with faculty so that they're efficient. It's your project that they're advising on, not an assigned task from a boss, so you should be coming in with a plan for the meeting, reminders about the goal, specific questions. I go through slides at the start of every single meeting about the general idea, what we discussed last time, etc and that helps quite a bit. I also follow up on urgent things if I don't get them when they say.",

You need to proactively remind them of their commitments to you and not by email. They get hundreds a day. You need to send calendar invites that serve as reminders and if things are getting done, set more regular meetings, make a shared calendar, Trello, Teams group etc. One thing I did was set an agenda where we reviewed new writing together and agreed on a way forward during the meeting. Both of my supervisors were more active in the months leading up to the submission of my thesis, which is to be expected. There were times that they needed to spend more time with my fellow students because they were close to submission, so I had less time with them, which is fair enough.",

I understand that you have an emotional stake in your candidacy but you will not get far by accusing them of lying.

This time is yours for them to go through the paper and you\u2019d like to be there if they have questions.\n\nMake a ppt to go along with the paper. Walk them through that. Then the paper figures. Then the paper.\n\nI had a very hard time editing one of my students papers. They struggled with writing and editing their papers was a chore. They started doing a ppt with me first and I would arrange the ppt and figures and then we would talk about them. Then they would write.
