  "text": "Anyone else have a bunch of their friends weddings while you\u2019re a student? Living off of loans on a strict budget, while all my friends are having weddings (I\u2019m bridesmaid in 2 of them) and the amount of money I\u2019m expected to invest in each wedding is probably about $500-$1000 each! \nHolt crap. I\u2019m super excited and happy for my friends, but fighting feeling upset about how much I need to spend just to participate and be supportive. As a student, that amount of money is crucial for my living expenses. \n\nLooks like I can\u2019t even attend my best friend since 4th grade\u2019s bachelorette party because it\u2019s $250 for BnB and takes place from Wed-Sat meaning I\u2019d have to miss a clinical rotation and summer classes. \n\nAnyone else dealt with disappointing friends because you\u2019re a student and can\u2019t afford to attend or participate in friends weddings? \n\nAnyone had luck with getting time off from professors fo attend wedding events?",

When I got married several of my friends were students or working very low paying jobs, so instead of asking them to cover their dresses or suits, I paid in part or in full for those who I knew it would be a financial burden. I had factored those purchases into my wedding budget to begin with because I  a grad student and I knew the financial stress it causes.",

We have a small circle of friends whose weddings we will attend/be in if asked, but beyond that, we really can\u2019t afford it, and we don\u2019t have the vacation/capacity to travel. None of our friends who are getting married live in-state for us. \n\nI was in a childhood friend\u2019s wedding during M1, and the cost would have been ridiculous if I had attended everything. They did a bachelorette weekend to Nashville, and then a second one in the North Ga mountains (I\u2019m at school in New England.). I couldn\u2019t make it financially or miss class/clinic, and I told them that. It pissed off the rest of the wedding party, but the bride had known I couldn\u2019t make either of those things when she asked me to be in the wedding. I also stayed at my parents\u2019, since she got married an hour from my parents\u2019 house, so I could see my nephew, grandparents, etc the week of the wedding (but I still attended all of the wedding-related festivities!!) instead of spending to stay in the air bnb with the other bridesmaids. Bride was super understanding! Her friends, not so much. I was honestly so glad I didn\u2019t stay in the air bnb because 2/3 of the other bridesmaids were rude and 1/3 was extremely unkind to me. The bride has sadly since fallen off the face of the planet to all of us because her husband keeps her pretty isolated.",

It was so touch and go that she just said \u201cwear whatever\u201d, so I wore a dress I already owned. \n\nNow I am planning my own wedding and I am trying to keep it as cheap as possible for my friends just because of where I am at financially and how I don\u2019t want them to feel obligated to spend a whole bunch of money on me, so I am going to have a simple hair and makeup look for my party and allow them to wear something in a broad colour scheme and style, so they can find something under $100 if they want to. I will ask them to try to plan something simple and cheap for the bachelorette, like maybe rent a cabin or something. \n\nHopefully there are ways you can still include yourself while making the couple aware of your situation. Discuss your budget with them and try to be up front about what events you can make it to and how much you are able to afford with stuff that comes up.",

I suggest having a one on one girls night get together with the bride as a substitute bachelorette. You can do all the fun things without spending that much. It'll be way more memorable. Same thing with the wedding. Treat the couple to a dinner/activity and maybe get them a gift (the dinner/activity could also be the gift) and have good conversation. You can choose how much you want to be a part of the couples wedding celebration. You can also tailor your budget to suit your needs. You'll still be spending money but that way you can be in control how much you want to spend.",

A day after we get back from a vacation with his family, after I spent money on a dress for his sister's bridal shower (plus a gift) and a month before her wedding, which I had to get a separate dress for (and shoes). Ugh. I hate everything right now. \n\nWeddings are usually on weekends though so there's that. Most profs don't sweat leaving on a Friday if you're in a lab type situation and will often switch days if you have paid hours you need to make up somewhere. A lot of profs don't even come in on Fridays or do WFH (in my experience). Pre Covid, Fridays were usually for meetings but that's all on Zoom now.",

We just said \"Sorry, I can't afford to travel this summer\" or whatever when it was too $$$ for our budget (my partner was a grad student too). But almost all of our friends were *also* grad students so most of those weddings were done on the cheap and people tried to arrange for cheap lodging (camping, shared houses, etc.) knowing that many of us couldn't afford a $1000 bill. Lots of grad school weddings were held outdoors, or in the campus chapel, or some other less expensive venue. I'm a minister and have done weddings for grads and recent Ph.D.s, all of them in someone's backyard or a rented barn or whatever.\n\nFor those who didn't get it, we just didn't go.",

I carpooled & stayed at a friend's place too so it kept the expenses low. But for out of state weddings, I understand now that it costs a bomb especially with flight tickets + accomodation. It's like a vacation... yikes",

They also did not expect a gift, saying that having me in their wedding was the best gift I could give them.\n\nIDK maybe my friends are just incredibly generous, but shouldn't friends at least be understanding with their closest pals? Maybe we just have the culture in our little circle that the closest friends (essentially family) are in the wedding party and thus we're more likely to help each other in that way.\n\nIt's a tough situation and there are definitely other weddings that I have just not been able to go to because of grad school finances.",
