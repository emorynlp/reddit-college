  "text": "I hope this is allowed here\u2026 my parents are pretty supportive and I\u2019m very grateful, but I can\u2019t help but feel almost envious of the students around me in regards to the support they receive from their friends. My friends who are in the program are generally quite understanding, but my \u2018close\u2019 friends who all work different full time jobs haven\u2019t really been there for me. I know it\u2019s a small issue and I shouldn\u2019t complain, but I can\u2019t help but feel a bit resentful. Of course I miss out on dinners and things because I\u2019m just busy most of the time with uni work, and they just get angry with me for not showing up (even though I apologise and make an effort to check in regularly). They make snarky jokes about how they should \u2018make me a study schedule\u2019 because if I was more organised I wouldn\u2019t be having a hard time. They never ask how things are going, or let me know they\u2019re proud of me. And when I apologise for being stressed, they just tell me that I am being unreasonable because \u2018adults realise that uni doesn\u2019t matter once you\u2019re grown up and are earning money in the real world\u2019. On one hand none of them have been to grad school so I figure they just don\u2019t understand (so it\u2019s unfair of me therefore to hold any of this against them) but on the other hand I (think) I\u2019ve been supportive and empathetic when they\u2019re dealt with things I have no personal experience with\u2026 has anyone had a similar experience? I find myself just wanting to avoid them all together now.",
