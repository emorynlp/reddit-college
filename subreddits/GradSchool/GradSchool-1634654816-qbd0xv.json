  "text": "I hope this is allowed here\u2026 my parents are pretty supportive and I\u2019m very grateful, but I can\u2019t help but feel almost envious of the students around me in regards to the support they receive from their friends. My friends who are in the program are generally quite understanding, but my \u2018close\u2019 friends who all work different full time jobs haven\u2019t really been there for me. I know it\u2019s a small issue and I shouldn\u2019t complain, but I can\u2019t help but feel a bit resentful. Of course I miss out on dinners and things because I\u2019m just busy most of the time with uni work, and they just get angry with me for not showing up (even though I apologise and make an effort to check in regularly). They make snarky jokes about how they should \u2018make me a study schedule\u2019 because if I was more organised I wouldn\u2019t be having a hard time. They never ask how things are going, or let me know they\u2019re proud of me. And when I apologise for being stressed, they just tell me that I am being unreasonable because \u2018adults realise that uni doesn\u2019t matter once you\u2019re grown up and are earning money in the real world\u2019. On one hand none of them have been to grad school so I figure they just don\u2019t understand (so it\u2019s unfair of me therefore to hold any of this against them) but on the other hand I (think) I\u2019ve been supportive and empathetic when they\u2019re dealt with things I have no personal experience with\u2026 has anyone had a similar experience? I find myself just wanting to avoid them all together now.",

      "text": "You say you have friends in the program, but how close are you with them? Can you seen yourself becoming closer? It can be hard in grad school because a lot of people may have started families already, adding more focus away from school. I was in a committed relationship when I entered grad school, so I had my now wife\u2019s support, which was extremely helpful. \n\nHowever, both of my parents passed away before undergrad, and I had moved to a new city, so I will use this as my example. The handful of close relationships I made with my classmates was so, so, so important. Obviously they understood the work load. Too busy to hang out? We\u2019d study together. And the best people to vent to are the ones who just get it. \n\nI\u2019ll say again that I know it\u2019s not as easy in grad school to make these kinds of friendships. But it might be worth a shot to reach out a bit more to those around you if you have yet to.",

So maybe as you\u2019re saying I should create some additional effort towards strengthening the relationships I do have with those in my program\u2026",

      "text": "While I empathize that grad school is demanding and friendships are hard, I would also suggest to you that friendships go both ways and grad school shouldn't necessarily be a complete interruption to your life. Unless you're working full time and in grad school, you probably should have time to hang out with your friends. In my experience, the same folks who over-work themselves in grad school continue to over-work themselves after grad school. You can't control your friends, but you can control your actions. \n\nI understand that some of the experiences you share do paint your friends in a negative light, and that sounds really difficult. But friendships take time and prioritization. If you personally do not take the time to prioritize your friendships then what can you expect from your friends? Yes, careers are important, but so are the people you surround yourself with.",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply! And I respect your opinion definitely. I think what I was more going for was that I still see my friends around 3 times a week, text each of them everyday without being prompted, send apology gifts etc. but feel like that effort hasn\u2019t really been reciprocated. But I will say no to the 4th time hanging out that week on average because of school. I also work (non optional for me) and was recently hospitalised for lupus. So nothing intentional on my end. I don\u2019t expect a huge gesture, I was just hoping for a \u2018okay we get it, good luck with it!\u2019, if that makes sense. But I understand that it\u2019s my responsibility to do better, so will take that on board. Thanks! :)",
