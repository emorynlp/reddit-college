Now I am back to being at home this week and having a hard time focusing on anything (even though I need to get this grant application done!!!). \n\nSo just know that you are not alone, this sh\\*t is already hard and stressful without the burden of a pandemic, collapsing government (at least in the US), and climate change. \n\nHow is everyone else doing and what are you doing to boost your mental health/kindness towards yourself?
