  "text": "I'm (hopefully) in the last semester of my PhD - been in my program for 6.5 years - and am only working on writing my dissertation. Problem is, I have lost almost all of my motivation. \n\nI know in some regards, it's better to finish if I've gotten this far, but I've struggled with burnout and depression over my time in grad school that my heart just isn't in it. I don't find my thesis interesting anymore. I feel like I've under performed in terms of publications and conference presentations. I don't think I'll be able to succeed in academia but remain at this crossroads of feeling like I should try to get a postdoc but I'm also not good enough for one. On most days I don't always see the point in finishing.\n\nI'm also going to look for jobs in industry but I struggle to have any passion. People ask me what I want to do, and I tell them a path that is a clear application of my field but the truth is I don't want to do anything.\n\nI guess I'm curious if anyone else feels this way or how people deal with burnout when it's gotten overwhelming. I know it's best to combat that before it gets this bad, but unfortunately this is where I am.",

No reason to shut a door on yourself that isn\u2019t yours to shut\n\nAlso yeah, if you\u2019re at 6.5 years and just have the dissertation left\u2026 finish it. I say that as someone who *abhors* research and just spent a miserable month pulling together my dissertation proposal. I know it\u2019s miserable, I know it\u2019s easier said than done. But you\u2019ve invested too much to deprive yourself of this title when you\u2019re so close. If you need to fuel yourself on spite, do it. Remember this phrase: \u201c*done* is better than *good*.\u201d",

I was so close to giving up, but I've spent 4.5 years essentially putting my life on hold. I might as well get a doctorate out of it. I realize that at this point, I don't need to get it perfect, I just need to get it done. It's not easy to accept that fact, and maybe it's not the right attitude, but I just want to get out as fast as I can and start doing my own stuff.",

We have various activities that help build visibility and employability. \n\nStudents who lose momentum at the end are a big problem relative to our goal. That often happens because a lot of students way underestimate how hard it is to get the dissertation written. From your DGSs perspective, you are becoming problematic in a very familiar way. They are likely eager to help you. \n\nI have a list of students who are supposed to be finishing up. I check in with them a couple times a semester to see how things are coming along. That's not much, but for some it provides a bit of support, motivation and accountability.",
