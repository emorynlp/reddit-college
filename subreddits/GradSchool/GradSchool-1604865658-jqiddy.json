  "text": "OH MY GOSH SORRY I DONT HAVE ANYONE TO TELL THIS TO SO IM HERE!!\n\nSo I've been in my Aerospace Engineering \"catch-up\" courses this semester since I got my degree in Physics, and I really didn't understand half of the stuff going on. \n\nToday I figured out it's because every engineering principle is based on Statics. *I never took Statics in undergrad.* \n\nI thought I was maybe just naturally stupid or didn't belong here, but it's not that at all!!\n\nI was approaching all these problems from a Physics mindset, which is why I kept getting things wrong!\n\nI talked to my professors and they understood and helped me find good resources, so now I'm gonna teach myself Statics and FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHATS GOING ON!!!\n\nI'm so happy y'all. This probably doesn't seem like anything big, but it's a huge game-changer for me. I'm so excited!!!!\n\nTL;DR - Im getting an engineering masters and I just realized the reason nothing's made sense is bc I never took Statics!!\n\nEdit: Thank yall all so much for your support and my first awards on reddit! I'm really blown away by how common this is in transitioning to grad school programs lol",

Of course philosophers are able to read and digest hundreds of pages of literature in an afternoon and come up with perfect arguments on the spot, *that is literally what they've spent their life training to do!* Meanwhile, computer scientists don't give two shits about what someone said 50 years ago since, if you have the data to back up your claims, what does it matter?",

                      "text": "The Laplace transform is a generalization of the Fourier transform, which is what your ears do to incoming sound.  Fourier transformation turns any function of an independent variable (say, pressure as a function of time -- i.e. sound) into an equivalent function of the reciprocal of that variable (say, sound energy as a function of pitch -- which is measured in units of 1/time). \n\nThe Laplace transform is a generalization of that.  Applied to sound, the Laplace transform converts pressure-vs-time into a collection of \"bell tolls\" (nearly-pure pitch, falling off in volume) rather than pure-pitch tones.\n\nBoth types of transform are useful for understanding physical systems.  Physicists think about Laplace transforms in several contexts including the behavior of dissipative fields (such as the electromagnetic field in a medium, which might gradually absorb radio or light as they propagate).  Engineers think about Z transforms (and, to be fair, Laplace transforms also) in the contexts of signal processing and control theory.   Mathematicians -- well, who knows what mathematicians think about?",

Usually this means analyzing materials under load - your desk, for example, is not moving, but it's experiencing load from your keyboard, monitor, etc. It might not be a big deal if your desk breaks if you put too much load on it, so there might not be the most urgent need to analyze how the material handles loads and stressed, but for something like a building you'll need to do work beforehand because we don't ever want to find out its breaking point after the fact.\n\nIt's important in aerospace engineering for studying loads on a wing, for example.",

Do static values apply to the object being held up like a monitor on top of the desk? If so, does the value change depending on where the monitor sits on the desk? Like if it sits on the corner of the desk then it won't break but if it's a thin table and the monitor sits right in the center of it then it's more liable to collapse? How does Statics work in space without all the gravity? Does it mess everything up? \n\nShoot, now I want to learn about statics and physics and dropping bowling balls off buildings and stuff",

Typically objects are designed within certain criteria so the design engineer is either told or makes an assumption on were the load is and how much it is. So if the engineer is told the weight should be in the middle they will make sure there is enough reinforcement in the middle. \nI have no idea about how it would work in space but probably more about withstanding acceleration from thrust and actually getting the object to space.",
