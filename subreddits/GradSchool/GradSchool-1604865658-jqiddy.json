This probably doesn't seem like anything big, but it's a huge game-changer for me. I'm so excited!!!!\n\nTL;DR - Im getting an engineering masters and I just realized the reason nothing's made sense is bc I never took Statics!!\n\nEdit: Thank yall all so much for your support and my first awards on reddit!
