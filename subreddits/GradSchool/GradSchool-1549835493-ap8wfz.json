In the sports/lifting community there is this concept of deload week. It is based on the idea that lifting weights is a stress that you accumulate faster than your body can evacuate it. You get rid of some of it during the night, while sleeping, eating and so on, but there is still a little bit of residual fatigue that accumulates day after day, training session after training session, and is easily amplified by outside events (break up, bad day, health problems, etc.). So there is a \"deload week\" programmed every few weeks, which is a week during which you intentionally keep stress low. You still do stuff, lift a bit of weights, do some jogging, but you keep from doing anything intense. Basically, it's a \"slow down\" period that helps you from crashing. \n\nI've always found that to be helpful in my academic career, typically using a 4 hard weeks - 1 light week cycle.", "author": "needlzor", "created": 1549890042, "upvotes": 1}, "eg7wwwd": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ap8wfz/take_care_of_yourself/eg7wwwd/", "text": "Ah, thanks for reminding me that I needed to eat something, I skipped breakfast and then lunch and now it's dinner time!", "author": "notinverse", "created": 1549888285, "upvotes": 1}, "eg74kc5": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ap8wfz/take_care_of_yourself/eg74kc5/", "text": "I just finished grading a bunch of papers and have a giant headache.
