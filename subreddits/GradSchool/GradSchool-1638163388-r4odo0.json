  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nFor context. I am currently in my 3rd year of my neuroscience PhD. I love neuroscience, but I have recently realized I do not want to do bench research or be a professor as a career. It feels like if I got a job offer doing something else, I'd take it, even though there are days when I like research. \n\nI do have my masters in the same subject from another school, so I think (hope) I could find a decent job. What's mostly stopping me if knowing how angry my parents would be at me and disappointing my PI and lab (who are amazing). Additionally, I finished my coursework, in the midst of my comps - it seems like a bad idea to quit now, but also the idea of pushing through my thesis for another 2.5-3 years sounds like torture. \n\nNot sure if this is just burnout or whatever - any else feeling/has felt the same?",

      "text": "Anyone telling you the only path from a PhD is a professor or bench researcher is doing you a massive disservice.\n\nA PhD is not just a degree in <SUBJECT>.  It's a degree showing that you can learn something new that nobody else has learned.  I know chemistry PhDs who now write the code for self-driving cars. So if you want the PhD, get it.  A STEM PhD will open doors for you.",

          "text": "That's true. I'm not entirely sure what career I'd like, so definitely a pro to finishing is having more doors opened possibly. \nBut part of me wonders if I could find whatever job I would like without a Phd, would I still want to finish? Currently, I think that answer is no, but definitely more to think about. I appreciate your reply, thank you.",

      "text": "I feel similar sometimes and am in the same boat. Not sure if it is just the burnout talking or just the time of the year. I try to ignore those doubts in my head most of the time, or let them have their space and then leave. Take some time if you can to refresh and re-evaluate yourself. Maybe step away for a day or two. I don't love what I'm doing all the time and I definitely have slumps where I am overwhelmed and/or don't want to do any of it. Just take a breath before you make any big decisions, unless it is causing you serious mental health issues and inescapable feelings of despair and dread. Then I'd talk to my advisor/ a friend to get their opinion. Talking to a good friend who gets it or a mental health professional can help. It's ok to be burned out. You're doing ok. You don't have to love it all the time (almost no job is like that). Good luck!",

Could be worth it to get that little bit of certification, even if you don't want to do the dissertation.",
