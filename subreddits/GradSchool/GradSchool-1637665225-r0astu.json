  "text": "My Masters was excellent. I won an award for brilliance. But my PhD has been nothing short of one misfortune after another.\n\nIt got off to an alright start, but I never got on with my colleagues. They bullied me to the point I didn't even sit with them in the cafeteria anymore. That really just set the whole shitshow that has been my PhD in motion, really.\n\nI really didn't like the project I was assigned. It was very dull. But I got on with it. The theory was very interesting, but my day-to-day experiments were just such a slog. I came home every day miserable, but I got on with it anyway.\n\nThen came covid. \n\nMy lab shut down in March 2020, and it was shut for months and months, during which time I like many reverted to a teenager. No longer was I a lab rat, I was the house maid.\n\nThe lab re-opened in August, and I started to get back into it. \n\nJust two weeks after I got back into the lab, my father passed away very suddenly. I had to rush back and suspend my PhD for several months. For 7 months, I stayed at home completely isolated, once again the house maid. During this time, I developed severe mental health issues, including severe anxiety and depression from all the isolation.\n\nWhen I FINALLY came back to work in April, I was totally out of the rhythm of working, having panic attacks most days, and in the end I just couldn't show up to work anymore. But still I kept trying to muscle on.\n\nBut my mental health has just kept deteriorating, and I've been missing more and more days, sometimes not going in at all for an entire week.\n\nToday, my lack of progress really caught up with me. Hard.\n\nI had the most AWFUL meeting. All seven of them just looked at me with great contempt and disappointment. They outright stated they were really not happy with me. My performance was awful, and I had no report to present. This is what really pissed them off. They also got upset with me for not replying to certain emails.\n\nIt was absolutely awful. Every second of the meeting was awful. I could feel them staring into my soul. As the meeting finally came to a close, my boss was just shaking his head. They all looked gravely concerned.\n\nI'm going to get fired, I just know it. A few months ago I had another meeting that went almost as awful, and I tried to resign after receiving a very concerned email from them. But they convinced me to stay, so I didn't resign.\n\nBut now I'm going to get fired. I just know it. From how unbelievably awful awful AWFUL that meeting went. I mean he was literally shaking his head! How badly do you have to fuck up for that?!\n\nMy whole PhD journey has been shit from almost start to now. My mental health has rapidly deteriorated from all the SHIT I've been through in my personal life throughout, and now it's crunch time and I'm going to get fired. Fuck me man they should've just let me leave when I resigned. Now I'm going to get fired and have no reference and no fucking future. Who in my prestigious field is going to hire a guy that was literally fired from a PhD?!\n\nFuck. I feel today marks the end of my career and I had better find another purpose in life.",

      "text": "Take a deep breath.\n\nYou said you've had severe anxiety and the way you've written this reminds me of the circular thinking that I get into when I am having a panic attack. \n\nAs you said at the beginning of your post- the past two years have been A LOT. It sounds like your department knows this. Do they know how much you have been struggling? If you feel safe sharing that with them, now might be the time.\n\nAlso, see if your university has mental health resources. You need support right now and they will be able to at least get that support system started. \n\nYou had a bad meeting, it happens. You probably aren't going to be fired. It's going to be okay.",

      "text": "Sounds like you have shitty lab mates and a shitty professor. I agree it's unlikely that you'll get fired. They'd have to make everything official and then you more or less hold up the shit cards you've been dealt recently and no university with a functioning brain would let them fire you for fear of public backlash for treating you like shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides absolute worst case scenario being fired is not such a big deal, you just phrase it a bit more eloquently on your resume. You say withdrew due to dispute. Being a PhD isn't a traditional job it's more than fair to not call it getting fired. Then you can tell your tail to any potential employer or another potential supervisor if you had to change things up and start under someone new. 98% of people are going to look at you more favorably than your former lab mates. Yeah you'd have to share a lot more personal details with a potential employer/ PI, and that may make you uncomfortable, but it's not the end of the world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso to help through commiseration/ advice for turning things around. I had a bad meeting with my supervisor last year, she was upset with how long things were taking (She had assigned me stuff outside my field and I was having to learn stuff completely unrelated to my studies). She sat me down on the floor with her dog and I could tell from her tone that she was trying to give a you're a good student, I'm not angry just disappointed speech. If you can manage it in those scenarios the best thing to do is to lean into it and HARD. Be like yeah I'm also super upset with how long these things are taking, I'm not happy with my progress, I've been dealing with X, Y, and Z, and things have been taking me WAY more time than I'd expect. Pulling this with my supervisor the talk actually turned into a bonus, don't expect that if you're not good at acting, but leaning in makes it REALLY hard for someone to cast blame cause it forces them to acknowledge their responsibilities to you. Your supervisor bringing that up in a group was horrifyingly inappropriate and not at all okay, even if you were in the wrong, which from your description you certainly aren't. Leaning in effectively defangs criticism cause it forces collaboration into the conversation and really makes it difficult to blame the person for the perceived short fall.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless it will all be okay in the end, regardless of how it washes out.",
