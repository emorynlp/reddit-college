  "text": "Hello all,\n\nHistory grad student here. I have a probably rather basic and stupid question, but I am unsure about the following :\n\nWhen I write a chapter/article that addresses a specific question in the scholarly literature, I will obviously use the beginning of the article / chapter to discuss the previous literature and how I differ from it/argue against it. \n\nHowever, I am wondering whether after that I also have to try and refute/critique each of the source(s) previous historians have used to make their arguments, which I am arguing against now? Or is it basically fine just use my own primary sources to make my argument after having discussed the previous literature in the introduction?\n\nThank you!\n\n(x post from r/ask historians)",
