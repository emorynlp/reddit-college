  "text": "Hello all,\n\nHistory grad student here. I have a probably rather basic and stupid question, but I am unsure about the following :\n\nWhen I write a chapter/article that addresses a specific question in the scholarly literature, I will obviously use the beginning of the article / chapter to discuss the previous literature and how I differ from it/argue against it. \n\nHowever, I am wondering whether after that I also have to try and refute/critique each of the source(s) previous historians have used to make their arguments, which I am arguing against now? Or is it basically fine just use my own primary sources to make my argument after having discussed the previous literature in the introduction?\n\nThank you!\n\n(x post from r/ask historians)",

      "text": "I'm probably being a dummy here, but what's the format and purpose of this? That is, is it a historiographical essay, or a literature review, or a historiography chapter/section for your own original research? I'm sure you don't want to be *super* specific about what you're doing, but having some sense of it may help as far as how to approach historiography.",

          "text": "I am talking about a chapter in my dissertation here. But from my research in the past few days, it seems that refuting each and every source other historians used to make the argument I challenge is not necessary. If someone is really that interested, they can check said previous literature and my work and judge for themselves what is more convincing. Or am I wrong?",

              "text": "That seems correct to me. If there's something that's central to an argument you're making that you can't avoid acknowledging, it may come up in there, but most stuff I've seen will relegate much of that to the historiography, or if the writer wants it in there but not in the text, occasionally there may be some sort of content footnote.",
