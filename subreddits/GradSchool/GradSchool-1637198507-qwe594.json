It feels like we are past the point of no return. \n\nThis has been a 6-year journey while working full-time, and what I have learned is both academic and psychological. Wouldn't trade it for the world.",

          "text": "Thank you! Aside from the content of my research area (theories of learning, cognitive development, mathematics education), some of my biggest take-aways from this process has been that I am capable of setting a long-term goal -- in the absence of deadlines or the cycle of the semester to keep me productive -- and I can achieve that goal. \n\nI have been working on this dissertation for 4 years, off and on, while working full-time. I learned in the process that I had a good bit of imposter syndrome. I come from a quantitative and technical background, with no formal training in pedagogy or psychology. I spent probably an entire year teaching myself cognitive development and learning theories. And through it, I learned that I can dive into new domains and teach myself. That feels empowering.\n\nOh, and I learned that you can write an entire dissertation (and do the data analysis on a reasonably large data set) on a Chromebook.",

Did you find it more challenging or surprisingly easier to be productive without the structure of semesters? And how did you navigate the imposter syndrome issue?",

                  "text": "Part of the challenge was learning how to be productive in an unstructured environment. I am naturally very good at designing and starting big projects, but never finishing them. That...doesn't work well for a dissertation. \n\nThe imposter syndrome was primarily addressed by spending that extra time to backfill my knowledge gaps, to educate myself on the prevalent theories of the field, and write a whole lot more on the subject than made it into the final draft.",

      "text": "I'm glad to hear that you're having a positive grad school experience as you approach the end. I'm defending on the 6th of December, myself. Everything that could have possibly gone wrong in the last 4 months has absolutely gone wrong, but here I am... about to graduate. Probably. I turn in my Dissertation to my committee on Monday, and while I turned it in to my advisor last Friday, he won't look at it. I'm so not ready, and I have no one to turn to for edits... but I have a job lined up (per the committee's recommendation that I go find one) and I doubt my committee will stop me from leaving now that I've accepted it. Just gotta ride it out.\n\nWould I trade my graduate experience? Yes. Unequivocally yes. But if I had the same life trajectory, I'd still go to graduate school, but I'd pick a different lab and advisor. I have no papers or other publications to show for my five and a half years here. But I'm almost done.\n\nGood luck with your defense, mate!",
