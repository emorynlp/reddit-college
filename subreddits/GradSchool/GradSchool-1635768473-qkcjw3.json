  "text": "Recently got accepted to an MS Sys. Engg. program but now I'm seeing things online where some are saying it's worth it and some are saying it's not. The college is a respectably ranked US one (top 40-60 in US depending on what ranking website you check).\n\nIs the degree worth it? In terms of worth of investment + job opportunities later + weightage of the degree/course.",

      "text": "Is it funded (e.g. tuition wavier, health insurance, and a stipend)? This is somewhat rare for a masters, but if so, then it's totally worth it. If, on the other hand, you'd have to pay for it and likely go into debt, then that's a tough question. I think it would depend what you are walking away from and what you think the degree would do for you.",
