  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a senior in environmental engineering wanting to go for my master\u2019s in the atmospheric sciences. I currently have a 3.38 gpa overall, and I\u2019m expecting it to go up to 3.45 after all my classes are finished. What are my chances of being acccepted? I\u2019ve got an internship going too as well. On a side note, I\u2019ve got very strong writing skills and a strong statement of purpose developed.",
