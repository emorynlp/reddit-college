I was wondering if anyone here\u2019s gotten an iPad for grad school and do you like it. What apps would you recommend? Particularly for those with neurodivergencies/learning disabilities/adhd. I\u2019m thinking of getting one but I want to make sure it\u2019s worth the price (I have some money saved up though) so I want to know your thoughts.

It is amazing. If you have other apple products (ex/ MacBook, iPhone, etc), you can easily use air drop to send and receive problem sets, practice exams, and textbooks. I have the iPad Air 3 with a gen 1 Apple Pencil (you can probably just buy a stylus pen not Apple brand for cheaper and would be just as good).\n\nI use notability for the app to take notes and download problem sets and textbooks, it\u2019s great. I highlight and write notes all throughout my textbook and I haven\u2019t used a piece of paper in some time. \n\nIt is ESPECIALLY useful if you can download power point presentations before a lecture. This way, you have the notes on the slides (don\u2019t have to re write them) while being able to follow along with what the professor is saying. In other words, you can keep up way better. \n\nHighly recommend.

Mostly I use a program called GoodNotes - it's GREAT for writing notes and drawing diagrams. The best feature is the ability to load your journal articles or whole textbooks into it as PDF files, and then you can highlight and annotate right on the page. It's an excellent way to give presentations, because you can point out text or circle things in real time. It's also got a flashcard feature built in, which is SUPER handy when trying to memorize facts. I currently have to the ipad pro 2021 and the battery lasts all day on both the device and the pen. I do software analysis in my post-grad school life and this morning i'm using it to diagram out some complex automation software and take meeting notes. \n\nTotally underrated feature - it has a magnetic back, so when I get home I slap it on the fridge and watch netflix while I make dinner. \n\nI loved it so much and use i all day, so I bought my husband one - he's turned his on twice. He doesn't use it all. He's not big on note-taking, and says it's not good for much else. If you're going to sit down and type out a research paper, answer all of your email, or do some heavy programming - you're still going to use a computer for that.

I could obtain and take the majority of my assigned readings with me anywhere, it had lots of other apps for research, footnote organization, scheduling and as an added bonus I was able to add a bluetooth keyboard and wrote appx. 60% of my thesis on it while I was at work, all at a fraction of the cost of an iPad. ($300-500 vs. $150 new) Not to mention that when I was doing archival research or attending conferences, and had some down time in the evenings, I could watch Netflix/Hulu/Sling etc. Granted for some of this I did have to \"jailbreak\" it to enable downloading of the Play store, but a simple Google search led me in the right direction pretty quickly, and the process isn't very difficult at all.\n\nNow that I've finished my degree, I have a great tablet that can do pretty much everything and I rarely leave home without because of its overall versatility.
