I was awarded with my PhD this summer, after passing it with minor corrections. Problem is, that now that I should start getting published and submitting journal articles, I can't write anymore, either in English or in my mother tongue.   \nI feel like I am in a full \"burn out mode\". Currently, I am not lecturing nor doing anything academic,  since I am no longer employed by my home university. I can't even work on a post-doc project, despite some nice opportunities coming out. Sometimes I just would like to be a craftsperson. Currently, I feel like I don't even know if it is the case to pursue a career in the academy anymore o just seeking a job in a sector close to my field of studies or just quit everything.", "author": "bebbanburgismine", "created": 1631095048, "retrieved": 1632952768, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hc1pvf2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pk7gbg/completed_my_phd_and_i_cant_write_anymore/hc1pvf2/", "text": "That's fine, take the time you need. Many people I know take a good amount of time off after competing their PhD. A few months, a year won't matter much in the scheme of things but will allow you to do things before your next job sucks up your time (do things like travel, rest, whatever gives you life that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise). Once you've recovered from burnout, you'll be able to make a better decision regarding the future. \n\nYou've earned the breather. No need to feel guilty or pressured, as you've probably done that for the past +4 years.", "author": "Dismal-Wallaby-2", "created": 1631101426, "upvotes": 5}}}
