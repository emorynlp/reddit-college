I also plan on applying to local/private jobs when the time is right. \n\nI shared my list of jobs I've applied for with my dad and he was shocked at how low the salaries were for the positions I'm interested in. Now granted, I am applying for federal jobs (no money) I'm an archaeologist (no money) and I'm entering archaeo with a Masters, not a PhD (no money). But I really don't mind lower salaries if I'm happy where I live, I can pay my loans off, feed myself, etc.... It did make me think that maybe I'm shooting too low? I have GIS experience, a lot of fieldwork under my belt, and technically my masters is in parks & rec so I could get jobs in parks that in the long term will pay a lot more... I'm just not sure if I know what I'm worth? How do you guys quantify your worth when it comes to job hunting, especially right out of grad school?", "author": "bonefarmer", "created": 1632496998, "retrieved": 1632844002, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he5mhgw": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pum25y/how_do_you_know_how_much_youre_worth_when_job/he5mhgw/", "text": "The internet will tell you that you should start at a GS-9 with a Masters.
