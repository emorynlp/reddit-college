  "title:": "How do you know how much you're worth when job hunting?",
  "text": "I'm graduating in the spring but if any of you know what federal government applications are like, they take about 8 months to go through the process so I am job hunting now. I also plan on applying to local/private jobs when the time is right. \n\nI shared my list of jobs I've applied for with my dad and he was shocked at how low the salaries were for the positions I'm interested in. Now granted, I am applying for federal jobs (no money) I'm an archaeologist (no money) and I'm entering archaeo with a Masters, not a PhD (no money). But I really don't mind lower salaries if I'm happy where I live, I can pay my loans off, feed myself, etc.... It did make me think that maybe I'm shooting too low? I have GIS experience, a lot of fieldwork under my belt, and technically my masters is in parks & rec so I could get jobs in parks that in the long term will pay a lot more... I'm just not sure if I know what I'm worth? How do you guys quantify your worth when it comes to job hunting, especially right out of grad school?",

      "text": "The internet will tell you that you should start at a GS-9 with a Masters. The reality I have experienced (though other people\u2019s reality is likely different) is that new hires into the federal government, or even into a new agency, start lower than what they \u201cshould\u201d because competition is just so darn tough. I\u2019ve been playing the federal job game myself for the past couple of years fresh out of school with a Masters in a STEM field. Feel free to message me if you want to talk!",
