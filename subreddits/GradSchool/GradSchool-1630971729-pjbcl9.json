Not that I didn't try - I just didn't need to. I understood the subject matter. I grasped the concepts. I loved what I was learning.\n\nTwo weeks into my MA and boy am I lost. I don't know half of the words in my readings, let alone what is really being written or said by the authors. The amount of jargon and fluff to inflate word count is ridiculous.\n\nThe longest journal article I had to read before a class was roughly 40 pages in undergrad, with 2 days to read it before the next class. Generally, readings were on average 10-20 pages at most and they were mostly easy to digest. Now, I'm expected to read 100+ pages *per class*, while doing outside reading for research on my thesis. Its like I read, I see the words, I acknowledge the words, but then my brain simply can't process the string of words together.\n\nI just want to know if this is a normal feeling at the beginning of grad school. Being overwhelmed and wondering how I even got here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for formatting.", "author": "CosmicCrispApple", "created": 1630971729, "retrieved": 1632844752, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hc1kgf9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjbcl9/do_you_feel_like_undergrad_prepared_you_well/hc1kgf9/", "text": "No not really, but if we were perfect at it, why go to school? Everybody feels overwhelmed at points and it makes sense for the beginning to be that way for most because it's an adjustment. \n\nIdk if I missed what your field is, but I wouldn't assume jargon is to inflate the word count. I'm in evolutionary biology and getting papers under the max word count is difficult, you have to be very concise a lot of the time and edit your writing down a lot. Jargon can really cut down on how many words you have in a paper and experts in the field can read it no problem. It'll get easier as you encounter words more.\n\nReading 100 pages per class sounds stupid though. Again, probably varies by school and field, but when I was still taking classes, I usually had 1 to 2 research papers to read per class that would be anywhere from 5 to 20 pages. I would probably look for ways to not read 100 full pages but maybe that's just me...", "author": "KiwiTheKitty", "created": 1631097562, "upvotes": 1}, "hbx4avw": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjbcl9/do_you_feel_like_undergrad_prepared_you_well/hbx4avw/", "text": "I'm a UK STEM student. I've just finished my masters and start my PhD next week. \n\nI felt really strongly that my bsc had prepared me terribly for research/postgraduate study. A significant amount of this I attributed to the programme itself. I studied Environmental Science at a university famous for its Agricultural Science and Earth Science programmes. The env programme suffered really badly for this, because there were very very few \"environmental science\" modules, instead we got a vague mix of Agric and Earth Sci stuff, where the staff running the modules assumed only their respective degree students were in the class. \n\nThis was most challenging in earthsci classes, as the earthsci degree had a chemistry entry req whereas the envsci one didn't, which meant there were a lot of us who hadn't studied chemistry at all who were expected to work at second and third year bsc standard for chemistry.\n\nWhat you talk about with required readings and not being taught how to study papers became super apparent to me in third year/the start of my masters degree, so much so that I had to ask my masters supervisor to give me a crash course on how to read scientifically. \n\nFrom speaking to other students in other universities and programmes, this step up in difficulty between undergraduate and postgraduate is common, and noone will look down on you for struggling or asking for help. I personally found the first few months of my masters to be somewhat of a \"trial by fire\", and I honestly think I learned and developed so many more skills and knowledge in those few months than I did in my entire undergraduate degree.", "author": "Altorode", "created": 1631014524, "upvotes": 3}, "hbw9v1n": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjbcl9/do_you_feel_like_undergrad_prepared_you_well/hbw9v1n/", "text": "Personally I feel like my undergrad education (STEM) did pretty decently. Not so much on the \u201cdrinking from a firehose\u201d aspect, but I had quite a few classes that were essentially journal clubs and one class in particular that was basically designed to take us from blindly following a lab manual to being able to direct our own work.

You will adapt soon, and trust me - almost everyone feels just as lost and behind and unprepared. Consider that everyone in grad school is USED to being the very top of their class in performance, and now all of a sudden you are in an environment where you are just average at best.
