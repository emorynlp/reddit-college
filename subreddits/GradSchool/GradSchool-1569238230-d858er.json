Its origins can be traced back to the work of the Dutch psychologist, Gerrit Smit, and his thesis that the human brain is an ill-equipped toolbox to design interactive systems. Smit's work in particular was a major impetus for the invention of the computer game, and the field of gam e design is now known as the game design field. Game design is a discipline that draws from the fields of computer science, psychology, and the humanities. It is a science that seeks to understand the human brain, and it is a science that is interested in the design of interactive systems.

To determine how mitochondria contribute to cellular energy production, we used a model system to examine the effects of ATP on cell metabolism. In this model, a cell is made up of a large number of individual mitochondria, which are composed of a single protein. ATP binds to the proteins and activates the transcription of a set of genes. The expression of these genes is regulated by the presence or absence of ATP in the cell. The model also includes a single protein, the mitochondrial ATPase, which is the main source of energy for the cell. In this study, we used the model system to study the effects of ATP on the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.

A number of studies suggest that the effects of the environment on life-history transitions are complex and include both physiological and behavioral factors, and that the physiological and behavioral factors are not independent. For example, different life-history strategies can be used by the same species to respond to different environmental conditions in the same environment. The most widely used life-history strategies are those that are likely to be most effective in different environments. For example, the largest size classes are likely to be most effective in freshwater, but smaller sizes are likely to be effective in salt water. Although there is little consensus on the relative importance of physiological and behavioral responses to different environmental conditions, many studies have shown that responses to different environmental conditions are related. For example, the proportion of time spent in a particular state is related to the proportion of time spent in a different state. Similarly, the proportion of time spent at a particular temperature is related to the proportion of time spent at a temperature lower than the temperature at which time was first presented. These studies have provided a basis for the development of a new concept, the behavioral response hypothesis, which states that the time course of a physiological process is determined by the time course of a behavioral response. In this article, we review the recent literature related to the behavioral response hypothesis. We also discuss the implications of the behavioral response hypothesis for the study of mental processes.", "author": "Weaselpanties", "created": 1569269100, "upvotes": 1}, "f194t3m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/d858er/i_made_a_bot_that_writes_a_research_abstract_with/f194t3m/", "text": "This is one of the coolest things on the internet right now--fantastic work!!", "author": "BirdosaurusRex", "created": 1569267833, "upvotes": 1}, "f1904ls": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/d858er/i_made_a_bot_that_writes_a_research_abstract_with/f1904ls/", "text": "This is great", "author": "travelwaves", "created": 1569265961, "upvotes": 1}, "f18zy2c": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/d858er/i_made_a_bot_that_writes_a_research_abstract_with/f18zy2c/", "text": ">   I had my first dream, which was to see a film.

The first major research project on gender and the humanities was the gender studies program at the University of Minnesota. The focus of this research effort was on the role of the humanities in the life of the past and the future. The main goal of this research was to develop a theoretical framework for gender studies that would go beyond the traditional focus on gender as a function of sex. The goal was to develop a feminist approach to the study of gender as a function of the cultural, social, and historical context in which it occurs. The research program was divided into three main projects. The first was the development of a theoretical framework for gender studies. The second was the development of a conceptual framework for gender studies. The third was the development of a research design. The first two projects were funded by the National Science Foundation, while the third was funded by the Department of Cultural Studies at the University of Kansas. The conceptual framework for gender studies was developed through the process of analysis of the existing literature and the contributions of the scholars who have contributed to the field. \n\nTfw a computer generates an abstract that sounds like a lit review you have actually written", "author": "ohsideSHOWbob", "created": 1569259299, "upvotes": 3}, "f18cxv4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/d858er/i_made_a_bot_that_writes_a_research_abstract_with/f18cxv4/", "text": "I kept the \"with recent funding from\" and switched it to song lyrics, and all of the suggestions made it sound like a CIA-sponsored coup.\n\n With recent funding from the CIA In the name of the motherland We are fighting for our rights We are fighting for  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n With recent funding from the government I'm gonna make it big, I'm gonna make it big I'm gonna make it big  \n\netc.", "author": "Guluronate", "created": 1569255916, "upvotes": 7}, "f1896zv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/d858er/i_made_a_bot_that_writes_a_research_abstract_with/f1896zv/", "text": "> Significant advancements in hyperlocal synergistic edutainment using Big Data have been made in the last decade.
