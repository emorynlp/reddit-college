I\u2019m a GTA this term for the first time, so I did my interview recently but I don\u2019t have much experience.\n\nI think the most important thing is to get across that you know the subject well and that you\u2019re passionate about it! A person who loves their subject makes an engaging teacher.\n\nTalk about why you want to be a GTA (beyond the extra income haha). I spoke about how much I love the subject and how being able to help other students learn about it was something I really wanted to do. How seeing them learn about it invigorated my own drive to research. I also spoke about wanting to be more involved in the department as a whole and how, as a GTA, I\u2019d feel like more of a team member than I do in my current research role which is something I want. Think about your reasons and how you can frame them to impress your interviewers.\n\nDid you take the class that you would be GTAing? If so, try to remember everything you can about the content and structure - if you didn\u2019t, try to find out what you can about it. Make reference to it to show that you know what you\u2019re getting into and are prepared for it.\n\nTry to think of classes you\u2019ve taken in the past that had GTAs and what they did that helped you as a student/what they didn\u2019t do that you wish they had. Use that as a basis if they ask you about what you think a GTA should be/do or what you think is important in the role.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to the interview so they know you\u2019re qualified in the subject, they probably won\u2019t be trying to quiz you or catch you out (unless they\u2019re particularly mean/bad at interviews). It\u2019s good to display that you know your area of study but it\u2019s more important to show that you know the content and structure of the class. \n\nEveryone applying will be very good at the subject, so you have to differentiate yourself by also being good at the admin and structural work of the GTA role. This is different for every class but for instance my GTA role (I\u2019m a phd student teaching first and second year undergrads) involves leading seminars, marking essays and marking exams, so I talked about my experiences with small group teaching and my understanding of the subject\u2019s marking scheme. Your subject will probably be quite different especially if it\u2019s a more advanced class, but there will be structural and administrative responsibilities that you need to demonstrate your knowledge of.\n\n\u201cIf a student asks you something and you don\u2019t know the answer, don\u2019t bluff, tell them you don\u2019t know but will get back to them and the ACTUALLY get back to them\u201d has been the most repeated concept in the GTA training I\u2019ve done, so if there\u2019s anyway to fit that in it might be bonus points!\n\nAlso! Because you\u2019re on zoom you have an opportunity to show you\u2019re familiar and comfortable with the software. Since a lot of teaching is still being done online this is a good chance to show that you\u2019re capable of using zoom to do that if necessary. Makes sure you\u2019re comfortable with it and won\u2019t have technical mishaps. (I know everyone has used zoom to death at this point, but worth making sure you show them you\u2019ve developed zoom skills!) \n\nSorry that this response ended up super long, I hope there\u2019s something in there that\u2019s helpful. And most importantly, good luck! I hope it goes well for you :)", "author": "northernpansy", "created": 1631891482, "upvotes": 4}}}
