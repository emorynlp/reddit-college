  "text": "I\u2019m starting a Master\u2019s program in Math Education and I\u2019m VERY nervous! I teach full time and am very worried that I won\u2019t have enough time or energy to devote to the degree. Consequently, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fail because of these things. \n\nI also am wondering: what\u2019s it like???? Is there anyone who has pursued (or knows someone who has pursued) the same degree? Will it take up ALL my spare time?? :/\n\nA little bit about me (to help you advise me) I teach middle school full time, I don\u2019t have a prep period this year, I don\u2019t have kids of my own, and I\u2019ve been out of college for 5 years.",
