  "text": "Hi everyone, \nBeginning of this Fall semester I talked with one of my professors to being my advisor. He said yes and gave me a research question. Frankly speaking I agreed with him immediately because I was scared not getting advisor plus he offered me good funding. Within few weeks I figured out there been already research on that topic and I informed him. For context- it\u2019s covid related topic. When I informed him he said not to worry and it is okay because it is emerging topic now.\n\nI am also taking research methodology class where we discuss about our topic and 2 professors (that class conducted by 2 professors) constantly attacking me that there is no reason me doing that research because others are already did that research. And I agreed with them. My question is what should I do now? Talking with my current advisor to change topic or looking for new advisor? \n\nPlease someone give me some suggestions how to deal with it. My current professor doesn\u2019t care about my research. We met only 2 times in last 3 months. He doesn\u2019t give me any deadline. So my research is not progressing at all. Still reading literature reviews and saw all the answers on my topic. Thank you for reading.\n\nEdit 1: Surprisingly I am so called research assistant but do not assigned any work in last 3 months. It\u2019s like 800 dollars every two weeks. Feeling guilty and at the same time do not argue with him about that. I asked him give me some work but he never did. But I know for long run I am hurting my resume. Any suggestions for that?",

      "text": "I mean it is an emerging area; even if other work has been done, it can be very useful to say, \"I explored similar issues on this emerging topic and confirmed the findings of similar previous studies... [OR] found results that contradict prior findings, suggesting more research is necessary...\"\n\nAlso, like another commenter suggested, see what those published studies talked about in their limitations and/or future directions, and identify whether you can incorporate some of that. If you haven't even started your study yet you have lots of room to adjust. Maybe they suggest specifically exploring, idk, race or gender differences, or age range-specific differences, or location etc. -- factors that might be easy to slide into your project to say \"We're doing XYZ just like these other studies, but we're ALSO doing ABC which they weren't able to do.\"",

      "text": "Hey depending on how your funding is set up you may have more power over your thesis topic than you expect! I would keep talking to your supervisor about the issues you see with your topic, pose some alternative ideas, and develop a proposal for what you want to do instead. If you're being paid specifically to do that project you may not be able to change topics but perhaps you can explain to the other profs that there is interest in revisiting this question and try to include something novel in your approach.",
