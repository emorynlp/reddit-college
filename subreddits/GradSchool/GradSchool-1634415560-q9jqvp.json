  "text": "I made a mistake in choosing the program I am in, and thankfully realized it in the first semester of my first year. My department was not clear on many things so I misunderstood what I would be getting out of it. I am considering applying to other programs this cycle but I don't know if it looks bad that I am in a program already. How do I explain that I made a bad choice without looking like I don't know what I am doing? I also will continue to stay enrolled in my current program until I know I have something else because the current one will at least set me up for work I wouldn't mind doing. Is that going to look like I am not serious about where I am applying? Anyone ever done this and had success? \n\nFor reference I am studying education, specifically higher ed and want a program with more research opportunities and the hope of being competitive for a PhD if I choose that path.",

A lot of people change directions in grad school.\n\n>I also will continue to stay enrolled in my current program until I know I have something else because the current one will at least set me up for work I wouldn't mind doing.\n\nYou won't find out until the spring where you have been accepted. And so you'll be halfway done with the Masters by the time you finish that semester. Are you sure it's not better just to go ahead and complete this Masters? And apply for other programs during your second year?",

      "text": "Thank you for this. I am the only person in my life who has done this and really had no one else to ask. To me it feels like I am dumb for making a single bad choice, but I can see what you mean that it will matter less to the schools. \n\nI do agree with you, I might apply and end up staying if I can get one or both of the fellowships I am applying to. I just don't want to pay for another master's after this one, and I have concerns that this one will set me up for only work instead of having the PhD option at schools in my area. \n\nI appreciate your advice, and it's definitely something to think about!",
