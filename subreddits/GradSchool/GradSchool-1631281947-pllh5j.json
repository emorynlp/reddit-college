They were able to see me sooner than expected- again  Yay! \n\nI explain the situation to my professor who said Dr.s appointment are not good reasons to miss class. I explained it was not my annual physical- I was meeting with a surgeon. Still, not a good enough reason I suppose. She told me to refer to the program handbook on the attendance policy, which I did. The handbook tells me to check my course syllabi about acceptable absences. I check the syllabi, and what do is see \"absences will be evaluated on a case by case basis\" \\*face palm\\*. \n\nIn the REAL world- no employer would give you a hard time for meeting with a medical specialist for surgery- and if they did I would quit.", "author": "ForecastForFourCats", "created": 1631281947, "retrieved": 1632952706, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hcdq2v4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pllh5j/how_to_deal_with_difficult_professors_ventadvice/hcdq2v4/", "text": "I think you have already gotten good responses so I'm just gonna say this - screw that guy.", "author": "Pr0gr3s", "created": 1631321047, "upvotes": 1}, "hcd6pyn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pllh5j/how_to_deal_with_difficult_professors_ventadvice/hcd6pyn/", "text": "Sounds like some BS.

You might not have a disability (or maybe you do), but if you have a health issue that warrants surgical intervention it may fall under their purview.

A major surgery is an exceptional reason to miss class, and she needs to educate herself oh her own programs policies, procedures, and learn how to be an empathetic person. I would also speak with your adviser about this too so he or she can be aware of the situation, because refusing someone an excused absence for a necessary medical appointment seems contrary to common sense, if not department policy, and unnecessarily spiteful. \n\nEven if she was a doctor, she is not *your* doctor so she is unqualified to have any sort of opinion on whether your healthcare appointments are necessary or convenient.", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1631303711, "upvotes": 7}, "hccarr1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pllh5j/how_to_deal_with_difficult_professors_ventadvice/hccarr1/", "text": "Since this is for an established health issue you need to your campus disability resource center and make it an official accommodation.
