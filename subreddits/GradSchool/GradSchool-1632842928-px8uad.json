Now though, I\u2019m thinking of using a better app for PDF notes, which I can link to my Macbook and keep track of references (I\u2019m using GoodNotes now).\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people use Zotero, so I\u2019m thinking of learning it so I don\u2019t need to always have a manually written list of references \ud83d\ude05 I wrote my BSc thesis using only Word and without any citation manager, and I\u2019m always nervous about forgetting to list one down.\n\nAny recommendations for an app which I can access on both iPad and Macbook? Plus points if it\u2019s either free or a one-time payment life subscription!", "author": "acabila", "created": 1632842928, "retrieved": 1632843794, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"helti0p": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/px8uad/partner_app_to_zotero/helti0p/", "text": "Use Paperpile instead", "author": "Shark_Bones", "created": 1632843036, "upvotes": 1}}}
