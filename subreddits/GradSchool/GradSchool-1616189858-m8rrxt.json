  "title:": "Does anyone else ever feel incredibly unqualified to interpret data?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently trying to write the discussion section for my MA thesis. I\u2019ve spent the last two years trying to learn everything I possibly can about this type of research, reading hundreds of pages of past research, yet I still feel like I have no business interpreting these data. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just imposter syndrome talking but I feel like my discussion section thus far is incredibly vague and possibly even wholly incorrect. I\u2019m just hoping my advisor doesn\u2019t hate it. Anyone feel like this?\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on writing a discussion section that doesn\u2019t sound like it was written by someone who has no clue what they\u2019re taking about?\n\nEdit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented to offer advice and share their own experiences. I\u2019m feeling much better and more motivated to continue thanks to you all!!",

Wonderful. Let's move on. \n\nSo you do your best, do your due diligence, honestly and thoroughly report your methods and then go \"Ok, based on all this inadequate bullshit I just threw together, here's a best guess at what it means.\" \n\nWhen in doubt, just make simple statements about things that you believe are true in your data. As long as you're honest, it's ok if you're wrong. Science is a conversation, not a series of facts. The fact that you care so much means you are probably doing a great job. \n\nGood luck. Make sure you're getting enough sleep :)",

You have some room to interpret what it all means in the discussion but don't get too far ahead of your data here -- you are just placing context around the interpretation of the statistical tests on your data. Stick to what you saw and what you measured, and then place your new findings in the context of existing literature, and maybe propose some future next steps.",
