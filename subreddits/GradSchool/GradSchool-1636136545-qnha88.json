  "text": "I\u2019m currently enrolled in my first ever graduate seminar (studying part time). I didn\u2019t major in the field of study but I have some background knowledge from having taken a few elective courses during undergrad.\n\nI\u2019m also waiting to get assessed for ADHD (for a number of reasons I won\u2019t get into) but that won\u2019t happen before the end of the semester. Here\u2019s my problem:\n\nA big chunk of our final grade is based on class participation, and my attempts at contributing anything meaningful have been horrible. I do all the readings and jot down ideas that I\u2019d like to share in class, but when the class discussion gets going, I struggle to keep up. Then I end up stuttering and rambling in response to my classmates\u2019 brilliant ideas and sound like I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. (I did have this problem while doing my undergrad, but it has gotten much worse.) The professor helps me reformulate my thoughts when he notices I\u2019m struggling to convey them. It was particularly embarrassing last class when I noticed two classmates rolled their eyes with their webcams still on.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this? Do you have any advice? I\u2019m feeling discouraged and disappointed in myself, and can\u2019t stop replaying in my mind the unimpressed looks on my classmates\u2019 faces.",
