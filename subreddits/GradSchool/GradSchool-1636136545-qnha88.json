  "text": "I\u2019m currently enrolled in my first ever graduate seminar (studying part time). I didn\u2019t major in the field of study but I have some background knowledge from having taken a few elective courses during undergrad.\n\nI\u2019m also waiting to get assessed for ADHD (for a number of reasons I won\u2019t get into) but that won\u2019t happen before the end of the semester. Here\u2019s my problem:\n\nA big chunk of our final grade is based on class participation, and my attempts at contributing anything meaningful have been horrible. I do all the readings and jot down ideas that I\u2019d like to share in class, but when the class discussion gets going, I struggle to keep up. Then I end up stuttering and rambling in response to my classmates\u2019 brilliant ideas and sound like I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. (I did have this problem while doing my undergrad, but it has gotten much worse.) The professor helps me reformulate my thoughts when he notices I\u2019m struggling to convey them. It was particularly embarrassing last class when I noticed two classmates rolled their eyes with their webcams still on.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this? Do you have any advice? I\u2019m feeling discouraged and disappointed in myself, and can\u2019t stop replaying in my mind the unimpressed looks on my classmates\u2019 faces.",

      "text": "It sounds like your prof is trying to help. Let them know what's going on broadly without details (e.g. I am waiting on a diagnosis that would allow me to apply for reasonable accommodations, but am struggling to participate during class). You already jot down ideas to contribute. I would ask your prof if you could supplement in-class participation with those notes so that you are able to convey ideas clearly while continuing to practice contributing to discussion. \n\nI'm a prof. I would say yes to this request.",

      "text": "It sounds like you're trying your best in your classes and the professor has been helpful so far! I wonder if your school has an accessibility centre? At my school we have one and students can get accommodations for the classes. Most of these are getting technology to help with classes or a testing room for exams, but I wonder if there could be any accommodations for your class? Like your grade could have less emphasis on participation? If you feel comfortable, you could also tell your professor about your struggles and see if there is anything he would recommend? I find that when professors know more about the situation, they will often help and support students. It sounds like your professor may be able to help somehow based on your description of him!",
