  "title:": "Collection of remote thesis defense streams",
  "text": "I am one of the many PhD students whose defense is now remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I think a lot of us are disappointed that we will not be able to defend and celebrate in person with our family, friends, classmates, advisors, and department faculty members. However, since many remote defenses will now be streamed, I thought it would be nice for students to have the opportunity to share their thesis defense streams. This also gives the academic community a chance to support PhD students giving remote defenses, to learn about new areas of research, and also to distract themselves from the COVID-19 news. \n\nIf you would like to submit a streaming link to your defense, please fill out [this google form](https://forms.gle/MPup883hhTtv4iUS6). To view links to defenses, you can check out [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1unGUjhscWqgY1UYA7ZpXAS6jn9AMavllN6jo0tImN-w/edit?usp=sharing). I hope this is a welcome resource to the academic community!\n\nEdit: My friend has created a [google calendar that will add the events to it](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c6vc52sdvqdl6b5a2lsh3vtbgk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). If you open up the calendar and click the \"+ Google Calendar\" button on the bottom right, it should add them to your calendar!",
