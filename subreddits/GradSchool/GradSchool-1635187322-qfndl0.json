  "title:": "Should I, as a freshman undergrad, drop a b grade class?",
  "text": "I took a senior level class and underestimated it\u2019s difficulty; as a result, I\u2019m probably looking to get a b in the class right now. I also took another hard class as a freshman and will probably get a b in that too. My question is: Would that negatively impact grad school admissions if I wish to apply in the future, or should I drop one b class?",
