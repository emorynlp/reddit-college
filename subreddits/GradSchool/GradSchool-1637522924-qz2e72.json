  "text": "I\u2019m in my first semester of my masters program in mental health counseling and wanted to know how difficult it is to be able to switch schools. I\u2019m ok if my credits do not transfer because I would rather go to the other school since it is a public university so would be substantially less expensive. I just wonder if programs discourage this and would not want to look bad with my current professors in my current program in case I go through the trouble of inquiring and end up staying there. Does that make sense? Lol",
