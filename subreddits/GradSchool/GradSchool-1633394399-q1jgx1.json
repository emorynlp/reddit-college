  "text": "Hey folks!\n\nI spotted an application for an oral presentation of my research at a national conference. This presentation doesn't require me to submit a paper for publication. Frankly, I don't plan to submit a paper for publication at this particular conference, considering both the timeline and where I *do* intend to publish, but I do believe that my research would be relevant among the presentations there. \n\nThat being said, I want to be certain that this isn't breaking any sort of rules or conference standards that I might have missed - I'm a first-year grad student! I hope to give similar talks at other conferences before I publish, and I will (hopefully) be publishing eventually. Does anyone have any thoughts or experience on this matter?\n\nFor reference, I am in Industrial & Systems Engineering, but my research also has strong ties to mechanical engineering. The conference itself is focused around industrial & systems engineering.",

      "text": "Check with your advisor to see what they think and to make sure you're on the same page, but this is pretty normal. You can use the same basis for research and publish/present different milestones and results along the way. I have multiple papers that are part of the same larger project, but they cover results for various milestones in the project. I'm an electrical engineering PhD. \n\nAnyways, what you plan to present in October 2021 will be much more mature and different by the time you get around to publishing it in say October 2022 because well, you've been working on it!",

My understanding is that it\u2019s a great way to get feedback on your idea.. but I haven\u2019t heard of any norms to then publish in one of their journals",

I would advise against rewriting abstract and submitting the same presentation to major conference. You need to check the rules of submission for the conferences you are considering. Not submitting paper for publication is not a requirement for most (maybe all) the conferences in my field.\n\nEdit: I was also told having the same presentation listed for too many conferences on your CV looks bad. Like you weren't very productive and wanted to pad your resume. This may be field dependent. But discouraged for us.",

              "text": "Most conference explicitly prohibit using the same abstract. Using the same presentation is something that can be frowned upon, but not a usually a rule. One conference I attend is really strict about the presentations not being \"substantially equivalent\", although the allow you to reuse figures in publications and other presentations. But they might reject your abstract if it looked like you were presenting exact material at too many conferences. I don't think they generally care about small symposia at your university or things of that nature. It's frowned on because, like journals, they want unique presentations. You might not pay to go to multiple conferences if too many people were doing this. But this is why I said check the conference guidelines. There is a spectrum of what they allow. In my lab, my PI will let us re-present a portions of previously presented data as long as we add something new to the story. The PI will never let us present the EXACT same presentation, more so for posters. \n\nInvited talks would be different and PI's will many times draw on their entire body of work, customizing the talk for different audiences. But again, check your conference gudielines.",

If I can repackage the figure for a new presentation, would that not be the same as presenting the research itself over again? It would still be the same work, just presented in a different format. \n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, you're warning against giving an identical talk or submitting identical abstracts at multiple conferences, which I understand. I'm perfectly comfortable changing the presentation depending on the conference, I'm just trying to understand the division between presenting the same talk vs. presenting the same research. \n\nAlso, out of curiosity - what is your field? I'm in engineering, and I'm honestly vastly unfamiliar with how conferences go for other fields.",
