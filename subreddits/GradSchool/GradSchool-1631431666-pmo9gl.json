  "text": "so im in a bioengineering PhD, was wondering if anyone thinks the ipad air was worth grabbing for notes, annotating papers, and all that. I already have a Macbook and a regular PC. Seems like an overkill, but i feel like for actual note taking and reading it'll help alot. Any advice?",

You have all of your notes in one place and (depending on the note app you\u2019re using) you can search for key words in uploaded text or in your own notes. It might feel like overkill, but if you\u2019ve got the money for it I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret it.\n\nAlso I recommend notability if you go through with it! \nBest of luck!",

So no more hauling a heavy notebook to class and no more messy notebooks that are falling apart by the end of the year. \n\nIt definitely seems worth it even if u just plan on taking notes or annotating papers. Plus it has so many other more features u could take advantage of. \n\nThe student sale at Apple ends on sept 27! So I\u2019d recommend u try to make ur decision before then.
