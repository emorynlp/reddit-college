  "title:": "Is depression common in your first year of grad school?",
  "text": "Basically the title. I\u2019m a first year PhD student. I\u2019m a little over 3 months in and honestly I love it so far. My students actually seem to like my as a TA, I aced both my midterms (take that, imposter syndrome!) and I think I have a great chance of getting into my top choice lab (fingers crossed) \n\nBut lately, I\u2019ve been having a hard time eating and getting out of bed. I feel like I\u2019ve been dragging myself through the week just waiting for the weekend, and then when it is the weekend I spend it dreading the next week. I can\u2019t pay attention and often just feel numb. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve reached out to mental health services on campus and am going to try to find a therapist in the area. But I honestly feel like I\u2019m losing it. Everything external is going well and I have more free time and am taking more care of myself than I did in undergrad. Yet I feel like crap. Is this normal during your first year? Or at least common\u2026",

      "text": "Dude abso-freakin-loutely! I\u2019m chemistry too and let me tell you my first year sucked. I felt disconnected, alone and I just couldn\u2019t handle the monotony anymore. Well after contemplating dropping out many times, I chose to stick it out and I gotta say grad school has become one of the best chapters of my life. Great friends, amazing advisor, dating life is solid, exciting research. Stick it out and do what you can now (work out, meditate, meet people) and things will fall into place",

I\u2019ve been talking to my first choice advisor since April and going to his group meetings remotely since then as well\u2026 but it turns out he\u2019s only taking 3 people and 4 minimum are putting him as their top choice. Stressful as hell. \n\nThank you though. I\u2019m glad to hear  it gets better.",

      "text": "I have found that grad school can be very isolating. You may have moved to a new place, far away from loved ones. You\u2019re in your program, seeing the same folks every day, spending lots of time in the department. You\u2019re dedicating lots of time to your work. The power dynamic that grad students deal with can be stressful, even if everything is great with your advisor. There are just a lot of factors that can take a toll on your mental health. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve reached out for some mental health support. Now is the time to work on this, not waiting for it to get worse. Definitely give yourself a big pat on the back for being proactive. \n\nAlso, I recommend aggressively scheduling time for things like hobbies and exercise. Schedule them like you schedule a class time. Make sure you\u2019re fully disconnecting for a bit. Your brain needs the downtime! \n\nYou\u2019re definitely not alone in your experience. You\u2019re doing a great job working through it.",

      "text": "My first semester (Fall 2020) really took a toll on me, especially during the last 5 or so weeks. I think a good part of it was because it was fully online, on top of the stress of the election, the exploding covid cases in CA, and preliminary exams I needed to take shortly after the first semester. \n\nAfter taking and passing the prelims, things got better, despite having more work to do than the previous semster.  People in my department told me that the first year here is the hardest, and I think they're right. Now that I'm in my second year in person and almost fully invested in research, I've felt happier, and I've been getting along with my cohort way better. The end of the semester slog still gets to me, but I think that's just the nature of academia.\n\nI'm chalking up my first year struggles to adjusting to grad school and the extraordinary circumstances I had.",

      "text": "Mine wasn't related to the first year (I'm year 3) but over the past year I noticed it getting worse.\n\nTraditional students are around the age for some mental challenges to present themselves or get worse (also pandemic). So I would suggest keeping track of when, what and how you feel. You might find triggers in doing certain activities, days of the week or month.\n\nIf you don't notice patterns or it is systemic/worsening I would suggest reaching out to your PCP. Talking can help but it might take some medication to have you feeling normal again. \n\nI never considered that how I used to feel was harder/worse than I needed to (because the onset over the last few years was so gradual). I'm not artificially happy all the time, but I'm more in control of myself and don't have those big dips that take so much out of you. Reading journal articles can still be a drag, but it no longer feels like absolute torture. \n\nIt sounds like you are reaching out for help, which is the first and often hardest step. Don't stop looking for help until you find what works for you. Best of luck in your health and academic journey!",

      "text": "I think it\u2019s super common! A lot of my people in my program (cohort members and more advanced students) have talked about having mental health struggles in the first year. It\u2019s just a huge, stressful adjustment, and that sense of competition you mentioned sounds really difficult too. Best wishes from an internet stranger - I hope everything goes well, that you\u2019re able to find good support, and that things start looking up for you soon! I\u2019ve struggled with some of the feelings you mentioned, and one thing that helped was not beating myself up for feeling them. I think I was making everything worse by internally criticizing myself for feeling bad (I hesitate to give other people\u2019s brains extra words to use against themselves, but my thought process was like \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you incredibly happy?!? this is your dream program, are you just terrible at knowing what you want??\u201d) Once it clicked for me that I don\u2019t have to feel bad for feeling bad, I was able to start pulling myself up a bit - it didn\u2019t fix everything and I\u2019m still looking for external mental health support, but I\u2019ve been able to pay more attention in class lately and feel less lousy about waking up in the morning.",
