  "text": "Hi, I'm currently filling out my application to the UMich Rackham Graduate School, and I've been stuck on the Program Selection portion of the application on ApplyWeb, where it has been loading indefinitely. I've tried different browsers and different operating systems to no avail. I was wondering if anyone else here is facing the same problem? Thank you!",
