  "text": "I think I made a fatal mistake during my first year of classes. For this week's homework, we had several problems, and the way I approached the first problem went something like\n\n1st day: Begin solution -> Stuck -> Read notes -> Continue solution -> Stuck, and it is night time, so I'll work on it tomorrow\n\n\n2nd day: Complete solution to 1 -> Begin Problem 2 -> Stuck -> Read notes -> Continue -> Stuck, and it's late so I work on tomorrow\n\n3rd Day: Read notes -> Stuck -> Read online resources -> Continue solution but don't calculate answer I expect so I trace my steps backwards -> It's late so I try again tomorrow\n\nYou see where this is going. Now I only have a few days with 3 HW assignments and I am running out of time to thoroughly understand things and complete the problems. I was wondering what's anyone's experience and advice here?",

      "text": "As soon as you get the assignment, read it and attempt all the problems. Then when you reconcile/study the notes, you can be looking for clues. Then come back to the problems. As soon as you get stuck for more than 10 minutes, switch problems. The back of your mind will keep working on it. If you're still jammed in a few days, ask for help, talk to your cohort.",
