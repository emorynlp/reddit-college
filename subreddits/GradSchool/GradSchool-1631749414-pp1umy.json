I had on my schedule and phone alarm that class on Zoom is on Tuesday starting 7 PM but really 5:15 PM. Only remembered when I saw the reminder post about it on Blackboard when I opened up the site to prepare for the 7 PM class. Worst part is that she emailed about the time change a few weeks ago and the Tuesdays that we meet live are mandatory! I even had two questions that I wanted to ask face-to-face (one about fieldwork). Of course, I emailed her an apology and my questions, and texted her for a greater chance it\u2019ll be seen. This is the first time that I missed the first day of a class, and I\u2019m so ashamed of it. Have you had this level of screw-up?\n\nEdit: the official site says 7-8:30, but prof says 5:15-6:45. So, yeah\u2014learned a lesson about updating schedule ASAP.", "author": "ilovepizza981", "created": 1631749414, "retrieved": 1632844455, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"hd4aw4i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pp1umy/stressed_about_accidentally_missing_first_day_of/hd4aw4i/", "text": "One time I missed a final in undergrad lol luckily professors were really understanding.
