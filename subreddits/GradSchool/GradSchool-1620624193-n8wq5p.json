My advisor pulled me aside and told me that I shouldn't worry about my GPA at this level and that his perception is that if you are able to maintain a 4.0 in grad school then you are not challenging yourself enough with your coursework. \n\nI took that advice to heart, and opted to take classes that were more challenging but overall more rewarding. I ended up finishing my M.Sc. with a couple B's, which dropped my GPA but made me a much better candidate for my Ph.D. program. \n\nKeep up the good work, but grad school is challenging enough without the added personal pressure to maintain the 4.0. \n\n> B's Get PhDs", "author": "fatchad420", "created": 1620656319, "upvotes": 15}, "gxlqj3n": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n8wq5p/ended_my_first_year_with_a_40/gxlqj3n/", "text": "This is glorious :') people think social sciences are \"easy\" but honestly it requires more thinking, critical skills, high order skills to write and express in a way that the world listens.\n\nVery proud and happy for you!
