  "text": "I honestly always thought I was kind of a dumb person until I found social sciences in college. I struggled academically in undergrad 10 years ago, finished with maybe a cumulative 3.1. Turns out I was malnourished, had undiagnosed illnesses, and needed time to study instead of working 30hrs a week on the side. \n\nMy graduate degree is in a different field than my undergrad was, so this has all been a giant learning curve. I am really proud of myself and so happy! I may suck ass at math, but I can write a bomb comparative analysis paper!!",

My advisor pulled me aside and told me that I shouldn't worry about my GPA at this level and that his perception is that if you are able to maintain a 4.0 in grad school then you are not challenging yourself enough with your coursework. \n\nI took that advice to heart, and opted to take classes that were more challenging but overall more rewarding. I ended up finishing my M.Sc. with a couple B's, which dropped my GPA but made me a much better candidate for my Ph.D. program. \n\nKeep up the good work, but grad school is challenging enough without the added personal pressure to maintain the 4.0. \n\n> B's Get PhDs",
