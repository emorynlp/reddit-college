I already have a masters in my home country, which was fully funded, as is my current MA, but the state of academia has made me so depressed about my prospects. I used to work at a university in my home country before I came to study abroad, and whilst I didn't like my department that much, I realised that I would be happiest working in a role in study abroad at a university, or maybe admissions or accommodation, or even just administration more generally. I love helping students but not necessarily through teaching, and I enjoy working with academics professionally.\n\nThe more I think about this, the more I regret enrolling in an MA overseas because it's starting to feel like a waste of time. I'm going to contact the study abroad office to see if I can work or volunteer there to get experience.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Am I now too overqualified for university administration jobs? Is it okay to regret my decision after just a few months?", "author": "16H07", "created": 1632025079, "retrieved": 1632844140, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"hdg3epk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pr14yh/realised_that_i_dont_need_my_graduate_degree_for/hdg3epk/", "text": "What are you studying?", "author": "randomhuman7482", "created": 1632046527, "upvotes": 1}, "hdfd7pd": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pr14yh/realised_that_i_dont_need_my_graduate_degree_for/hdfd7pd/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1632026895, "upvotes": 2}}}
