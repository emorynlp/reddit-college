Everyone else in my lab feels very professional and more like \u201ccolleagues\u201d than people who would want to be friends with me, especially since most of them are later in their degrees and very busy. My courses have very small class sizes, and from the few conversations I\u2019ve had with people in them, I don\u2019t seem to have a ton in common with most of them (i.e. many of them are older and/or married and I\u2019m very much not at that stage in my life). \n\nHow can I make friends that I actually have things in common with? Especially when in-person events are limited right now. I\u2019m also only on campus for one semester, which means I\u2019ll have to do this all over again in a new city next year (working at an off-campus research station). \n\nI\u2019m an introvert, but I\u2019m willing to initiate conversations and social get togethers, HOWEVER, I don\u2019t know how to bridge the gap between \u201cperson I\u2019ve seen and talks to a few times in my class\u201d and \u201cperson I hang out with socially outside of school\u201d without it being awkward.", "author": "TheMadeline", "created": 1631384825, "retrieved": 1632952686, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hchlfq4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pmco7w/alright_how_do_you_make_friends_in_grad_school/hchlfq4/", "text": "Homework and study groups over zoom man.", "author": "LegallyThrownFarAway", "created": 1631398417, "upvotes": 1}, "hcgy5jp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pmco7w/alright_how_do_you_make_friends_in_grad_school/hcgy5jp/", "text": "I'm in the same situation.

I think we just have to give it some time to click with people to be honest. It took me a couple months to make real friends in undergrad. It doesn't happen right away for some people.
