You should have:\n\n\n3 copies of all important files, spread across at least\n\n2 different media, with at least\n\n1 off-site backup.\n\n\nSo, following this scheme you should have one copy on your laptop, on copy on your work computer, and one copy on your cloud service of choice. This fulfills three copies. The two different media are hard drives and cloud, and the off site is obvious. Don't trust just hard drives, they fail. SSDs are less prone to failure, but they can still get bricked (I had two SSDs fail ON THE SAME DAY once). Flash drives are great as a quick backup. All my lab data is stored 1. On the machine that collected it. 2. On the flash drive I use to transfer it 3. On my work computer, which then auto backs up to one drive, which then auto downloads onto my home computer. With this I have 5 copies, three different media, and technically two off site backups (home and cloud). The rule goes for handwritten data as well. Photos are great, especially if you have Google or Apple or one drive auto upload. \n\n\nAlways follow the 3-2-1 rule for any mission critical data.", "author": "notsosilentlurker", "created": 1619670509, "upvotes": 3}, "gw9d8bq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n0lsw7/can_we_all_just_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_the/gw9d8bq/", "text": "Started being a real believer after the other night.
