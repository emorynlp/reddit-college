  "text": "A short rant while I take a break from finishing the last section of my final research paper for grad school.\n\n\nTo hell with writing papers. Ive spent the last week trying to finish up two papers so I can graduate this semester and it sucks man. I finished the first one (the larger of the two) Monday and now it feels like this is just dragging on for no reason. I feel like I get so much done and then I realize it's been 3 hours and I've barely made a dent and I still have so much left.\n\n\nWish me luck. Its due in an hour and my literature review is only half finished and fully half assed. Not my best work. I'm ready for a long overdue break from school.\n\n\nUpdate: Submitted the damn thing fully finished. Was told I forgot to put a presentation together... So I guess I'll go do that now.\n\n\nGood luck to everyone on their final deliverables. Please take care of yourselves and your loved ones.",

WORST THING IS is that this paper is for my supervisors class, so he knows how busy I am in the lab. So over this semester.....",

Not only do I contribute nothing original, but I feel that my creativity is being stifled. \n\nIt's not even an exercise in my ability as a writer; I'm just regurgitating information that I've spent hours researching. On top of that, the quality of my writing goes to shit because I'm too fragmented. I read on this sub the other day that the best grad school assignment is a finished one. I'm just sticking to that and hoping for the best.\n\nGood luck to everyone out there!",
