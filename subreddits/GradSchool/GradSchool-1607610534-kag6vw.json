Ive spent the last week trying to finish up two papers so I can graduate this semester and it sucks man. I finished the first one (the larger of the two) Monday and now it feels like this is just dragging on for no reason. I feel like I get so much done and then I realize it's been 3 hours and I've barely made a dent and I still have so much left.\n\n\nWish me luck. Its due in an hour and my literature review is only half finished and fully half assed. Not my best work. I'm ready for a long overdue break from school.\n\n\nUpdate: Submitted the damn thing fully finished. Was told I forgot to put a presentation together... So I guess I'll go do that now.\n\n\nGood luck to everyone on their final deliverables.
