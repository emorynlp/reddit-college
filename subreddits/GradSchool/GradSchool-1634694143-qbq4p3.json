On top of the fact that everyone is so freaking busy, you can't connect even if you want to sometimes, as everyone has packed calendars, and then need to recuperate in their free time. I've definitely felt the same way as you, OP, starting in Covid (I'm a 2nd year now) hasn't done anyone any favors.",

Despite going to much larger D1 schools for my masters and now my PhD, those feelings just aren't there. I'm on campus once or twice a week if even that, I work full time, I'm getting married next year, more responsibilities, etc. Just makes it difficult to invest in the institution beyond \"I'm only here to get a degree and leave\".",
