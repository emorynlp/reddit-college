Now a month in I am excited to say that I love my new program. I'm sad that I can no longer pursue my original goal, but my new thesis advisor and division of the department are so much more supportive, inclusive, and challenging in the best ways. \n\nI had a meeting today with my thesis advisor because I needed help in narrowing my focus from the theoretical and philosophical to the practical collection of data. My meeting started with a near anxiety attack because my ADHD brain couldn't seem to stay on one track or communicate. He gave me the time to breathe and gather myself before I started again. Then we talked through my current dilemna and established some smaller steps to take in the next week. \n\nI left that meeting feeling heard, optimistic, and capable. That hasn't happened in my education for a very long time.", "author": "AwkwardViking01", "created": 1631743699, "retrieved": 1632844197, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hd11tlo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pp06gc/the_right_advisor_makes_all_the_difference/hd11tlo/", "text": "That's fantastic to hear!
