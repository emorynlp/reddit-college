Her reply was : This is normal...! And she is right. The more you know about something, the more you realize what you don't know and it is unnerving. \n\nFor me, grad school is akin to brain olympics. What makes great athletes is dedication and mental attitude / capacity. Physical ability is important, but if you cannot handle the pressure, the doubts, the pain, the process, you will never get there. A good support system is then of primary importance. Without it, it is really hard to survive and thrive.\n\nI also want to say that a PhD is not necessary to be happy, and no one forces us to be there. We can opt out, there are 98% of the population that live their life without one. It is not the holy grail of life. For me, I continue pushing through. But If my mental health and my ability to be happy and a good partner / father was seriously impaired by grad school, I'd seriously consider quitting, or finish asap if I can manage it.", "author": "jtmooon", "created": 1615985777, "upvotes": 3}, "gr89x0p": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/m6cb47/this_subreddit_has_helped_keep_me_in_grad_school/gr89x0p/", "text": "This sub helped me a ton, too.
