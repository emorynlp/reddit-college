I have never felt so isolated and incapable in my life. Having the ability to see that people all around the world share similar woes has been very comforting and has played a huge role in pushing me forward. I appreciate you all!",

      "text": "Yesterday I was saying to a friend : As a 3rd year PhD Student, I feel a lot less capable of doing research than 3 years ago. Her reply was : This is normal...! And she is right. The more you know about something, the more you realize what you don't know and it is unnerving. \n\nFor me, grad school is akin to brain olympics. What makes great athletes is dedication and mental attitude / capacity. Physical ability is important, but if you cannot handle the pressure, the doubts, the pain, the process, you will never get there. A good support system is then of primary importance. Without it, it is really hard to survive and thrive.\n\nI also want to say that a PhD is not necessary to be happy, and no one forces us to be there. We can opt out, there are 98% of the population that live their life without one. It is not the holy grail of life. For me, I continue pushing through. But If my mental health and my ability to be happy and a good partner / father was seriously impaired by grad school, I'd seriously consider quitting, or finish asap if I can manage it.",

I'm also starting to see how my skills have indeed grown, though I was not as sure while immersed in grad school.",

A person's brain can't work 12 hours a day 6 days a week. Or even 12 hours a day 5 days a week. An 8 hour day 5 days a week SHOULD be the norm, and anything else is a problem. \n\nGrad school is stressful but it's also fun, and if it isn't fun at least some of the time we shouldn't be doing it. And when it's more stressful than fun, there's something wrong. I'm incredibly grateful that my PI encourages a basically normal work environment. I'm not really expected to work weekends. I'm planning on taking a few days off soon, then probably 2-3 weeks off in the summer, and that'll be ok as long as I'm being productive around then!",

Please take my poor people's gold. \ud83e\udd47\n\nMy advisor is a workaholic and seems to think that people who choose work/life balance are \"slacking off.\" During breaks she says it's good to take \"a couple days off\" but other than that she expects us to be working pretty much all the time, including through weekends and late at night (she once scheduled a meeting at 10pm). \n\nI am miserable and trying to get out as soon as possible. It's not surprising to me in the least that she's been in her position for almost a decade and has no students with completed PhDs to show for it. It's not healthy to be crying/wanting to cry on a regular basis because of your job. That sounds like abuse which, again, is not all that surprising - academia has a pattern of encouraging abusive dynamics. It's not okay and we need to start saying no, respecting ourselves, and standing our ground.",

I was experiencing a little bullying from my cohort, but mostly I was in a shitty relationship, academically in over my head, and experiencing garden variety anxiety/depression.
