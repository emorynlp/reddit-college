  "title:": "How to approach a thesis reader who is difficult to get in touch with",
  "text": "So, I\u2019m finishing up my MA in history, and finished my first draft of my thesis in March. Prior to writing, I asked my second reader if there were any books or other sources I would need for the topic that were just super crucial. Radio silence. \n\nAfter writing the draft, I sent it to my panel and got feedback from my thesis director, but didn\u2019t hear anything from the second reader. I did a lot of rewriting, reoutlining, etc., and it was much better based on the feedback I got, and I sent a new timeline to my thesis director and second reader, including when I hoped I would get feedback from them. They both agreed that the timeline worked. \n\nI sent them my new draft in mid-September, as agreed, and once again, heard back from the director and not the reader. Edited it, sent it back in mid-October and specifically asked the reader if we could discuss it. The thesis defense deadline is November 1, and I did not hear back from him until a week and a half after I sent him the draft, and even then, only because I asked about scheduling the defense.\n\nHe finally sent me feedback at 2:30 am, leaving me with four days to make changes before the thesis defense, and has some major changes he wants me to make and 7 or 8 books (several of which I have no way to get access to prior to the defense) that he wants me to incorporate into my argument.\n\nAm I right in feeling this is unreasonable? Should I bring this up with him? If so, how?",

But what are you going to do about it? \n\nSo it sounds like you're just going to have to do the best you can .\n\nAlso, are you certain you can't get all of those books? The ones that you can't get, write that second reader and say you can't get them and ask them if they happen to have a copy. Professors have quite large book collections and/or they may know another professor in the department who has the texts.\n\nAt the very least, that lets them know that you are doing your best to address their feedback, even if you don't get your hands on those texts.",

          "text": "Oh, I\u2019m going to do the best I can, I\u2019m just really frustrated because I have been on top of things, and he waits this long to communicate at all? And yeah, I really don\u2019t have access to those books. I really appreciate the suggestion, but with how terrible he\u2019s been at communication, I doubt it would even be worth it to ask. The university\u2019s special collections has them, but you have to schedule an appointment at least 3 business days out. \n\nAssuming I pass the defense, I have about 2 weeks after to make any final changes that may be needed so if what I do isn\u2019t quite good enough for submission but is good enough to pass the defense, at least I have that time, even if it is very much less than ideal to make large changes post-defense",
