  "text": "Hi all,\n\nRecently, I've become interested in getting a PhD in Economics. I graduated with a ~3.6 from a top 20 undergrad with a business degree (IT Management, specifically) in 2018. After I graduated, I took a job with a strategy consulting firm, hated it, and then transitioned to economic consulting after a year and a half. I've worked at my current econ consulting firm for a little less than 2 years.\n\nSince I've been at my firm, I've worked with a lot of folks with econ PhDs on cases that involve a lot of econometrics and statistics (labor discrimination, housing discrimination, and antitrust, to name a few). These are the cases I've enjoyed the most during my time here, and I want to explore the possibility of getting further education in economics with the eventual idea of doing academic research on homelessness and economic development. I can set up a regression in R or STATA and have good experience in a variety of statistical and econometric analytical techniques.\n\nThe problem: I don't have a math background even close to what is required to be competitive at econ PhD programs. In college, I took Calc I, a few stats classes, and intermediate micro/macro (and received As in all of them save for an A- in intro stats), but I have never taken Calc II or III, linear algebra, differential equations, or real analysis. I have come to understand that those courses essentially represent the bare minimum for being a competitive candidate at most econ PhD programs. Coming from a business background, I also have no academic research experience.\n\nI understand that if I want to become a competitive candidate for an econ PhD, I've got some work to do. My tentative plan was to explore post-bacc math certificates (this program at Northwestern is the one I'm considering most heavily: https://sps.northwestern.edu/post-baccalaureate/math-data-science/#courses) and then applying to master's programs like UChicago's MACRM where I can get research experience and continue to flesh out my math background. I've taken the GMAT and gotten a perfect score on the quant, so I'm confident that with some practice I can score 168+ on the GRE quant as well.\n\nI've got a few questions that I am hoping to get your feedback on:\n\n1. Does this plan even make sense? I don't have any idea whether I will be a competitive candidate at any top 30 school even if I proceed with the above plan and knock the classes/GRE out of the park. I feel quite behind.\n\n2. My job is usually quite busy, so it seems challenging to take the post-bacc classes at the same time that I'm working. Would it be wise to consider looking for RAships and taking the post-bacc math while I work one of those instead? I honestly don't even know if I'm qualified for RAships given my meager math background.\n\n3. I'm 25, and by the time I get through all of what I need to do to be competitive for quality econ PhD programs, I'll likely be at least 28. Is this even worth it? I think I could be a competitive candidate for top MPP/MPA programs if I just take the GRE, and part of me feels as though that would be the smarter path even though the econ PhD might be the more rewarding one.\n\n4. Any other advice?\n\nThank you in advance for reading. Any and all feedback/criticism/disillusionment is appreciated.",

Many universities let you register as a special student once you've already completed a bachelor's, and let you take classes. You might need to talk to the math department.\n\nSo then you would submit the transcript of your work from the institution with your application for the PhD.\n\nSo if there's a local institution near you which would work better, talk to the math department there and see if it's a possibility for you to register as a special student and take classes.",
