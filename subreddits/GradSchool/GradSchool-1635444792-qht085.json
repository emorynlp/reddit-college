  "text": "I'm in the process of applying to a doctoral sociology program, and am really hoping I can use a journal piece I've been working on/is close to completion as my writing sample. It's the best work I've done, period, but this is especially true for my research/writing skills pertaining to sociology.\n\nThe thing is, despite my being the solo author on a technical basis, I agreed to allow my research assistants to be listed as authors having contributed their research (looking up lit, etc) to the foundation of the piece; my research advisor will also likely be listed as the secondary author. So, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use this as my writing sample, since I'm not the sole author, technically speaking.\n\nThoughts/suggestions/advice? The program I'm applying to doesn't specify anything beyond the page limit for their expectations, and my advisor is in the department himself/has suggested I consider something I'm clearly the sole author of instead, but I'm struggling to find something that's as strong as this piece and would really, *really* like to use this if possible.",
