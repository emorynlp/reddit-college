My undergrad program really did not have a lot of research focus besides one course and now that I am assisting with research in grad school I find myself a bit lost. \n\nFor reference I got my undergraduate degree in Child Development and am doing my grad degree in Special Education for students with severe disabilities.\n\nThe research I am doing is more psych based and looking at job satisfaction. So it is a lot of correlations. I won\u2019t be doing the actual statistics for the study though but I should still understand the correlations. I am currently working on getting relevant literature together to write the lit review and compare our study. However my lack of background in research is causing me some issues in following along with the nitty gritty of the literature. I\u2019m able to get the gist but I want to be able to fully know the types of studies I am reading and I want to be able to read and understand the data tables and stuff like that. \n\nSo, if anyone knows a good place to get a decent background on this I would appreciate it!", "author": "SillyShenanigans", "created": 1631973013, "retrieved": 1632844157, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdc8dba": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqmsou/best_resource_to_learn_basics_of_research_and/hdc8dba/", "text": "For some intuition on econometrics ( should be easily transferable to other fields) check out Ben lambert on YouTube.

I personally found it was a good intro to statistics without going into too much of the math (still some, but just to highlight the points). Or if you are looking for something even more general with less math, you can check out the statistics books by Jim Frost. They are super easy to read and focus on the use and interpretation of statistics and less on the computation. \n\nAlso, correlations are statistics. These books will cover them.\n\nHope that helps!", "author": "sensorimotorneuro", "created": 1631974470, "upvotes": 1}}}
