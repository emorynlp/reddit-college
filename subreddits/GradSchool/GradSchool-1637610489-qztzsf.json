  "text": "I am in the process of applying for a history master's program.  I am interested in getting a PhD one day.  While looking at the university's programs the website states, \"Typically, students complete all required coursework within two years before taking written and oral comprehensive examinations in three fields of study.\"  Does this mean a PhD could be completed with two years at this school or am I misinterpreting this? Here is the full website for better context: [https://history.ua.edu/graduate-program/phd-program/](https://history.ua.edu/graduate-program/phd-program/)\n\nTIA!",

The typical structure for a PhD in the US is 2 years of coursework that leads to quals followed by 3 or more years of research leading to a dissertation. That page states you submit your thesis proposal in the same semester you do your quals, and that you have 7 years to finish the programme",

                      "text": "For one, archive work takes a long time. Often lots of traveling is needed, you don't know what is where until you get there, and old handwriting can be time consuming to transcribe. If you don't find what you need in one archive, you then have to figure out where to go next. I'm not even a true historian, and I've had to go through thousands of pages of old newspapers. I have over 4000 articles in my database with paper, date, and a short summary. Also, many historians have to learn a different language well enough to read old documents. One of my friends had to learn German, French, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, and Manchurian to work on her dissertation. \n\nYou also often don't start on your research until after you pass your exams, so not until your 3rd or 4th year. Different programs could do otherwise, but all of my chemistry PhD friends started working on research their first year under their advisor's projects. Instead, you have to apply for grants to begin your research and you don't always get those the first go around. Also, history (and related fields) are more likely to have to TA for funding and even if they don't its incredibly unlikely they get paid to work on advisor's research that can be used for their own dissertation. So that all leaves less time to work purely on research. \n\nHistory also has the longest average dissertations (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/221tzd/average_length_of_phd_dissertations_by_major/). So longer dissertation = takes longer to write. \n\nI'm sure there are some historians on here that could chime in. I can tell you for my specific field it takes a long time because we can only really do field work in the summers. My research took three separate summers to complete. Lab based projects take a bit less time, but not much as using someone else's old data leads to a whole different set of issues.",

Whereas when you write up the dissertation in STEM based on research one has done, that's the easy part. Mostly a matter of reporting what was already completed.",
