It's also super useful for reading PDFs. I download and manage files on my computer, and I read them on a tablet or even my phone. \n\nIt's even crazier because many grad students have access to unlimited storage for free through their institutions, and if that's not the case, they might be paying for extra cloud storage through a package deal with Google/Apple/etc. anyway, if they've got a music or some other subscription.",

That lives on the HPC and storing it privately would be expensive and a minefield of paperwork. My funding doesn't give me an allowance for such things. \n\nEveryone should be using version control where they can though! And that **does not** mean saving a bajillion copies of a file with *thesis_150321_final_FINAL_draft1*-type names.\n\nEdit: if anyone is interested in learning git, or you've tried before and found it impossibly complicated, [check out this short course](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/grad_school_git_course/)!",
