Studying is ONE of my JOBS. \n\nIn order for me to be a competent scientist, I need to keep abreast with new material concomitantly with solidifying my understanding of the fundamentals\u2014which basically means that I NEED to keep studying. \n\nGetting a PhD means that you are an EXPERT in that specific field; how can I become/be an expert if I\u2019m not studying? Like wtf. This is NOT like undergrad where I\u2019m studying to get a degree; this is MORE than that. I\u2019m studying because I want to be a competent scientist \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udd2c; evidently, that\u2019s really hard for laypeople to understand. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThank you.",

Also, note two points:\n\n1 - It *is* working.\n\n2 - It is going to grease the skids for later, after you graduate and have a job - where you review papers for conferences/journals, review proposals, do lit reviews as part of projects, and write papers.\n\nGenerally - the \"you aren't working, you are just reading\" doesn't really apply to people whose primary job is expertise - like PhD scientists (in-field publications) and lawyers (case law).  ***Studying is working***.\n\nSo stop saying \"studying\" and start using the big-boy term - \"working\".  If they don't understand why you need to work, then they just aren't going to understand (see lawyer example).",

Also, maybe better call that \"studying\" what it most likely actually is: reading to keep in touch with new advances in your field of work. Many professionals - such as medical doctors of many specializations - need to frequently read about new knowledge related to their job, so that they can do their job better (and don't lose their licence or trust of their clients).",

Part of graduate school is learning how to balance studying/learning; work; family life and social life. It sounds like you are possibly talking about how much you study to your family more than necessary, possibly?  They likely don't want to hear about it more than at a cursory level. You don't need to, and should not be, studying *all the time.* You have to have a life - and unless you want what you're studying to be the sole focus of your life you'll need to learn when to set school aside and listen to, engage and enjoy people who are not in grad school, who have never studied like you, who are your family - without you having to discuss how much you study.",

I think it's you. you're unwilling to open up and share this part of your life with them. it's going to be hard. but if you don't try, things will never slowly improve. you have to stop assuming they won't understand and give them the chance to understand. if you keep making the decision for them, thye'll never be given the opportunity to try to understand.\n\nmods- can we require context in posts? so much of what is discussed here is TOTALLY field dependent.",

Implying that it's rude for someone to be surprised that you can get paid to go to school is just insane. Generally, part of that surprised response is also the person being impressed, in the same way someone would be a bit surprised and impressed to learn that a person got a full ride scholarship to college.\n\nLaughing or saying \"yes, who contributes to research and University teaching gets paid indeed\" is not an honest answer, it's purposefully rude.

We want validation, we seek family approval of what we do. *However,* the fact is they aren't going to care about details. You become interested in your field, then your sub-field(s), then specific topics, then you learn all you can - but that isn't what they do, and it isn't what interests 99% of people. My guess is you don't take much interest in the specifics of what your family members do, care about, how much they like their jobs, what they think about it and how it affects them, etc. \n\nIn other words - grad students suffer from higher rates of depression than almost any demographic for a reason. Stress, lack of sleep, constant studying, poor family relations - these become badges *of pride* when they are terribly unhealthy for the individuals and for their relationships. We find that we know too much to not get annoyed in many conversations - and we get upset when someone with a HS diploma tries to argue something related to our field (politics for me - so it comes up a lot) and don't take you seriously...\n\nUltimately, part of the solution is compartmentalizing. You have to have a life outside of grad school - be able to talk to people without naturally reverting to talking about your field, your research.",

D., which will still be substantially more than a lot of my friends working in industry or government, and TT professor jobs here start around $120k.\n\nIt's just amazing how little people can expect to make in most \"regular\" jobs these days - both my parents were making >50k per year when they started in the 80's, and my mom doesn't even have a university degree.",

Going to engineering, comp sci, or consulting right after your bachelors is probably the best pay off of education to income. You'll have a ~70k starting salary in those fields, similar to an associate prof that has an addition 7-10 years of training after their bachelor's. Your salary as an engineer or whatever will likely be considerably higher after 10 years if you work as hard as the sort of the PhD student or postdoc that gets a TT professorship.

But still double the poverty line. \n\nYeah I\u2019m not entirely convinced, at least for stem phds, that the payoff is as poor (at least in Canada). The median income in the province I live in is very low, around $30,000 per year. Even a post doc will start around 50-60k here, with more if you teach on top. The starting rate for TT professors hovers around $120k Canada-wide, even at a shitty little college. it sounds like profs in the US are getting screwed!\n\nWhile I agree that stem professionals like engineers and computer scientists will likely make more in their lifetime, I think compared to an \u201caverage joe\u201d job that most of our friends likely have, a PhD will pay off substantially more. If you make 120k+ in Canada you are going to be in the top 10% of earners nation-wide.\n\nAt the end of the day though it comes down to whether you enjoy it. I\u2019m pretty stress-free about my PhD, I\u2019m making an \u201caverage\u201d income of about 35k/yr for the next three years, which isn\u2019t so bad for a millennial in Canada, and I\u2019m aiming for a reasonable TT job at a small university in the future (what you guys might consider an R2 or R3). I\u2019m happy with this life, because it means I have a lot of freedom in terms of time and get to learn every day.\n\nIt may not be worth it for someone going into it for the money, maybe they\u2019d be better off going into a trade like electrical or welding, or become a healthcare practitioner, an engineer, or someone who works in software.
