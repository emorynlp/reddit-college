  "text": "Long story short, I\u2019m a 3rd year undergrad wanting to go into a PhD for psychology. I had an opportunity to work in a psychology related research lab, but unfortunately due to covid that opportunity was cancelled and because I felt I HAD to get research in I applied for and accepted a position in a neuroscience/systems biology lab. While the work there is great, I\u2019m afraid that it won\u2019t be very applicable when I\u2019m applying for an almost purely psychological PhD. There is a senior research program which the deadline is coming up for, but when I asked one of my professors about it they advised not to stay in the lab and do the senior program. The issue is I would need to find a PI to essentially sponsor me, as well as the fact that I\u2019ve agreed to a 2 year commitment to my current lab (I\u2019m not in - contract or anything though). Any advice would be extremely welcome and helpful. Thanks!",
