It\u2019s harder to get into a PhD program and they have less seats. They typically are given to people that want to finish, but there are some who will master out.\n\nTypically for a PhD program to be awarded a stipend (or free) you need to do some sort of work for the university, wether that is through TA or RA responsibilities. These are not required for many masters programs and often your obligations are mainly class. This of course doesn\u2019t outweigh the cost of a masters program tuition, which is why people choose to \u201cmasters out\u201d of a PhD program instead. \n\nI have met people that have openly admitted to joining for this very reason.

A master's degree and the first two years of your PhD are not the same education. At then end of the master's degree you have learned the skills that you went in hoping to learn (assuming you took your education seriously). At the end of the second year of your PhD, you've completed some classes and got some lab experience, but the skills you've learned might not be comparable to the terminal skills focused on in the Master's. \n\n2. It's very field dependent. For my degree, I knew I needed the PhD and just straight up skipped the master's to save time. Not every field will do that, and not every field needs a PhD. \n\n3. Stigma. There's a HUGE stigma against Mastering Out. Peer pressure is real and keeps people going longer than they should. Plus, bailing on your PhD can be really detrimental to your future opportunities. It very much depends on each specific situation. I've seen people master out because they realized they hated academia and the terminal PhD just wasn't worth it. I've also seen people master out for mental health reasons. These are generally viewed as fine reasons. But, if I found out one of my students joined the program with the intention of mastering out after two years, I would be livid. Especially if they were funded by our lab's grants.
