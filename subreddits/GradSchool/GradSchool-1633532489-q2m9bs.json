  "text": "So, I\u2019ve decided I want to get my MSW. Unfortunately, the school closest to me which has a great program has suspended its part time option until 2024, so I\u2019ve bern exploring online options. Long story short, I put my name down for the mailing lists of a few schools, and now admission counselors are blowing up my phone left and right. I talked to one on the phone for a half hour and she fast-talked me through the entire application process. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m thrilled in a way that I\u2019m being reached out to, but this is the sort of stuff I always associated with for-profit colleges. The school I\u2019m interested in is a pretty well-known university and it just strikes me as odd that they\u2019d be going out of their way to try and recruit people, but I\u2019ve also been put of school for awhile, and I\u2019m thinking maybe this is just normal now?\n\nIf anyone could shed some light on this, that would be great. Am I overthinking it, or is it kind of strange? \n\nThanks.",

They know if they talk to you and get you through the process they can count you towards their numbers.

          "text": "I think lower enrollment played a role in my sudden grad school acceptance. In March I met with the professor who is the head of my area of focus (it's an art program at a state school) to discuss applying for school next year, and within 48 hours I applied with an old portfolio and was accepted *with funding* as a TA to start this fall. \n\nI just don't think this is normal, I think they needed TAs and higher enrollment numbers. Because this was after all application deadlines, after they had already offered financial awards etc., and my work was old, which is a big no-no for art portfolios when applying to grad school.",

I\u2019ve experienced that if you tell them that you aren\u2019t considering their program anymore, they\u2019ll back off\u2026but I still have two programs I didn\u2019t apply or enroll at leaving me VMs asking if they can answer any questions for me and the semester is almost half over.",
