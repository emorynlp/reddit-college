  "title:": "NSF GRFP - third reference unsubmitted",
  "text": "I applied to the NSF GRFP this year, and my third reference writer submitted right after the deadline and his letter didn\u2019t go through. I\u2019m really frustrated and feel stupid for not asking for 4 or 5 references. I\u2019m a second year grad student so this is my last chance to apply.\n\nMy question is - the GRFP guidelines say that it is required that three reference names are provided. However only two submitted reference letters are actually required for the application to be reviewed. Since my other two reviewers submitted on time, this is the boat I\u2019m in, so at least my application will be reviewed. It feels hopeless though, because it seems like they pretty much expect three submitted letters. Does anyone have any experience with this/can provide guidance on next steps? Do I still have a shot or is my app essentially dead in the water? I (and my third reference writer) have sent an email to the help email address but I don\u2019t expect them to respond until after the weekend.",

How would this look bad? They were all really good letters from different people from different parts of my life (I'm in my 30's, so kinda old). They were my PI, the PI of the lab from another uni I am working with for my PhD project, the head of the department of chem at my uni, another big professor at my uni, and my EMT instructor from EMT school. I just don't get how too many letters could be frowned upon.",

                      "text": "If an application lists a certain number of letters (3, in this case), more is often viewed as trying to game the system or secure an unfair advantage. \n\nIn this particular case (as other posters have pointed out) it seems like NSF has updated their system to allow 5 submissions and you rank which ones you want reviewers to see (only the top 3 letters according to your submission scheme will be used). \n\nSo the negative impact here is that two of the people who wrote for you will have wasted their time, as the reviewers will only see 3 out of the 5 (whatever ones you designated top). So you should have selected the people who would write the three strongest letters, and asked them. \n\nFor systems that don't automatically cull (for example, job applications), submitting more letters than requested is often frowned on for the reasons I mentioned above. There are also a number of systems (and the old NSF system was like this) that will consider only the first X letters submitted, irrespective of whether those are strongest or not. So, for instance, in your case, if your PI's letter was submitted \"later\" than others, it might not be used as part of your application.",
