  "title:": "Appplying as a non-matriculated student in order to get into master's program?",
  "text": "For some background: I had graduated undergrad Fall 2020 with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering Technology, with a GPA of 3.25/4. Im seeking to continue my education with a master's in Mechanical Engineering (not technology).\n\nI had applied and was contacted by the school. I was told my gpa was not satisfactory enough and to apply as a non-matriculated student. They want me to take some undergrad/grad classes in order to prove i can handle the work load before being accepted into the program and as a result, they had deferred my grad application.\n\nI am wondering if anybody had ever done anything similar and if so, how did it turn out? Ive never heard of anybody taking this route and it makes me a little nervous. I am worried about wasting time and money only to not be accepted in the end. Of course i will be trying my hardest to get good grades.",

          "text": "Essentially its an easier degree - geared towards the applied or \"hands on\" side of engineering. The degree itself is very similar, it includes all of the fundamentals except the math is algebra based and not calculus (though i did take calc 1 and 2, got an A in both).\n\nIts not regarded with the same respect as a regular ME degree and you dont geaduate and call yourself an engineer but its not meant to be. I wanted an ME bachelor's but unfortunately i was rejected.",

And take those courses that they want you to?\n\nIf they insist on deferring you, get it in writing what classes they want you to take and that if your grades are X or better, they'll automatically accept you to the program.",

      "text": "I have taken a similar route. My undergrad GPA was lower than yours. My school offers graduate certificates, which are a more formalized version of takung courses as a non-degree seeking student. A GC at my school set of 4 courses from a restricted list within an area of interest. A student who gets B's or better on those 4 has shown he or she can handle the work, and can continue on to a master's degree, and those 4 courses then count towards the master's. It was a good way for me to \"try before I buy\" and see if I could handle the work and had the interest to go all the way before I committed to the whole master's degree program. I did well and am almost done with my aerospace engineering master's degree. I will always be an advocate of taking courses at a school of interest as non-degree students as an alternate way of demonstrating fitness for students whose undergrad GPA would otherwise be too low.  \n\nAnd if you are worried about wasting time and money, it's better to find out a student lacks necessary drive or ability after one or two non-degree courses and can just not re-enroll than to find out after being admitted to master's program with all the pressure to continue and the need to explain why the student is dropping out.",
