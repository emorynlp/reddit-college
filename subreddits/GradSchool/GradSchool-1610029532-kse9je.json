Those of us who belong to marginalized groups have to live with the consequences of these systems, and therefore talking dispassionately is not often practicable when polices or systemic structures impact our ability to enjoy equal citizenship in this country. I don't really think it would have much implications for your career. I follow several political scientists on Twitter who say some very forceful things on social media and nobody really pays any mind to it. \n\nAs far as setting boundaries, my general practice is whenever someone brings up politics, I just politely let them know I'm not interested in talking about politics since I study it for a living and find it exhausting.
