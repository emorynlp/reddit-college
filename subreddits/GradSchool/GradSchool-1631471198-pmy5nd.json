  "text": "Hello. I currently have a BFA in a design program, but I'm super interested in this field. I'd like to know what would be considered research for a Ph.D. in performance studies when applying. I've been trying to find research assistant jobs in fields like psychology, anthropology etc, but haven't had any luck as there's a lack of funding in my country. So could I work as a scenic designer or be a dramaturg? I'd love to hear from anyone who knows the field!",
