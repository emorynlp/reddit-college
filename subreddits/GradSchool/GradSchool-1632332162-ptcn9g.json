I am currently in my second year of a PhD in mathematics.\n\nIn my research and coursework I feel like I am really having a tough time understanding new papers and approaching problems with an open mind -- and this seems to be a global effect. My biggest hobby is playing the guitar and I also feel pretty stunted in my growth there. Not sure if this is something others are feeling, or if anyone has advice on getting out of this mental rut?", "author": "ModernBatman", "created": 1632332162, "retrieved": 1632952117, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hdwyjwr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ptcn9g/mentally_plateaued/hdwyjwr/", "text": "Take some time off.
