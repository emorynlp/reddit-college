  "text": "I\u2019m currently a senior in college with my undergrad in business administration. The spring semester is my final semester and I\u2019m planning to apply to the Masters of Public Administration (MPA) at my school. I haven\u2019t done an undergrad internship yet, but I have the option of taking a grad course or two next semester and if I did that I wouldn\u2019t have time for an internship. Would it be worth taking these grad courses at an undergrad fee? Or should I wait until next fall to start my masters and just try to do an internship next fall (it also seems hard to find internships at the moment because of the pandemic). Thank you for the advice!",

      "text": "Work experience always trumps school (unless you plan on being a lifelong academic, then by all means, go ahead). If the internship is paid, you'll also make up the cost savings that you'd get from taking graduate classes in undergrad\n\nI'd recommend taking the internship and saving the courses for masters. It might be nice to get the courses at a reduced rate, but you're still going to need work experience even when you finish. The MPA is a professional program (at least in Canada), so it's advised that you gain some hands on experience to learn some of the nuances of the profession. It's not needed, but definitely helpful.",

          "text": "Yeah, I agree, the OP should aim for experience first. Going from undergrad directly to a professional program like MPA, your obvious weakness will always be a lack of experience. No amount of courses can make up for it, so take it where you can get it!",

              "text": "It might sound counter-intuitive being on a grad school subreddit, but school will always be there while work opportunities are more fleeting. \n\nI'd always priortize work experience over education. Education basically helps you to get your foot in the door (aka an interview), but you'll be hired based on your work experience. \n\nYou could always do your masters part time online as well. Lots of public servants will pursue an MPA while working full time as it really helps with career advancement",
