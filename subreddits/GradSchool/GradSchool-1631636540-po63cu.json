If the type of statistics you want to do is more mathematical than applied, it will be necessary to learn real analysis because you will need to be able to do some heavier proofs of mathematical statistics. Real analysis, at least what you learn in the first few courses, go over the basis of what calaculus is and how derivation and integration work, which is very, very relevant to statistics. \n\nThat being said, if you are looking at applied stats programs, it\u2019s probably not as necessary, but it might make you stand out. I\u2019m in an applied stats program and I had a lot of people ask me about my mathematical background in the interview stage because I had a much deeper background in pure math than average. I would guess these programs would inevitably have you take some kind of analysis course regardless if they didn\u2019t expect it from you at the beginning.\n\nIf you are interested in pure stats (which is usually what blanket \u201cstatistics\u201d graduate programs are), I agree with the others in that I would be surprised it isn\u2019t an outright perquisite, and I am also kind of surprised it isn\u2019t a required course for your math bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nPart of the process in applying to graduate programs is looking down the road at the places you want to go and see what they expect, which i know can be hard to have that much foresight at times.", "author": "ULTIMATE_FROG", "created": 1631764979, "upvotes": 1}, "hcvnbyc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/po63cu/how_necessary_is_real_analysis_for_a_masters_in/hcvnbyc/", "text": "At ubc for example, two courses of mathematical statistics are required for grad students, and knowing the techniques from real analysis is extremely helpful, not to mention any measure/probability theory you may want to take could build upon these concepts, so you should take real analysis if you want to leave open the possibility of pursuing grad studies. \n\nI'm surprised it's not an outright prerequisite for admission into master's programs tbh.", "author": "ning7", "created": 1631658707, "upvotes": 1}, "hcv9avh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/po63cu/how_necessary_is_real_analysis_for_a_masters_in/hcv9avh/", "text": "If you intend to do anything with probability theory, that whole field is basically a study of measure theory on spaces with measure 1. Real Analysis at the level of Baby Rudin is the prerequisite to studying measure and integration, and that in turn is the prerequisite to doing any higher level probability. That being said, you asked about statistics, not necessarily probability. I don't know much about statistics programs, but I think you would want to have a solid background in probability for data science. That aside, however, Real Analysis is tremendously valuable as a means of gaining a sense of mathematical maturity. If you can survive a Real Analysis course (even if its just one, and not a sequence of two or three), then you will be a step closer to being able to think and reason as mathematicians do, rather than just be a code monkey that can compute stuff.", "author": "KingOfTheEigenvalues", "created": 1631652702, "upvotes": 3}}}
