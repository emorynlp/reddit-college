  "title:": "Anyone else feel like they definitely dont do a full 40 hours of work a week, let alone the 70+ everyone seems to complain about?",
  "text": "Maybe it's just because I'm in a masters and not a PhD (although I feel like I have most of the same requirements as our phd program just condensed into a shorter period of time to get it all done) but while grad school is difficult in many ways it's definitely not killing me with the work load. \n\nI'm fully funded so I dont have any additional TA responsibilities, and I only need to take 2 courses a semester to graduate, none of which have given me a huge workload and when they do it's just lots of reading. This is a fairly reputable stem program too and some of the classes have been pretty difficult but that doesnt inherently correlate to time consuming\n\nMy research at the moment is all computer modeling, which I do on my own time from home. Besides the fact that I simply would not be capable of spending 8 straight hours coding, it's also not usually beneficial to do that. If I'm stuck on a line of code I solve it way faster by giving myself a break for the rest of the day and looking at it again tomorrow. Then once I get something to work I usually have to test run it before I can move on, which can take an entire day\n\nI'm not trying to brag here because honestly it bothers me. With school being wfh right now I feel restless and bored a lot of the time and also it makes me feel sort of guilty and anxious that I barely pull 30 hours a week when I'm being paid as a full time employee. And makes me wonder if I'm not getting enough out of the experience. My tuition is funded but I'm still paying a few thousand a year in school fees to be here. \n\nIs it just that I'm doing a different line of work that maybe requires more focus and brain power but less actual time? Or should I be concerned that I'm not doing enough and gaining enough experience if I'm not feeling overworked?",

If I did at least 3-4 publications in my Masters, perhaps I wouldn't be doing these long hours now haha.... I need to graduate with quite a few publications so it comes without saying that I need the 80+ hours. I do not have a research team to work on any of my papers, so all my papers will be first author.\n\nAlso, I teach part time. I also attend at least one conference a month online. Teaching, grading, watching improvement videos (about software etc), writing a dissertation, having meeting with supervisors, preparing for these meetings, reading on latest updates in my area, responding to paper reviews and drafting papers is more time-consuming that one would think. \n\nI do not promote neither recommend these work hours to anyone out there. How long you do research will depend on what you want during your graduation. Some are happy with 2-3 publications or even just have a dissertation and that's perfectly fine. Do what makes you happy and feel fulfilled. It really is goal-dependent and field-dependent. I am in social science and doing all this with just 30 hours is absolutely not possible without major delays.",

I always assumed I would be doing research with my advisor and they would let me know when we were ready to public something. Am I supposed to be creating additional research projects on my own out of thin air and just figuring out how to publish?? I also thought it took quite a while to complete enough research to publish and then go through the entire peer review process so I'm a little confused on the time line of how you would manage to get 4 papers out in 2 years. I'm almost a year in and not writing anything and I would have no idea where to start.\n\nTbh I think one of the downsides of covid that I dont hear discussed very often is that there are certain things you're expected to just pick up on as a grad student that arent possible to pick up on when you have to attend school 100% from home and have zero interaction with other grad students. I have no concept right now of what other people in my field are doing, if they're all publishing, if they have a significantly different work/life balance, if they're taking more credits. I cant tell if I'm on target to be competitive for phds because I have no clue what the competition is",

              "text": "I'm from social science so YMMV if you are from a different field. The usual number of publications for Masters student is about 2 within 2 years. One of it can be from your thesis and another one can be a lit review/conceptual paper etc. Nobody taught me how to write a paper. I learnt how to write one after reading many papers in my field and thinking, I think I can add something to the discussion. Initially, I did not know where to start as well but I joined many online sessions about how to submit papers to top journals. I really recommend following some of the academics in your field through social media because that's how I joined a lot of these great sessions.\n\nI was in the same position like you in my Masters because I expected my supervisor to tell me to start writing a paper but in reality, they cannot tell you to write one unless it is mandatory for students to publish/submit before they graduate. Otherwise, your supervisors are in a tough spot because although they do want you to write a paper, they most likely won't bring it up because that is beyond the scope of your task a researcher in the faculty. The best that they can ask is if you have a publication timeline. \n\nPublications are important to be a competitive post-doc or securing a job in a research based university. Not many people shared this to me in my postgrad. My advice is to write ONE paper first and usually, that one paper will propel you to do more because you become familiar with the publishing process.",

      "text": "I don't think I put in many 40 hour work weeks the last 6 years in my PhD program. Maybe when I was working research assistantships for professors in different departments or even a different university, but most of that work was pretty mindless/menial and just happened to be time-consuming. My first year TA-ship was for a course that required me to do a LOT of grading of a LOT of papers, and I probably ended up spending more time on trying to meet the grading deadline than on coursework. Still, I don't know if I even was working 40 hours then. Getting a cushy fellowship for 3 years that freed me up from TAing or RAing for funding helped me cut back my hours a lot so I could focus on finishing coursework and publishing.\n\nIt's only since beginning my dissertation research (ethnography + long af interviews + fielding a survey) that I've really worked full 8+ hour days, almost daily, but I give myself a weekday off to de-stress, catch up on other work, and prevent myself from totally burning out. I guess that means I do work a bit on my \"day off,\" but at least taking the day off from fieldwork or doing interviews helps give me more time to tend to my own needs so I can continue moving forward with my research since it really does require me to be \"all in\" and is pretty tiring, although I really do enjoy it (usually). \n\nI'm in the social sciences though, so maybe it is just a STEM vs. social sciences/humanities thing.",

Sometimes working 40 hours a week on the offered stipend means making less than minimum wage, that was unacceptable to me so I didn't work those hours. \"you are here for an education\" is bullshit when the classes they made you take were basically check boxes where everyone gets a B for showing up practically, and you haven't taken one in years, and are doing the exact same things as the lab technician also with a B.S. who makes more than you, or the exact same things as the teaching professor with an M.S. (that you can get instantly if you pass quals or the coursework and immediately quit at some programs) making even more than that. \n\nIt's shameful how colleges pay their grad student workers. In some cities rents have doubled in 10 years and stipends have remained flat, so you are effectively making less money than when you started despite being more senior and relied upon, and a whole lot less than if you lucked out and were born 10 years earlier and came to school when rents were lower.",

I do 20 hours of lab for my funding, about 20-30 hours in classes and doing class work, 5-10 hours in a clinical experience, and 5-10 hours of volunteer research. Some other people in my program have non-service fellowships so their weeks are automatically 20+ hours a week less, so don't be worried about under-working, it all depends on people and programs.

It felt I was swamped with work and I couldn't focus on one thing at a time. \n\nWhen I was in undergrad, I thought that doing 70+ was a given and it was \"a badge of working hard.\" Most if not all the professors I have had contact with also talk about how it's good that a student puts in this much work. But in reality, forcing oneself to work for that long is a terrible idea (for what I do). \n\n\"Is it just that I'm doing a different line of work that maybe requires more focus and brain power but less actual time?\" Maybe. But if it's working for you and you're getting good results, keep doing it. Don't feel obligated to increase time spent on working and forcing yourself to do more unnecessary work. Feeling overwhelmed and overworked for long periods of time can erode your well-being. \n\nIn other words, \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it\".",

Throw in some meetings. I did TA and take 2 classes a semester during the school year so honestly I was a little more busy then, but no where near 70 hours.

I also have time to work another small job (passion project, if you will) and save at least 6 or 7 hours a week for my hobby. \n\nBut yeah I\u2019m with you I feel terrible about making money for when I\u2019m supposed to be working 9-5 and I usually don\u2019t.

      "text": "I'm in humanities doing a masters and have the same thing - I think part of it compared to friends in STEM is that not having lab work etc. changes expectations. I also have course mates who will take any opportunity to tell you they're pulling 60+ hour weeks and working SO SO HARD. I did 40 at the start of the year and am honestly now plodding along quite happily at around 25 and am on track to finish my thesis ahead of the final deadline. Big part of it is hours actually worked, not hours sat at a desk. I'm a very big believer in not overloading/burning out and it being more efficient to plan five hours actual work than claim to have done ten. \n\nMy theory is part of it stems from the kind of people who wind up in graduate school. We're pretty exclusively nerds to some degree at this point. I wonder how many of my classmates were *that kid* in the year who used to sit outside the exam hall and base a degree of their personality on the fact that they'd studied the most/least/were the most stressed you could *possibly be*. Alternatively, how many were the similar kid who placed a horrendous amount of self worth on grades/academic success and as a result held themselves to often pointlessly high standards.  Most on my coursemates are dead set on academia, whereas I'm taking a job completely unrelated to the masters next year, so i'm quite detached from it all. I see a hell of a lot of anxious perfectionists who are:\n\na. working inefficiently (either because they're burnt out, or that part of them seems to genuinely gain satisfaction from the idea that they're doing more hours than you)\n\nb.sitting at a desk for 10 hours because part of them feels like they *need* to be the one who worked the hardest. \n\nc. have actual commitments (I'm also funded and not having to TA, so I don't want to make too many generalisations as I only know the financial situation of \\~1/3 of my coursemates)",

I also think PIs in Stem put a lot of pressure on students to constantly be churning out new data. I meet with my PI once a week, and there is an enormous amount of pressure to have new data every week, even though it\u2019s not realistic to get several experiments done every single week. I often felt pressured to push through experiments as quickly as possible because my PI wants the data ASAP, and I was not spending enough time thinking about design, and what information we wanted to get out of the experiment. I\u2019m collecting less data overall, but producing better quality and informative data more quickly. I wish my PI was more patient and willing to give us time to think things through more before demanding data. taking more time to really think about experiments before I do them, and it has really cut back on me having to redo things when they don\u2019t work or I\u2019m missing a crucial control or condition by trying to churn out results ASAP. \n\nMy PI has definitely been disappointed that I\u2019m not producing as much data before, but I feel the data I collect now is more meaningful and informative and I\u2019m making progress faster than I was doing random experiments that are poorly designed and are generally uninformative. It\u2019s really easy to get into that zone of just trying to be productive and then missing the mark on why you\u2019re doing it.",

They might publish more papers and might get that good postdoc gig. But that's very different to cases where people have to work on the weekends due to the fundamental nature of their field.\n\nIf someone's experiment requires their input every single day and it takes 5+ days to run then it is literally impossible for them to get a PhD without working weekends. If they have other commitments, like teaching, that make some days a no-go for launching then even shorter experiments could require weekend work. And that's not even getting into fields where PhDs must care for animal test subjects every single day.\n\nCompare that to your code. If you don't write a line of code over the weekend, your code isn't going to magically delete itself and all previous versions of itself. If you don't care for the animals or the cells or the reaction or whatever, it can die, and you lose everything. My code runs for a week or 2, but I don't have to feed and water it every single day lest it delete itself.",

And you don't only save yourself those 2 days because a job submitted on Monday might sit in the queue for 5 days versus a Saturday job that runs immediately. \n\nBut the difference is that I can submit code in about 10-15 seconds from my personal computer anywhere in the world and then I'm done. Bio and chem experiments involve physically going into a lab most of the time and then the work you need to do to \"submit the job\" takes considerably longer than 10-15 seconds. There may also be numerous analyses that have to be done within a small window of your experiment completing, whereas my data can sit uninterrupted for months, if not decades (depends where it's saved).\n\nBut these sort of time saves only work for experimental work (simulation also being experiment). If you're doing theory then you don't save extra time by doing more work now. You can *only* save the amount of time you spend actively working (4hrs done today is 4hrs not done tomorrow), and would probably save less when you burn yourself out from working too much without break. So any and all advice on whether you should work outside of 9-5 or outside of weekdays depends on the field and kind of work being done.",
