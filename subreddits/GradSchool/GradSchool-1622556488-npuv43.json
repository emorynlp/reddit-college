But if it's working for you and you're getting good results, keep doing it. Don't feel obligated to increase time spent on working and forcing yourself to do more unnecessary work. Feeling overwhelmed and overworked for long periods of time can erode your well-being. \n\nIn other words, \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it\".", "author": "datdestructor", "created": 1622571637, "upvotes": 17}, "h07ybbc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/npuv43/anyone_else_feel_like_they_definitely_dont_do_a/h07ybbc/", "text": "I\u2019m also in a STEM masters, and I get no where near the 70+ hours I hear people talking about. I\u2019m honestly a little concerned by the lack of work I do on a weekly basis. I usually call my friends (who work full time office jobs, from home) just because I like to simulate the environment of a library or something (lockdowns been hard on me), they easily work 9-5 on a weekday where I\u2019m working more 10-4 ish, maybe less depending on the day. However I do work a few extra hours too on my weekends or sometimes in the evening. But I can\u2019t claim I\u2019m working effectively for any of this, since I do get distracted with social media, like I am now for example. \n\nLike you, I can\u2019t write code all day, but I\u2019m also writing and reading too. Throw in some meetings. I did TA and take 2 classes a semester during the school year so honestly I was a little more busy then, but no where near 70 hours. Honestly it fluctuates a lot based on the week. I also have time to work another small job (passion project, if you will) and save at least 6 or 7 hours a week for my hobby. \n\nBut yeah I\u2019m with you I feel terrible about making money for when I\u2019m supposed to be working 9-5 and I usually don\u2019t. Usually I get everything I set out to do in my week done within the week, but sometimes I get stuck on something and it takes me longer than expected. My supervisor has never commented that I\u2019m behind, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m behind, but I constantly feel guilty for not working hard enough. Mainly I feel like my work isn\u2019t always reaching the standard I like. \n\nI know that part of it is the pandemic because I\u2019m very externally motivated and need the social pressure of a group setting to not procrastinate. When I\u2019m home, as soon as something doesn\u2019t go as planned (weird code error, can\u2019t figure out how to explain what I am trying to write) I can always convince myself to do it later (since I work at home and I\u2019m always home). I miss the urgency of \u201ccan\u2019t go home until I\u2019ve done this step\u201d. \n\nSo yeah we are in the same boat.
