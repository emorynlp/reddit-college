I hope it\u2019s okay to ask this question here. When I was looking at benchmarks for admission into some US programs, I was shocked at how seemingly high the standards were. For instance, the top overall mark for last years cohort of the course I\u2019m currently in was 88 (and everyone in general scored much higher last year as we were still in lockdown and assessments were all online- people sat exams in big groups etc). But US students here seem to speak of an 88 as an average mark at best? Maybe even less than? Does anyone have any insight into this?", "author": "daisybuckley", "created": 1632559474, "retrieved": 1632952048, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he7vbut": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pv2x8p/confused_re_us_vs_australian_standards/he7vbut/", "text": "The US generally has skewed their numbers upwards, so you shouldn\u2019t focus on the numbers, you should focus on the letter grades. \n\nA C-grade (passing) in the US is typically at 70% and the work is designed such that a C-level student will achieve 70%.\n\nIn Australia, the passing grade is around 50% and the work is designed such that a C-level student will achieve 50%.\n\nThat means if you took a US student with a 70% average and made them sit an Australian exam/assignment, they would achieve only 50%. You can think of this as \u201cAustralian coursework is harder\u201d if you want, since even the best students will rarely cross 90%. The US also does not always have a grade corresponding to the highest in Australia:\n\n- 70% C = 50% Pass\n\n- 80% B = 60% Credit\n\n- 90% A = 70% Distinction\n\n- 95% A+? = 80% High Distinction\n\nSo someone with a 6/7 GPA or 70 WAM in Aus could have a 4.0 GPA in the US. \n\nSo 88% for them is a solid B, inching towards an A. For us it\u2019s a very high A+, inching towards A++. \n\nThis is before you take into account scaling, of course, but that applies everywhere and you\u2019re always scaled to your local grade standard so it\u2019s irrelevant.", "author": "officially_anxious", "created": 1632575877, "upvotes": 4}}}
