I want to stay where I am geographically and this region needs healthcare professionals\u2014so I\u2019m gonna learn. \n\nLuckily the program is totally online and I\u2019ve already found a friend (through this community!) going into the same program at my start date. \n\nHaving done grad school before I have a smidge of confidence going in, since I\u2019m already familiar with the workload and reading demands. And this time I don\u2019t have to TA for first years!!",
