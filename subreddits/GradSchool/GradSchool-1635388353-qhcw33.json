      "text": "Yeah. GMacc is rough right now, but my advisor did tell me that as the semesters progress, the balance of undergrad required courses and graduate oriented courses begins to shift (implying the course expectations will shift as well). \n\nBut managerial accounting, financial accounting and tax fundamentals all at the same time is a pretty insane introduction to these topics and the first part of the semester really did not go well at all. I think I'm starting to get the hang, but who the fuck knows...\n\nOh and to boot, we had to start applying for internships 1 week into the school year for a job that I'm not even sure what is actually done on a day to day basis. I'm currently deciding on which firm to go with, knowing that this will probably impact the rest of my life. \n\nSuper fun process. Super fun.",
