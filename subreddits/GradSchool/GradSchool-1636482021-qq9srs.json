  "text": "And that\u2019s okay. As someone in an interdisciplinary program (a \u201cgraduate group\u201d) that doesn\u2019t have a home department or it\u2019s own qualitative methods class, I had to learn how to do qualitative research from a different grad department and thought Sociology would be a good fit. I feel like I\u2019m going above and beyond to succeed in this Soc methods class but at the end of the day, the prof keeps giving me the harshest critiques because she doesn\u2019t see the value in my project. After presenting on my literature review that draws largely from Asian American studies and Cultural studies literature to support my own research on Asian American youth subcultures, she just said, \u201cJust because something hasn\u2019t been studied yet doesn\u2019t mean it should be studied.\u201d \n\nShe then proceeded to keep interrogating me with questions like \u201cbut WHY does this topic matter?\u201d I was so shocked by how aggressively she spoke to me compared to the rest of the class \u2014 largely sociology students who focus on medical and legal/governmental sociological issues. I just froze and dissociated from my body \u2014 I was in shock because she did not respond to critically to the previous presenters.\n\nLuckily, the fellow grad students in this class had my back. They justified elements of my project and said that my topic does matter. We were going over class time so the professor just abruptly ended our discussion and quickly left the classroom. \n\nAnyway, if anyone else feels like they\u2019re not getting support on their dissertation or thesis topic, know you\u2019re not alone! Some profs are just haters and give feedback that is more destructive than constructive \u2014 it says a lot more about their own biases than the value of your work. Your work is valuable! We got this.",

Imagine what the world would look like if academia as a whole were this intellectually uncurious. I'm sure someone said something similar when people wanted to study mating behavior of mosquitos or some other tiny, specific, thing but they were too short sighted to see that studying mating behavior of mosquitos could provide insight into stopping the spread of malaria. During the AIDS epidemic, many people thought that AIDS shouldn't receive that much attention because it was a \"gay disease\". Fools with attitudes like your professor are not uncommon. \n\nStudying Asian American subcultures may not be fighting malaria, but these people exist and if they have been ignored in the academic literature it's not because they are not interesting or nothing valuable can be gained from studying them. There's also the fact that Asian Americans are one of, if not the, fastest growing minority group in the United States and some school districts have a disproportionate number of Asian students. So while the number of Asian Americans may be small compared to whites or Hispanics, they are hardly insignificant. \n\nI know nothing about Asian American studies, little about qualitative methods, and have only taken a few courses in sociology and I can still see how this type of research could be valuable. It's really sad that your professor couldn't, and it does not reflect well on them intellectually. \n\nOn a personal note, I read a paper about emojis and how people use emojis on the internet to express identity. It might seem like a stupid topic to intellectually lazy and uncurious people like your professor, but it was actually super helpful in some of my quantitative research working with social media data where people are not likely to blatantly say what their identities are. Being a researcher often involves creativity and openness to new ideas. If your professor can't see the value in that, then they really need to retire.",

Being this harsh in public takes away the opportunity for the student to learn anything because they largely get discouraged. Been through something similar, not with my own prof but some random faculty member. She only likes her own student's work... lol. Anyways, I brush off her comments and just think of it as white noise lol",
