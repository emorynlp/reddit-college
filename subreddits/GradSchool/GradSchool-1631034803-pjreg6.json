The conversations have been about the high expections, the stress, the detailed curriculum etc. I feel like I've been drifting away from my main group of friends of 10+ years because no one understands grad school. I never expected to experience these feelings when I started. \n\nI also am in a super small cohort, so a lot of the same people in all of my classes. It's also a top program, so all the students are very serious about their grades, their classes etc. I am surrounding myself with a different group of people than my group of friends. I am also part of a small research team, which obviously I have a lot in common with these people, because research is hard. Our group leader is now my mentor, and it's really rare to have one in social work. It's really hard to explain the complexities of social science research. \n\nI don't think of this as a bad thing. I love my friends but it's important to have goals, and my friends don't really have that feeling. They are perfectly happy not changing and living the same lives they have all lived since I've known them..\n\nAnyone else feel like they have changed, or drifted from friends while in grad school or after?", "author": "jenkneefur28", "created": 1631034803, "retrieved": 1632844722, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hc4iggl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjreg6/does_or_did_grad_school_change_you/hc4iggl/", "text": "Fuck yes.

I think, if I had gone to a psychiatrist, they probably would have said I had PTSD. I was in a financial strangle hold by a conniving demonic witch whose only goal was to kill me or allow me to continue to work for her if I could survive her lol. It was how she tested new employees and grad students. It took me a solid year of work outside academia to go back to something like my old self. My memory also went to shit over the years in academia spent balancing multiple simultaneous research projects I led, classes, part time jobs, job applications, on top of all the other stuff like pets, roommate problems, etc. I couldn\u2019t remember anything unless I wrote it down (so I wrote everything down). It took longer for my memory to come back\u2014probably about two years.
