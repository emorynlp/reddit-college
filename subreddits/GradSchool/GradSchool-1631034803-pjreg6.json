  "text": "I have been having lengthy conversations with some friends in academia (or have been). The conversations have been about the high expections, the stress, the detailed curriculum etc. I feel like I've been drifting away from my main group of friends of 10+ years because no one understands grad school. I never expected to experience these feelings when I started. \n\nI also am in a super small cohort, so a lot of the same people in all of my classes. It's also a top program, so all the students are very serious about their grades, their classes etc. I am surrounding myself with a different group of people than my group of friends. I am also part of a small research team, which obviously I have a lot in common with these people, because research is hard. Our group leader is now my mentor, and it's really rare to have one in social work. It's really hard to explain the complexities of social science research. \n\nI don't think of this as a bad thing. I love my friends but it's important to have goals, and my friends don't really have that feeling. They are perfectly happy not changing and living the same lives they have all lived since I've known them..\n\nAnyone else feel like they have changed, or drifted from friends while in grad school or after?",

      "text": "Mmmmm my masters\u2019s was pretty psychologically destructive, I suppose. I think, if I had gone to a psychiatrist, they probably would have said I had PTSD. I was in a financial strangle hold by a conniving demonic witch whose only goal was to kill me or allow me to continue to work for her if I could survive her lol. It was how she tested new employees and grad students. It took me a solid year of work outside academia to go back to something like my old self. My memory also went to shit over the years in academia spent balancing multiple simultaneous research projects I led, classes, part time jobs, job applications, on top of all the other stuff like pets, roommate problems, etc. I couldn\u2019t remember anything unless I wrote it down (so I wrote everything down). It took longer for my memory to come back\u2014probably about two years. Now I\u2019m back to my old self\u2026but somehow miss the learning and challenges of academia!",

          "text": "Oh geez, that really blows. That's awful, I can't imagine how that must have felt at the time. I mean grad school is so fucking expensive. Masters of social work right here and the full 2 head program is 80k. 80k to be a social worker?! Our training is years extensive if you do both BSW, MSW. 3 internships, that are time consuming (both undergrad and grad) There are much cheaper options but it's paying for the name, alumni status, and resources at this level of program. It's sad that you had such a stressful and negative experience that it caused you psychological and biological (yes?) Harm. It's dope that you're doing betfer",

Thank you very much for your support! :) In relation to your original post, I think that once you complete your degree(s) and get out of the academic environment (if you choose to do so), you might feel closer to your friends again. Once your focus shifts away from 60+ hour weeks all spent in the endeavor of acquiring and manufacturing knowledge, you will probably be more relatable. That is how it has been with my family. They couldn't so much relate to my academic experience (or my career now), but now that I work only 40 hours per week, I have hobbies and do activities that are relatable to them. Plus, if you have more time for your own hobbies and activities, you might be able to spend more time with your friends doing those activities. That's how it is with one of my unmotivated friends from undergrad and his friend group. They are just rolling along in their respective jobs but now we go on climbing/hiking/backpacking trips together because we can all take a few days off every now and then (whereas, in grad school, never lol).",

      "text": "Yes. I\u2019ve changed so much politically in particular that I no longer feel like I can be honest with my friends and haven\u2019t made many new ones. Add on to that the fact that I am currently fighting the desire to have a child (which is largely not the life stage my cohort is at) and it\u2019s really lonely. I just keep telling myself that it can\u2019t always be this way and hope for a time when my life is more cohesive",

      "text": "I recently started grad school and I'm already starting to feel exactly what you described! Now that I think of it maybe this feeling began to creep in during the application process itself. It's hard to relate to and connect with people/old friends, even when they have good intentions, who don't understand why would someone want to go to grad school, or your routine now that you're busy, or why studies are a priority for you, etc. I guess it's okay to let some of the friendships fade away with time and not blame oneself for it.",

          "text": "It's okay for friendships to fade, so it's just a fact of life. It's important to recognize this as positive, not negative. I'm allowing change to happen in my life. My long-term changes took a long time because I was an alcoholic who drank nightly and was always hungover at work.  Lots of therapy, and self-analysis finally lead me to go back to community college a few years ago. Graduating from a graduate program will provide me with an exciting future.  Three degrees in just under six years by the time I graduate in May 2022.",

I\u2019m still depressed and anxious, but I can recognize it and cope better.",
