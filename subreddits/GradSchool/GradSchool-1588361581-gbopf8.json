PhD is next on my list, but I'm waiting for my kid to get out of school here in the US since my dream programs are in Dublin.\n\nI definitely centered my studies on feminist criticism; my thesis was about witches and the male gaze. I loved it! I'm in the process of reformatting and editing it for publication (I have to trim it to under 8,000 words, ahhh!).\n\nWhat's your specialty, and what is your thesis about??? I have several ideas for a doctoral proposal. How did you narrow yours down, or did you follow an extension of your master's studies?",

Being an online student is hard AF - especially for people with ADHD like me.. \n\nI loved the program! It was exactly what I was looking for, e.g., asynchronous, short term length (10 weeks/term), intensely academic. Plus, I don't have UCLA or USC money, so affordability played a factor. It took me two and a half years going mostly part-time.\n\nWhat I got out of the program was definitely worth the time, effort, and money, imo!",
