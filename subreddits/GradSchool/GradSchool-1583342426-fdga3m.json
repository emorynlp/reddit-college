Thank you all for your encouragement. \n\n\nI left my husband after 6 yrs last week. We got married my first semester of grad school and this was supposed to be my last semester. The stress from the emotional abuse, moving, and basically raising a kid on my own for the past year has forced me to push back graduation to december.\n\n  I don't know how I feel honestly. Part of me is embarrassed I'm still in school, part of me is sad my marriage is over. The rest of me just wants to throw all my research into the wall and say fuck it.\n\nAnybody else deal with this?

Graduate school made salient issues I had been ignoring for years. He was threatened by my intellectual advancement. He never missed the chance to question my expertise (in my field, i'm not claiming expertise in literally anything else). In the past, I was the one with the disposable time and income and I spent most of both on him. When the tables were flipped (he moved into a career where he made almost 50% more than me, never worked nights or weekends) it wasn't the same. \n\nBeing surrounded by really smart people I jived with also meant that I started crystallizing why some of my core values were really important to me, and of course, it highlighted differences there too. \n\nI don't know if I would've been strong enough, or come to those same conclusions without grad school.

I didn't really realize why my friends always said they were so encouraged and inspired by me and my ability to manage a family and grad school until I finished.  You see, I came to grad school with one kid (added 2 more before I left) so grad school with kids is all I knew.  But it is orders of magnitude more difficult than without children.  I didn't realize that I never really got a break: I'd go to lab and destroy my brain working through stuff, then I'd come home and be a parent which, while not necessarily as intellectually challenging as grad school, was challenging in many other ways.  We'd ship the kids to bed and then my brain would immediately switch back to grad school.  \n\nIt took me 6 years plus a quarter.  I also felt a bit ashamed.  But then I realized that it doesn't matter.  What I accomplished is much more important than how long it took me to accomplish it.  (I also had to fight with our graduate division and basically told them to \"go pound sand\" whenever they asked me why I haven't graduated in normative time).\n\nAll this to say: I know, not the full burden you bear, but a significant burden.  And it's hard.  And as I got closer to completion the difficultly increased exponentially.  I don't know if it was imposter syndrome or what for me, but I have always seen -- and experienced -- this sharp rise in difficulty and while I don't know exactly what causes it (it's probably dependent upon the person), I know it's real.\n\nThe best advice I can say is: you can absolutely do this.  You made it this far, the only thing that is going to stop you from graduating is you.  And it doesn't sound like that is the case, so take a second -- or two -- and breath.  Take a weekend off (if you don't already take weekends off) and go somewhere and do something either by yourself or with you kid that you or both of you enjoy doing.\n\nRest.  This is like a hike through the mountains and it's ok to stop and rest for a second, to take in the view.  Celebrate the journey you've been on.  Look at where you started and where you are now.
