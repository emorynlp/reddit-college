  "text": "I'm now working on a plant science MS. This is my first research project in academia (not in life, I have 2 papers out already) but my last master's degree was done with a capstone that I pretty much managed myself so I barely talked to my advisor. But now I'm on a full scholarship and I'm working of a multi-lab grant. And I'm expected to have weekly meetings with my advisor, and biweekly meetings with the PI. Which I am doing. And I don't really bother anyone other than that. My first few months I was basically ignored anytime I had a question and so I learned to just manage on my own. But I swear every time we have these meetings people look at me like \"why are you telling me this?\" as if I'm wasting their time. Which is weird, because I don't dig into details unless they ask. I am fully on track and everything has been successful and gone as planned this far. It's such a strange interaction every time, and I'm not really sure this dynamic is typical. If these two went through the effort to write a huge grant and hired me to tackle two of the more difficult questions, wouldn't they want to know what is going on? And if they don't, then why not just have me shoot them an update email?\n\nI do not understand people in academia.",

      "text": "Yup academia is its own little bubble. Professors sometimes have a hard time realizing that's students aren't fully functional researchers and experts in the area of study. My advice is ask way too many questions, be enthusiastic and up-beat while doing so, and be annoying. The squeaky wheel gets the oil, my friend.",
