  "title:": "MS Informal Thesis Proposal Advice",
  "text": "My advisor wants me to write up an informal thesis proposal with a deadline of 2 weeks to present to them. I\u2019m brand new to my MS program (about two months in) and I wanted to get some advice from others who have completed this!\n\nMy specific questions are: is there a particular format to follow? Can you read out to your professors and PI for help on finding relevant articles? How long should I make the proposal? Any advice on literally anything is much appreciated!!",

      "text": "The way I did mine was:  \n\nIntroduction (why your topic is important, what\u2019s missing, how your project fills in some sort of gap or expands on others work)  \n\nBrief literature review (describe the system you are studying, what the current state of the field is like, what\u2019s currently known, etc. For your informal document you can probably keep this to a paragraph or 2.\n\nObjectives/research questions (I had this as a list of 3 main questions with a short paragraph explaining what it meant and why)  \n\nProposed research (if you don\u2019t fully know yet, that\u2019s fine; just describe the overall plan as to how you\u2019re going to tackle your research questions, and any methods/protocols you may plan on using)  \n\nConclusion (impact of research)  \n\nThis was the format of my official proposal, so it was about 6 pages, but for an informal one maybe do 2-3? I think it\u2019s a great chance to impress your advisor!\n\nFeel free to ask if you want me to expand on anything :) (or shoot me a pm if you want). Good luck!",

          "text": "Good advice!\n\nOne of the crucial skills researchers need to develop is identifying the important questions. That would be some thing to show off in this initial proposal. Since you are working with very limited information at this point, chances are your first conclusion will turn out to be wrong. But that is not a problem if it is logical based on a decent read of the literature and conversations with others in the lab group.",

And not in terms of \u201cto see how x affects y\u201d, but why studying x versus y even matters and how your question address the problem.",
