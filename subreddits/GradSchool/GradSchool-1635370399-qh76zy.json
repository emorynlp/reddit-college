      "text": "That doesn't seem too crazy for a research paper. I would recommend getting a good citation manager and also using an excel sheet to summarize and organize your references. I usually spend a lot of time gathering sources and recording important info in my excel, and then grouping them based on similar ideas and where I want to use them in my paper. Then I create a simple outline and keep going back to add to the outline. Then add transition sentences to the outline to make sure everything flows. Eventually the outline should be robust and you should have a list of which citations go where, and at that point you just string everything together and write it up. If it is too short, go back to finding references and add to what you have or create an additional section. If you break down the process into chunks it should be more manageable.",

      "text": "It depends on what discipline you are in and the requirements surrounding the paper. Generally speaking:  \n\n\n1. Pick your topic. Make sure it's something you are at least somewhat interested in so you can maintain focus later. It's not fun working long days on a topic you despise.\n2. Read some general texts on this subject. These will almost always be useful regardless of the direction you take later. Take note of the points, questions, or thoughts that interest you the most. This will guide you to your topic. \n3. Start looking for sources that address your topic more specifically. Input them into a citation manager as u/souperpun recommended. \n4. Something I do for my research, including for my current project, is to take a word document, put interesting quotes/thoughts down (with the citation from your manager with it). You can also use your citation manager, as most good ones will have a feature to add notes. Whatever you prefer. Either way, at this point, the idea is to get relevant points written down. This helps get ideas onto the page, and avoid the dreaded staring at a screen for 20 hours stage. \n   1. DO NOT FORGET THE CITATIONS! It is a pain in the butt to go back later to figure out where you got a quote or idea from. \n5. By this stage, I tend to have an idea of how I want to structure my paper and what argument(s) I will likely make. This is when I make an \"outline\" with headers, and start filling in each section. \n6. This is your main \"writing\" stage, although the process has been blurred with steps 4 and 5. Your goal here is to connect your scattered ideas.\n   1. If you come up with questions, thoughts, or even potential counterarguments to what you are writing? Take note of them and return to them in step 8.\n   2. This is where most writers start to pour lots of ideas out, since they already did the leg work of researching earlier. \n   3. DO NOT WORRY about it being perfect. The goal is to have a solid core.\n   4. Write consistently. Schedule time to write, and stick to it. Many people find that writing in shorter blocks of focused time more efficient than setting aside whole days.\n7. Once you have finished filling in your outline, including with transition sentences, introduction, and conclusion all finished? Walk away.\n   1. In most cases, you will have more written than you'll need.\n   2. If you come up short, you will address this in step 8.\n8. Return to read your paper and any notes you took along the way. Start editing.\n   1. Reading it aloud or having software read it back can help identify awkward sentence structure.\n   2. Make sure each paragraph is a complete idea.\n   3. While writing, ask yourself if your target audience can follow along if they were to read the paper without supplementary materials. If something is unclear or there is a phrase that a reader might challenge? Strengthen it.\n   4. Related to Point 8 section 3, make sure you are not missing any context or explanation. Just because it is obvious to you it doesn't mean it is to readers. Addressing cases of \"assumed knowledge\" will often add much needed, still relevant length. \n9. Repeat steps 6-8 until satisfied or you run out of time.  \n\n\nThis is just a very vague process that I use, and I do change it depending on the topic. For example, if it's tangential to something I am already intimately familiar with? I might start writing the highly specialized parts and then add information around it instead of starting with the general reading.",

Most people struggle with a research paper when they don't have enough to say because they haven't done enough research.\n\nOnce you have a lot of research, create an outline dividing it into topics that can be several pages. Use those topics as headings for the individual sections. Other than the introduction and conclusion, each section heading should be a claim, a statement about fragmented learning. And then treat each section like its own paper for the specific claim.\n\nAnd don't start with the introduction. That's just a way to get stuck. Start with one of the individual sections. Whichever is easiest. When you get stuck on one section move to another. Go back and forth until you have them roughed out pretty well.\n\nOnce you flesh out most of each section, then it'll be easier to write the introduction. And finally the conclusion.",

Just start searching for key terms in google scholar (or similar tool) and start keeping track of the major elements that show up. Follow citation trails from older foundational studies/theory to more recent studies. Identify a few key themes to focus on and spend time briefly writing about each study you find. \n\nFor example, \u201cIn a meta-analysis, Authors explored ThisConcept and found GeneralResults. Importantly, these findings suggest that BroaderTheme. Similarly, results of other studies have illustrated that Results, Results, and Results (cite).
