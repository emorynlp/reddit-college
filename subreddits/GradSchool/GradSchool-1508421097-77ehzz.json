My new blog \"Fuck It, I'm Not Cooking\" is dedicated to eating well, while depressed, and dead broke, literally without cooking for yourself.", "text": "So, I'm an undergrad myself, but I live with a few of y'all and being pretty fucking depressed myself, I totally get how insanely hard it is to eat properly. Between work, study, financial strain and mental illness, nobody can be fucked cooking a decent meal. Packet ramen and a bag of crisps counts as dinner, yeah? Yeah. Well, I made a blog dedicated to recipes that are equally or less difficult to make than packet ramen, and are a loooot healthier for you.\n\nAnyway, here's the link: https://missmedlandtaylor.com/fuckcooking/\n\nLet me know what you think, subscribing is super easy (sign up at the bottom of the page, and the recipes will literally be emailed to you) and I will gladly become more active in this sub if you need help/motivation/inspiration/somebody who gets the whole barely-functional-depression gig. I'm at rock fucking bottom over here, just trying to get better, and drag who I can up with me.\n\nCheers folks, much love.", "author": null, "created": 1508421097, "retrieved": 1632846346, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 308, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"dpz2l22": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/77ehzz/hey_all_i_was_pointed_in_this_subs_direction_from/dpz2l22/", "text": "Hello, I work in mental health, and this seems like a great resource for my clients.

I'll share one of my super quick and cheap meal while I'm here, black bean quesadillas.  Take a normal (15ish oz?) can of black beans, drain them mostly, but don't try too hard, you want just a little bean goo.  Add a drained small (8ish oz?) can of corn, a small chopped onion, and a bag (8ish oz) of shredded cheese.    Mix that together, if you're feeling ambitious, add a packet of taco seasoning.  Spoon about a quarter of that onto a dinner plate sized tortilla, top with another tortilla, and microwave til the cheese melts.", "author": "ThatTallGirl", "created": 1508459257, "upvotes": 14}, "dom0orn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/77ehzz/hey_all_i_was_pointed_in_this_subs_direction_from/dom0orn/", "text": "Love the idea!

Soylent is still ~~fine~~ terrific compared to chips, so whatever.)\n\n * Cans of beans that you just throw other spices into and warm up on stove\n\n * Frozen veggies straight to the frying pan with oil, low at first to defrost, then high to taste good.\n\nIf you want to get real fancy, you\u2019ll brown some hamburger on occasion and freeze it, then throw some in whatever.\n\n**Standard chili and veggies:**\n\n * can of black beans\n * some frozen browned hamburger (or not) to taste\n * cumin\n * dried peppers, whatever types you like\n * some garlic or shit, whatever dried spices you like. I tend towards a mexicanish blend of cumin, cilantro, maybe some other shit. For winter, go with a touch of sweetener of some sort, a touch of cinnamon, a touch of allspice, and fucking garlic.\n\nWhat about the veggies? You throw whatever frozen shit you can stomach just into the beans and hope you overshadow the flavor.\n\nYou throw everything into a pot on really low and watch a tv show. You then get a pad of some sort as a heat barrier, put that on your lap, and eat out of the pot for the second tv show. Congrats, it\u2019s now already bed time somehow.\n\nEmergency beans:\nBuy a spice blend of garlic, black pepper, red pepper, and salt. Pour some into bowl. Pour beans into bowl. Microwave mixture. Mix afterwards some more. Eat can of beans that tastes slightly better.", "author": "unampho", "created": 1508438305, "upvotes": 16}, "dolinvl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/77ehzz/hey_all_i_was_pointed_in_this_subs_direction_from/dolinvl/", "text": "Bookmarked!", "author": "natuxatu", "created": 1508435001, "upvotes": 4}, "doli497": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/77ehzz/hey_all_i_was_pointed_in_this_subs_direction_from/doli497/", "text": "Thanks for sharing!
