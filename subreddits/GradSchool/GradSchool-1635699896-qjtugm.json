  "text": "I am applying as an international student for master's in computer science at the United States. I am preparing my CV for the application and I have mentioned my academic and work experience.\n\nShould i mention my goal/objective in the CV mentioning why I wish to pursue the master's? Or is it sufficient if it is contained in the SOP?\n\nFurther is it fine if I just mention the title of a project/Internship? Since it is a major change, it seems to be irrelevant to an MS in CS for which i am applying to.",
