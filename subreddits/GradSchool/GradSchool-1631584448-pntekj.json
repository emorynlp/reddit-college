Looking for grad school advice", "text": "Am currently thinking about whether or not I want to apply to graduate school next year. Thinking of doing a STEM PhD in biomedical science/related areas. I graduated college in May 2020 and am currently working as a lab technician, and am thinking of applying Fall 2022 and therefore would matriculate Fall 2023. Would appreciate someone who is willing to message with me as I have a lot of questions, and am also just open to any general advice regarding why you decided to go, what you did to prepare, and how the application process goes.

Also, I always say this is something that you would do even if you didn't get paid for it sort of like the clergy. You are going to devote your life to this work, live this work, make it part of your life. A Ph.D. means that you \"live the philosophy of your subject.\" It will forever influence every decision you make in your life. A PhD more often doesn't make you an expert in your field right away but it teaches you the questions to ask to find the answers you want. If you would like I would message with you for some advice.", "author": "rthomas10", "created": 1631672340, "upvotes": 2}, "hcw2y24": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pntekj/should_i_or_shouldnt_i_looking_for_grad_school/hcw2y24/", "text": "Only do it if you really really love your work and are willing to give up a huge amount of your time to it. Like is your work your passion? Can your work also be your hobby? Is your work what defines you? You don't have to answer yes to all of these, and surely you can do it without these things... but you probably won't enjoy it and it may not be worth it.\n\nOr maybe I'm just a sad grad student having a bad time idk.", "author": "FreezerDust", "created": 1631665923, "upvotes": 3}}}
