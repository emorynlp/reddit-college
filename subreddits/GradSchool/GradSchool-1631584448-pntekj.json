  "text": "Am currently thinking about whether or not I want to apply to graduate school next year. Thinking of doing a STEM PhD in biomedical science/related areas. I graduated college in May 2020 and am currently working as a lab technician, and am thinking of applying Fall 2022 and therefore would matriculate Fall 2023. Would appreciate someone who is willing to message with me as I have a lot of questions, and am also just open to any general advice regarding why you decided to go, what you did to prepare, and how the application process goes. Thank you in advance!",

      "text": "Get a PhD in a science if you love that science and are willing to give 5 years training and the rest of your life to the advancement of that science. Also, I always say this is something that you would do even if you didn't get paid for it sort of like the clergy. You are going to devote your life to this work, live this work, make it part of your life. A Ph.D. means that you \"live the philosophy of your subject.\" It will forever influence every decision you make in your life. A PhD more often doesn't make you an expert in your field right away but it teaches you the questions to ask to find the answers you want. If you would like I would message with you for some advice.",

Is your work what defines you? You don't have to answer yes to all of these, and surely you can do it without these things... but you probably won't enjoy it and it may not be worth it.\n\nOr maybe I'm just a sad grad student having a bad time idk.",

              "text": "Thanks! Frankly a lot of my bad time is due to extenuating circumstance. STEM gradschool isn't the most forgiving if you have a personal tragedy. My dad passed away a year ago in a random car crash and I still haven't really recovered. That coupled with having very little actual connection with my advisor has been hard. Like my advisor isn't a bad guy, we just don't click at all. I don't think he has laughed at a single joke I've ever made. So that would be another peice of advice. Pick an advisor that you feel like understands you as a person. Someone you could get a beer with.",

I know graduate school is mentally taxing without the additional personal issues so I cannot imagine trying to be productive and perform well academically while carrying that grief with you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is a piece of advice I have often heard, and have even been recommended to choose a lab based more off the \"vibes\" (for lack of a better word) from the PI/advisor rather than the topic. Ideally a combination of both, but the worst stories I have heard have been because of bad PIs.",
