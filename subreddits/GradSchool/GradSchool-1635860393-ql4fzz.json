  "text": "hi! long time lurker here!\n\nI have just started my master's and I feel really inadequate. My CV is completely bare, and competing against other students with so much experience under their belt is scary. I am getting rejected from opportunities already and I don't even know what will happen when I have stopped studying and looking for a job. feels l am leagues behind everyone else...\n\nI want to get opportunities and work and get experience but I can't get any opportunities because I have no experience lol\n\nAny advice for this? feeling very stuck",

Those are still important factors. Include info about your classes and any skills you have related to your degree. Then, start applying for conferences, get involved with national organizations that pertain to your field. Start a chapter of one of them on your campus! Conferences are great too, and you can basically recycle abstracts which is nice",
