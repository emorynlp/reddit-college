  "text": "Hi! I am finishing my last semester of my masters in neuroscience. What are the best sites to use to find research positions? I\u2019ve been using LinkedIn and indeed. Also to prepare for job applications I have written a statement of purpose. Anything else that you all can recommend? I would really love to relocate to another state and have a somewhat decent salary. \nTIA!",
