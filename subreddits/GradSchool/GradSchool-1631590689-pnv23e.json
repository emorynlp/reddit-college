My PI seems like she doesn't care about me or anything I do, she only talks to me when she needs data. I'm a masters student with hardly any prior experience, and she randomly expects me to know things and relies on me for data for her grants - I ended up working 18 hours a day for two weeks the last time she did this, to learn new techniques and get her the data she asked for. She did not ask how long I worked or if I had trouble with the experiments, knowing that I had NEVER done this before.Today, she came into lab and asked me if I had any presentations coming up, and I thought she was asking about my classes, so I said \"yes, I have a few for these classes x,y...\" and she laughed at my face and said \"Oh no, I don't care about your classes, I was asking if you had any lab-related presentations in your program\".I know she is not a mean person, but it just feels like she doesn't care about me and how I am doing. I also wonder if I am overreacting. Are \"good\" PIs more involved/do they ask about your well being outside of the lab? I like my PI, but definitely do not feel very supported at the moment.", "author": "haemo_goblin7", "created": 1631590689, "retrieved": 1632952628, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"hct17le": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnv23e/how_involved_is_a_typical_pi/hct17le/", "text": "Depends...

Some will push their students to highly specific tasks, others will simply check in. \n\nI find that good profs do generally care about their students well being. This doesn't mean they won't test you or push sometimes, but they will try to see you through your degree. \n\nIt may help to set up regular meetings (I.e. Weekly, biweekly) with your PI, that will help both you and her stay on the same page.", "author": "Dismal-Wallaby-2", "created": 1631597335, "upvotes": 3}, "hcsbrvg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnv23e/how_involved_is_a_typical_pi/hcsbrvg/", "text": "The answer is \"it depends\".\n\nThere's no \"average PI\".  Everyone is different.  Each professor is just trying to do what they can to keep their jobs.  If they have the bandwidth for handling students then they'll do that.  It seems like your advisor doesn't.  There are professors who are more involved in their students.  There are professors who don't dedicate as much time to their students and rather see them as a resource to use up. There are professors who know the technical details inside-and-out, there are other professors who are just really good at bringing in the funding and doing engagements but have a \"general\" understanding of the actual science.\n\nIt sounds like a difficult situation you're in...  It's probably a good idea to communicate with your PI about your concern.  PIs are also just people, they'll assume everything's fine unless you give feedback related to what you need as well.  Talk with your fellow graduate students as well to get a feel for the water.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1631596549, "upvotes": 7}}}
