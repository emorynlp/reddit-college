  "title:": "Looking for someone who finished undegrad 5+ years ago to interview for college assignment",
  "text": "Hi everyone, not sure if this is the best place to ask but I figured some of you guys have finished undergrad 5+ years ago.\n\nI'm a freshman in college right now and for one of my seminar classes, we have to find someone who finished undergraduate studies 5+ years ago to interview and write an essay about for an assignment.The questions/topics are very basic, such as me asking you to reflect on your undergraduate experience (academic choices, time management), things you would do differently, etc.\n\nTo keep it simple and convenient, I can just message you questions and you can answer. I may also be following up with your responses to dig a little deeper so that I can complete my reflection essay better. Also, I will need to know your name for this assignment, current position, and just a bit of surface level background. I can provide proof of this assignment and all of the questions I'd be asking if you are feeling skeptical at all.\n\nI need to turn this assignment in by Friday, December 3rd at 11:59pm so please message me before then if you are willing to help out! It shouldn't take too much time (depending on how much you spend responding to my questions). Thanks guys!",
