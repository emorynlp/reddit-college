The main issues are that the lab has a culture of overworking (consistently would see people in the lab very late at night) and multiple people come in on the weekends as well, which has been exacerbated by COVID. As a result, I have been pushing myself to the max, and it has gotten to the point where my mental health is really suffering, I have loads of things to do but not enough time to do it in, and am literally constantly stressed, am skipping meals to work consistently and recently have had panic-attack like episodes. I have never wanted to go into academia, always industry, but my experiences have suggested to me that I probably wouldn\u2019t even want to go into industry (although the hours are much better supposedly). I am not sure what sector I would go in, but I feel at the very least that this job is not for me. I also struggle to integrate with the lab due to COVID time restraints, my own stress on work and social anxiety. I am waiting for CBT therapy, but am seriously thinking of quitting now and finding a job. The supervisors and lab members are really nice, and the project is appealing on a high level, but I struggle with the day-to-day. It doesn\u2019t help that none of my experiments have worked\u2026 Should I quit?", "author": "MELCHIZIDEK2410", "created": 1632656747, "retrieved": 1632843966, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hecn77t": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvsa00/should_i_quit_my_phd_in_the_uk/hecn77t/", "text": "Grad school is a grind. what you are describing about work hours is pretty normal in my opinion however what you don't see is the SAME people there all the time. Try coming in at different times when others aren't there. I used to start at 5 am because all other grad students came in at 9 am. This gave me a full 4 hours or so of instruments to my self! We had one guy that came in at 1 am for 4 years because no one was there at that time. That being said there are times when you must do late hours like when the instruments are reserved by older grads with more seniority than you. Yes grad scientists work on the weekends as well at least 1 day out of the weekends for me when I was in. \n\nGrad school is not meant to be a cake walk. you are given a research project to do, are you making progress, what is the progress you are supposed to make. I don't know what CBT therapy is but don't quit until you get it. \n\nReading your post I don't see anything different between my grad years and yours regarding workload.", "author": "rthomas10", "created": 1632667062, "upvotes": 0}, "hec6scn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvsa00/should_i_quit_my_phd_in_the_uk/hec6scn/", "text": "Instead of quitting now how about doing things at your pace?
