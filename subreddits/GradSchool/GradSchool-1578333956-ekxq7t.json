  "title:": "Just found out that my advisor died",
  "text": "I'm in my fifth year of my PhD (engineering) and I learned last night that my advisor has passed away. This isn't a complete shock: he was 75 and fairly frail, and just last week he asked the first-year in our group to move to another professor on account of his health, but I certainly didn't think it would be so sudden. It's still hard to process losing someone I've worked with but honestly I'm not that emotionally struck: he was a difficult advisor to work under and hard for any of us in our small group to call a mentor or someone we had a personal relationship with. But he was dedicated to his research with no plans to retire and certainly wanted us to succeed.\n\nI'm really afraid about what comes next: He wrote to me a month ago that I could graduate at the end of the summer, with a couple ideas on organizing a thesis (no papers yet), but even then I felt that was too soon since laboratory research progress has been very slow (and I'm actually only three years into it after switching advisors from a project I hated). Without my professor, I'm not sure I see a path forward with this project: it felt like a dead end that I can't write a full dissertation on at this point. To complicate things my home department (he was in another) had said they can no longer offer me TA positions after next quarter since they only guarantee five years of funding. If I can't join another PI's group and do a new abbreviated project I kind of want to just start looking for an industry job, but that's half a decade down the drain.\n\nThanks for reading, any advice would be appreciated.",

      "text": "I agree that you should tell the committee that you're graduating in the fall, having a job to start at that time definitely helps pressure them. Also, get your ducks in a row now! Look for all of your written communication with your professor that backs up what you want. Also, your uni should have a set of rules for PhD students. Read them, so that if the department tries to pull something (like forcing you to look for a new advisor yourself, or pushing you out of the uni), you'll know if they are even allowed to do that. And don't give the people you need things from at the uni much time to figure things out/mourn/whatever. If you aren't pushing for what you need, you'll get nothing, and if you aren't a problem, you'll get forgotten.\nThis happened to me in May (except my advisor's death was completely unexpected), and I'm still fighting the university about staying and finishing. I was in a two professor department, and the one left doesn't want me. The uni would love if I just vanished, but I'm still trying to force them to abide by their own rules eight months later. \nGood luck! Do not let anyone make you start over!!",

      "text": "I'm so sorry to hear this. I've unfortunately dealt with this situation - my advisor died unexpectedly a little over a year ago.  I admired my advisor and losing him was a huge setback both research wise and just overall.  Even as a well seasoned PhD student, you still rely on this person for funding/stability and final feedback.  I'm sure this uncertainty and unknown as a result of his passing is incredibly stressful and anxiety-invoking.\n\nI'm not an engineer, so I can't give a lot of help on career advice and I'll let others help there.  I can give advice on grieving.  Even though you weren't close with your advisor, death and grief are weird.  As simple as it sounds, I want to encourage you to take care yourself.  Your sense of 'normal' is gone and it's a huge shock and a lot to process.  I'll admit it took me about 6 months to feel like things were 'normal' again, but a new normal.  Give yourself time if you needed it.  It may be nice to take a few steps back and allow the dust to settle before you make any decisions.  I hope you have someone in your department or lab group who you can talk to if needed, both about your next steps but also about your advisor's passing and grief.  \n\nWe're in a small club, so feel free to message me if needed.  I wish you all the best!",

I don't have any outside advice other than it sounds like you're close and have some good ideas for a thesis project so it might be worth giving it a month or two more to let the dust settle before making a big decision.",

Their job is to help people navigate the paperwork, policies, and weird bureaucratic university stuff for some of the less common situations in academia. Sounds like you are in one of those situations. \nDefinitely check if once of your committee members might be willing to pick you up as a student so you can wrap up your current project. Even though your mentor has passed, his grant funding may still be available to support the project, so you could also do some digging to find out if that is the case.",

Tell (dont ask) your program that you are graduating at the end of summer and starting an industry job (an offer letter will help your case) and you need to schedule your defense. Get your committee on board, write up your project, leave, and never look back.",

You may not have to change your project at all, depending on how this faculty member wants to help you graduate. \n\n\nBest case scenario: a friendly professor from the department becomes your angel / advisor and helps you complete your research, write your thesis, graduate, and acts as your reference as you find a job.\n\n\nYou may have to advocate for yourself to get this to happen, to find a prof who will let you build on what you already did rather than start all over again.

Set up what safety net you can but proceed as though you can absolutely walk the tightrope. You might find you make it across the gap just fine.",

      "text": "Damn, that's very unfortunate.  Hopefully your school will be able to give you (and your cohorts) some leeway as you transition to the next phase of your career their (even if it is short).  I would not give up on your PhD (as I'm sure everyone else will agree with) and would definitely start talking, face-to-face, with anyone at the school with any authority who is willing to listen.\n\nOne thing I've found is that everyone and their grandma at a university will stick very closely to the policy regardless of the situation.  Typically, this doesn't work in favor of the student, but in this case you're not really bounded by concrete policy since this situation is likely not accounted for by the school.  I'd definitely ask around to see if anyone else has dealt with a similar situation (possibly a PI leaving or getting fired) to how their students had to dealt with it, but odds are this is somewhat unprecedented.  If so, then you just need to speak with someone high enough up whose willing to listen.  At the end of the day, things like funding and placements is determined by people, you just gotta figure out who and appeal to their humanity rather than policy.\n\nAnd sorry for your loss.  Even if your relationship was purely professional, someone you know and see on a regular basis dying is not a pleasant experience.  It can be depressing and discouraging, but don't let it keep you from graduating.  If it matters, I'm sure your PI would have wanted you to continue on and graduate with as little hiccups as possible.",

Career paths with masters and PhD are completely different. I went through three labs during my six years, yet I have three publications with three in the pipeline. But those publications all came in the last two years. \n\nYou are so much closer than you know to feeling like a scientist, I promise you. Start thinking of the opportunity you provide to a committee member: you\u2019re probably on the cusp of multiple publications with a little tweaking. They get in those, plus graduate a student, for a semester of funding? That\u2019s a great deal.\n\nYou can always work your way through at a PhD industry job, but a master\u2019s is just so much lost time for someone that sounds like they are close.
