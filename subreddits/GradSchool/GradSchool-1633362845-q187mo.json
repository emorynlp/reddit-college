  "text": "In all other aspects of life, I am highly extroverted and have no social anxiety. Throw me into a zoom meeting with my cohort and two professors and I become mush for brains, unable to coherently speak. It\u2019s so bothersome because I know I\u2019m meant to be there and I know I\u2019m fully capable of contributing to the discussion. But\u2026. I just can\u2019t. My body won\u2019t let me. My mind goes blank. My heart nears 200 bpm. My lips tremble. My mouth goes dry. My body starts to shake. I start to panic. And only one thing crosses my mind: Escape now!\n\nThen, although I know I\u2019m meant to be in this program, I feel like others see me as an imposter. It\u2019s like projected imposter syndrome. I feel in the right place, but don\u2019t think others believe I am. \n\nIm just so fucking terrified to say something stupid and give them any evidence that I\u2019m not in the right place. \n\nIt\u2019s a catch-22. Don\u2019t participate and that looks bad. Participate, during a state of panic and blankness of mind, and, as a result, say something stupid\u2026 also looks bad. \n\nWhat on earth do I do here? I really do want to shine and be an essential contributor in my cohort.",

Hopefully classes will be back in person in the near future because its so hard to be an feel successful via Zoom.

I would reach out to your school for resources re: counseling (you don't have to be completely broken to seek out coping tips/tricks) and as a \"right now\" fix, have you tried hiding your own image so you can't see yourself? That has helped me immensely.",

I'm one of those people, I tried doing graduate seminar classes over Zoom last year briefly, I suffered through all the same things you've described here, and I had to seek a deferral for a year because it was just horrible for my mental state to keep trying to do something I used to love in this awful, inhuman state.\n\nI'm not you, I don't know how much it matters to you to succeed in in this situation at this exact moment, but I don't think you can ever actually replicate the spontaneity of human connection over Zoom classes like this. It may be worth trying to take a semester or a year off and hope things have calmed down by then until you can take in-person classes. It's not worth suffering through if you're not getting anything out of it.",

      "text": "I have found on days when my anxiety is high, typing my thoughts/answers into my notes helps. I typically just use keywords or phrases in outline form. It gives me a scaffolding and provides me with a sense of security that I can refer to while I am speaking. Also, I split my screen so Zoom is on the right half of the screen and my notes are on the left half of my screen, that way it appears that I\u2019m looking in the general direction of the camera even if I\u2019m referring to my notes. On worse days, I just completely dissociate, pretend I\u2019m someone who knows what the hell they\u2019re talking about, and throw myself on the flames of criticism (just kidding - sort of haha)",

Or could you write/type out your thoughts and try to focus on reading them aloud? \n\nI second other commenters that you should see what kind of mental health resources your campus offers and consider pursuing some counseling if that is available for you. If it's low cost and available, might as well use it!\n\nLastly, I have a similar issue that I was dealing with both in person and on zoom meetings. My doctor recommended I stop drinking caffeine and that actually helped immensely with the heart racing feeling in particular. This was not fun (obvi we are all caffeine dependent), but has been a total game changer for me.",

      "text": "If you really feel you are in the right place, what others think shouldn't matter. I am a TA and I have been both teaching and taking courses in Zoom for a year and a half now. It's next to impossible to judge a student's performance in a Zoom class. As a teacher, you cannot tell if or why a student is paying attention or not. It might be that they are distracted by the neighbour's dog barking, they might find that being in front of a screen for so long makes their head ache, there are a million reasons. For example, as a student, I find that I cannot focus for a long time in front of the screen, I start to feel very drowsy, regardless of how much I've slept or the time of day. So I have to study the class recordings at a later time and use the speed mode or else my mind wanders. This is why we, as teachers, do not require students to turn their camera or their mic on. We give them the benefit of the doubt, because it's impossible to tell what they are going through where they are. Not many people were used to online learning before the pandemics, so we try not to be too hard on the students or even on ourselves. You should do the same.",

      "text": "Firstly, I acknowledge how much of an issue zoom/ online participation can be, even as someone who greatly benefits from them. \n\nI would suggest you write to your supervisors and let them know that you are facing an unexpectedly strong wave of anxiety during zoom sessions and that you will be trying to get help. Ask if in the meanwhile, they would be happy for you to interact via the chat feature?\n\nAnd then, please do reach out and get help. These are strange learning environments but that does not mean you have to necessarily somehow get around to it. Think of it this way: if you had severe anxiety talking in front of people (in-person), you would have got help. Reach out for help and it is good that you reached out to this community on reddit. \n\nWish you all the best :)",

I have some classmates that don't say much in Zoom, or even in in-person classes, but have really insightful discussion questions that show they are engaged and helped me better understand them. \n\nAs a suggestion for Zoom, and this may only help once you've found other strategies that help with the anxiety, you could prepare some discussion points ahead of time that you could either throw into the chat or bring up in discussion. Having them planned out before the class starts could help you to have something you know is coherent to say/type and make it clear that you have insightful things to say, even if finding them in the moment on Zoom is a nightmare.",
