  "title:": "looking for a topic for my final thesis (Health Technologies or Emergency Care)",
  "text": "i spontaneously received a free place for my master's thesis at my university (after 7 months of waiting due to corona). \n\nThe two areas in which I can freely propose a topic are Health Technologies and Emergency Care. i'm looking for a topic that is exciting and up-to-date on the one hand, but on the other hand it's important to me that i find enough papers on it. i have to hand in at least 90 pages of text at my university. i would also like to hand in a pure research paper and nothing practical.\n\ni'm asking here for inspiration because i'm not personally interested in the field, but in my desired faculty, no more topics will be assigned in the next few months. i'm through with my exams and have already accepted a job offer. so i have to get the master's thesis over with somehow in order to finish my studies.",

Besides, I don't really have an alternative as the rooms in my department (electrical engineering) are fully booked until January and no one knows if there will be another lockdown",
