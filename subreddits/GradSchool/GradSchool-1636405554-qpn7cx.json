  "text": "Maybe a better question for another subreddit, but I do this the most in school. I took my comp exam yesterday - it was a written format. You need effectively a 70% to pass. I answered 8 essay questions. Three of them I am confident I got full marks for, three of them I am confident I got most of the marks for, and two of them I understood well enough but am not sure if I conveyed my knowledge properly. One of them I blatantly forgot one of the terminologies for a subpoint and just wrote about it.\n\nSo I'm a month away from graduation in I/O psychology. I have one class, and that class has a term paper. I'm very close to being done, and I did all this both for a career shift and to begin making a living wage. But I keep playing worst-case scenarios in my head. I keep scoring myself and hoping I get the 70% bare minimum so I can leave. I'm about 90% confident I passed, but that last 10% won't be quiet. Because if I fail this exam, I'm going to be set back even further, so I'm terrified.\n\nMaybe I should have asked this much sooner in my academic career, but how do you all put these thoughts away? I've gone for a walk, played some video games, socialized, cooked... but I can't stop being a defeatist. Thanks for any advice.",

      "text": "IME that persistent worry is a form of self-criticism that's trying to keep me safe by pushing me away from certain behaviors (i.e. careless errors, poor preparation, etc.), but that critical voice is more harmful than helpful in the end because it just makes me depressed. I found and use resources about self-compassion, which focuses on becoming aware of when those critiques come up, normalizing the emotional experience that results from those thoughts, and then intentionally choosing kinder and more supportive thoughts for myself (which can definitely be  hard when the internal critiques are very ingrained or prominent in the moment). In short, it's a process of actively examining and replacing internal critiques rather than ignoring or distracting myself from them.",
