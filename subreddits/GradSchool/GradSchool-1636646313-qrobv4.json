      "text": "School ranking means squat next to the work you're going to do. Doing good work at a middle-ranked school will open more doors than mediocre work at a high ranked school.\n\nThe only exceptions to this rule are when talking about truly \"big name\" schools, IE MIT, Harvard, Yale, etc, where \"omg you went to (school)!?\" still has an effect. But even that is debatable, and only a very small number of people can even go that route so it's not even worth considering unless it's already an option.\n\ntl;dr - If you like the place, the prof, and the work don't let something silly like ranking steer you away.",
