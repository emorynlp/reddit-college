  "title:": "Chances of getting into a Psy.D program with low GPA?",
  "text": "I apologize if this is the wrong sub to ask this question. I graduated a few months ago with a double major in psychology and human biology with a concentration in pre-medicine. Although I loved learning about the human brain/neuroscience aspect of my bio major, I absolutely hated everything else about biology. I was already so far deep into it that I decided to get the second major and call it a day. I love psychology and the brain and knew I wanted to head towards that path instead. Towards the end of my college career, my best friend got diagnosed with brain cancer and it left me with depression and extreme health anxiety. I was deathly afraid and hyper-focused with every cell in my body, thinking that I had every disease in the book and that I could die any second. This took a huge hit on my GPA where it dropped significantly. I hated watching my friend having to go through what she did. After her major surgery, I was in charge of taking her to all her appointments; physical, occupational, and speech. It was so fun just the two of us and taking life slowly. Being with her and watching her improve was really special and therapeutic for me. I've learned to fall in love with the complexity and fragility of the brain, and the behavioral outcomes that stem from it and knew I wanted to do something in the field.\n\nMy overall GPA dropped to a 2.8, and a 3.1 in psychology. After graduation, I went to work at one of the best hospitals and research facilities in the neurology department (I am still working there). I have done a few poster presentations and publications. I am just unsure if my chances of getting in are close to none or if there is hope?",

      "text": "I think you should maybe look into masters programs to show that you can do well in classes. I would be \\*extremely\\* leery of PsyD programs because many of them prey on students with profiles like yours i.e. weaker than would have a shot at a Clinical Psych PhD. They can have very low match rates into APA accredited sites and so you'll end up with a useless doctorate (in a lot of states) and owe a mountain of debt. PsyD might be your only option but be extremely extremely careful about which one you go to. I have a close friend in one that is \"reputable\" and they're borderline Full Sail/University of Phoenix in their business model. The clinical psych subreddit can probably help you a lot better.",

          "text": "Absolutely stay away from \"Professional\" schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I certainly have a bias towards Clinical Psych PhD's because I am in one, out in the clinical world, many of practicum supervisors and directors I have seen do have PsyD's, many of them coming from a program that admits over 50 students a year (which is quite a lot). Not sure how much they get paid; folks in more prestigious positions definitely worked hard after school to get there, and didn't stay stagnant at one job. Unfortunately they all noted having quite a lot of debt that they have shouldered for years. Some students didn't do well in the program and have crumbled, while others, I have seen, were always quite bright and did well with the degree. What I recommend, is looking into the types of jobs you would want to have in the city you would like to live in. See where that person went to school and their credentials. Look into common schools  and their student practicum sites and ensure you would get a broad range of clinical experiences and good training. Ask around! \n\nYou could take the Master's route now, but you could also apply to a few PsyD's as a Litmus test if you're willing to cough up some money. Might be a good experience, and give you a better sense of the process, even if you don't end up getting admitted this year.",

              "text": "Some of the PsyDs are excellent and their clinical skills are far and above PhDs but a sizable proportion are awful and have no place in the clinic. Lots of unresolved personal issues they are using the PsyD to address; narcissism is a pretty common one. A few were sleeping with patients. Match rates are also very inflated and the costs are outrageous given that students are pretty much working in the clinic and paying for the \u201copportunity\u201d. Good for students without other alternatives but the reasons for not having alternatives runs the gamut from understandable to terrible.",

      "text": "I agree with the other commenter. Consider a Master\u2019s to get that GPA up. PsyD programs can be a good option, IF you can find a really great one (ie\u2014fully funded). The problem is that those programs are as competitive as a PhD.\n\nI\u2019m in a high quality PsyD right now\u2014fully funded at a state university. Admissions was extremely competitive, and my cohort\u2019s mean GPA upon admission was ~3.8, I believe. I do think you have a compelling story to include in your SOP, but they\u2019re likely going to want to see more evidence that you can hack it. \n\nThere\u2019s a real misconception that a PsyD is easier or more clinically focused\u2014that may be the case with many diploma mill programs. But a good program is structured almost identically to a PhD. I still spend 15-20 hours a week conducting research of my own and my faculty mentor\u2019s. I have to present at conferences and work as a TA. The course load and expectations are just as outrageous as my friends\u2019 in PhDs. \n\nThe real difference in my program is that we have a more social justice oriented training lens where we\u2019re expected to question everything and get involved in making psych services more accessible to vulnerable populations. I also have personally had access to some awesome clinical training opportunities, but those were through my faculty mentor and not part of the curriculum. I co-facilitate a weekly therapy group for undergrads with ADHD that he runs, and I\u2019ve been able to do some short term therapy work under supervision as well.\n\nWe all also have to put in a year of clinical work at the community psych clinic conducting assessments and providing therapy for folks in need of low cost care, although that\u2019s likely not unique compared to PhD programs that also have a training clinic like that. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, a PhD and a good PsyD are going to look almost identical. I wouldn\u2019t write off either one at this point. But a Master\u2019s may have a slightly lower barrier to entry and offer an opportunity to improve your GPA and develop your professional identity further.",
