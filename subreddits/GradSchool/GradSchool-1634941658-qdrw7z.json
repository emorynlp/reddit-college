  "title:": "How many journalism grad programs should I apply to?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve already read a ton online about how going to grad school for journalism is a waste of time and money because those programs are rarely funded, are usually catering towards academics and it\u2019s better to just get experience in the field.\n\nI\u2019m nervous about finding a job so I just decided to go to grad school. And yet I shudder at the thought of more school \n\u2014I\u2019ve been burnt out academically since the beginning of my junior year, and I\u2019m now a senior. I\u2019ve heard people say not to go to grad school if you\u2019re unsure because it\u2019s a commitment.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m figuring I\u2019ll apply to a few schools and just see what happens. If I get in AND get good funding, great. I\u2019ll go because it\u2019ll be a good opportunity. If I don\u2019t, that sucks, I have to actually get into the real world now, but at least I\u2019m free of school. \n\nSo how many schools should I be applying to? I feel behind. I rush researched programs this summer. It\u2019s practically November and I haven\u2019t really started on my statement of purpose essays. My deadlines are January 1 and February 1.  I don\u2019t have time for applications outside of class, studying, work and my senior thesis project. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of applying to Boston University, Syracuse, University of Missouri Columbia and University of Maryland. But is that too many? They all have funding opportunities, although competitive.\n\nAny advice?",

      "text": "Don't do it. If you want to work in the industry it is literally better for you to go after an unpaid internship versus a grad school you have to take out loans to go to and that will only make you marginally more hireable. Unless you want to study journalism from an academic perspective (which let's be honest is not a big job market) don't do it.",
