  "text": "Hello! \n\nCurrently applying for MA and PhD programs, a professor from one of the MA programs and a professor from one of the PhD programs are both interested in having me lead my own preliminary projects prior to even getting accepted (idk how I feel about this but it seems like good experience). It doesn\u2019t feel like too much work added onto my full-time and part-time jobs. But I\u2019d feel bad if I start work with the MA professor and get into a PhD program. Should I worry about this? Has anyone been through something similar?  Any advise would be great! Thanks y\u2019all!",
