My own defense was similar.  I pushed very hard to get my dissertation finished and distributed, then worked very hard to put my oral-defense slides together.  The actual defense was an anticlimax -- in retrospect, it was just like giving any other seminar.  Everything went fine, and toward the end one of the committee members said \"Okay, let's wrap this up\" and they started firing *really hard* questions.  It was pretty clear that they were pushing to make sure I was willing to say \"I don't know\" when I got to stuff I didn't know.\n\nAfterward, I just felt ... empty and dazed.  That afternoon, a lady friend took me under her wing and we went and watched \"88 shorts about Glenn Gould\" in the theater.  It has excellent music and basically no plot, and was therefore exactly right for the moment.  \n\nThere were two kinds of disorientation: one was the relief from the constant pressure of knowing I had to get to a deadline, and the other was the total, utter anticlimax of finishing.  Somehow I thought that when I finished, I'd become rapidly enlightened somehow.  I dunno -- maybe they'd open my head up and pour in the Light Fantastic.  But that pouring operation is more of a trickle and takes 4-6 years to finish up.  The defense is just to check that you're sane and assimilated everything -- like kicking the tires of a car in the lot.

Just to give folks some variety, mine went quite differently.\n\nMy external examiner was a real dick in my defense. My defense took four hours because so much of his time was spent attacking my framework and research from his own paradigm, which is different than mine (fat story thin, I'm critical of certain mainstream assumptions in my discipline, and the relevance of his own work relies on them, which I didn't know before accepting the suggestion that he act in that role). He had some good points, but his \"questions\" were mostly him mindlessly ranting about how I didn't read X, Y, or Z, or how I'm mischaracterizing the literature because these three authors out of dozens have this particular view, etc. Just anything to cling onto, *anything*, that invalidates my paradigm. Then, I assume it took an hour for my committee to get him down from whatever fucking planet he was operating from so that my revisions were reasonable, and not just a mishmash of \"I didn't like the way you did this.\"\n\nIn the end, it was fine, and it ended like any other defense ends. This guy stressed me out (because he sent his hypercritical and inappropriately-toned report three days prior to my defense) and stressed out my advisor and committee, and did not make any friends during that process. In fact, this guy seriously harmed his image in front of his disciplinary peers at another institution. I doubt he'll be doing any examinations at my institution anytime soon.\n\nLesson here? *Read your potential external's work.* I had this dude because someone on my committee, whom I trusted, suggested him. My fault for not investigating further. Even if you get a recommendation, and it sounds good, always, *always* look at the assumptions in their work if you're in the social sciences or humanities.
