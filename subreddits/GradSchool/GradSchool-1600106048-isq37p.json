  "text": "I successfully defended last Friday! My Q and A literally opened with them telling me congratulations, and then me getting questions on how my research could be implemented in their projects. Then my advisor ended the defense by saying that they'd \"confer\" and I could call him later or just hear the results on the group meeting in five minutes. I logged on and he told everyone to wish Dr. Anointed congrats. It was super odd and anticlimactic. I then spent the rest of the week in a haze. Thought you all may appreciate a different perspective from the defense horror stories.",

      "text": "Congratulations on finishing up!\n\n\u03a5our story contains a great insight, and describes the ideal outcome of a thesis defense.  My own defense was similar.  I pushed very hard to get my dissertation finished and distributed, then worked very hard to put my oral-defense slides together.  The actual defense was an anticlimax -- in retrospect, it was just like giving any other seminar.  Everything went fine, and toward the end one of the committee members said \"Okay, let's wrap this up\" and they started firing *really hard* questions.  It was pretty clear that they were pushing to make sure I was willing to say \"I don't know\" when I got to stuff I didn't know.\n\nAfterward, I just felt ... empty and dazed.  That afternoon, a lady friend took me under her wing and we went and watched \"88 shorts about Glenn Gould\" in the theater.  It has excellent music and basically no plot, and was therefore exactly right for the moment.  \n\nThere were two kinds of disorientation: one was the relief from the constant pressure of knowing I had to get to a deadline, and the other was the total, utter anticlimax of finishing.  Somehow I thought that when I finished, I'd become rapidly enlightened somehow.  I dunno -- maybe they'd open my head up and pour in the Light Fantastic.  But that pouring operation is more of a trickle and takes 4-6 years to finish up.  The defense is just to check that you're sane and assimilated everything -- like kicking the tires of a car in the lot.  If you pass it's just ... no big deal.",

My defense took four hours because so much of his time was spent attacking my framework and research from his own paradigm, which is different than mine (fat story thin, I'm critical of certain mainstream assumptions in my discipline, and the relevance of his own work relies on them, which I didn't know before accepting the suggestion that he act in that role). He had some good points, but his \"questions\" were mostly him mindlessly ranting about how I didn't read X, Y, or Z, or how I'm mischaracterizing the literature because these three authors out of dozens have this particular view, etc. Just anything to cling onto, *anything*, that invalidates my paradigm. Then, I assume it took an hour for my committee to get him down from whatever fucking planet he was operating from so that my revisions were reasonable, and not just a mishmash of \"I didn't like the way you did this.\"\n\nIn the end, it was fine, and it ended like any other defense ends. This guy stressed me out (because he sent his hypercritical and inappropriately-toned report three days prior to my defense) and stressed out my advisor and committee, and did not make any friends during that process. In fact, this guy seriously harmed his image in front of his disciplinary peers at another institution. I doubt he'll be doing any examinations at my institution anytime soon.\n\nLesson here? *Read your potential external's work.* I had this dude because someone on my committee, whom I trusted, suggested him. My fault for not investigating further. Even if you get a recommendation, and it sounds good, always, *always* look at the assumptions in their work if you're in the social sciences or humanities. You could suffer otherwise.",

My body had been operating at high-stress, high-alert for so long, it took a while to ease out of that mindset and state of being without something that felt like a big and definitive end to my six year journey. Be kind and patient with yourself during this season of transition!",

Unlike some stories from friends about very long vivas (UK defence) lasting more than 4h, I was out in less than 2h. A few minutes of deliberation and I was declared doctor. Very anticlimactic. The after-viva drinks were definitely the best part.",

      "text": "Congrats! I felt the same where. There was a sense of loss after it was over and this thing I had been working towards for 5 years was accomplished. It's anticlimactic because the real PhD is the journey -- what you do and learn and accomplish on the way. The defense is in many ways is just a formality. It's not something you've trained for for 5 years and now you're getting tested. It's not like game 7 of the nba finals.\n\nEnjoy the transition to normal society. I had a bit of a hard time but as I'm transitioning I'm realizing more and more just how hard and not fun aspects of grad school were (long hours of hard work and not enough appreciation) that now that I have a normal 40 hours a week job, I realize I actually have the opportunity to be happy. I didn't dislike grad school while I was there - I appreciate the dedication of part of my life to science and the academic endeavor -- but I'm glad it's over and you should be too! Congrats!",
