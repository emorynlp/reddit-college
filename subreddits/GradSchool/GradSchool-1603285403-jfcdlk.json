  "text": "To anyone reading this and lurking the sub, especially those not yet in grad school and questioning it,\n\nFirstly, what I am about to say does not take away from any of the experiences stated on this site before and I am not saying that they are not true or anything. These experiences are definitely valid but it is just something that I have not dealt with yet. I am a graduate student at a major R1 university in the United States in Chemistry and I can honestly say that I love this program and the experience of grad school. Yes, classes are hard. Yes, TA'ing can be an absolute timesuck. Yes, research is frustrating. Yes, you actually do run out of time and it is crazy what my schedule looks like. But, I don't think that  I have ever been more fulfilled doing something in my life. I feel like I am being pushed to learn and that I am learning a lot. I have also been lucky to find a group of people in my cohort who I think have similar goals and aspirations with that have made a very good friend group for me. I found a lab whose research I love and a PI who is exactly the type of boss I want. Lastly, I think the idea of having ownership of a research project is one of the greatest things. It makes me want to go in every day to do work because it is MY project. I just feel like this is where I should be right now and it is nice to be here, after working in industry, knowing that I am furthering my knowledge, and the world's knowledge in the field that I love. I just wanted to write this as a bit of hope for anyone who has been disenchanted by the bleak posts of some of the users. I compare it to like  yelp review or something of that idea. You always hear from the people that are unhappy more than the people who are content. Hope this helps someone out.",

      "text": "I think I've been miserable in my PhD program because I do not feel like I have any sort of ownership over my projects. I also love to learn and don't mind working hard, but every time I come up with an idea, it is either shot down for no reason or my advisor tries to steal it and pass it off as her own. That, in addition to other abuse I've dealt with from both my advisor and another committee member, is why I'm mastering the hell out as soon as I find a job. I'm in my 3rd year for what it's worth, and I think I really started getting taken advantage of by the end of my first year. \n\nIMO, the biggest factor as to whether you enjoy grad school is who your supervisor/committee is. I thought I chose well, but as it turns out, meeting someone for a day during grad school recruitment is not enough time to determine whether they are fit to be a manager of people.",

      "text": "IMO, department culture is a major part of the equation. I was in a PhD program for three years that I hated. Not because of the subject or responsibilities, but because of the professors' completely flippant attitude toward their grad students. I switched to a different PhD program in the same university and it's a 180, all because the professors care about their students, both academically and emotionally. It starts from the top; professor respect and care creates a much healthier environment. Unfortunately, I think it's not at all uncommon to have a toxic professor environment. The #1 piece of advice I give anyone looking to grad schools is to ask the really uncomfortable questions before you sign on. Straight up ask the professors and current students how many students leave, why they leave, what responsibilities you'll have, advising style, what happens if you hate your project or advisor, what the qual process is like, etc. It's never too early to ask the pointed questions, and any professor/ department worth joining won't be put off or evasive after you ask. If you get anything less than really good responses from the students, that's a bad sign too; the student responses are likely biased in favor of their department (usually the happier ones are going to be the ones talking to you, people might be afraid to say bad things, etc.) so a really good response is probably more like a good environment. A good response is okay, okay is bad, bad is horrible. Run!",

      "text": "Since there are studies that show that mental health problems are extremely common in academia and often higher than in comparable groups, I wouldn't chalk it up to \"complainers\". It's a very serious problem in academia.  \nYou can get lucky and have a good experience, but that doesn't change the fact that there are some things fundamentally wrong with the whole system. Academic culture fosters unhealthy behaviour (e.g. overworking to \"show that you're serious!\" and pressure towards \"publish or perish\") and has this weird system where people never learn how to be a supervisor, get their own group through other measures (e.g. scientific output) and then somehow everyone is surprised that abusive PIs or people who just don't know how to supervise exist.  \n\nAlso, don't be fooled: A lot of abusive guys know how to behave to \"outsiders\" to make you say \"I would have never imagined that!\". They also have their students in check so they won't tell you, either (assuming they weren't just gas lighted into normalizing that behaviour).  \nSome of the PIs that are most famous with the undergrads at my University are most feared by their grad students.",

          "text": "Yup, this is such an important point. The culture of overwork can be terrible for mental health (particularly for anyone who is disabled, neurodivergent, etc), and it's not uncommon for departments to have a lot of other toxicity festering under the surface (racism, homophobia, sexism, ableism, cultures of normalized sexual violence, etc.). Especially if you're not a straight, white, cis man, you will likely notice this kind of stuff as you get more familiar with the department you're in. My best advice is to try and build community and solidarity with your fellow grad students. I am lucky enough to have some amazing students in my program with me, and not only have they made all of frustrating stuff more bearable, but I've also probably learned more from them overall than from faculty (even though I have been lucky enough to have some good instructors/committee members).",

My rotation is mostly online so I had chill days reading for my proposal on a topic I love. It\u2019s also all mine and I like being able to follow my own interests. Its hard to concentrate at home but also it\u2019s a choose your adventure in terms of scheduling, having errands, cooking.

The lack of career support and information about how to translate your skills into a job. \n\nI enjoyed graduate school.

One reason so many folks drop out of Ph.D. programs is that nobody has yet figured out a better way to determine which kind of person \\*you\\* will turn out to be, than just applying the stress and seeing what happens.\n\nLike any stress test (of materials or people) there are outliers -- groups and/or fields that are easier or that are more stressful than they should be.  So there's an element of chance there also.  That's one reason I always advise folks to talk with existing graduate students before joining a group, and to consider the grad school search to be a search for an advisor and/or group they like, not necessarily a school that is prestigious.",

In my cohort enjoys graduate school and feels fulfilled by what they do.  At my R1 university, this is the norm, and it is a culture that is intentionally perpetuated by faculty, administrators, etc.  That culture is the #1 reason why I applied to this University.  Program culture and work-life balance are things that prospective students NEED to be aware of when they are weighing different programs.\n\nOP's intention in their post was to provide a positive perspective on this sub for prospective graduate students.
