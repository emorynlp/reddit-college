These experiences are definitely valid but it is just something that I have not dealt with yet. I am a graduate student at a major R1 university in the United States in Chemistry and I can honestly say that I love this program and the experience of grad school. Yes, classes are hard. Yes, TA'ing can be an absolute timesuck. Yes, research is frustrating. Yes, you actually do run out of time and it is crazy what my schedule looks like. But, I don't think that  I have ever been more fulfilled doing something in my life. I feel like I am being pushed to learn and that I am learning a lot. I have also been lucky to find a group of people in my cohort who I think have similar goals and aspirations with that have made a very good friend group for me. I found a lab whose research I love and a PI who is exactly the type of boss I want. Lastly, I think the idea of having ownership of a research project is one of the greatest things. It makes me want to go in every day to do work because it is MY project. I just feel like this is where I should be right now and it is nice to be here, after working in industry, knowing that I am furthering my knowledge, and the world's knowledge in the field that I love. I just wanted to write this as a bit of hope for anyone who has been disenchanted by the bleak posts of some of the users. I compare it to like  yelp review or something of that idea.

I was in a PhD program for three years that I hated. Not because of the subject or responsibilities, but because of the professors' completely flippant attitude toward their grad students. I switched to a different PhD program in the same university and it's a 180, all because the professors care about their students, both academically and emotionally. It starts from the top; professor respect and care creates a much healthier environment. Unfortunately, I think it's not at all uncommon to have a toxic professor environment. The #1 piece of advice I give anyone looking to grad schools is to ask the really uncomfortable questions before you sign on. Straight up ask the professors and current students how many students leave, why they leave, what responsibilities you'll have, advising style, what happens if you hate your project or advisor, what the qual process is like, etc. It's never too early to ask the pointed questions, and any professor/ department worth joining won't be put off or evasive after you ask. If you get anything less than really good responses from the students, that's a bad sign too; the student responses are likely biased in favor of their department (usually the happier ones are going to be the ones talking to you, people might be afraid to say bad things, etc.) so a really good response is probably more like a good environment.
