  "text": "Hello, I received my BS in Political Science in May 2020 and I'm currently weighing my options for graduate school. I'm primarily looking at MPP programs right now and my applications for Fall 2022 enrollment are due in mid-December.\n\nI'm not sure if it's cold feet but I've had a lot of doubt about this choice the past few days. I have public policy research exposure from my undergraduate years and some internships, but I'm not sure if I'm starting this program too soon out of undergrad. By the time I start next year, I would have 2 years of post-undergraduate full time work, but I haven't had any policy research experience since my research in undergrad. I absolutely loved the policy research experience I have had and I know research is what I want to go into.\n\nI eventually want to pursue a PhD and get into academia, but I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I should keep trying to land a job in policy research without an MPP or just dive right into the program to increase my chances of employment in the policy research sector. Most PhD programs I've been looking at require a Master's so I feel like I'm going to have to get a Master's at some point no matter what.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I can decide whether or not pursuing an MPP is the right option for me right now? Should I keep pursuing work without a Master's or just go for it?\n\nThanks, any and all advice is appreciated!",
