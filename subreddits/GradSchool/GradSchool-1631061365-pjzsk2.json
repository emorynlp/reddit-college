  "text": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m starting a master\u2019s program and I\u2019ll be receiving a small stipend from NSERC (~17k/year). I have been having a hard time finding any answers on whether that counts as taxable income or not. I haven\u2019t received any yet, but I know taxes aren\u2019t taken out when it\u2019s deposited. It would be nice to know if I can use that full amount to live off from, or if I need to save 25% of it for taxes. \n\nAny help would be appreciated! Thank you",

      "text": "I was having trouble finding clear info on if funding is taxable as well. I think (but it was so confusing I\u2019m not sure) it may depend on province, and then in some places what it is used for (eg school related of personal expenses), or whether or not you are doing TA or GA work for it. I figure I will eventually speak with someone at the school or my accountant and figure it I\u2019m out then. I will keep an eye on this thread to see if someone has an answer.",
