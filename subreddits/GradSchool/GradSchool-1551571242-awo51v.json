      "text": "So CRAN (the repository for R packages) has this concept called [the Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/), where they have a page for a concept like \"Experimental Design\", and that page collects all of the packages that might be useful for that kind of task.\n\nI've adopted the same thing in Zotero. I have task view folders that are about one specific topic (e.g. \"plant defenses changing with elevation\"), and then the articles inside that folder are all about that. I've turned on recursive searching so that I can select the parent folder of all of my task folders and search everything at once.\n\nThe consequence of this is that you can have a big common folder where all of the papers get dumped in a semi-organised way (by project, say), and then task views inside that project where papers are more curated. Basically whenever I have a question, the question becomes a new task folder and the answers to that question are put inside it.",

              "text": "Not the OP but I moved to Zotero from Mendeley and I'm glad I made the switch. First, a values reason, just to get it out of the way: Mendeley is an Elsevier product and I'm a supporter of open access for science research. It seems odd to me to be actively using and promoting a product that is produced by one of the big guns in pay access journals, so I moved to Zotero - but that's also my opinion on the subject and if it's not a factor to you, it's not a factor.\n\nI do, however, like Zotero a little more. It's far better at automatic metadata collection for articles so there's less work to get papers in the system, and on top of that instead of having each paper exist as an individual file like Mendeley does, you can add additional documents to each paper you have - I usually have a clean copy, an annotated copy, and all my typed notes on the article tied together in the Zotero system. Zotero also stores things on the cloud, so the files in Zotero aren't tied to a specific file on my hard drive, which means I can rearrange my hard drive or get new computers or whatever and not be afraid of breaking links - unlike Mendeley, which required me to remap all a bunch my files after I needed to move a folder on my hard drive (d'oh). It's also open source so people make handy apps and add-ons constantly.\n\nDownsides are that Zotero has a lower limit on free storage and most of the tablet apps for it are third party. However, additional storage is pretty cheap ($20/year for 2GB).",

I love it, but it has some inconveniences that is probably not for everyone. There's no auto-saving. Formatting options are pretty limiting but honestly it's enough. Can't really draw into it like OneNote. Just to name a few.\n\nI feel the biggest headache it solves is syncing though. My notes are easily accessible anywhere I have a browser. In comparison, the syncing of these huge cloud software suites is just a huge pain in the ass. Evernote is just a mess. OneNote feels too tied down to OneDrive. Plus, I don't know if it's just me, but I just don't feel like these programs scale very well. What I mean is, with TiddlyWiki, I can maintain the same clean look to my notebook no matter how many notes are in it. With OneNote, the more I have, the more tabs, pages, etc. Looking at it becomes more intimidating as my notes grow.\n\n[https://tiddlywiki.com/](https://tiddlywiki.com/)",

Then I also have all my protocols in there since I can easily take pictures of each step in case I need to share the protocol with someone else in the lab. ",

Don't get me wrong, I still do it lol, although I use OneDrive since that seemed to be recommended, but I try to be careful to only have Zotero open on one device at a time. ",

You only get problems when you try to sync the Zotero data on a cloud drive - I guess people assume they can have some kind of 'portable app' thing happening that way but it just ends up screwing your library. Theres no risk doing it this way though.",
