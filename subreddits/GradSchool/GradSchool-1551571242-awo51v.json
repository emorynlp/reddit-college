I have task view folders that are about one specific topic (e.g. \"plant defenses changing with elevation\"), and then the articles inside that folder are all about that. I've turned on recursive searching so that I can select the parent folder of all of my task folders and search everything at once.\n\nThe consequence of this is that you can have a big common folder where all of the papers get dumped in a semi-organised way (by project, say), and then task views inside that project where papers are more curated.
