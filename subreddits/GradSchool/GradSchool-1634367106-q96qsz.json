I could fix it, but I'm too lazy. But still, it doesn't take long, maybe 10 minutes tops for a lot of articles. \n\nHonestly, for non-grad school stuff I only ever have about 5 open max at a time.

I use pomodoro to stay disciplined with work time, and this method helps me compartmentalize websites that aren\u2019t explicitly blocked and still distractions. \n\nIn the other browser window I usually have webpages relating to R code issues or stats when I\u2019m working on analyses, or papers when I\u2019m reviewing literature. I use zotero and a simple .txt file to catalogue papers (in addition to endnote for sourcing PDF or references), so I may have 5 or so papers or webpages open at a time.",
