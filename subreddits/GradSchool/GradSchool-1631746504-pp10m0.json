I cant keep up.", "text": "Today is the last day to drop classes without penalty. I'm thinking of withdrawing from the entire program. \n\nI currently work full time and also take 3 classes, so I am considered full-time in graduate school. We just had a 10-point quiz today and although I was almost up all night reading the research articles to discuss in class today, I still am almost sure I got a zero or a very low score on the quiz. I can't possibly go to work full time and do all of these classes and excel. A B- is a failing grade in my program. Although I am trying to tell myself that a 10 point quiz is not going to determine my whole grade, I feel like it's just going to keep getting worse from here on out. We NEVER had pop quizzes when I was in undergrad. Even when I'm reading research articles, it is very hard for me to not focus on details and focus on the main picture like I am supposed to. I also have a very, very hard time retaining information and understanding the words.\n\nHaving a full time case management job is not helping me but I can't just up and quit, I'm dealing with health problems and need the insurance; I turn 28 next week. I haven't been in school since 2016 and it's really hard for me to adjust. I truly believe that I am not smart enough for this program and it is really embarrassing. I can't think critically. I can't contribute to conversations. Even if I read the material, I don't retain and cannot explain it when I am quizzed on it. Almost all of the questions on the quiz today were short answer and I did my best but I know it wasn't totally right. \n\nThis is why I didn't go back to school for 5 years. I couldn't handle it, emotionally. Now I really can't handle it. All of my peers are 22-23 years old and can keep up and I can't...

At my program, it was about 1200/yr for GREAT coverage; like, better than my job.\n\n2) you don't have advisors? Do you have some sort of faculty member who's tasked with helping you get through the program successfully? Or are you just being left floundering?\n\n3) You're only in your 20s. Many people start grad school in their 30s or 40s. You're genuinely the oldest student there?\n\n4) Where are the support services? First of all, if you're struggling to understand and retain information from articles, you should be supported through some sort of student support center that offers one on one tutelage. Where is that?\n\n5) Is there a career center with folks to speak to? I found although ours was mostly geared toward getting jobs afterward, they were a super supportive resource for navigating work+school.\n\n6) You're not being paid to participate in this program? Do you have scholarships? Are you paying out of pocket? Is this a for-profit school?\n\n7) You never had quizzes in undergrad? What was your major?
