      "text": "Research. Maybe. Depending on your program. I don't think undergrad-style scholarships for graduate studies are much of a thing, but if you do a research-based program you *might* be able to get funding through an assistantship.\n\nEdit to expand a bit: all the research-based MS students I know are funded, but I get the impression from folks elsewhere that that's unusual, and I've never heard of a non-thesis student with university funding (though one's employer might pay for it).",
