  "title:": "How to address inappropriate looks from a professor?",
  "text": "I have a weird problem I have no idea how to address.One of the  professors I am currently working on a project with has a tendency to stare at my breasts during our meetings (and before people jump in to ask: I am not wearing anything that shows cleavage or is inappropriate for professional settings in any way). When I catch him do that, it distracts me from our meeting and makes me feel uncomfortable and upset. I  go from feeling like a student having an intellectual conversation with a professor to feeling like a woman talking to a man, who is displaying inappropriate behavior for a professional setting. I know this professor well enough to know that he has no harmful intentions. He has been quite helpful with my time here at my graduate program and I am grateful for the project we are  working on now. So I keep reminding myself that this person is on my side, it might be natural for some people to get distracted like that etc but it's not really working.  I am still uncomfortable  and I get distracted by his looks in return.\n\nThe problem is, this project will continue on for at least a few more months (+ he is in my committee) and it is also very uncomfortable to point this problem out to him. So I have no idea how to address the issue but I would like to, somehow.I am sure (unfortunately) that I am not the only female graduate student who has experienced this. So my question is if someone else here has also experienced it and found a way to address it, what did you do? Any suggestions?\n\n**Edit:** I realized that this post has been getting downvoted quite a bit lately. Sorry if people think it is not fitting for the subreddit. However, this seems like an experience some female graduate students (like myself) do experience in graduate school, and given the power dynamics, it is especially hard to navigate it. \n\n**Edit 2:** Thank you very much to everyone, who proposed solutions! There were some great ideas I never thought of myself that I think might actually be effective. I will try some of them out next week and I hope they make a difference :) And if I find out that this is happening with other female students, too, I will follow u/husky54's advice on talking to the department chair about it. Note: It's been pointed out by u/LastLioness that a faculty member/department chair would better know how to handle this professionally. So I will think about directly talking to them (but will probably keep the identity anonymous at first).",

Could you contact Title IX, ask them if they will deal with it? They can contact this professor on your behalf, sit him down, tell them there has been an anonymous concern and no formal complaint will be filed. He doesn't have to know it came from you and he won't get in trouble.",

In my undergraduate institution, a student went to Title IX to get advice but then was pressured to give out more information. She later raised her problems with  how Title IX handled her case etc and there were some changes in the department. So I was concerned about accidentally escalating this way more than I intend to. But I guess I could still talk to them.",

However, just because you experience glancing looks doesn't mean that he isn't this way with other women. All I'm saying is use this as a cautionary tale of what can happen if this behavior escalates.\n\nThis man was a professor at the University of Tennessee where he was tenured in the geography department. He was a world leader in dendrochronology. He testified in courts as an expert witness to the validity of violins from centuries ago just by looking at the rings on the wood. But, all of that is to say that no matter how senior the professor, if they perform behavior like this professor did they need to be dealt with. Best of luck.\n\nhttps://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMSw4JW8YI5xTfBZLA6SKp5RYlXLf3HN0ZTlAevNsirDkdHw1fyWpES-3Vb-dI2_Q?pageId=none&key=VFd1MzVwSnBhUlRsRW5POWM3VkFJemhvNFhEVWZ3",

On top of that, you're the only female, so you're already singled out in your cohort. Which is probably why you brushed it off for so long and even now you try to justify his behavior and dismissing it. It's hard to rock the boat when you're the only one that sees the need to do it. But you will be surprised at how many allies you will find either among your cohort or among other faculty members. If he is so open about objectifying you like this, you're not the first and you won't be the last. But you can choose to make your experience better by refocusing his energy from constant leering to actually tutoring. Which is what you're doing by taking this first step.\n\nGood luck with this!",

However, if you're not comfortable talking about this issue with him directly, and you have no idea how he would respond if you did, then imho you do not know him well enough to have a good grasp of his intentions. He is a grown-ass man, well-educated, AND in an authority position. It's very likely he's well aware of where his eyes tend to \"drift\". \n\nThat being said, it is not your job to confront him, and it's dangerous for you to do so (I mean this primarily professionally but also personally). You need to talk to someone with authority over him, someone you trust to talk to him about this issue with the option of keeping you anonymous. I suggest getting someone to help you advocate - perhaps one of the women on your committee can go with you to talk to the department chair (the HR department would also be a good option, possibly even better). \n\nAs a side note, I would make a mental note if this only happens when you are alone with him or if he does this to you or other women in front of his colleagues and bosses.",

What I meant by \"I know that he has no harmful intentions\" is that I find him trustworthy enough to think he doesn't intend to do anything more serious. But you do have a good point -- I don't know him \\*that\\* well so I could be wrong and this has been going on for a long time now that he really should be aware of what he is doing and stop.

Sorry you had to go through this. I think this sucks everywhere but especially at grad school, where professors are supposed to be focused on mentoring you in their relationship with you and are higher up on the power hierarchy. I do hope that it didn't end up affecting your career in a significantly negative way :/\n\n> these sorts of situations are handled so terribly by universities, and I feel like I\u2019d likely face backlash/retaliation and ultimately it wouldn\u2019t be worth it. \n\nYeah, I am also afraid of retaliation and that's why didn't know how to address it. I am glad some people here gave me ideas on indirect ways to address it, though so I will try them.   \n\n\n>If the issue is really bad, I just avoid meeting. I\u2019ve found that I can get away with not meeting with certain people for months, even if I have an ongoing project with them.\n\nThis is what makes me very frustrated. A student shouldn't have to avoid seeking mentorship just because of the shape of their body. I find this very unfair but don't know how to really solve the issue...\n\n>I hate my advice to avoid/ignore, but that\u2019s sadly all I\u2019ve got.\n\nI understand how you feel. On the one hand, I feel mad at myself for not being better at standing up for myself, but on the other hand, I think my concerns are valid. This has beeen going on for about 8 months now so it's not like he spaces out and randomly stares at things so I think I need to address it somehow if I keep interacting with him.\n\nI hope you are not experiencing the same stuff anymore.",

Have someone who knows him very well talk to him about this (embarrassing and highly inappropriate) habit. They might not even have to mention you at all, since you said he does this to other women, and colleagues close to him will have noticed the problem at large. If the colleague you talk to is really a good friend of his, they should want to bring this up with him to protect him from more serious consequences if he continues with the habit, since this is something you and others could certainly report. \n\nYou might also get advice from your ombudsman, if yours isn't a mandatory reporter.",

I haven't seen anyone criticizing him for something serious yet (other than things like \"oh Bob your desk is messy\" or something). He has a calm and kind personality that I think he might take it lightly. But I don't know if it will actually lead to some sort of retaliation.

      "text": "Given that you're fairly confident he doesn't have bad intentions and he's been helpful otherwise, it may be possible to talk to him directly about it. It's largely a question of how comfortable you are bringing it up like that. I'd say keep it light, try to avoid a serious half-hour meeting on the topic, so like the next time you notice him doing it say something like \"hey Bob, I've been meaning to bring something up with you, often when we're in meetings like this you seem to be looking at my breasts while we talk and it makes me really uncomfortable. Could you make an effort to look at my face instead?\" and see what response you get. This may be some horrible habit that he's developed without thinking about it, or that he thinks other people don't notice, and once you point out that you have noticed and it's not OK it may be enough to embarrass him into stopping. \n\nLike I said though, depends on your comfort level. If that sounds like a nightmarish conversation to start then /u/prettyvioletlilies' suggestion of having another professor talk to him about it is a great option, especially if it turns out he does this with other women as well and someone needs to address the full pattern of behavior with him.",

Yeah, I do feel like he is well-intentioned towards me and wants to help me out in my education. So perhaps you are right, he might bee fine with a direct conversation. I actually don't think he will verbally react to it in a negative way but I think it might change his support towards me in a more implicit way. Or that's what I am afraid of and don't feel comfortable talking to him about it as a result :/ If he were a fellow grad student, I would not feel awkward about it, though so I think this power dynamic thing plays a significant role with my comfort. I think I will take the advice by u/nemaflamingo on using more subtle verbal cues, as well as the other non-confrontational suggestions here like a coffee stain, and talking someone else about it without giving names.   \nThank you! :)",

He doesn't display this behavior as frequently when there are other people in the room, actually. It still happens but rarely.
