When I catch him do that, it distracts me from our meeting and makes me feel uncomfortable and upset. I  go from feeling like a student having an intellectual conversation with a professor to feeling like a woman talking to a man, who is displaying inappropriate behavior for a professional setting. I know this professor well enough to know that he has no harmful intentions. He has been quite helpful with my time here at my graduate program and I am grateful for the project we are  working on now. So I keep reminding myself that this person is on my side, it might be natural for some people to get distracted like that etc but it's not really working.  I am still uncomfortable  and I get distracted by his looks in return.\n\nThe problem is, this project will continue on for at least a few more months (+ he is in my committee) and it is also very uncomfortable to point this problem out to him. So I have no idea how to address the issue but I would like to, somehow.I am sure (unfortunately) that I am not the only female graduate student who has experienced this. So my question is if someone else here has also experienced it and found a way to address it, what did you do? Any suggestions?\n\n**Edit:** I realized that this post has been getting downvoted quite a bit lately. Sorry if people think it is not fitting for the subreddit. However, this seems like an experience some female graduate students (like myself) do experience in graduate school, and given the power dynamics, it is especially hard to navigate it. \n\n**Edit 2:** Thank you very much to everyone, who proposed solutions! There were some great ideas I never thought of myself that I think might actually be effective. I will try some of them out next week and I hope they make a difference :) And if I find out that this is happening with other female students, too, I will follow u/husky54's advice on talking to the department chair about it. Note: It's been pointed out by u/LastLioness that a faculty member/department chair would better know how to handle this professionally. So I will think about directly talking to them (but will probably keep the identity anonymous at first).", "author": "Clous09", "created": 1567789979, "retrieved": 1632845945, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 346, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"eze4uzh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/d0jja5/how_to_address_inappropriate_looks_from_a/eze4uzh/", "text": "Title IX recently gave a training at my institute and provided some examples of how people have used their services in the past.

He was a world leader in dendrochronology. He testified in courts as an expert witness to the validity of violins from centuries ago just by looking at the rings on the wood.
