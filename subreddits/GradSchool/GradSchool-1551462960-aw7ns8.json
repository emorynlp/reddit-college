      "text": "My defense was the biggest anti-climax of my life. \n\nIt was a rainy Monday. I arrived full of adrenalin and realized within 2 minutes that my examiners just wanted to chat and be finished by 4pm. (We started at 3pm). They were very complimentary but I wondered if they had really read my thesis.\n\nSo we finished at 4pm. My supervisor couldn\u2019t be there as he had a meeting out of town. I was supposed to be playing with my local team that evening and looked forward to sharing the good news but the game was cancelled due to weather. \n\nSo I literally drove straight home and didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. \n\nI think it was a perfect example of how much importance we put on it all when it means very little in the grand scheme of things. \n\nNow I\u2019m a tenured professor I give so much stuff so little importance. Students come to me looking green and if they only knew the reality that all I\u2019m really thinking about is what I\u2019m doing with the wife at the weekend or when I\u2019m going to catch up on True Detective. \n\nSo I learned a good lesson I think from my defense.",

I just appreciate having been in such a wonderful graduate program, made such fantastic friends, and trust that in your next stage of life, you will be able to meet similarly amazing people. And trust me, once you move, you\u2019ll be so busy starting your new life that you won\u2019t be sitting idle and pining for what you had. Lastly - you can always visit! All the best to you, and best wishes for a great new start!",
