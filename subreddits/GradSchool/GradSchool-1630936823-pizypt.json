  "text": "Got my Master's degree already and I'm now doing my PhD which is going well so far. The thing is, I have always this dream to study in Harvard/MIT/Stanford. I'm just wondering if it's kind of weird to try to apply for a Master's degree after I do my PhD.\n\nTo give you a context, I'm doing my PhD at a consistently ranked top 50 university in the world. The Harvard/MIT/Stanford dream has been with me since high school.",

      "text": "The advice I always give students is, \"Don't get the degree unless there's a reason to.\" How would this Masters degree help your career beyond what a PhD would already provide? If you wouldn't get the degree from a place other than Harvard, MIT, or Stanford, I'm not sure it's going to actually help you. That's a lot of effort for a piece of paper that will maybe go up on your wall that no one else will care about.\n\nI mean, if you have the money, time, and energy, and it's something you really, really want, who cares, go for it (assuming you'd get in), it's your life. But I would never advise a student do this, especially if the purpose seems to be more about the name on the certificate than any actual skills you'd develop in the process.\n\nEDIT: Also, university rankings are a farce.",
