As much as I loved the guys I lived with they frustrated me sooo much because of these issues. I decided that I'm going to be proactive about it and channel my frustration into something productive. Because of all this, I spent the last 2 months building a roommate app from scratch. It's not much that I feel like it's pretty good so far. There is still some testing I have to do so I'm not launching it just yet. I'm going to launch it this Sunday. I'll add a link in the description on Sunday and create another post describing the app in more detail.\n\nI'll answer any questions you guys may have below.\n\nTL;DR - I had cruddy roommates for years, built an app to split chores and bills, releasing the app here on Sunday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: \\*3 Days Remaining\\* Hey everyone, app testing is running smoothly. The team and I haven't run into any major bugs and everything in the app seems to be working great. We still have a bunch of the app to still go through but it looks like we're still on track to release this Sunday at 8 AM Eastern Standard Time.\n\nUpdate: \\*2 Days Remaining\\* Good news everyone! The bug fixes are going smoothly, we're also in the process of adding a few suggestions a few of you guys PM'd us. We're still on track to get it all done by Sunday 9 AM\n\nUpdate: \\*1 Day Remaining\\* Great news everyone! We just have a few minor bugs remaining and we've successfully added all the features. The app will officially be releasing tomorrow at Sunday 9 AM New York Time.\n\n**Update Post Explaining WeDivvy -** [Update Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/pibr7y/update_release_of_the_roommate_app_to_end_all/)\n\n**WeDivvy App Store URL -** [**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wedivvy/id1570700094**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wedivvy/id1570700094)\n\n**WeDivvy Play Store URL** \\- Coming Soon", "author": "Heathermohl", "created": 1630506222, "retrieved": 1632845147, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 82, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"hbsddue": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hbsddue/", "text": "RemindMe! 1 week", "author": "_thenotsodarkknight_", "created": 1630917086, "upvotes": 1}, "hba9ful": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hba9ful/", "text": "!Remindme 6 days", "author": "Keysersoze_66", "created": 1630562845, "upvotes": 1}, "hb9777p": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hb9777p/", "text": "Imterested", "author": "Due_Minute", "created": 1630542395, "upvotes": 1}, "hb8iz2d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hb8iz2d/", "text": "Following!", "author": "insubstantialsh", "created": 1630530657, "upvotes": 1}, "hb7jjkm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hb7jjkm/", "text": "every innovation is born from the identification of a pressing and unfilled need", "author": "nickyfrags69", "created": 1630516141, "upvotes": 4}, "hb7fwxp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hb7fwxp/", "text": "Have you heard of Splitwise?\n\nThere's also a mathematical solution to something called cake-cutting, which is how to fairly divide up pleasant or unpleasant things, that might be of interest to you.", "author": "Linearts", "created": 1630514672, "upvotes": 6}, "hb7b223": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hb7b223/", "text": "Modern problems require modern solutions.\n\n*insert meme*", "author": "tpat247", "created": 1630512700, "upvotes": 9}, "hb7arhf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pfuxwq/im_releasing_a_roommate_app_to_end_all_roommate/hb7arhf/", "text": "I've stopped buying the \"forgetting\" angle when it comes to paying you back.
