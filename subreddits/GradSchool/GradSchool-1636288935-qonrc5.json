  "text": "After I graduated last spring I entered the workforce and got a job that involved me going door to door, I left after 3 months because I didn't feel safe doing the job, now I applied to a lot of grad schools because I want to get my MBA.\n\nBut more and more I've been thinking, am I going to grad school to early, I'm 24 and I know I'm probably overthinking everything but I just wanted some other opinions.",

      "text": "Agree with other comment.\n\nThere\u2019s really no such thing as too early, it\u2019s are you ready and does it make sense for a trajectory? I went for my masters because I needed a field change and it was a funded program. I advise against grad school unless it is a very employable professional degree (MPH,MSW, etc) or a fully or very highly funded academic program.\n\nEdit to add: if you do go make connections bc that is ultimately how I got my new career making 3x what I did before grad school.",

I made an effort to get to know my professors and people in my cohort and it took me a long way. I asked about opportunities and that\u2019s how I got my job. Someone in my cohort was working for a company I liked so I just blatantly asked if they would consider taking me as an intern. They did and now I\u2019m full time employed by them because I worked my ass off as an intern to make a good impression.",

      "text": "I obviously don't know a ton of details about your situation, but I will say there is no such thing as \"too early\" or \"too late\" IMO. Like most things in life, it's about what's right for you.\n\nI took twice as long to get my undergrad, took a 2 year break, and am now in my second semester of grad school at 28. I know people who got their Masters by the time they were 23 or so. Every situation is different.\n\nMy advice would be to for sure do some self reflecting, and also talk to a career counselor if you can. Try looking into your alma matter- that's where I found mine. And now as a grad student I'm about to meet with one at my current school.\n\nFor me it's less about a wrong answer, it's just about the right thing for YOU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I don't mean to sound preachy. Sorry if it comes off that way!",

      "text": "An MBA is most useful when you have a job and you add it on top of your job and apply whatever work scenarios you\u2019re in to your school and vice versa, meanwhile your employer is paying for it. I wouldn\u2019t go into debt for it. Maybe check around on other subs and see what people with MBAs say but I think it\u2019s not the best idea to jump right in and take out loans for it. Get some work experience first and make sure it\u2019s what you want.",
