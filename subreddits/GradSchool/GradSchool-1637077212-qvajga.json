  "text": "Hey guys \n\nSo I am an Engineering graduate(Bachelors and Masters) and I think I want to change my career into security. \nI am interested in a combination of cyber and physical security but don\u2019t have any idea what courses I can do to pursue a career in the security industry. \n\nIs it worth doing a course tbh? Will it help me at all?",

      "text": "Within the wide world of technology jobs, the job opportunities within the \"cyber and physical security\" zone range from barely-technical, to absurdly technical.  \n\nYou could practically read a book, and watch 10 YouTube videos to become a physical security camera & badge-reader installer, and that would technically be a physical security job.  \n\nBut if you wanted to go a bit more advanced than installing cameras, (and as a Graduate student I assume you do) you might need more training than that.  \n\nYou need technical skills on how these things work, and why they are necessary.  \nYou can teach yourself those things if you want to, or you can pay someone to teach you.  \n\nYou already have an undergraduate & graduate degree.  \nEmployers don't really need you or expect you to have further education.  \n\nIf you learn best in a classroom environment, fine. It's not wrong to get a Masters in Security topics.  \n\nBut there are professional certifications that might help you develop the necessary skills instead of an academic environment.  \n\nIt's all about what your goals are, and how you learn the best.",

      "text": "This sounds like a situation where getting a job in that business will provide you with clarity about the best route to advancement as well as where you'd like that advancement to go. \n\nLook for positions that use some of the skills you already have. Companies may be a bit short on that if they have mainly hired security experts.",
