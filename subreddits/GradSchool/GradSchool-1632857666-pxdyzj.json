I\u2019ve taken about 6 graduate level courses (600+) at the school of medicine, school of public health, etc which have counted towards my bachelors degree.\n\nI\u2019m currently applying to MS/MPH programs. Is it unheard of for some of the credits I\u2019ve obtained from graduate courses to count towards a grad program? Is this considered double dipping? \n\nThanks so much", "author": "neuromedicfoodie", "created": 1632857666, "retrieved": 1632951967, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hen66c4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pxdyzj/transfer_credit_question/hen66c4/", "text": "It depends on the policies at the grad school. Some will accept transfer credit, some won't recognize it at all, and others still will recognize them for waiving pre-requisites but not count toward your credit count (so, more time for electives). \n\nIt's entirely a reasonable question to ask the programs where you're applying because this isn't one of those \"well, duh\" questions.", "author": "aggressive-teaspoon", "created": 1632863365, "upvotes": 1}}}
