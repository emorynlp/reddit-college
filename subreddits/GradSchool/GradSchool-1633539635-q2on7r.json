  "title:": "Planning to have a baby in Masters program",
  "text": "So, I just started my masters program about six weeks ago. My husband and I have been planning when we would like to start having children. Ideally, we have decided that we would like to have our first child before he gets out of the military, which will be in about 2.5 years, that way we can get free medical for when we have the kid. I also feel that I would like to have my first child before 30 because I feel it may be significantly more difficult at that age. I\u2019m 26 now. I would like some thoughts and opinions on what you think might be the best time to get pregnant in grad school. My program takes about 2-2.5 years to complete, depending on the individual. At first, I thought maybe I might try in January 2022. But then I got to thinking maybe I should wait until the last year of my program, that way I can have the kid after graduation and won\u2019t have to worry about taking care of a kid while in school. Personally, I am okay with not working for a while after graduating because I really want to be in my child\u2019s life and am not very trusting of babysitters/daycare (other than my mom and MIL). So, finding a job right away is not a downside for me. Also, my husband has a pretty good career and is able to support us financially to have a child and for me to not work as well. So, that is not an issue. I am more concerned about the possibility of being sick and pregnant while in school and that possibly deterring me from completing my program. I don\u2019t work so it\u2019s nice that I can just focus on school, which I think will help if I decided to get pregnant in grad school.",

      "text": "I had a classmate who gave birth during our program. Our department was really understanding, but we were in a public health program so definitely a more \"liberal\" environment. I also have a coworker who gave birth the week after defending her doctoral dissertation. It's definitely possible. How easy it will be seems to depend on how much support there is within your program. You might want to discuss with your ombudsman about how to work around potential challenges like dr appointment or just general pregnancy brain.  But it sounds like if you can time delivery for just after graduation, that would be the best possible scenario.",

      "text": "As Long as you can be sure to not end up caring for your child entirely on your own, it should be okay (good friend had some issues there and studying while being a single mom without a lot of money is extremely hard but she managed to). As for getting a child. I have figured that at least in my country many are getting theirs during the PhD but I also believe there is no \u201eperfect timing\u201c and nothing can guarantee that you get pregnant when you plan to. If you both feel ready for it and are sure of being able to provide for it financially, why not giving it a shot:) I definitely wish you all the best.",
