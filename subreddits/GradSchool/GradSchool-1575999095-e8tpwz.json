Currently, UCSC graduate students are enduring precarious conditions as we are living in one of the roughest housing economies in the nation- the majority of us are forced to pay 50% or more of our TA incomes towards rent alone (likely more if living in campus graduate student housing). We are currently on an unsanctioned WILDCAT GRADING STRIKE in order obtain a necessary Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We need this COLA in order to get out from underneath the rent burden so many of us are facing. \n\nWe need support and solidarity  from anywhere and everywhere we can get it! Please visit https://payusmoreucsc.com  or @payusmoreucsc on Instagram for more information on our COLA campaign!!\n\nEDIT: FEEL FREE TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT IN THE COMMENT SECTION!!!", "author": "astute_canary", "created": 1575999095, "retrieved": 1632953741, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 465, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"fjh9apb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/e8tpwz/ucsc_graduate_students_are_on_wildcat_grading/fjh9apb/", "text": "OH NO, NOT 50% PERCENT!\n\nWe make 30+/hr for our 20 hour (maximum) work weeks.\n\nTA\u2019s who tell you they work more than 20 hours are unfairly lumping their PAID TA DUTIES with their UNPAID RESEARCH DUTIES THAT ADVANCE THEIR OWN FUCKING CAREERS.\n\nSome people are in dire circumstances.
