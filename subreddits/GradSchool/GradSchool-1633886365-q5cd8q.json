  "text": "Hello.. I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate from India and looking for Masters in Electric Automobile/Electric Powertrains. I've been searching for a long time now but couldn't find a lot of them. Though this sub is for admissions but I'm finding difficulty in finalizing the University. If any folks have an idea regarding this.. Please do respond. Plus I'm planning for the Fall 2022 intake, so I don't have much time. \nThanks in advance :)",
