  "text": "So, I wanna write my thesis on Native American boarding schools.\nGenerally, scholars pick a school to do a history of it, they compare it to another school, or even a school in another country. Lately, scholars interview living alumni.\nI was hoping to write about an all girls school as a case study and discuss how religion changed traditional gender roles.\nThen, I come to find that someone is already writing a book about the school with my same research idea.\nMy advisor says, \"do you have a backup school?\" ..which bummed me out cause I was hyped to try this idea. I do have a backup school. \n\nI suppose what im asking is, how do you handle books coming out that have already done the work and apparently asked the questions?\n\nI feel like every time I get a thesis idea I'm sent back to square one.\nMaybe I'm just not considering different research questions for an all girls school. Any ideas? \n\nI feel bummed out",

      "text": "Even if someone writes a book about religion, native american boarding schools and changes in traditional gender roles, chances are they have not covered *everything* about the topic and there's one question, angle, or approach that they did not look at. I think if you want to write about Native American boarding schools, that sounds like an excellent topic and I'm sure there's a whole bunch of other angles you can take. \n\nI'm not an expert in that so I can't provide specific suggestions, but a couple years ago a really prominent scholar wrote a book about the topic my PI and our lab were working on. My PI also happens to be a well-known scholar, and we decided to continue the track we were on because we had a completely different methodological approach, data set, and theoretical background. Famous McFancypants did a qualitative study, ours was quantitative, so we were still able to make a contribution that added to the overall discussion. \n\nIf you're passionate about this topic, I'd try to do some additional reading and exploration and see if maybe there are other elements about the impact of boarding schools on Native American communities that maybe have received less attention from the academic community.",

      "text": "If you are interested in going onto a PhD, I strongly recommend picking a different school since then your thesis could have a hint of more originality around it by covering a different population. After all, you may find that your backup doesn't fully mesh with this monograph when it is eventually published. Such differing conclusions could open up new, unanticipated avenues of research for both of you. You might even be able to get a journal article out of it in comparing and contrasting differing conclusions and analyzing why the conclusions differed. After all, history does make use of the scientific method and this could prove useful in verifying the more general conclusions that the monograph will argue.",

      "text": "It could be worth picking a different school, just because as someone else said, you'd be able to carve out your own focus. You would have a different body of primary sources, which may lead you to different questions and different conclusions.\n\n\nIf you really feel that *this* is the school you want to do, and this is the topic, are you able to look at that book to see what it's doing? It's possible they did something different than what you wanted to do, or that you could see some gaps to be filled in their scholarship, or a way to apply a different approach to understanding the same problem.",
