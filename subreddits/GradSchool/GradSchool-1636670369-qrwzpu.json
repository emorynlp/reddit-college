  "text": "My PI is very creative but very easily distracted. He will wake up with an idea and propose that I do experiments that are only tangentially related to my thesis. I just want to stick to my overarching thesis plan and focus on doing everything I need to graduate (I am in my third year with absolutely no data due to the lab being slow to start up), but my postdoc told me it was unreasonable to ask to focus on the thesis plan. Are all PIs like this? Is it possible to find a more structured environment? I am his first graduate student and I really fear that I won't be able to stay on track.",

      "text": "Being able to come up with novel insights, and the experiments to test them is certainly a valuable talent in researchers. So is a great ability to determine which are the most important and feasible questions to pursue. \n\nYour advisor appears to be providing more of the former than the latter. You'll do best if you try to learn both skills. \n\nTypically a good research program reveals more valuable directions than the original plan and you make some adjustments. But flitting around is not going to do you any good.",

      "text": "Sometimes these new ideas only slightly related to your thesis can lead the project in a new way and be more promising than original idea. That seems to be the case for one of my PI's ideas. I'm also her first grad student but I have a friend with 70 yo PI and he does the same thing. Explore it, don't put too much time and energy into it, if it leads somewhere then follow up if not the drop it",

      "text": "I have had a similar experience, and the best thing I can say is: **document everything**.  Like have a couple working documents that when you are discussing your thesis, you update.  If a meeting goes off in a tangential direction, and you don't want to do that part, don't add it.  In my experience, they then forget they said that.  Use this document, or powerpoint or whatever, to give yourself that structure and something to keep building upon.  Have them regularly agree to aspects of it, as in during meetings pull it out and be like, \"okay, this is where we are currently, does this still look good to you?\"  I know some people that would even screen share, or very openly edit the sort of document with the PI.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the post-doc, no it's not unreasonable.  Just because they probably came from a lab/department where they dealt with similar doesn't mean you have to.",
