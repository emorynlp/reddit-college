  "title:": "Professor didn't show up to lecture for 3 days and screwed us over.",
  "text": "So in my program (MSc clinical drug development), we only show up to class 3 days per month, for 8 hours each, and then use the rest of the month for the assignment and working on our dissertation.\n\nLast week was the start of a new class (pharmacoeconomics) which is already a dull, difficult subject to begin with. I show up to class and there's not professor. The program admin sits in on every class and eventually decided to just play the zoom recording from last year. So I commuted to class for an 8 hour zoom recording. Cool, I'll come back tomorrow and hopefully the prof will be there.\n\nI show up the next morning, no professor. Admin shrugs and puts on last year's zoom recording again, and people begin to trickle out of the lecture hall until there's only 3 of us left. Why would you stay 8 hours to watch a recording you can watch from home?\n\nNext day the prof doesn't show up again, and the admin tells us to just go home and watch the recording remotely.\n\nI was so pissed because I paid actual money for public transport to get to class all 3 days just to watch a video recording.\n\nNow, I wouldn't have minded as much if the recording didn't sound like it was recorded on a mcdonalds drive thru microphone. I'm a native english speaker and I couldn't even understand it, I couldn't imaging what other students thought. It sounds like someone is screaming the lecture from across their house, and once you can finally hear something it starts to lag and you don't know what he said anyways. One of us brought up the issue to the admin and she said if the people on zoom last year could deal with it then we could too, and assured us that we would be getting the same education as if he actually showed up to lecture.\n\nI just had to vent. Just, not only do I not understand the material because I've never taken economics class in my life and now I'm in a graduate level course, but I physically can't understand it either.",

They should have let the class know instead of having a program admin shrugging and playing a Zoom recording, but whatever.\n\nBut to happen again, *twice*? Inexcusable. \n\nClearly the program admin doesn't give a shit, and is trying to placate you by saying some bullshit about \"if the people last year can do it you can too,\" but if they're confident enough to open up in-person learning again, then the professor needs to damn well come in to teach the class.",

You paid A LOT of money to be there and will be paying on this debt for the next 20 years, whether you succeed or not, so you better make sure you at least get the education you bought. If you paid for a new home, you wouldn't just sleep in the street for 20 years because the real estate agent didn't want to show up to the closing. You'd fight tooth and nail to get what you paid for. At least, that's how I see it. They offered us an alternative course, and adjusted the syllabus to accommodate the time we'd lost and we still graduated on time. \n\nBut that was before COVID. We're all living in a brave new world where the rules are made up and the points don't matter now. Good Luck!",
