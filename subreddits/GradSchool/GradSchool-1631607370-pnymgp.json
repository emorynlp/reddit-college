I feel like y'all would relate and guide. \n\nI am a final year undergrad english major, and I have been working on a research paper that i self studied for and wrote entirely on my own. I am doing this as part of a research club. I hope to get into grad school next year. I submitted my project for a peer review. \n\nNow my project was on English Literature. It low-key overlapped with sociology, and thats why they gave me Sociology thesis advisor. I worked with that. Then the research club sent it to another socio prof for peer review. \n\nLook, i was not expecting this to be perfect. This was my first time doing research and writing this long and detailed of a paper. The subject was beyond the scope of undergrad syllabus, and given that i studied this all on my own, I was expecting some loopholes in my own understanding and how I put it across. I was expecting some level of changes and review. I knew this would not be approved directly. \n\nShe went so brutal! This peer reviewer, she went completely ballistic! she wrote a whole page about how it was unclear, and how \"most arguments were unsubstantiated\". I was not expecting this, especially after my thesis advisor had told me that my writing was good for an undergrad level. I worked under her direction, took in all of her advice and incorporated it in my paper, and literally burned the midnight oil doing this. Her review is making me feel as if I'm not the great writer I think I am, and now I'm spiralling to how my grad school apps and essays aren't good enough and I wont be accepted. Fun times. \n\nMaybe I should have expected this. i dont know, maybe the peer review is right and i am acting like a naive child.I guess this is my way of saying that I'm disappointed. My advisor said this is normal in research, that even top rated profs get brutal reviews on their papers. This got me wondering if i really want to be part of such a toxic and negative industry, but that is a discussion for another time. \n\nMy question is, is this what i should be expecting going into academia and grad school? Im picking myself up and working on the corrections. I really enjoyed the process of research, but maybe Im feeling like this because its the first time. Maybe with time, Ill be jaded and it wont affect me then. But it affects me now, and i guess im looking for reassurance, ways to deal, tips to get better. \n\nAny all tips and advice are appreciated, please help a newbie out!

The former is not toxic. It can be tough, but that's the purpose of a review. The latter is toxic, but ime less common. \n\nIs there merit to what she is saying? If you've self studied and are writing in a field that is not your native discipline, there may be some fundamental things you overlooked simply due to lack of familiarity. This happens all the time when STEM people (usually physicists for some reason) want to \"try their hand\" at a social science discipline and end up producing garbage. You may be a great writer mechanically, but writing well and having a well-supported argument is not the same. I also wonder if there is a difference in disciplinary norms, because a \"well supported\" argument in English doesn't take the same form as a \"well supported\" argument in sociology. Sociologists probably want to see data and data analysis, so if you don't have that and are just relying on logical arguments, then it her feedback makes sense. \n\nThis is all not to say you're not a good writer, not a good researcher, and won't be successful in grad school.

I'm impressed with what you described and your post about it is well written. I can see the quality of writing extending to a more academic paper, but I can also see a self-taught undergrad submitting a paper for graduate-level review getting torn to absolute bits as described here. The quotes from the feedback do not seem personal to me, nor do they seem critical of the writing itself. Saying something is unsubstantiated suggests (to me) the structure of the argument is not sound, not that the argument itself is not well written. Academic papers can be well written and still structurally messy. I know, I've written and read some myself!\n\nI was consistently frustrated with a lack of feedback on my chapter drafts while finishing my dissertation. If I had gotten more regular feedback like this throughout the process I think it would have stung, but it also would have made getting to a final draft much more iterative and natural vs an exponential leap forward. But that's my experience, not yours. From the outside the feedback you've gotten sounds appropriate and helpful. It doesn't feel like a Stockholm situation like some have suggested. But if there are more personal attacks you've left out or it feels oppressive ignore what I've said. How you react to feedback is a personal matter.

You realize the books aren\u2019t that great. The number of academics who are active and alive that whose work you wish you\u2019d written yourself you can count on one hand. I also suggest you read up on new research in learning and education that shows that teachers who show care and work to produce a nurturing learning environment do the best in their teaching and in their work.

That you're a last year undergraduate doing this is a great learning experience, but also be realistic and be open to criticism and feedback. \n\nEveryone takes feedback differently but end of the day it's feedback on your work, not you. When I first peer reviewed an article and sought advice from one my PIs he said that the best reviewers are supportive and the aim is to make \"the science and the paper better\". So don't take it personally at all. If you do, which is totally normal, scan the feedback, and then take a day off before any revisions. Give yourself time to breathe.\n\nLastly I hate to call peer review \"toxic\" as I think it's a tad overblow as a word. Feedback and change is something which is integral to work - both in industry and academia. Approaching constructive criticism, feedback and the ping-pong communication which takes place is an important learnt life skill which you can, and should develop.
