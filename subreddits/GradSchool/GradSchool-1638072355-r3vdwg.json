  "title:": "Should I drop out my masters program if I don't get an internship?",
  "text": "For background I am attending a top ranked program for my field (trying to be vague as it's easy to identify me if I say too much) for a masters program. I am coming from undergrad with a year of unrelated experience and have had zero luck securing an internship for the summer. So far I have applied to 60 companies, been rejected from 34 with more that just never even had the decency to say they weren't interested. I have had 6 companies interview me and none have worked out.\n\nMy fear is if I don't get one I will graduate with a masters degree and zero relevant experience making me overqualified (on paper) and under experienced, making me even less attractive as a candidate.\n\nAnyone been in a similar boat of being in a masters with little experience, no internship, and thinking of dropping out? What did you do?",
