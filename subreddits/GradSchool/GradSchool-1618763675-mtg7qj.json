      "text": "For me it was budgeting and properly tracking the finances of my wife and I. \n\nThis is something I really wish was taught in secondary schools. Prior to online and mobile banking, I often relied on calling the bank's toll-free number to get my available balance prior to spending money. I never kept track of my in and outgoing transactions. \n\nMy bachelor's degree was in Communication Studies, so math and other courses were never required. Even though I originally started as a Business student, after some self-inflicted wounds and dropping out, then coming back under a special readmission policy, my advisor essentially gave me the \"easiest\" major so I wouldn't flunk out again. \n\nFast forward 4 years later post-undergraduate graduation, I decided to act on my urge to get a masters degree. I had thought of law school, a Comm masters, and several other fields but landed on getting a MBA from my alma mater. \n\nIt was going through that rigorous curriculum that opened my eyes to a lot of things and led me to the field I'm in today (Business Analytics and SDLC support), to which one of those things is accounting and making sure my personal books are accurate and up to date. \n\nI've gotten to the point where I've been two cents off and spent 30-40 minutes going through my spreadsheet to find the mistake and correct it. I know how much expendable income I have everytime I update my books. And I track every thing. I probably spend a few hours a week total brushing through my books to update and forecast. Something I had never done prior to entering grad school. \n\nIt came in handy when my wife was laid off just before the pandemic hit and I was the only one working. Keeping track of everything kept us on time with bills and knowing what we can spend was certainly helpful at times. \n\nFinancial mishandling and arguing over money is a top contributor to divorce. That's something my wife and I really have to qualms over. She understands I handle the money side and has now gotten on board with my system. She now asks which card to use prior to purchasing anything. It's certainly not a form of control because I'm not restricting her from buying anything (unless of course it's absolutely unnecessary), but she understands we spend money from one account and she asks to ensure we have enough to cover stuff. \n\nIt works for us and I have grad school to thank for it \ud83d\ude42",

I contacted the student's lab supervisor (with the student's permission) because I thought it might be worth trying to publish it. Or at least submit it for a campus wide annual writing competition. It was super well written and the analysis was super impressive for an undergrad.\n\nTurns out the student had lifted the data (and most of the analysis techniques) from a master's student. They had done all the writing themselves, but the code used to analyze the data had come from the master's student, who had shared it without knowing that the student was running the tests on their own and turning it in as homework. They thought they were helping the student learn more advanced stuff in R.  It was an awkward case of \"yes that is also plagiarism.\"",

If you use the entire sample as your df, your answer for what is the probable mean difference will always be exactly what your sample says it is. In reality, your research methods assume that your specific sample is just one of many possible ones that plausibly represent the (true and unknown) population. So you are basically saying: I have a pretty good estimate of this thing I'm measuring, but I could be wrong (which is why you are doing statistics to begin with). \n\nSo you now need to turn your \"sample as population\" in to \"sample as sample\" which involves creating a non 0 dimensional problem space for you to solve. By doing the \"-1\" for your df, you are creating a 1-dimensional problem space. This means that you say your data is not actually determined (because it's just a sample, and not the population) and it can plausibly contain any other value. This creates a linear (1-dimensional) problem space for your data. \n\nWith a 1-d space, you can easily solve this analytically, but with higher dimensions you need to use the maximum likelihood methods. So in SEM you are doing the same thing as in ANOVA, but with extra dimensions. This is why you have concepts like \"under-identified\" and \"over-identified\". \n\nHonestly, degrees of freedom are probably the most difficult concepts in stats you are likely to encounter. I didn't really understand this until I tried teaching stats and had to actually understand df, instead of just regurgitating what I heard in class. \n\nAlso when teaching, I realized that all of stats from t-test to SEM is just Sums of Squares done in different ways.",

Of note he only applied to three colleges total. Last year my department advertised for a TTAP and got 150+ applicants, and they were disappointed as often similar departments get 300. \n\nMy masters department is ranked around 90th and every single person they've hired over the last five years has had insane pedigree (Oxford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, years of postdoctoral work).

And I realized that I was such a tiny part of a their job, they have no reason to help me, and that politics absolutely dwarf any minor responsibility they might have.",

You have that title only while you're department head.\n\nAnd some, like the example earlier, are time-bounded and, in ones I'm familiar with, have a sort of governance process to decide who gets them. Like a school might have named junior professorships that were created/funded to help promsing young faculty have some financial resources as they work toward tenure...money for a sabbatical, for travel, etc., but those career development professorships are divvied out via some sort of process across departments. Like maybe there are three of them across a school with ten departments with several junior faculty each on the tenure clock, and each department head nominates one person who then goes to a committee headed by the dean. The professorship gets awarded and it comes with, say, up to three years of whatever funding it provides. The end of those professorships try to be timed to when the person goes up for tenure.",

Even PLoS One journals have at least once been found to have published [controversial research](https://www.nature.com/news/paper-that-says-human-hand-was-designed-by-creator-sparks-concern-1.19499), and PLoS is regarded as a solid journal as well.\n\nPapers can be judged from many perspectives, and the publisher is just one of them.

Sure, the leaders, that is, the first one to try to implement this would profit heavily, but how much time until the competitor try the same action, but paying more for submissions/charging less for readers? In the long run, all publishers would be having a null net profit or even a net loss. Anyway. your suggestion is not an equilibrium for the publishing market and I guess, unless government plays its roles, things are pretty much stable in the academic publishing market and it's.",

There's been such a push in the last...I dunno decade or so? to respect creatives and such (exposure doesn't pay my bills an artist would say), I'm not sure why the same logic doesn't apply to academia, you know?\n\nI'm not entirely sure how profitable publishing is, I just feel like paying the authors that get published should be relatively easy. The only reason it doesn't happen is cause we gotta use journals either way, I guess.",

Given that a non-irrelevant share of research is funded by public resources, the behind pay-wall articles does not seem fair to me. That's why I argued about the role that government can play on this. Isolated, each specialty is powerless against this publishing business model, however more rules about openness of the public funded research could already change the dynamics of the academic publishing model.",

Extensions are frownupon and they get often 3,4,5 reviewers so if they got fast enough feedback they can cancel the review request on you. But rest of the process and reviewers seem to do a good job from what I have seen",
