Prior to online and mobile banking, I often relied on calling the bank's toll-free number to get my available balance prior to spending money. I never kept track of my in and outgoing transactions. \n\nMy bachelor's degree was in Communication Studies, so math and other courses were never required. Even though I originally started as a Business student, after some self-inflicted wounds and dropping out, then coming back under a special readmission policy, my advisor essentially gave me the \"easiest\" major so I wouldn't flunk out again. \n\nFast forward 4 years later post-undergraduate graduation, I decided to act on my urge to get a masters degree. I had thought of law school, a Comm masters, and several other fields but landed on getting a MBA from my alma mater. \n\nIt was going through that rigorous curriculum that opened my eyes to a lot of things and led me to the field I'm in today (Business Analytics and SDLC support), to which one of those things is accounting and making sure my personal books are accurate and up to date. \n\nI've gotten to the point where I've been two cents off and spent 30-40 minutes going through my spreadsheet to find the mistake and correct it. I know how much expendable income I have everytime I update my books. And I track every thing. I probably spend a few hours a week total brushing through my books to update and forecast. Something I had never done prior to entering grad school. \n\nIt came in handy when my wife was laid off just before the pandemic hit and I was the only one working. Keeping track of everything kept us on time with bills and knowing what we can spend was certainly helpful at times. \n\nFinancial mishandling and arguing over money is a top contributor to divorce. That's something my wife and I really have to qualms over. She understands I handle the money side and has now gotten on board with my system. She now asks which card to use prior to purchasing anything. It's certainly not a form of control because I'm not restricting her from buying anything (unless of course it's absolutely unnecessary), but she understands we spend money from one account and she asks to ensure we have enough to cover stuff. \n\nIt works for us and I have grad school to thank for it \ud83d\ude42", "author": "WhitePigeon1986", "created": 1618845111, "upvotes": 1}, "gv340ty": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mtg7qj/what_basic_academic_thing_did_you_learn/gv340ty/", "text": "I'd say graduate school in general is full of unwritten rules that it seems like everyone else already knows.
