  "text": "I have a good relationship with my supervisor insofar as we communicate well and work gets done on time but I can't help feeling my interactions are far too rigorous and formal if that makes sense?\n\nI feel that this innate formality kind of restricts my performance and communication skills because I'm always on my guard to not sound like an idiot or embarrass myself.\n\nHow do I lower the formality and make my meetings more comfortable?",

      "text": "Do they supervise other students? If so, is it possible to chat with those students and gauge what their interactions are like? You could ask with the goal of info-gathering, rather than the aim of changing the dynamic (as others have said, your supervisor might prefer the formality).\n\nMaybe you'll find out that the other students have had the same experience, maybe you'll find that for them, the relationship 'warmed' after particular milestones or lengths of time.\n\nIf you get the sense that your supervisor is unlikely to change, and you think you would benefit from having someone a little less rigid, consider asking other students about their experiences with other faculty members and maybe you could put someone with more warmth on your committee to help give you that outlet. \n\nMy committee has an intimidating hard-ass, a warm parental type, and a very perfunctory expert in the area, it's a nice mix and a good recipe for getting different needs met on my projects.",
