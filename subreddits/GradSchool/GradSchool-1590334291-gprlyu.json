  "title:": "Mastering out is NOT PhD failure. It's not. Don't ever let anyone make you think it is.",
  "text": "I remember having a friend a while back who was at the time a postdoc but is now a professor. He would talk about how people would master out and how it's PhD failure. At that time I was just a first-year PhD student, not really involved with research, not really knowing or caring. That being said, I also wasn't aware of just how much of a dumpster fire academia is.\n\nThat friend is also elitist and can be incredibly condescending. He's not a bad person, but he is incredibly toxic. You know, the kind of friend who regularly overtalks, interrupts, and is a poor listener. He also lucked out with a good PhD advisor, many years ago.\n\nNow that I'm three years into my PhD, have been thorough two advisors, and have a much better idea of how things work around this toxic environment, I can say with certainty that mastering out is actually a win, not a loss. Leaving a toxic environment is much better than trying to stick it out with something that absolutely does not work. There is absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about, but everything to be happy about. In fact, if it weren't for a friend of mine, I would've mastered out.\n\nMy first advisor is incredibly toxic. I was so ready to master out because I did not want to deal with him anymore; I would much rather have left and saved at least three years of my life than try to stick it out with him. My case is particularly rare, though; a friend of mine showed up at the right time to tell me to switch advisors--and I am so glad I did. My second (current) advisor is a true rare gem. Had my friend not shown up, I would've mastered out.\n\nIf you're in a position where you feel you have absolutely nowhere else to go and you have to master out, don't ever feel embarrassed. Your mental health is so much more important than you think. If you have a friend who's strongly considering mastering out, be there for them and support them. And if there is a good advisor in your institution, switch to them! Grad school doesn't have to be painful, and bad advisors can easily be replaced with those who will make your life so much easier.\n\nEdit I: thank you for the silver! :)\n\nEdit II: thank you for the wholesome! :)",

      "text": "I have been having a similar experience. I started my PhD program this last year. \n\nThere wasn't/isn't really a doubt in my mind that I want a PhD. I love learning, exploring, and creating, and to me, these are the reasons to pursue higher education. I have a real passion for my field and want to contribute to society in such a way. I know my views might be idealistic, but it gives the motivation I need to persevere. \n\nUnfortunately, my first adviser didn't share those same values. She seemed to be in academia for the prestige and money. I don't doubt she has a passion for what she does, but it was apparent she was a professor for the sake of research progression rather student progression. And in that is where I see a major flaw with many professors in academia.\n\nIn my opinion, the whole point of a school is to further education in young people as to hopefully progress society forward in future generations. That makes social/emotional intelligence probably the most important aspect to an adviser.\n\nI was on the verge of dropping out when under my first adviser because I felt like I wasn't being heard. I would state my needs and they were ignored. Mentally, I was extremely strained and I just wanted the anxiety to stop immediately.\n\nIf I hadn't reached out to my current adviser, and if he hadn't been so emotionally intelligent and available for me, I don't think I would've stayed in the program. The PhD wasn't worth working under my previous adviser and the amount of stress I felt. But it is worth it under the right conditions, which I feel I have now with my current adviser.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel like many people stop pursuing higher education simply because of the people they work for (and this is highly applicable in the workforce too). I think the main goal to achieve retention is to provide emotional/social training to professors since advising is a main part of their duties. I think there would be great benefits in the long term.\n\nI would also encourage students to push for the respect and dignity they deserve. I hear so many stories about students being anxious and depressed and the toxic behaviors in the lab being normalized. I think the quality and standard of being a grad student has dropped because nobody is pushing for accountability. The cycle will continue as long as you let it, but don't be scared to stand up for what you need.",

One tip though: have a good answer ready for when they ask you why are you mastering out (because they will ask).",

      "text": "I only wanted a Masters to begin with; didn\u2019t think I could handle another ~6 years of school after a tough undergraduate experience. I applied to a school with a special program that combined two different departments. Heard back from the department that they only really take PhD students (despite a MS being listed online), so I said okay, do whatever you need to my app, you are my top choice! Got in, moved 1000 miles, started classes, only to THEN be told \u201coh we are dissolving that dual department program, you\u2019re really only a student in our department now.\u201d I stuck around, struggled HARD the whole time, almost failed out, until after 5 years when my advisor says \u201cwhat are you still doing here? You didn\u2019t even want this in the first place. Let\u2019s get you out of here with a Masters.\u201d \n\nI was SO relieved. \u201cMasters\u201d had become a four letter word in our department and I felt like a failure for even considering that on my own, even though it was all I wanted to begin with!! I got out of there with an MS, got a job directly related to my area of study after several months, and ended up with a starting salary on par with some of the PhDs leaving my program. I ended up being at school for ~5.5 years and getting a degree that should have taken closer to ~3 if I had fought for what I wanted earlier!\n\nIt looks better for a department to graduate more PhDs over MSs, so of course they\u2019ll want you to stick around. But don\u2019t do it just to help them pad their numbers if it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for you individually!",

I was also very happy with my decision to eat the banana, though my enjoyment of the banana doesn't mean I successfully ate an apple.\n\nOn a more direct note: failing to do one thing we wanted to do isn't the same as failing as a human being. We fail and succeed constantly at all sorts of things big and small, and there's no point pretending we don't. It's the general direction of our failures and successes over time that carve our paths in life.",

Many people tend to tie their self-worth and identity with study (not saying it's a good thing, in fact this is a classic example of why it's not) and so failing PhD requirements becomes more of a case of \"failing as a human being.\" \n\nFailure is a natural process of life, but the way we approach failure needs to be improved. \"I failed my PhD requirements and so had to Master out\" - okay. \"I'm a failure because I couldn't do a PhD\" - not okay.",

If you did is as a PhD candidate in a STEM filed, that means you did it for free, kudos to you, really! \n  \nI went into my PhD program having no clue if it's what I should be doing, but it was actually *comforting* knowing that if I should find a PhD or a career in research not for me, I can still get paid to do a MS, which sounded pretty great to me. With a Masters in engineering that you would've had if you obtained your MS (from what I can tell from your flair), that is an incredibly employable person.... maybe more so than a PhD in some other STEM fields--depending.   \n    \nThis is the number one thing people forget when in academia... you should not compare yourself to your local environment... as much as its human nature to do so. Compare yourself to the general population, you have a Masters degree, you have reach an elite pinnacle of success that many don't even have the opportunity to do so. You had the opportunity and put in some really driven hard work to achieve a Masters degree: *BE PROUD!* A Career as a PhD is not for everyone, you also may not have a law degree or an MBA either... who cares! You did what you needed to do to enjoy the type of career that fits you, that's the **only** thing that's important.  \n    \nThanks for putting this out there PTH, well said!",

                      "text": "In terms of reapplying, I would argue that's negligible since (at least in my experience and those that I know) grad school isn't much of an application process like undergrad, but more of a \"find a good prof with money and a cool project\". It can be a bit of a hassle for sure, but as long as your Masters went well, it should be easy enough to find a PhD-level project, either through your own connections by that point, or through your supervisor's connections.\n\nMoving, yeah, I can see that would be a hassle, but I would say the benefits outweigh that. Moving can be fun! Get out and explore new places.\n\nIn terms of \"restating in the middle\" and \"inability to do longer term projects\", it's not really like that. In general, Masters projects are designed/chosen by the prof to be a solid one-paper project. Solve that, get some research under your belt, and then move on. Maybe you continue the same research, or maybe you move on to a related or non-related topic. But the nice thing is that when you start your PhD, you already know what you're doing in terms of the research process. You're generally expected to have a paper done within the first year and a half-ish, aiming generally for 3-ish papers within the three years and graduate. So it's not that you're doing a \"shorter\" project, it's more that you are just moving at a faster pace now that you have a Masters.\n\nMy prof always described it like this to me: your Masters will generally get you one, maybe two papers if you're really good. But in general, two years for one paper. First paper of you PhD is \\~1.5 years, next paper should be around 1-1.25 years, then maybe 0.75-1.25 years, etc. Eventually you'll get to the level most profs are at, where you think of an idea, do the research, and have a paper done within 4-6 months (depending on your field of course).\n\nEssentially the idea of splitting the Masters and PhD up is to allow flexibility to the student. Not everyone will want to go for the PhD, but may still want experience in researching, so they complete a standard Masters (which is in no way looked down upon). And those that do want to continue can now move quicker, and continue on to a long-term PhD project. But overall you're still looking at around 5 years for all of grad school.",

They're made because the project isn't going well, the advisor is a douchebag and they're not working well together, they hate their project/field/etc... deciding something isn't for you isn't a failure, surely, but is it success? It's wasted effort in any case.\n\nI know two people who mastered out. The first is the person who failed their two exams. The second is someone who decided that, after 5 years or so & being told at their last committee meeting that they had yet another year of measurements to go, decided to call it quits and just leave with their MSc. This person also already had an MSc, but it was from a different country, so at least the Canadian MSc had more recognition and it wasn't a loss for them.\n\nThat person is gainfully employed in their field; however, advancement prospects are low due to the lack of a PhD. This person essentially ended up taking 5 years to achieve what they could have in 2, and not getting much benefit from it. Turned out OK for that person, and they don't regret quitting the PhD (they hated it), but it's not like they're happy to have stuck in there for 5 years.\n\nThere's a business strategy called \"fail faster\" (ironic given the present discussion) which I argue should apply to people doing their PhDs. Individuals are probably served better mastering out early rather than slogging it through and mastering out 3 years later. 3 years is a lot of time not spent starting a career and earning an income.",
