Don't ever let anyone make you think it is.", "text": "I remember having a friend a while back who was at the time a postdoc but is now a professor. He would talk about how people would master out and how it's PhD failure. At that time I was just a first-year PhD student, not really involved with research, not really knowing or caring. That being said, I also wasn't aware of just how much of a dumpster fire academia is.\n\nThat friend is also elitist and can be incredibly condescending. He's not a bad person, but he is incredibly toxic. You know, the kind of friend who regularly overtalks, interrupts, and is a poor listener. He also lucked out with a good PhD advisor, many years ago.\n\nNow that I'm three years into my PhD, have been thorough two advisors, and have a much better idea of how things work around this toxic environment, I can say with certainty that mastering out is actually a win, not a loss. Leaving a toxic environment is much better than trying to stick it out with something that absolutely does not work. There is absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about, but everything to be happy about. In fact, if it weren't for a friend of mine, I would've mastered out.\n\nMy first advisor is incredibly toxic. I was so ready to master out because I did not want to deal with him anymore; I would much rather have left and saved at least three years of my life than try to stick it out with him. My case is particularly rare, though; a friend of mine showed up at the right time to tell me to switch advisors--and I am so glad I did. My second (current) advisor is a true rare gem. Had my friend not shown up, I would've mastered out.\n\nIf you're in a position where you feel you have absolutely nowhere else to go and you have to master out, don't ever feel embarrassed. Your mental health is so much more important than you think. If you have a friend who's strongly considering mastering out, be there for them and support them. And if there is a good advisor in your institution, switch to them! Grad school doesn't have to be painful, and bad advisors can easily be replaced with those who will make your life so much easier.\n\nEdit I: thank you for the silver! :)\n\nEdit II: thank you for the wholesome! :)", "author": "Palerthanghosts", "created": 1590334291, "retrieved": 1632953234, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 734, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"frvz6a8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gprlyu/mastering_out_is_not_phd_failure_its_not_dont/frvz6a8/", "text": ">That friend is also elitist and can be incredibly condescending.

I started my PhD program this last year. \n\nThere wasn't/isn't really a doubt in my mind that I want a PhD. I love learning, exploring, and creating, and to me, these are the reasons to pursue higher education. I have a real passion for my field and want to contribute to society in such a way. I know my views might be idealistic, but it gives the motivation I need to persevere. \n\nUnfortunately, my first adviser didn't share those same values. She seemed to be in academia for the prestige and money. I don't doubt she has a passion for what she does, but it was apparent she was a professor for the sake of research progression rather student progression. And in that is where I see a major flaw with many professors in academia.\n\nIn my opinion, the whole point of a school is to further education in young people as to hopefully progress society forward in future generations. That makes social/emotional intelligence probably the most important aspect to an adviser.\n\nI was on the verge of dropping out when under my first adviser because I felt like I wasn't being heard. I would state my needs and they were ignored. Mentally, I was extremely strained and I just wanted the anxiety to stop immediately.\n\nIf I hadn't reached out to my current adviser, and if he hadn't been so emotionally intelligent and available for me, I don't think I would've stayed in the program. The PhD wasn't worth working under my previous adviser and the amount of stress I felt. But it is worth it under the right conditions, which I feel I have now with my current adviser.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel like many people stop pursuing higher education simply because of the people they work for (and this is highly applicable in the workforce too). I think the main goal to achieve retention is to provide emotional/social training to professors since advising is a main part of their duties. I think there would be great benefits in the long term.\n\nI would also encourage students to push for the respect and dignity they deserve. I hear so many stories about students being anxious and depressed and the toxic behaviors in the lab being normalized. I think the quality and standard of being a grad student has dropped because nobody is pushing for accountability.
