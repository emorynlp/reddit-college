      "text": "Do you mean In-person vs online studying? Because you can be a full-time student for both options, so comparing Full-time to online studies doesn't really make sense.\n\nI was able to get my supervisor to agree to stay abroad and do my PhD research remotely. There's no class for PhD students where I am studying. I will only come for the experimental part of my research this winter and next fall as well. I am in a lucky position but it's definitely not often that students get to decide that. Prior to covid, it would have been impossible to ask such a request at my PhD uni, but my undergrad uni was already offering some remote classes online, but not the main curriculum one.",

Even my colleagues went pretty quick from \"meeting in person\" to \"let's just save the commute time and zoom\". Our project quality really really decreased.\n\nI would always prefer in-person over online!",
