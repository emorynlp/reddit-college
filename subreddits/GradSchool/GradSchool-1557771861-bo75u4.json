My thoughts on starting a family during graduate school.", "text": "Hey guys, like the title states, my wife and I both defended last June (Molecular Microbiology), and walked on Saturday. We met a half a year before our programs began, and we married and had a kid 2 years in.\n\nStarting a family in grad school is definitely doable, depending on your lab situation. We had zero proximal family support, so we had our son in daycare during the weekdays, and we took turns watching the little guy on the weekends and weeknights when one or the other of us had to put in a lot of work. Not trying to violate rule 9 here, but we collectively published 12 times (4 first author, 5 co-author, three reviews) as PhD students, so I would dare to say that we didn't half-ass it because of the kid.\n\nVarious (usually older) faculty told us that we were making a mistake when my wife got pregnant (on purpose), and our school offered zero support for graduate student mothers apart from the mandatory, unpaid FMLA weeks (my wife took 6 weeks plus her two weeks of vacation). Luckily, our mentor was extremely supportive and absolutely thrilled to have a lab baby (she even babysat for us a couple of times).\n\nSo, if you are considering getting married and/or having a kid in grad school, never let anybody tell you that you ***have*** to put your life on hold, especially if raising a family is a high priority for you; those mid 30s come up real fast. Talk to your mentor, look at what resources your school/state/country offers, get advice from others who have gone through the same thing, and do your research about the child care options in your area. Most importantly, find a work/life balance that works for both of you, and be sure to create some quality family time (weekend \"daycations\" and babysitter-allowed date-nights kept us sane).", "author": "Took-the-Blue-Pill", "created": 1557771861, "retrieved": 1632953775, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 449, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"enhntst": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/bo75u4/my_wife_and_i_just_walked_for_our_phds_my/enhntst/", "text": "This is a huge achievement to be celebrated.
