Where your adviser is typically your first point of contact, with my former adviser they were often the *last* point of contact because they were not experienced enough. Planning classes was a pain because they said everything sounded good. My current adviser talked me out of a class because they said it would be too much work for where I was in my program without compensating by being critically relevant to my research interests. \n\nOne main difference between the two is current adviser is tenured and a former department chair.
