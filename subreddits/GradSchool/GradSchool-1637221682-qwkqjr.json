Now my friends are expecting me to share my LOR with them. But I don't trust them. I said\u201d I will not share sorry\u201d . They are now making fun of me saying - When people don't share Statement of Purpose it's understandable, but why isn't she sharing her LORs. I worked really hard to write them and I don't want to take risk or share my hard work with anyone.\nIs it wrong ?\nI\u2019m I being selfish ?",
