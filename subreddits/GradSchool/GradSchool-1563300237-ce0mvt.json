  "text": "Hi Dr. DGS, thanks for taking time to meet with me :)\n\nI'm really looking forward to graduating with a PhD in [*insert biomedical field here*]. Now, we both know I'm probably not cut out for staying in academia, after all, only [10%](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/663) of biological or life science PhDs land a tenure-track job within 5 years of graduation. And let's be honest, [*insert university name here*] isn't one of the top 25% of schools, which together account for [71-86%](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005) of all new faculty. \n\nI *could* do a postdoc, but do I really want to work [50+](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/4/245/253174)  hours / week to get paid [less](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00587-y) than a new [college graduate](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/college/class-of-2018-starting-salary/index.html) even though I'll be [~9](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab27.htm) years older than said college grad? I mean, I definitely would if there were data that showed doing a postdoc would help my career in the private sector, but --*whoops!*\n\n[*accidentally drop studies (1-3) showing there isn\u2019t any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs.*]\n\nI mean what's gonna happen? It's not like if I do a postdoc, like most bio PhDs will, and then go into industry, I'll end up making [$12,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766)  per year less than if I had just skipped the postdoc altogether? Right?\n\nAnd do you think once I've got my PhD, and I'm making [~$37,000](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367), will that be more or less than the salary of someone who skipped grad school all together and just got a bachelors in [philosophy?](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors/page/8?orderBy=EarlyCareerPay&ascending=false) How about if I went into industry ([~$48,000/yr](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2015/12/09/350.6266.1367.DC1/aac5949_Zolas-SM.pdf)), would that still be less than the median for a new college graduate ([~$50,000](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/college/class-of-2018-starting-salary/index.html))? Should I be heartened to think that eventually a [biology PhD working the private sector](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab48.htm) will make more than [someone with a bachelors](https://data.bls.gov/PDQWeb/le) or should I keep in mind that data from middle aged workers all come from a market where PhDs were rare and can't adjust for the last several decades of record PhD production?\n\nHm, I guess I could always teach... which would probably mean adjunct status, since they teach [most](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noodleeducation/2015/05/28/more-than-half-of-college-faculty-are-adjuncts-should-you-care/) of the courses nowadays. If I went that route, I'd make about $25-40K/yr with little to no benefits, or I guess you could say: it would pay better to teach high school than college, which is kinda weird, but okay.\n\nBut gosh, I just love research! Maybe I should go private sector. I sure hope sticking with research doesn't mean I can expect to earn [less](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0241). And how many private sector bio PhDs get to actually stick with research anyway? Would you say the proportion of biomedical PhDs that stay in some form of research in the private sector is between 45-72% like in [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766) study? Or less than 10% like in [this](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367) one? Because getting to pursue my (employer's) research interests was sort of central to the whole idea of getting a PhD in the first place!\n\nI just can't wait to really start my career! I bet you felt the same way back when more NIH funding went to \u201cearly-career\u201d researchers (\u2264 40 years old) compared to researchers \u2265 50 years old at a ratio of greater than 10. [*insert wry chuckle here*] Of course, nowadays that ratio has totally flipped and ten times more money goes to the older researchers. Maybe that's why some [74%](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/06/17/data-suggest-baby-boomer-faculty-are-putting-retirement) of professors aged 49-67 plan to delay retirement past age 65 or never retire at all. I mean, do you think if you graphed the age distribution of NIH PIs from [1980 to 2010](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/02/13/age-distribution-of-nih-principal-investigators-and-medical-school-faculty/) you'd actually be able to *see* the Baby Boomers get hold of the funding and then just hoard it? Heck, I bet there are more researchers with a major grant [75 years and older than there are 33 years or less](https://twitter.com/aarmey/status/565674331792244737)! No seriously, wanna bet? Let's put some money down; my stipend is paltry and I want to remember what meat tastes like.\n\nI sure am glad I was one of the lucky [30%](http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7574-597a) of American grad students to report obtaining useful career advice from their institutions and not one of those other poor souls enmeshed in an exploitative pyramid scheme where the half-life of a researcher is only [5 years](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/12/05/1800478115) and it doesn't even matter how much you produce. Ha! Publish and still perish! Am I right?\n\nCheers!\n\n[1] http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/663\n\n[2] https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766\n\n[3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318302312#bib0465",

      "text": "I take issue with the age stuff. All the stats are true, but many of people's proposed solutions (get all the dinosaurs out) are suicide. Imo the only time I see \"young\"= college rhetoric is when I'm dealing with rich white people that can do k-12+. Studies actually show most undergrads 36-75% (depending on whether you count community college and online) are non-traditional students (parents, veterans, second career, older, doing a degree over twice as long etc). We will finish our phds in our 40s and 50s, not 20s like our privileged advisors. We will have so much debt we need to work till we are 85-90. We have no retirement and likely never will. I'd like a chance before I even start. But that's ageism for you... Works both ways. Destroyed my chances of advancing when I was too young, so I started a new career and now I'm too old. FML.\n\nAnyway, I would use phrases like \"new ideas\" and not young ideas or whatever else. Old bodies can have fresh, ahead of the curve ideas and young, thin, rich, white bodies can have monstrous ideas.\n\nI imagine that eventually we'll all unionize if we are lucky and probably come up with bargaining option that spreads resources fairly between newer academics and those with experience and tenure (which is fair). BUT will base that not on graduation dates, but on age (which is illegal). After we get that seemingly wonderful deal, a year will pass, we'll get a job or not and then eventually go to draw on those new faculty resources only to be told too old. Then we'll beg to keep our jobs but eventually be told no, too old. We'll default on our debt, end up homeless. But there's a silver lining!!! At least we don't have kids, because we were struggling financially so bad that 50% or so of us will choose to not have kids even though we want to. See, not too bad.",

      "text": "Take heart, biomed PhDs... there are industry jobs, I even recommend going outside direct biotech into classic tech looking for a bio-angle. Classic tech/engineering payscales are far higher than biomed.\n\nFor example, I skipped a post-doc and applied to roughly 100 jobs looking in a very specific, non-bio rich area and received two offers. One from a large biotech conglomerate who offered $64k a year with paltry benefits and one in a traditional engineering company who offered $92k a year with not excellent, but solid bennies. I took the second offer and I love it. I am in the minority as a biologist, but that's a good thing in my line of work. I have received pay raises in 3 years that increased my salary over 10k in 3 years, plus bonus, plus other incentives. I have several patent apps, I love my work, it's engaging, and I am still involved with biotech 100%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not a stellar candidate, I didn't have high impact first author publications or go to a top 25 undergrad or grad school. But I fit a niche and it's worked out well. Search long and hard and learn how to sell the skills you gain in grad school- the teaching you do is communicating with diverse backgrounds about technical topics. The dissertation topic you research is how you execute a plan you've devised and work collaboratively to achieve your goals. Learn some program/project management speak and figure out how to hit those notes in a resume. And most of all, get an industry internship if your advisor will support it. It's typically the biggest barrier to hiring a PhD, that they don't have actual industry experience. The biggest shock to my system was taking a corporate job that had requirements I did not expect and I needed to adapt very quickly to a new work environment.",

The current hierarchy is honestly pretty effective in terms of producing good research, but sucks terribly the majority of those who reach the PhD stage through the postdoc stage. Professors borderline promise TT level position to 7+ PhD students through their careers, but only the very best advisers will even manage to train PhDs at TT replacement level. So the vast majority of professors are horribly overselling the benefits of the degree.\n\nI think NIH, NSF, USDA, etc. should ALL begin mandating this as part of their funding agreements. Show in your grant how those line-item PhD students/postdocs are going to be better prepared for the real world because of this project, or find a better use for the money. I'm not jaded enough to not think that the excess PhDs out there aren't benefiting society in some way, but the current system crushes souls because it puts way too much of the burden on us to figure out how to do that.",

What you describe will dilute the rigor of PhD training in nontraditional tracks (and already has where implemented), and that should be distinguished.

Further reducing that value/specificity will accelerate the problem.",

They spent their savings helping her with the application process and living expenses... She is currently applying for her third postdoc. They don't understand what a \"postdoc\" means in academia. Even I only understood when I moved to the US for my Ph.D. ( in a field with better prospects, thank god). My family thinks she is getting her second ( and now third) PhD. I didn't have the heart to tell them the truth that my cousin is struggling to find a job and is working 60 hour weeks for shit pay. Academia is rough.",

However, if you don't, then don't bother, because you will make far less money.\"\n\nThe boomer shit is new to me though. I knew funding was tight and that the old folks in my department were sticking around forever, but I didn't realize that the new funding disparity was that extreme. \n\nAll the more reason to talk about structural changes that can happen in academia. That will take political organizing, though, which, as someone who has tried to talk to colleagues about unionization, is hard with scientists sometimes. Sure people generally have liberal views, but everyone is busy and focused on their own stuff and sometimes have been trained to value competition over cooperation. \n\nYou can see it in the comments of this post; \"if it's so bad, just leave.\" We could do something about this with lobbying and mass-action. Some democratic candidates are touting free college; could graduate and academic reform be a part of higher education reform in general?\n\nOP's post is controversial and sarcastic, but I'm glad it's being talked about.

It certainly should be a mission of graduate schools to prepare you for what happens after, but they can't control it themselves.

My high school chemistry teacher discouraged me from doing academia, a couple of my undergrad profs discouraged me from doing academia, even the graduate coordinator of my department discouraged me from pursuing a PhD after my MS for THESE VERY REASONS. I don\u2019t even want to be a professor, but you can find jobs in science that offer good work-life balance, good salary, and opportunities to do research. But it turns out jobs like that aren\u2019t going to just fall into your lap immediately after you get a PhD, who would\u2019ve guessed? The point of a PhD isn\u2019t to get you a good salary, it\u2019s to train you up to be a good researcher. If you feel you\u2019ve been robbed because of it, I have no sympathy for you. You should\u2019ve known what you were getting into. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have very many arguments either. His post is essentially \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a job that pays well even if you have a PhD and it\u2019s very difficult to get a tenure track position in academia.\u201d Yeah, no shit Sherlock. We\u2019ve known this for decades now. What is he proposing? Absolutely nothing. He\u2019s just presenting statistics and venting about how unfair everything is.\n\nHonestly his whole post reeks of the kind of talking point that is oh so common on Reddit. \u201cHigher education is pointless and doesn\u2019t pay, therefore you should drop everything to learn how to code or be a welder so you can finally have that middle class existence that makes everyone happy\u201d",

There are people with highschool degrees making 200K a year as entirely self-taught programmers. Some people on YouTube made chemistry videos of their independent research that inspired other lab workers to explore their work and make further advancements. (I happen to like the idea of independent research not affiliated with a university or organization.) A phd also endangers you to be overqualified and underpaid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think you should be allowed to go after your dreams. I support you getting your degree. But I understand why people are a little alarmed by the statistics. I don't think it's entitled to want a significant pay raise (within reason, of course) and to know that you are going to be able to get the job you went to school for after getting a phd; it's hard stuff!",
