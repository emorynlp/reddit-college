Ask them about these career statistics! [Biology] / [Biomedical] / [STEM]", "text": "Hi Dr. DGS, thanks for taking time to meet with me :)\n\nI'm really looking forward to graduating with a PhD in [*insert biomedical field here*]. Now, we both know I'm probably not cut out for staying in academia, after all, only [10%](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6286/663) of biological or life science PhDs land a tenure-track job within 5 years of graduation. And let's be honest, [*insert university name here*] isn't one of the top 25% of schools, which together account for [71-86%](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005) of all new faculty. \n\nI *could* do a postdoc, but do I really want to work [50+](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/4/245/253174)  hours / week to get paid [less](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00587-y) than a new [college graduate](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/college/class-of-2018-starting-salary/index.html) even though I'll be [~9](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab27.htm) years older than said college grad? I mean, I definitely would if there were data that showed doing a postdoc would help my career in the private sector, but --*whoops!*\n\n[*accidentally drop studies (1-3) showing there isn\u2019t any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs.*]\n\nI mean what's gonna happen? It's not like if I do a postdoc, like most bio PhDs will, and then go into industry, I'll end up making [$12,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766)  per year less than if I had just skipped the postdoc altogether? Right?\n\nAnd do you think once I've got my PhD, and I'm making [~$37,000](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367), will that be more or less than the salary of someone who skipped grad school all together and just got a bachelors in [philosophy?](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors/page/8?orderBy=EarlyCareerPay&ascending=false) How about if I went into industry ([~$48,000/yr](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2015/12/09/350.6266.1367.DC1/aac5949_Zolas-SM.pdf)), would that still be less than the median for a new college graduate ([~$50,000](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/college/class-of-2018-starting-salary/index.html))? Should I be heartened to think that eventually a [biology PhD working the private sector](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/datatables/tab48.htm) will make more than [someone with a bachelors](https://data.bls.gov/PDQWeb/le) or should I keep in mind that data from middle aged workers all come from a market where PhDs were rare and can't adjust for the last several decades of record PhD production?\n\nHm, I guess I could always teach... which would probably mean adjunct status, since they teach [most](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noodleeducation/2015/05/28/more-than-half-of-college-faculty-are-adjuncts-should-you-care/) of the courses nowadays. If I went that route, I'd make about $25-40K/yr with little to no benefits, or I guess you could say: it would pay better to teach high school than college, which is kinda weird, but okay.\n\nBut gosh, I just love research! Maybe I should go private sector. I sure hope sticking with research doesn't mean I can expect to earn [less](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0241). And how many private sector bio PhDs get to actually stick with research anyway? Would you say the proportion of biomedical PhDs that stay in some form of research in the private sector is between 45-72% like in [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766) study? Or less than 10% like in [this](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1367) one? Because getting to pursue my (employer's) research interests was sort of central to the whole idea of getting a PhD in the first place!\n\nI just can't wait to really start my career! I bet you felt the same way back when more NIH funding went to \u201cearly-career\u201d researchers (\u2264 40 years old) compared to researchers \u2265 50 years old at a ratio of greater than 10. [*insert wry chuckle here*] Of course, nowadays that ratio has totally flipped and ten times more money goes to the older researchers. Maybe that's why some [74%](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/06/17/data-suggest-baby-boomer-faculty-are-putting-retirement) of professors aged 49-67 plan to delay retirement past age 65 or never retire at all. I mean, do you think if you graphed the age distribution of NIH PIs from [1980 to 2010](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/02/13/age-distribution-of-nih-principal-investigators-and-medical-school-faculty/) you'd actually be able to *see* the Baby Boomers get hold of the funding and then just hoard it? Heck, I bet there are more researchers with a major grant [75 years and older than there are 33 years or less](https://twitter.com/aarmey/status/565674331792244737)! No seriously, wanna bet? Let's put some money down; my stipend is paltry and I want to remember what meat tastes like.\n\nI sure am glad I was one of the lucky [30%](http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7574-597a) of American grad students to report obtaining useful career advice from their institutions and not one of those other poor souls enmeshed in an exploitative pyramid scheme where the half-life of a researcher is only [5 years](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/12/05/1800478115) and it doesn't even matter how much you produce. Ha! Publish and still perish!

All the stats are true, but many of people's proposed solutions (get all the dinosaurs out) are suicide. Imo the only time I see \"young\"= college rhetoric is when I'm dealing with rich white people that can do k-12+. Studies actually show most undergrads 36-75% (depending on whether you count community college and online) are non-traditional students (parents, veterans, second career, older, doing a degree over twice as long etc). We will finish our phds in our 40s and 50s, not 20s like our privileged advisors. We will have so much debt we need to work till we are 85-90. We have no retirement and likely never will. I'd like a chance before I even start. But that's ageism for you... Works both ways. Destroyed my chances of advancing when I was too young, so I started a new career and now I'm too old. FML.\n\nAnyway, I would use phrases like \"new ideas\" and not young ideas or whatever else. Old bodies can have fresh, ahead of the curve ideas and young, thin, rich, white bodies can have monstrous ideas.\n\nI imagine that eventually we'll all unionize if we are lucky and probably come up with bargaining option that spreads resources fairly between newer academics and those with experience and tenure (which is fair). BUT will base that not on graduation dates, but on age (which is illegal). After we get that seemingly wonderful deal, a year will pass, we'll get a job or not and then eventually go to draw on those new faculty resources only to be told too old. Then we'll beg to keep our jobs but eventually be told no, too old. We'll default on our debt, end up homeless. But there's a silver lining!!!

Classic tech/engineering payscales are far higher than biomed.\n\nFor example, I skipped a post-doc and applied to roughly 100 jobs looking in a very specific, non-bio rich area and received two offers. One from a large biotech conglomerate who offered $64k a year with paltry benefits and one in a traditional engineering company who offered $92k a year with not excellent, but solid bennies. I took the second offer and I love it. I am in the minority as a biologist, but that's a good thing in my line of work.

Search long and hard and learn how to sell the skills you gain in grad school- the teaching you do is communicating with diverse backgrounds about technical topics. The dissertation topic you research is how you execute a plan you've devised and work collaboratively to achieve your goals. Learn some program/project management speak and figure out how to hit those notes in a resume. And most of all, get an industry internship if your advisor will support it. It's typically the biggest barrier to hiring a PhD, that they don't have actual industry experience.
