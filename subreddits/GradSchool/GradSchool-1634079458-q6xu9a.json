  "text": "I just started my PhD. Because I\u2019m a neuro specialty, my program has it set to where I can\u2019t get less than an A- or else I am removed from the neuro specialty. \n\nI am very type A, insanely organized, and in undergrad I never had less than an A. My A\u2019s pretty much determine the value I see in myself. So now here I am, in a program where everyone is incredibly accomplished, and I am no longer able to reach the standards and keep up. \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I just can\u2019t focus. Maybe because in undergrad I would have one big project due once every two weeks, and now I have a big project to do every night? I set aside 8 hours yesterday to write a 7 page case study. How much did I write? A paragraph. That is all I could manage to do. I am burnt out and have barely started. A\u2019s used to be my motivation, and because I\u2019m not even getting A\u2019s, I feel like there is no point anymore. I took a midterm today and scored an 86 and was genuinely disappointed in myself. I check what the class average is for every assignment and I have consistently been falling under the class average. I feel so inadequate. This midterm was supposed to be my easy midterm, and I couldn\u2019t even manage an A. I have no motivation to write or study. I just feel constantly defeated. Last night I opened my DSM to read the diagnostic criteria and see if I have ADHD. I am already looking into psychiatrists to see if I need some form of medication. I just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with me because this isn\u2019t who I usually am. My mom has tried reminding me that people are not built to study as much as I am required to during this time. But I feel like lots of other people manage it successfully. Or maybe they struggle too, and struggles aren\u2019t talked about enough. \n\nI\u2019m trying to tell myself there is a learning curve. I came straight from undergrad into an insanely rigorous program, and there are students who have masters degrees who know more than me and it\u2019s ok they score higher because of that. But when I am seeing that I am falling below class average, that is why I am really starting to worry. Has anyone gone through something similar? When did you adjust? How do you not put all this pressure on yourself? Is there anything you learned about this process? \n\nI understand self care is important. I try to practice self care. But I get to a point where I have procrastinated so much that I can\u2019t even practice self care because there is no time anymore.",

      "text": "This is relatable and a lot of students experience it. I struggled through the coursework for 2 years but eventually made it through it. You have to just take it one day at a time and do your best. Talk to your graduate advisor to get some perspective on the program. Talk to your professors about the classes. Go to office hours, make friends, and study groups. All you can do is try your best. If you are getting nothing done, take a break, go have some fun. If you aren\u2019t going to get anything done at least enjoy a few hours off for that mental rest and reset",
