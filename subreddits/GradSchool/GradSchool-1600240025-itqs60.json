  "text": "I\u2019ll just keep it short. I feel like I haven\u2019t done anything in the past two weeks, which scares me. I have been suffering from depression for quite some time now (ever since I was a child, my therapist thinks). The therapy didn\u2019t seem to help a whole lot cause I am used to distracting myself by staying busy (an unhealthy coping mechanism, Ik). I have noticed that I got practically nothing done in the past couple of weeks, just barely getting by. Been watching a lot of Netflix (starring at it more like) and sleeping a LOT. I have a shitload of things to do, but I just feel like not existing. It\u2019s not related to work by any means, I have been okay with classes and lab stuff (so this ain\u2019t a downward spiral because I feel like a failure). I just have no motivation AT ALL. I love what I do, so I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on here. Thought of pouring my heart out on this sub cause I stopped talking to my therapist and don\u2019t have a SO/close enough friend that I can talk to at this hour. Would really appreciate any help on how to deal with this.\n\nUPDATE: thank you all so much for the kind words and the award. I truly don\u2019t have words to explain how much I appreciate all the suggestions everyone gave. I really really really hope there is some light at the end of this dark and lonely tunnel",

      "text": "It looks like you've gotten a lot of good advice already, but to add to it. I could have written this same post four months ago. I was in a dark place near the end of my degree process and felt like the finish line was so close, but I couldn't bring myself to do anything, my motivation was non-existent, and it felt very hopeless. \n\nMy lab was supportive, but we do computer modeling, so we were all working very separately with the pandemic, and it wasn't enough for me at the time, very isolating. I wanted to comment because at this low point in my life I actually fired my therapist for a bit because I felt like they weren't helping me, and I was so frustrated. \n\nI ended up taking almost a full month off, re-established some work boundaries, and focused on small victories. Editing one paragraph, fixing one graph, sometimes just opening a new document and giving it a name and saving it etc. Eventually, this, paired with deadlines, forced me into a productive/not cycle that allowed me to make forward progress. \n\nI ended up making another appointment with my therapist and told them that I was mad at them, and we re-addressed how we talked about things and approached problems, which helped a lot. I know right now everything feels impossibly hard, but it does get better. You can do it. Remeber to be kind to yourself.",

      "text": "OP your post resonates so much that I could have written it myself, except I\u2019ve been staring at the TV for a while longer than 2 weeks. The thing that helps me is getting workouts in. I paid for a membership to an exercise group and just the financial commitment makes me keep going for zoom sessions. And the best part is you can have your camera off so no fear of being judged. \n\nI know it\u2019s not a long term solution but on a day to day basis it gives me enough happy hormones to sustain myself. I\u2019m high functioning too. I\u2019m on top of my TA duties and an internship but only because those have externally mandated deadlines. For my research mostly I\u2019m staring at a screen blankly. Like I want to bring this work to a conclusion and I know I\u2019m capable but I can\u2019t motivate myself to start where I left off. \n\nAnd years of therapy has finally convinced me that my worth as a human being is not tied to my academic productivity. It\u2019s okay to not be at the top of your game at all times. It\u2019s okay to take time to heal. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. This is not a failure, but a pit stop. You need this time to work on yourself and don\u2019t feel guilty about it.",

You get a number of sessions for free, and then they will refer you to a local therapist who works with your insurance. They can also hook you up with a psychiatrist to get meds worked out.\n\nTake this seriously. Get help. You're smart for recognizing symptoms so quickly over the last couple of weeks. Reach out to your student health center for therapy/meds.",

      "text": "I get where you are coming from. I deal with similar feelings sometimes. Here are a few things I do to help me be more positive about myself and the work I am able to do.\n\n1) positive affirmations, I try to tell myself a statement that I can believe about myself and actions. They are simple statement such as 'I am doing a good job'. Sometimes the statement is not as lofty :p. Then it changes to 'I am a good person'. These statements can slowly help build your confidence in yourself.\n\n2) take baby steps on my work load. I make a plan to do one or two goals a day and then break it into smaller steps. Like I have to read a chapter in my book so I count the sections and try to get a halfway(ish) point before a break. Then I allot a certain amount of time to rest and then get back to it. Early on I set a timer. Now I don't and I end up doing more than the goals I set for the day... most days. On days I don't I spend more time on step three...(see the next one)\n\n3) I take note of what I did do that day and give myself honest praise. Early on, that meant talking to myself as if I was someone else, so I would not be harsh or sarcastic with myself. I tell myself I did a good job and that any step is a good step and that I can try to do better tomorrow but I did a good job today.\n\n4) I try to remember when you beat yourself up, all you get is bruised. It does you no good to whip your self for not doing better, it just hurts more in the long run. If I start to spiral I try to put up a stop sign in my mind to help me remember that's it's okay and I deserve to be loved by myself. I don't deserve to be hurt, and that I can do this.\n\n5) I do some deep breathing and try to remember,  'You got this'.\n\nI hope maybe some of these mental tricks might work for you. Overall, you are doing a great job right now by taking the time to notice how you feel and seeking help. I agree with all the others advice on maybe getting a therapist and/or meds but overall, you are on the right track. It won't always be this hard. \n\nYou got this. :) I believe in you and you deserve to believe in yourself. :)",

      "text": "If it makes you feel better, you\u2019re very far from alone. Things are hard for MOST people right now.\n\nFor example, in June the [US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm) found 74.9% of adults 18-24 and 51.9% of adults 25-44 had one or more adverse mental health issue at the time. Mental health struggles are relatively common in normal times, but they are dramatically higher than that right now to the point of actually being more common than not. And it stands to reason people who have struggled before may be having a particularly hard time right now.\n\nThe fact that these numbers are so abnormally bad right now actually gives me reason to hope. The circumstances that are causing this aren\u2019t going to last forever. And I think life will get a lot better for most people as they change. In the mean time, be forgiving and kind towards yourself. It\u2019s a rough time, it\u2019s normal to be struggling because of it.",

These brought a lot of gratitude towards me and made me feel like I had an impact on someone else\u2019s life as a scientist.\n- I told my PI that I was going through a rough time in my personal life and that I just wanted him to know that. Lowering his expectations helped me lower my own.\n- I set a limit on the amount of work I would do per day. I used to do way too much until being absolutely drained at the end of each day. I want to be as productive as I was but going from 0 to everything was not working. So I now do one or two experiments of my own per day and try to convince myself that that\u2019s enough. \n- At the end of each day I say out loud the following: \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself because today I did _____\u201d. I\u2019m not actually proud, but I know that psychologically we are wired under the principle of commitment and consistency, so I\u2019m hoping that saying this every day makes me do more things to be proud of. \n\nI hope you find yourself again.

Be kind to yourself, take real breaks without feeling guilty, in the long run it's not going to hurt your degree.\n\nI agree with the other commenters, it's time to take care of yourself, find another therapist and/or see a doctor for your depression. Because it sounds like you're depressed. I've been there, I didn't see anyone, I spent a whole semester holed up in my room doing the bare minimum in lab and classes. Let me tell you, it's not worth it. Not because of losing productivity, but because of not living your life and being able to enjoy the things you enjoy.",

If you had the flu, would you hate yourself for throwing up?\n\n2. If you had allergies, it would you hate yourself for sneezing?\n\n3. If you broke your leg, would you hate yourself for needing crutches?\n\nDepression is a medical condition. One of the most noticable (to me at least) symptoms is fatigue. \n\nAnother question, if you were vomiting from the flu for 3 weeks, would you see a doctor? \n\n Because it might be time. Research high functioning depression. That is the kind that I have. I get my work done, and everything I am required to do. Then nothing else. That isn't living; it is existing, and it is hella dangerous. \n\nThey put me on medication and my life changed dramatically for the better. I used to think that I was strong enough not to need it. That was a hella crazy thought. It isn't about strong, it is about enjoying the time I have on this planet as opposed to enduring. \n\nIf you don't like your current therapist pick another one. And when you are ready, have a conversation with your doctors about medication. See what they have to say about it. Life is short.

My grad experience would have been so much better (and probably shorter) if I was on meds the whole time instead of waiting until the end to get back on. If meds are right for you, they can take several weeks to begin working, so starting sooner rather than later can make a big difference.\nIf it's impacting your work, I would consider bringing it up with your advisor. Mine was surprisingly understandable.",
