  "text": "I\u2019m (25f) at midterms in my ENG graduate program. It\u2019s my second year and taking a full course load. This fall, I accepted a position mentoring ENG students at my local university. It makes me happy. I\u2019m contractually obligated to be present 20 hrs/week. I also took a position this past summer on an army base fulfilling orders for a really big DoD supplier. I need the money. It\u2019s also rewarding and makes me happy.\n\nSo:\n\n-Fully enrolled in grad school.\n-15 to 20hrs/week on base.\n-20hrs/week mentoring.\n-Teaching mini-lessons on Mondays under instructor supervision.\n\nI want to do it all. \nI can\u2019t let go of a single part of it because that, to me, is failure.\n\nSimultaneously, I feel like I\u2019m doing poorly in every aspect of my life. I\u2019m not operating at my finest at either job. I feel like each assignment I submit is an embarrassment. Discussion boards and zoom discussions leave me nauseous because my cohort can easily see I\u2019m not the sharpest tool in the shed. My students aren\u2019t getting the best of me. I\u2019m essentially a joke. \n\nI\u2019m grouchy with my fianc\u00e9 every day. I\u2019m crying most days. I\u2019ve gained 30 lbs. I\u2019m financially stretched thin and recently found myself under a mountain of (very necessary) debt\u2014 vehicle tore up and I needed ATM cash off my credit cards for a down payment (and fuck you, Discover, for making it difficult to cancel drafts). I don\u2019t make a habit of such things, but every cent we\u2019ve had lately has gone towards winter proofing the house or we will be freezing to death this winter. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I have so much to be thankful for. I am privileged to be where I am and I\u2019m so grateful to everyone who has made that possible\u2014 my parents, my advisor, my fianc\u00e9, my relatives. I have a home. A vehicle. My fianc\u00e9 and my family. I just feel so worn thin. I\u2019m laughing and crying manically on the way home basically every evening. I\u2019m silently crying myself asleep, my peacefully sleeping fianc\u00e9 laying next to me, unaware. I\u2019m not who I used to be. I can never manage to get enough sleep and there are days that I just want to curl up and die but I don\u2019t have the time.\n\nI\u2019m growing to hate myself. Be embarrassed of myself. I feel like an entire failure and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nReddit, please help. Positive and negative perspectives. All of it.",

Honestly, a key reason you are so stressed is your commute time: it is 2.5 hours. Did you know that there is a direct correlation between life satisfaction and work commute time?

You're miserable, your health has deteriorated, you're doing unnecessary damage to the thing guys like me would KILL to have (a fianc\u00e9)... It's probably best that, instead of living with this anxiety that you might FAIL if you quit one of these jobs, you can take comfort in the fact that you already did. Potential failure is not ahead of you; it's actually already behind you.\n\nSo... Now process your feelings on your acknowledgement of failure, and more importantly, realize that even though you already did it, it's not too late to salvage what you need, since you still have your program, you still have whichever job you feel is necessary, you still have your fiance, and you still have a beating heart, so you've still got a chance to correct your health.\n\nI once got fired from a job. Not laid off, but literally fired. For being really, really bad at it. Imagine how that must have felt for a guy who was valedictorian of his class, graduated college with an engineering degree and a 3.7 GPA, and who, up until that point, had been doing fine in the working world for 9 years and was just trying to move up, and I failed HARD. And the moment, THE MOMENT, that I instantly felt better about everything, after the sheer turmoil of knowing how impossible my situation was for month after month, was the moment I got fired. That was literally the turning point towards success.\n\nThat's why acknowledging that you already failed is good. You already hit rock bottom, and now things can and will improve!",

      "text": "If you are now realizing that you are spreading yourself thin, then it makes sense that you are feeling this way. Maybe at some point you were genuinely happy that you were ABLE to tackle on mentoring, helping out at the army base, and most importantly your career goal as a grad student. There is one other thing that you may have forgotten to squeeze into your life though and that is taking care of yourself. Sure, helping others is important, but I believe that you must help yourself out first before you give your energy and time to others or else your perspective of self goes down. Prioritize what you want for YOU. I\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t do everything you want, however, some thing always has to give. Being a GRAD student is already time consuming ( I don\u2019t mean this in a bad way) and as a student you should try to enjoy and learn as much as you can. Enjoy the process of being a student while you take good care of yourself. \n\nIf you are feeling like a joke to your mentees, then what\u2019s the point of mentoring?!? Ideally, a mentor is someone who uplifts others and gives others advice. Right now, you\u2019re not able to do that so perhaps take a step back from this and instead cater that energy to rejuvenating yourself. Get back to it when you are done with graduate school or taking a break. \n\nYou are not a failure! You having a lot on your plate and not doing it all does NOT equate to being a failure. It\u2019s okay to restructure your agenda. That\u2019s part of life. \n\nSo my advice for you is, I hope you consider minimizing your to-do list so that you can cater that time to your health and well-being. Spend that time doing your hobbies too. You gotta try to balance it out. That\u2019s something that I try to incorporate into my life and something that I have to remind myself as life progresses. \n\nYou got this! \ud83d\ude42",

I ended up quitting my extra jobs after my first quarter. Fast-forward several years later, and I'm now working at a start-up during my last year of grad school. It's tough but more reasonable when you don't also have courses. It's also easier if your job is somehow related to your degree; for example, I TA every quarter, and even though it can be a bit dull at times, I always try and get a class related to my field, which helps me stay sharp about the fundamentals.\n\nWhen I was much younger and ambitious, I kept my focus on working around the clock to earn more money or publish faster, but I've realized the most important thing is maintaining a good work/life balance. You'll probably be done with your engineering degree in a couple of years, but you might be with your SO for the rest of your life. Strengthening that long-lasting relationship is a far better investment for long-term happiness than anything you do during grad school.",

If you already feel like a failure, then surely there's nowhere to go but up? \n\nOf course, you aren't a failure, just stretched so thin. You can already identify that you are not giving your students 100%, you are nauseous on Zoom discussions (probably because you don't have the luxury of reviewing class material like your cohort, not because of anything to do with your intelligence or how smart you are). It's not fair to you or the people who rely on you for you to promise them your 100% when you physically, mentally, cannot do that. \n\nI know it is easy to tell yourself \"Oh, I'll just plan my day this way to make everything work\", but from your self-reflection in this post itself, it sounds like you know there's no way to make everything work. That's also OK. You say that both these jobs make you happy but in the same post, you talk about how miserable you are. Think deeply about what you really enjoy and what you want out of your grad school experience. Being miserable doesn't have to be part of that experience.",

You are worthy of happiness, of having time to relax and breathe, of taking care of your health, of enjoying time with your partner. Make sure that this program is working for you, like literally putting money in your pocket or putting you in a place to earn enough to take care of yourself very soon after graduation, or else it's taking advantage of you and burning you out in the process. You don't always heal from everything so be careful with yourself <3",

These are incredible assets for you that are hard to learn, and will continue to be going forward. I respect *so much* that you are giving this a shot. Seriously. And I understand hating to feel like a failure or like a letdown to yourself on a personal level. I very much resonate with that. \n\nHowever...having said all of that. I started a year and a half ago with full time graduate school, full time job, part time creative work to make money on the side, and what felt like a whole other part time job thanks to legal obligations and comm serv, etc. I was HYPE my first semester because I felt like I had it ALL going on. I was getting good grades, I was doing fine at work as I normally do (it's not rocket science), I was cranking out creative work, and I didn't miss any of my court-ordered weekly sessions. As someone who *likes* to be consistently stressed and have a lot on her plate, I thought I could do it. I function well in these scenarios.\n\nAnd then something switched...I no longer liked myself. I liked my school (loved it). I was neutral about my job (it's money; quitting is not optional). I was proud of my creative output. I was making it. But I HATED me! I had no time for family and pushed them aside. I was moody at work where I am face to face with clients all day and that cannot happen. I didn't exercise. My house was a mess. My relationship was tense.\n\nSo, quite simply, I tried something I have never tried in my life: I scaled back. I cut school back to part time. I work full time still. I stopped creative work on the side entirely. I felt like an absolute POS for a little bit. But it got better. It IS better. I am happier, I am healthier, I am more connected to my friends and family, and I am performing my *best* at work and at school. \n\nAfter doing that for a semester, I added more back to my schedule VERY gradually. I started thesis preparation and proposal work. I sit on a Graduate Advisory board this year (because I became a better student and was recommended by a professor, which would NOT have happened prior to my scaling back, I can promise you). And I'm managing everything without hating myself, hating my schedule, and hating getting up in the morning.\n\nRemember: Failure is on YOUR terms. Work on *redefining your terms* if you can. Right now failure to you might be letting a commitment go. But failing to make yourself happy also stinks! Maybe repeat this to yourself so you can gain some self-love back and look at your obligations/careers/education in a different light. I promise you what you want to be there will be there, it just takes redefining failure and redefining success. It might be tough but it sounds like you can absolutely do this.",

I'm at the end, grinding out my dissertation and trying to get at least a few people to look over my chapters before I defend.\n\nYou're burning the candle at both ends. Trying to have two separate jobs on top of a mentoring job, instructing a class, and being a grad student will grind you to a nub in no time at all. A big symptom of burnout, is, well, everything you're saying about yourself, including this: \"I want to do it all. I can\u2019t let go of a single part of it because that, to me, is failure.\" This is an attitude that is also a systemic issue in academia, which is the lie that if you can't do everything, then you're not capable of doing anything. The biggest untold lesson of grad school is setting and maintaining healthy boundaries with advisors, faculty, other students, and most importantly, yourself. This includes saying no to things. It's tempting to want to do it all, but especially in times like this, you have to be mindful of your daytime energy/productivity. As I've told my boss, my philosophy is \"know thyself\". And trust me, it's taken me almost 5 years to figure it out.\n\nNow let's talk practical matters. I'm a Ph.D. candidate, and I know that on my salary, money can be tight. But how I rake in cash has to be balanced with what I'm capable of doing in a day, week, or even a month. I couldn't imagine\nhaving to have a job outside of grad school, but I know it's been done. This is burning you out, and your health as a human being is ultimately higher on the ladder than spreading yourself out amongst several jobs/positions. My recommendation, if it's possible financially, would be to ditch the jobs outside of the university and just focus on grad school. Ask your faculty about scholarships/fellowships that you can apply for. Get as much money as you can through those avenues.\n\nWhen you're this overwhelmed, it's easy to call yourself names and be hard on yourself, but you're loading yourself with way too much work.  You're not a failure, you matter, and you will make it through grad school, but to ensure that success you're going to need to prioritize your health.\n\nEDIT: Had to delete my old comment because the fancier editor in reddit was exponentially growing the number of copy/pastes I was doing.

During my Master's program I was a full time student working two part-time jobs (about 40 hours a week total), engaged, planning a wedding, and absolutely struggling. If you keep going at rate you are, you are going to burnout. Trust me, it's not pleasant. I get needing the work in order to be financially able to function. I was in the same place; I didn't have parents who could financially help me if I got into trouble. But I also had members of my cohort asking me how I was still functioning multiple times per semester.\n\nThe problem was that I was so used to depending on myself that this was the norm. I had done it all through my undergrad as well. \n\nWhat I didn't realize is that my fear of failure and deep need to be perfect were caused my anxiety, which was exacerbated by how much stress I was putting on myself. Again, you need to take care of yourself before you burnout. Find a counselor. Talk to them about what you are going through and coping mechanisms to handle stress.\n\nMy main advice: talk to your fiance. They are your support system, and the two of you are in this together. Let them know the stress you are experiencing, and communicate openly with them. My now husband was my rock. Any time imposter syndrome kicks in, they can be your support. But you have to be open with them and not take your frustration out on them. Talk to them about your worries and finances, and make a plan together. Don't suffer in silence. \n\nDon't give up. There are a lot of people rooting for you.",

You\u2019re not alone. \n\nHere\u2019s what I will ask you: do you *need* to be happy to complete grad school and work two part time jobs? \n\nIf the answer is yes, then you know you need to let something go. Whether that be a job, or walk away from grad school, you need to do some soul searching and figure out what you are willing to sacrifice if you want to be happy. \n\nIf the answer is no, that you don\u2019t need to be happy to finish grad school, then just get through it. Grad school isn\u2019t forever. Set your own standard of what you want to get out of university, be reasonable of your expectations of yourself, and don\u2019t not worry about what colleagues/profs are doing or might think of you. \n\nOddly enough, when I decided I didn\u2019t need to be happy to get through grad school, I felt leagues better.

You mentioned that you feel you aren't doing well enough at your different tasks, but is this perception accurate?  \n\nWhen I went back to finish my undergrad and then did my master's degree I was working multiple jobs.  Quitting a bunch of them just wasn't an option and the ones that were an option were the ones that I enjoyed and got the most fulfillment out of.  I was definitively stretched thinner than I liked and my grades were not as high as I wanted, but they were more than adequate for what I needed and work, while wishing I had more availability, was happy with what I was doing.  So even though there were times I FELT like everything was going to shit and I was about to totally fail the reality was that I was doing better than the minimal acceptable performance at everything, typically much better.  \n\nQuite often we are our harshest critics in life.  A quick perusal of your posting history suggests you might be harsher on yourself than most are.  \n\nThe other thing to consider is how long this is going to last.  You've mentioned that your fianc\u00e9 has pointed out to you that this is a temporary situation and something to just get through.  When we are in the moment it can often be hard to look forward to how things will be in the future.  If this situation is going to last for 6 months that is a very different situation than if it is going to last for 5 years.  \n\nI am neither advocating that you keep going as you are, nor for you to reduce your work load.  Instead I am just suggesting that you make sure to have an accurate evaluation of your performance, which could largely rely on others, such as what grades you actually got versus feared, and how your fianc\u00e9 thinks you treat him versus how you fear you treat him.

      "text": "Yes. I am living that life right now. It mostly depends on you and where you are in your degree. If you are into the research phase, then it should be easyish depending on your research. \nTaking classes... harder, but still possible.\n\nIf you can't handle it, that is fine. No shame. Each degree is different. Each person is different. Every commute is diffetent. What you are doing takes practice. It took me years to figure out the balance. If you can't manage the time, it isn't a failure. It is recognizing you took on too much, tried it, and learned from the challenge.\n\nDeep breath. Admitting you need to change is the hardest step. Once you get past that, life gets easier. While your current place seems cheap financially, what is it costing you in fuel? If you commute 2.5 hours a day and fiance does 2 hours, at $3 a gallon, what is that per week? Per month? Can you find a place closer for that cost? If your hourly wage is $10 an hour, how much would you be earning a week if you paid you to study instead of driving?\n\nI thought of moving to a cheaper place until I factored in my extra travel time. Combine that with the cost of moving and I would have only saved $1k over 6 months. Do the same math. Moving closer to your school/job might be cheaper than all of those commutes.\n\nPro tip. Have a vehicle. That helps speed things up. Also makes getting too and from jobs much easier. Since you are struggling with that, I would think dropping some of the workload would be a good idea.\nBuses are great if you can use that time to your advantage. If you can read articles or listen to lectures, then great. Multitasking is great. I get bus sick. So I use that time for naps. But set alarms or have really nice drivers. I have missed my stop several times! :)",
