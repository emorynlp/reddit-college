As weird as it sounds, this quarantine period has given me a newfound appreciation for the sheer amount of reading humanities students do for their research. I\u2019m a wet bench stem grad student and because of the lock downs, I can\u2019t go into lab and have just been exclusively reading papers. I\u2019m starting to get stir crazy not being able to hold a pipette and also realizing how terrible my reading stamina is. My bf is a humanities grad student and has already read a book and a half today like it\u2019s nothing, and from what I understand, this is fairly standard for the humanities. It\u2019s honestly commendable, you guys are awesome :)", "author": "TeaAndBiscotti", "created": 1586728633, "retrieved": 1632845258, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 642, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fnbw2h8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/g05pg1/shout_out_to_humanities_grad_students/fnbw2h8/", "text": "I feel that too!
