Talk with your advisor or a more senior grad student in your research group and see if they have any papers or something to help you get acquainted with the literature.  Focus on how they formulated their problem and how they structured their experiment.  \n\nMy time is split up to:\n\n1. Work work (grant-funded work, so deliverables and other tasks)\n2. Thesis work (trying to graduate)\n3. Classes (I haven't taken a class in years, but I still drop in on certain lectures or courses I'm interested in sitting in on.)\n\nDuring my \"free\" time, I also have joined:\n\n1. Email lists that gives seminars related to my field from different universities (I attend presentations I find interesting)\n2. Conference organization meetings \n\nMost of these things you need to already be setup and running on.  Being a new grad student, you're going to be eased into it.  Don't worry, it's coming.

It can really range, I did a MS in research, so I was in my lab doing that stuff.

They finally came back yesterday so I\u2019m going in in 2 hours.
