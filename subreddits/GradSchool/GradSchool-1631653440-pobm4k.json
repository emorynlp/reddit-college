Maybe the worst part is that the grant itself was done. It was done yesterday. I was waiting on a final sponsor document from my PI (there were a couple that trickled in through the morning). I emailed thirty minutes before deadline, heard nothing, finally got it less than 5 mins before (turns out it was trapped in his drafts). Then as I was uploading, the deadline hit. Tried to email and call, and was politely but firmly told no, they only do extensions if you ask before deadline, this isn't an extenuating circumstance, and I should've submitted earlier to avoid this sort of thing. I know they're right. If I got the ball rolling on everything in my proposal earlier, my PI would also have started his bits earlier too, and I could've submitted well before the deadline. But the part of me that spent so much time and energy on this feels awful. I don't need another week or another day to write or revise. The thing is finished! I just need a few minutes.\n\nPI asked for their email address and I think is now trying to beg/schmooze on my behalf, which is great, in that there might actually be a chance I can still submit -- though also slightly embarrassing that I needed my boss to sweep in to remedy my fuck-up. I think he's probably annoyed at me for understandable reasons.\n\nAnyone wanna commiserate/share tales of unexpected grace shown post-deadline to feed my false hope?", "author": "rudolfvirchowaway", "created": 1631653440, "retrieved": 1632844547, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hcy4ygw": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pobm4k/missed_a_grant_deadline_and_i_feel_like_such_a/hcy4ygw/", "text": "I submitted a grant last month that I worked 8 months nearly every day on.

Come to find out, I\u2019d given my references the FOA number from the year prior and immediately felt like an idiot. I\u2019d triple checked everything but somehow I missed this. I called and they were able to route my letters to the correct FOA and I think I thanked the guy on the phone at least 500 times. It sounds like your PI is on your side and if they thought there was no chance in fixing things, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d even try to contact the organization.
