And the \"it's like you're not even thinking.\" And let's not mention when I was writing my dissertation and I was told it was like I couldn't write anymore. It was awful and disheartening for years. And I consider my PI a good one, believe it or not! \nBut it was worth it when I had a beer with my PI and was commended for the work I had done and progress I made. And at the end of it all when my PI got up there and introduced me at my defense as the best student writer he'd ever had. This feedback is normal, for better or for worse, and so is feeling like a failure or an imposter. \nIt's horribly difficult, and it took everything for me to get through the worst of times, but at the end of it all, I'm glad for it. It made me a better scientist, academic, thinker, problem solver, and person. I became more confident in myself (ironic how that works) so that I was ready to take on anything, and grew a skin so thick I don't know that anything will ever phase me professionally again. It made me who I am, brought me to where I am (NOT academia lol), and I'm glad for it. \nJust try to hang in there, learn from it, and believe that things can get better.
