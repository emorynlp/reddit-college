  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am wondering what your thoughts are on Masters programs in marketing (not MBA)... I've seen these programs get some flak on the internet in the past.\n\nI have the opportunity to go to a t15 school right out of undergrad (fall 2022), and am curious whether going will improve my employability or career prospect in a significant way.\n\nAny insight appreciated!\n\nThanks!",
