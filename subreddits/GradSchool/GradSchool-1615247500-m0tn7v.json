I had PIs tell me that they don\u2019t know how I got into my program, and that the grants I want to apply for are a pipe dream for someone \u201clike me\u201d. I had one PI call me a slacker and many others insult my intelligence and ability. I watched all of my friends commit to labs happily for months before me. I experienced students tell others that I was the problem. Even my own program heads were questioning what was taking me so long. Almost everyone told me what I wanted out of a PI was not possible, that I was being too picky, that I needed to \u201cjust choose already\u201d.\n\nToday, after 17 zoom interviews, 5 rotations, and 7 months of searching while balancing some of the worst self-doubt and pressure to join a lab from my department: I found a PI who truly believes in me, supports me, and inspires me everyday. And I could not be more proud to officially join their laboratory. \n\nTL;DR Never settle\n\nEdit 1: Thanks for the support/ awards/ kind remarks. I acknowledge the privileged situation I was in to be able to take so many rotations and speak to so many PIs. I wrote this in hopes to let people know that regardless of your situation in life you don\u2019t have to settle for less than you deserve. I settled in a horribly abusive relationship for many years of my life, and recently I have been able to prioritize not doing so in personal and professional aspects. I want those reading this to know it *does* get better.

You're honestly privileged to be in a major where you can get into a program before getting a PI. We have to have a PI lined up already for admissions to even look at your application and you're often committing to their lab without having a chance to even meet them in person, unless you've been fortunate enough to have had an undergrad internship with them. Then it's very hard to switch labs after getting in because other labs have already lined up all the grad students they want and you've usually signed onto your PI's grant when you accepted which makes it awkward to leave", "author": "bi_smuth", "created": 1615313575, "upvotes": 6}, "gqcsksl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/m0tn7v/to_new_graduate_students_never_settle/gqcsksl/", "text": "Your PI is roughly 95% of your PhD experience.

Sometimes it was money, but sometimes it was accusations or assumptions of not being good enough, passionate enough, hard-working enough. The list goes on and on. I eventually found a PI in a different department who really believed in me and was comfortable investing in me as a scientist (but I still eyed other universities just in case before deciding on this group).
