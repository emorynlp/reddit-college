Too much embellishments make it difficult to focus on the important bits. In terms of the background I usually just opt for something simple (i.e. white background with blue square header on the top where the title goes in)\n\n\\- Try to use bigger fonts. Older audiences and those with bad eyes will appreciate it.\n\n\\- Keep it succinct & concise. Too much unnecessary details can derail the presentation from your main topic. If someone really wants to know some detail they can ask during the Q&A time.\n\nSo, all in all it's not really a bad idea to aim for a minimalist approach. Just make sure you don't exclude too much info so as to make it difficult for your audiences to understand your point.\n\nHope this helps and good luck", "author": "km61", "created": 1632460189, "upvotes": 5}}}
