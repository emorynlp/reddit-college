  "text": "I'm having a report next week, and I have to say PowerPoint presentations are my biggest insecurities during class. I don't want boring slides but at the same time, my aesthetic is gearing towards minimalism. I'm not a fan of cramming long paragraphs in a single side either. Any tips and tricks on how to win this report? Like I know my topic inside & out, but I'm just too conscious about the visual aspect of my report.",

Presentations that are visually simples in fact do the job.\n\nFont always 20+, choose a good font though.\n\nGo for colours that are subtler than the neon ones. \n\nWhen you are not referring to something in a slide, insert a blank slide so that the audience focus reverts to you and not to whats up there.\n\nTime and practice the slideshow.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Here's some tips from my experience:\n\n\\- No one likes to read off entire paragraphs from the slides so it's usually a good idea to just include the main idea/topic in the slide with some visual aides to go with it (figures, tables, maybe some mathematical equations depending on your field)\n\n\\- Not everything you say needs to be included in the slide!\n\n\\- Don't use too much colors or designs in your slides. Too much embellishments make it difficult to focus on the important bits. In terms of the background I usually just opt for something simple (i.e. white background with blue square header on the top where the title goes in)\n\n\\- Try to use bigger fonts. Older audiences and those with bad eyes will appreciate it.\n\n\\- Keep it succinct & concise. Too much unnecessary details can derail the presentation from your main topic. If someone really wants to know some detail they can ask during the Q&A time.\n\nSo, all in all it's not really a bad idea to aim for a minimalist approach. Just make sure you don't exclude too much info so as to make it difficult for your audiences to understand your point.\n\nHope this helps and good luck",
