Basically, I was an ok undergrad  academically (~3.3 GPA) but was involved in research from my freshman year. I received REU funding from my university, NSF, and NASA and co-authored publications in high profile journals like Science. Presented at conferences. Etc. I was doing everything right. Or so I thought... \n\nWent to apply for PhD right after undergrad because I had the pipe dream of being a professor one day. My undergrad advisor also offered to fund an \"accelerated\" masters at my alma mater if I didn't receive any PhD offers. Well, I took the GRE. Bombed the math portion. Got rejected from every school I applied to because of it. Ended up staying for the 1-year master's at my alma mater where I worked really hard to maintain a 4.0.\n\nI apply again the next year and got into every single school I applied to with full fucking funding. With the exception of Cambridge. But I got shortlisted for the Gates Cambridge for that. I was ecstatic. I ended up accepting a position in Florida after Cambridge didn't work out. I was still super excited and proud of finally having made it. To top it all off, I was invited to speak at my fields biggest conference this December to present my masters work!\n\nNow I'm potentially unable to move to Florida in August because of it being a coronavirus hotspot. Everything is in shambles. My advisor is unsure of funding after this year because of budget cuts, labs are closed, and classes that have heavy lab components will end up being online. The move is over 2000 miles and I don't have a car. Things are not looking good for being able to fly and my friend who was going to help me move and just road trip through the mountains on the way back is now backing out (understandably). \n\nIdk why I'm posting this. I guess I just need to vent. I'm just heartbroken and stressed. Im the first in my family to go to college and was making strides to break the cycle of poverty. Im mad that I've tried so hard only for it to all get taken out from under me because people can't wear masks and social distance for 2 months so the virus can be contained.\n\nAlso, I'm curious how other people who were supposed to start programs this fall are handling this.

This situation sucks ass and it's TOTALLY valid to be frustrated and upset and heartbroken!!  It's SO awesome that you got fully funded acceptances almost everywhere, hopefully somewhere underneath all of the frustration and pain, you're still super proud of your journey because you've done amazing things!  No virus can take away those accomplishments.\n\nI'm supposed to start my PhD program on September 1st and I'm approaching meltdown levels.  I'm going the opposite direction (from a hotspot to one that's known for throwing up quarantines on out-of-state travelers) and there's a likelihood that my friend who's helping me move may have to back out if the quarantines become a thing again--I also don't have a car so I feel you on THAT struggle.  (This is also assuming something doesn't happen to the place I was renting because my two roommates are international students.)  My classes, lab rotations, and TA assignments are going to be a HOT mess because the university is doing a REALLY convoluted system of shifting class days and alternating online and in-person weeks.  Funding is going to be a whole horse of a different color and I don't think ANYONE knows how that's going to play out for us too.  \n\nAs far as advice, have you tried reaching out to your department and maybe your grad student orgs to see if they know of any incoming students from any departments who may be heading in the same direction?   If you're going to a larger university, there's always the chance that someone else may be in a similar boat and be willing to split the cost of a truck or a van rental.  Also check with your grad college about emergency loans that you can repay by letting them pull it out of your paycheck over the next X pay periods.  Is your advisor willing to help you with trying to apply for external funding?  I know that the NSF-GRFP is probably off the table because of the masters (unless there's a provision for students who did that sort of accelerated program, IDK the full eligibility but it can't hurt to read through the solicitation and look for loopholes) but depending on your area, maybe there's another government agency or external foundations that you can apply to, especially if your advisor is willing to help you with the process.\n\n\n\nIt's TOTALLY okay to be upset and stressed out right now, and you're not alone.  <3  You're more than welcome to DM me anytime if you need someone else to vent to or commiserate with!", "author": "LadyWolfshadow", "created": 1594342109, "upvotes": 2}, "fxhb00l": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ho7r4v/rant_my_attempts_at_starting_a_phd_have_been_a/fxhb00l/", "text": "You don't need a car to move - if you can get to a greyhound station, you can move most of your belongings through that, and then fly there.

The state will get shut down eventually and college campuses are generally safer (so long as the schools are closed - and I imagine they will be).\n\nI think the only issue is whether or not your funding pulls through. Also, your classes will probably all be online, so you shouldn't actually even have to move down there yet.\n\nI think you're in a good spot relatively speaking, minus the fact that online learning sucks and your funding might fall through.

They might be able to give you more information about what online classes might look like, and whether it would even make sense for you to move there at all, until things start to open up for real. \n\nI would also see if you can get in touch with other students who were supposed to start at the same time in your program. At the very least they should be able to commiserate; best case scenario you might be able to connect with someone you could travel with to get across the country. \n\nAs for funding, I would suggest looking into outside funding sources that you can apply for on your own. If you don't know where to start looking, it's perfectly fine to ask your PhD advisor about it - they will probably be very happy that you're this motivated. If you're staying in the same field as your master's degree, then you can also ask any faculty that you have a good relationship with at your undergrad/master's institution. \n\nPlease don't be afraid or feel guilty about asking  for help or feel like you need to figure it all out alone. \n\nOne last thing - if you're not already on twitter to connect with other academics and professionals in your field, I'd recommend it.
