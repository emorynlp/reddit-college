  "title:": "Rant: My attempts at starting a PhD have been a series of unfortunate events.",
  "text": "Gonna try to keep this short. Basically, I was an ok undergrad  academically (~3.3 GPA) but was involved in research from my freshman year. I received REU funding from my university, NSF, and NASA and co-authored publications in high profile journals like Science. Presented at conferences. Etc. I was doing everything right. Or so I thought... \n\nWent to apply for PhD right after undergrad because I had the pipe dream of being a professor one day. My undergrad advisor also offered to fund an \"accelerated\" masters at my alma mater if I didn't receive any PhD offers. Well, I took the GRE. Bombed the math portion. Got rejected from every school I applied to because of it. Ended up staying for the 1-year master's at my alma mater where I worked really hard to maintain a 4.0.\n\nI apply again the next year and got into every single school I applied to with full fucking funding. With the exception of Cambridge. But I got shortlisted for the Gates Cambridge for that. I was ecstatic. I ended up accepting a position in Florida after Cambridge didn't work out. I was still super excited and proud of finally having made it. To top it all off, I was invited to speak at my fields biggest conference this December to present my masters work!\n\nNow I'm potentially unable to move to Florida in August because of it being a coronavirus hotspot. Everything is in shambles. My advisor is unsure of funding after this year because of budget cuts, labs are closed, and classes that have heavy lab components will end up being online. The move is over 2000 miles and I don't have a car. Things are not looking good for being able to fly and my friend who was going to help me move and just road trip through the mountains on the way back is now backing out (understandably). \n\nIdk why I'm posting this. I guess I just need to vent. I'm just heartbroken and stressed. Im the first in my family to go to college and was making strides to break the cycle of poverty. Im mad that I've tried so hard only for it to all get taken out from under me because people can't wear masks and social distance for 2 months so the virus can be contained.\n\nAlso, I'm curious how other people who were supposed to start programs this fall are handling this. Hope you're all holding up better than I am... <3",

A large part of being a scientist, especially in academia, is learning to accept setbacks and being uncomfortable. \n\nI had my thesis changed 3 times by my advisor and committee before my advancement to candidacy. I was still technically ahead of schedule and powering towards a December graduation in 4.5 years, but COVID happened. It blows, but you learn along the way. I have a lot more skills now than I did before.\n\nIt sounds like you got a paper, a master's, and a whole other set of skills by the delay and still got into good schools. In the moment, it always seems like the world is ending, but life has a way of working things out for you.",

It is entirely possible to get into programs without doing this, but it's always nice to not waste time/money on the application for a school that doesn't have funding for new students that year.",

First day of class program was terminated and department dissolved.  \n\nSpent a year prepping for the GRE's and then applied to half a dozen programs.  Rejected from every one of them.  On a whim, sent in an application to UNC Chapel Hill, a far better program than I had been applying to, but was cheap so figured why not and got in for a masters.  \n\nSadly post masters I had to take a break from school for health reasons.  \n\nYou are in a FAR better position than I ever was, so hang in there.  I suggest if you do have to do another round of applications to talk to potential advisors early.  Many first gen grad students learn this the hard way.\n\nAs for the virus, if you are healthy, a campus may be one of the best places for you.  Have healthcare on site, you will be away from family and ideally, still be able to be safe.  Transportation is an issue, but may be able to rent a car and many flights are still going.\n\nPlan B is to see if you can defer your acceptance to next year and let the virus pass.  This may be the way you want to go too if your labs will be closed and funding is questionable.",

It's SO awesome that you got fully funded acceptances almost everywhere, hopefully somewhere underneath all of the frustration and pain, you're still super proud of your journey because you've done amazing things!  No virus can take away those accomplishments.\n\nI'm supposed to start my PhD program on September 1st and I'm approaching meltdown levels.  I'm going the opposite direction (from a hotspot to one that's known for throwing up quarantines on out-of-state travelers) and there's a likelihood that my friend who's helping me move may have to back out if the quarantines become a thing again--I also don't have a car so I feel you on THAT struggle.  (This is also assuming something doesn't happen to the place I was renting because my two roommates are international students.)  My classes, lab rotations, and TA assignments are going to be a HOT mess because the university is doing a REALLY convoluted system of shifting class days and alternating online and in-person weeks.  Funding is going to be a whole horse of a different color and I don't think ANYONE knows how that's going to play out for us too.  \n\nAs far as advice, have you tried reaching out to your department and maybe your grad student orgs to see if they know of any incoming students from any departments who may be heading in the same direction?   If you're going to a larger university, there's always the chance that someone else may be in a similar boat and be willing to split the cost of a truck or a van rental.  Also check with your grad college about emergency loans that you can repay by letting them pull it out of your paycheck over the next X pay periods.  Is your advisor willing to help you with trying to apply for external funding?  I know that the NSF-GRFP is probably off the table because of the masters (unless there's a provision for students who did that sort of accelerated program, IDK the full eligibility but it can't hurt to read through the solicitation and look for loopholes) but depending on your area, maybe there's another government agency or external foundations that you can apply to, especially if your advisor is willing to help you with the process.\n\n\n\nIt's TOTALLY okay to be upset and stressed out right now, and you're not alone.  <3  You're more than welcome to DM me anytime if you need someone else to vent to or commiserate with!",

Florida is a COVID hotspot but I wouldn't read into it too much right now. The state will get shut down eventually and college campuses are generally safer (so long as the schools are closed - and I imagine they will be).\n\nI think the only issue is whether or not your funding pulls through. Also, your classes will probably all be online, so you shouldn't actually even have to move down there yet.\n\nI think you're in a good spot relatively speaking, minus the fact that online learning sucks and your funding might fall through. If your funding doesn't fall through, I think you should be fine!!\n\nAlso, the virus was never going to be contained - the idea was just to slow the spread until a vaccine hopefully arrives.  So, don't worry about blaming it on people not distancing for two months - it wouldn't have made a difference in terms or whether or not the virus went away (just in how fast it spread).\n\nWhich school are you going to?  I have a good friend at USF that just started his PhD last year.  If it's USF, I can put you guys in touch. He also doesn't have a car and is the first in his family to go to college as well.",

Or you could have a parent or trusted person add you as an authorized user on their credit card, which would get you a card in your name connected to their account (I had one of those with my mom which actually brought my credit up a bunch since it was a good card). \nAs for cars, they certainly can be expensive but choosing a good make and model can help with them being more reliable. Also lower miles will generally mean you can go longer until you have to replace things. I\u2019ve had a car for the past 5 or more years that only costed about $50 per month in car insurance. I\u2019ve had a few repairs that weren\u2019t horribly expensive (new tires, new brake pads, etc.). So it doesn\u2019t have to be a horrible experience if you are smart about your purchase beforehand.",

My partner and I are both PhD students and first-generation college grads, so I can relate intimately to what you said about breaking the cycle of poverty.\n\nI know you said you don't have a car, but do you have a driver's license? Could you rent a car? Or if you have furniture, could you rent a U-Haul? This is how my partner and I (and our cat) moved across the country for grad school.\n\nI will also echo the sentiments of some other commentors, in that you should reach out to the director of graduate studies (or maybe your potential advisor, if that's relevant to you) for your department and/or graduate school. There are *definitely* other people in your situation. I know that my department head was just talking about this today, and they are bending over backwards to accommodate us and our incoming class in this troubling time.\n\nGood luck!",

But my buddy booked it since he is over 25 (it's like 3x the price if you're under 25 somehow) and has a credit card. But now that he has backed out I'm kinda screwed...

But if this is a route that you think is best for you, Discover will give you a credit card in under 2 weeks with 0% interest for the first year. I applied for one when I was in a super precarious life situation, filled out the online application with the salary that I was about to make (I hadn't even received my first paycheck), and said that I'd been working there for less than a month. Apparently those weren't too many red flags for them, and I got the card after a phone call the next day verifying the address I applied with. If you are technically still employed by the master's institution, I'd just go with that salary/work history to make your life easier.\n\nBut PLEASE don't do this just because a stranger on the internet suggested it! You can get yourself into a ton of trouble if you use credit irresponsibly. Also, there are probably better creditors out there, but they were who I heard I could get credit from the fastest.\n\nEdit: to be clear, I didn't get the card next day. I got it in 8-10 calendar days, but the only hurdle after applying was a phone call the next day.",

It's nearly impossible to become a professor, though of course industry positions are always options. Even if the PhD doesn't work out, you have so many things you can do. It'll be fine. But other options are also fine. Don't put so much pressure on yourself, that's how you get all these grad school horror stories. \n\nIf you do stick to the PhD... A PhD is almost never finished on time, you're just getting a headstart for all the things that will go wrong during grad school. If you can focus, try to study and get basic preparations done, the headstart can compensate for the late official start. Try asking your prof for a reading list, take free online courses in your field,etc. \n\nAgain, *if* you can concentrate. It's ok if you can't. It's a hard time. You don't have to do everything perfectly and it's perfectly fine to only focus on surviving 2020.",

I don't know how she managed to dig out my application from \\~300 apps, but it probably was due to me listing her as one of the supervisors I wanted to work with and also emailing her before sending in the application.

You were shortlisted for a ~Rhodes level scholarship so when the application process is intense, they apparently find that you\u2019re one of the best young scholars in the world. But then your old GPA and GRE blind everyone back home :( \n\nHad you been able to afford a second round then I\u2019m sure you would have found something through the Trust, even. But I understand that the acceptance timelines don\u2019t work so well with the US. As you know (but others might not): all funding for Oxbridge is announced after acceptance and after the deadline for most schools in the US, so you\u2019re put in the position of accepting in the US **or** waiting to hear about Oxbridge funding.",

I\u2019ve been told by both the professor that offered me a TA position and the department head that I stay put for two or even one week before class starts to know for sure. \n\nThe uni will be a hybrid system, and I\u2019m an int student. If I get the green light I\u2019ll have a week or less to go back to the US, find an apartment and start working in the labs.  \n\nI\u2019m also a bit worried about the hybrid thing, I\u2019m a bit scared of graduate level classes being online, I don\u2019t know what kind of toll my GPA will take as I\u2019ve never taken online classes before and working from home doesn\u2019t feel as motivational as being in the loop physically. \n\nI guess, like with all things in the current pandemic, only time will tell.",

      "text": "I'm so sorry. This is terrible timing, derailing something you've worked so hard to get. \n\nI know you didn't really ask for advice, but I have a couple of ideas that I wanted to mention. \n\nFirst, if you haven't already gotten in touch with the university's department of student affairs and the leadership for your graduate program, definitely do that. They might be able to give you more information about what online classes might look like, and whether it would even make sense for you to move there at all, until things start to open up for real. \n\nI would also see if you can get in touch with other students who were supposed to start at the same time in your program. At the very least they should be able to commiserate; best case scenario you might be able to connect with someone you could travel with to get across the country. \n\nAs for funding, I would suggest looking into outside funding sources that you can apply for on your own. If you don't know where to start looking, it's perfectly fine to ask your PhD advisor about it - they will probably be very happy that you're this motivated. If you're staying in the same field as your master's degree, then you can also ask any faculty that you have a good relationship with at your undergrad/master's institution. \n\nPlease don't be afraid or feel guilty about asking  for help or feel like you need to figure it all out alone. \n\nOne last thing - if you're not already on twitter to connect with other academics and professionals in your field, I'd recommend it. It can take some time to build connections, but it's been really helpful for me, especially in combating the sense of isolation that can come with doing a PhD.",

It is a lot easier to build connections with someone who has a moderate number of followers, just because you won't get as lost in the sea of replies.\n\n\\- Tweet regularly. It's up to you how strictly you want to keep to \"professional\" topics (personally, I decided that I'm a whole person and I'm not going to pretend to be a science robot on twitter), but the more you tweet, the more people will see your name and get to know you.\n\n\\- Ask open-ended questions that people will want to answer. Everyone likes talking about themselves. Ask for advice, funny stories, whatever. And when people respond to you, reply back! Keep the conversation going.",
