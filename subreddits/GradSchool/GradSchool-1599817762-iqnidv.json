  "text": "Gave us a lecture in which he told us that we needed to abandon our fears regarding besting each other. Comparing ourselves to the members of our cohort is the most unfair thing we could do to ourselves. \n\nWe all start from different places with different skills and what really matters is that by the end of our journey, we accomplish something that we are proud of. And that accomplishment shouldn\u2019t be defined by anyone but ourselves. You shouldn\u2019t wake up every morning with the mentality that you need to beat someone in your program, instead your mentality should be focused on your personal growth. \n\nThis lecture resonated with me for a number of reasons. It pacified some of my worries and brought up my confidence. I am extremely happy that I decided to go with a program in which the professors acknowledge that their students have different strengths.",

As a junior military officer there were roughly 30 of us in our battalion and we got ranked and stacked 1 through 30.\n\nInevitably there were officers who were petty and tried to game of thrones it, but I decided early on that I'd just help everyone and do my best. The irony was that in return I had a pool of 25 people who would stick their necks out for me and I was rated #2 (really by technicality I was effectively #1). And thats not because I'm a super genius or the hardest worker or anything, I just made work an enjoyable place for myself and others. It helped me just ask, how can I do better and help my peers? \n\nAnd also maybe a little philosophy but pretend your time in your grad program is a tape and then wind it back and hit play. Do you think you could have done a drastically better job the second go around? Probably not! You sound like you care a lot, so at every point where you shamed a bit, or took a day off, or relaxed, it's likely that you were at a point where you HAD to take care of yourself. \n\nI know it's cheesy but you really only should compete with yourself. If you tried your best and did your best and did it with dignity then thats admirable regardless of your results. Raw intelligence is a trait like blue eyes or being tall, you don't earn that. You wouldn't hate yourself for not being a brunette, so don't hate yourself based on outcome, just focus on how you can do your best. \n\nYou got this!",

This year, I'm a tenure-track assistant professor at what I would describe as my \"dream school.\" It has a small graduate program, a great location, and primary emphasis on undergraduate instruction. There are minimal resources for research, but my research is actually really cheap so I don't need a lot of resources. \n\nImposter syndrome never fully goes away. At least in my experience. But you hopefully learn to understand it better and accept it. There are times where I feel like I didn't earn my PhD at all. They just pushed me through the program and graduated me because it looks bad when students drop out of programs. All my friends from grad school have hugely impressive CVs with many publications. I've got a few, but some of them are just so impressive. They're all in post-docs at Ivy league schools or starting careers in clinical practice. I'm in awe of them half the time.\n\nAnd then I have moments where people thank me for my valuable contributions and comment that they're glad I was hired. That the dean told me I was chosen \"unanimously and enthusiastically by the department\" for my position. I have to remind myself that while I went to an R1, my passion has always been for teaching. Research is amazing. I love it. But I love helping students find their passion more. I live for teaching resource creation, connecting with my students, and making difficult concepts digestible. And I remember that all my insecurities and doubts are the same insecurities and doubts most people struggle with. That my goals and interests don't have to align with everyone else's, or my dissertation advisor's expectations for me. That I earned that fucking Ph.D. \n\nKeep reminding yourself of these things while you go through grad school and beyond. Imposter syndrome comes in waves and you don't want to be caught off guard by it.",

      "text": "I'm so happy to hear this story. I spent many years in the work world before returning to do a PhD and I learned that lesson the hard way - it wasn't competitive, but I felt that I had to \"live up\" to the example of people around me, some of whom worked like absolute machines.

Good luck with your first semester!",
