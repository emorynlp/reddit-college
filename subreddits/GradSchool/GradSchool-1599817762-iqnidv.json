I'm in awe of them half the time.\n\nAnd then I have moments where people thank me for my valuable contributions and comment that they're glad I was hired. That the dean told me I was chosen \"unanimously and enthusiastically by the department\" for my position. I have to remind myself that while I went to an R1, my passion has always been for teaching.
