  "text": "Found out about a week ago that my master's program is going to be online (again) for winter 2022. I'm in Canada, and the Covid situation is significantly improving here, the uni has a vaccine mandate, yet my program of 20 students was specifically told we can't go back since it's \"not safe.\" I'm feeling frustrated seeing undergrads and other masters programs at other institutions go back in person yet I'm still stuck online. I feel like I'm missing out on valuable experience while sitting at home fully vaccinated watching everyone else go back to school. I don't think there's anything I can do to change their mind at this point, but I am struggling to come to terms with it. Any advice? Thanks!",

      "text": "Would they let you defer for a year? If you feel like you're not getting as much out of the program as you would be if you were there in person then trying to suffer through might be a waste of time. I can't believe that they're not doing everything possible to go in-person post-vaccine mandates, that is appalling.",

I was able to defer an offer once because I had a mental health crisis. I don't know if you have a coordinator or advisor you trust, but you might contact them and tell them the situation. Maybe you can't change the program, but you might be able to change your standing in it.",
