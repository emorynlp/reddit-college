The symptom is that it's hard to get words on paper.  The problem is often just that one's thoughts are not fully organized yet.  If you're getting writer's block, try outlining and/or refining that outline.  \n\nMost of us are pretty good at writing 5-10 paragraph essays by the time we get to graduate school.  If you're good enough at it, you're used to shooting from the hip and just ... writing.  It works because your thoughts are already pretty organized, so you can pick your way through a few paragraphs naturally.  The thing is, inspiration like that doesn't scale.  Outlining does -- you can use it both to organize your thoughts and to separate the different parts of your larger work.  \n\nThat last aspect (separation) lets you write one part of your article or dissertation, while the other is still \"shaking out\".  That's important because at the dissertation scale you actually *can't* keep everything in your head all at once to let it shake out.  Practically nobody can just sit down and write even a rough draft dissertation from start to finish -- and if it were possible, we'd just set aspirations higher.    So you have to be able to push aside most of the work in order to focus on the details in any one section.
