We are depressingly rare in any white collar career, let alone academia, that\u2019s why you feel uncertain or vulnerable in your gratitude over your situation. The reality is if you come from a poor background, you recognize that this is a grand experience that is afforded to a lucky few.\n\nThis is opposed to people from more privileged backgrounds that more often seem bored or disappointed by their place in life, who occupy the majority of positions and so dictate the work culture. This work culture makes you feel uncertain of your gratitude and enthusiasm, and gradually you replace enthusiasm with outward expressions of boredom and overwork. The elite feel cognitive dissonance because they themselves can\u2019t ignore that the luxuries they are relatively afforded from society, do not correspond with their relative contributions to it, so they regularly compensate for it by creating an image of overwork. They hesitate to express gratitude over their life because it would only trigger deep and unaddressed feelings of guilt and shame. This is not shame they should personally own, but their inability to address the underlying issue of that shame, which is unfairness, prevents us from actually attacking the problem. Overwork enables you remove that sense of personal responsibility in addressing the fundamental injustices in our society (hey I\u2019m working my ass off, they should get a job, etc)\n\nWhereas you can be fully and outwardly happy about your successes, because your place in life is a direct product of efforts and decisions you have made, most of your colleagues are there because of the inertia of reality and family (I\u2019m not trying to be a dick, I\u2019m not judging anyone here). It is hard to separate what successes are due to your own merit as opposed to your starting position, so maintaining an illusion of overwork and lack of happiness allows you to keep this realization at bay.\n\nLuckily there\u2019s more of us than before, I would suggest looking around for colleagues and peers who come from a similar background or are at least equally appreciative of reality. The sort of things we desire and appreciate in life are very different, and it helps to see people with similar values in a similar situation to ground ourselves, rather than regressing towards the mean.", "author": "otterpigeon", "created": 1605645167, "upvotes": 5}, "gcn81dh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jvsdi1/is_it_weird_i_internally_fan_girl_when_i_meet/gcn81dh/", "text": "I think this is normal as a new student and will fade over time.
