I went ahead and told my advisor yesterday after my first ultrasound to confirm that the baby is developing in the right spot. She was congratulatory and supportive.  She also shared her story of being pregnant while in grad school and the fear she felt in telling her advisor that she was pregnant. I had no idea. I knew I picked her as an advisor/dissertation chair for a reason. I've looked up to her as a role model since day one of my program.  She shared that she carried her daughter across the stage with her when she received her doctorate.  She told me that being pregnant and then having her daughter helped to motivate her to work harder.  She believes (as do I) that I will feel the same way. She emphasized that my mental and physical health should take priority right now.  She was more than willing to be flexible with my new proposed timeline and to slow it down even more so if I need to.  This time seems to be the perfect time for me to have a baby while still a student since I've nearly finished coursework, completed my thesis, and passed comprehensive exams. \n\nThank you all for your responses to my previous post. Now I feel like the anxiety I was feeling about telling my advisor was all for nothing. I wish everybody else who is in my position the best of luck with their advisors and pregnancies! I hope you all receive support and encouragement as well.", "author": "kittencookies", "created": 1593793387, "retrieved": 1632953270, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 654, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fwuwyin": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hkm0wi/update_when_should_i_tell_my_phd_advisor_im/fwuwyin/", "text": "I had two babies in my last two years of grad school.

I had a baby during about the same time of my grad school career. The best advice I have is to block off time after the baby is born. I did zero work for two weeks after she was born\u2014and I told people this was the plan ahead of time. Then from 2 weeks to 2 months out I planned to do only my absolute minimum obligations (work for my assistantship and an R&R only). I found that I was able to do more (my baby was easy going and slept great), but going in with only minimal work expectations is helpful. And have a back up plan in case you do need more time. One of the professors in our department only planned 6 weeks off and then had a bad birth experience and had some medical complications that had her sidelined for about 9 weeks. Have contingency plans in place just in case, and prioritize ahead of time so you know what needs to be done.
