  "text": "I\u2019m set to graduate with my BS in May of 2022 and want to attend grad school for sure. I\u2019ve been going back and forth between if I should apply for the Fall 2022 admission rounds or take a gap year and apply for Fall 2023. \nMy parents are supportive of me either way, I think I want to hear from current grad students who either went straight into their programs or who took a gap year. \nI see the benefits of taking a gap year & also not, just want to hear any opinions or thoughts from current grad students especially since the coursework is much more than undergrad. \nThank you!!!",

Depending on your that now, it may be more beneficial to head straight into your next program. It depends on what you're currently studying and where you'd like to end up in the Public Health field.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to talk more one-on-one about it. I know how stressful going into your next program can be.",

I felt that if I would have taken a gap year then I wouldn\u2019t want to go back to school, because I would be used to not being in school\u2026if that makes sense \n\n2. I already had a good routine of balancing school and life so I felt like it made sense to continue with that routine and go right away \n\nI\u2019m not against gap years at all, but for me I knew it wouldn\u2019t have worked. More than likely I just would\u2019ve gone straight into getting a full time job in my field and not go back to school. But I\u2019ve wanted to go to grad school and to make sure I fulfilled that, I went right away.",

      "text": "I\u2019m currently applying for PhD programs after taking a gap year. The main reasons I took a gap year was: 1) experience, I needed way more research experience in my interests to really determine if I want to go further with it. 2) COVID; I was thinking of applying last fall but the thought of starting online and staying home literally sounded like torture. I\u2019m super dependent on my environment for productivity and mental stability. I don\u2019t have either at home. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re in a good place with a solid chance of getting in; go for it. If you do take a gap year, do something to pad the CV and build connections. My gap year was used working for several labs and getting a full-time industry research job in my field. I know fully what I want to study and research in a program, I wouldn\u2019t be able to say the same last year. Good luck friend!",

      "text": "I took three years between finishing my Bachelor's degree and starting graduate school. I can recommend a gap year for so many reasons:\n\n1) Take time to confirm your goals. I thought I wanted to go to law school. On the advice of several lawyers I worked for in college, I opted to put law school off and work instead. My career goals and my general understanding of myself and what I wanted out of a career, lifestyle, the place I lived, etc. changed drastically in that time period. \n\n2) Money. I cannot tell you how much more comfortable I am financially having saved money for three years. Also, my parents were not going to be able to help me and I wasn't willing to take out student loans. \n\n3) Maturity. Working full time is just different from student life. The stakes are high and real. Even though I was a good student, my time management skills are much improved and I can tell a difference between my study habits and those of people in my program straight out of their Bachelor's.\n\n4) Grad school will always be there. There just isn't any rush, and I am an advocate of taking the time to really know what you want and figure out who you are before making such a big financial investment. I assume you're 20-21 at the moment, and anything older than that sounds super old. But trust me, people aged 24-29 still party and they do it well. \n\nAll that said, you should follow your heart and do what feels right for you! Anecdotally, I am so so so glad I didn't go to law school immediately. Now I am in Europe, studying something I am very passionate about, and doing quite well in the program. Feel free to DM me if you have any more questions!",

I had the luxury of doing that during the early 2010s when the world was slightly less on fire but, if you can swing it, I highly recommend it.",
