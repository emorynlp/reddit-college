I am on week 7 of my first semester of grad school (MS)\u2026. This is a 3 year program where I am interning every year. I am severely suffering mentally. This program brings out every ounce of depression and anxiety in me. It\u2019s not the course load but the extra hours and projects and lack of communication with the faculty which is adding to this. I am seriously considering dropping out and trying to find out how to even \u201cdrop out\u201d. I can\u2019t find any information on the penalty for dropping out? My courses are credit / no credit so I don\u2019t know if this will effect later grad school possibilities or hiring prospects. I was hoping if anyone has ever quit a program before and how to go about this? \n\nThe major problem is that it is a masters of counseling degree and I will be working with clients starting in a week. It is a major ethical and legal problem to start seeing clients then to just leave with little to no notice. I have these same clients for a full year so I don\u2019t know if I should stay for a full year and suffer or just quit before that is even a factor??? My main concern is that I am not really interested in this field so I am unsure of how this will effect other possible programs and careers.

I got W's in the class and took a Leave of Absence.  This allows you to take a semester or sometimes more depending on your school off without officially leaving the program.  This might give you time to sit with it and decide if you want to continue. You would have to retake the W classes if you stayed, and of course repay for them but it does give you options.  I wouldn't worry about the clients over your own mental health as they can replace you if needed, but you can't replace your own peace of mind.  I personally would take the W's before starting if possible.
