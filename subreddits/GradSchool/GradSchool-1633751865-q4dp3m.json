  "text": "So I have to submit my Master's thesis in approximately 1.5 weeks.  I've written only around 2000 words out of 12000 so far.  I still have to run some last-minute experiments (cursing past me for being too afraid to ask for help) and my anxiety levels are through the roof.  I wish I had more time.  I feel like I don't have enough to write about.  But I also feel like I don't have enough time to write about everything.  How am I going to write a 4000 word discussion when I've only got some chromatograms and MS data and some bioinformatics work?  I feel so incompetent :( also I might have undiagnosed ADHD which is just screwing me over even more.  \n\nAnyway thanks for reading.  If anyone has any writing tips, please post them below!  I've tried timing myself but that just makes me more depressed.",

      "text": "That is quite a tight deadline. Do check if you can get an extension as this will not be fun to do in 1.5 weeks.\n\nOne suggestion I have is that you finish a draft asap. Write down everything you have up to now. Don't worry about formatting, grammer, just put the words on paper from the beginning to end. Once you have a working draft like that, it's much easier to polish it out. Then you can split time between finalizing the matter and the experiments you have left.",

          "text": "I did talk to my PI about possibly taking an extension, but they didn't seem too sold on the idea and said I should write up whatever I have until the deadline.  Then my committee would go over the thesis and see if I need an extension or not (or if I need to make changes.  This version we're submitting right now isn't the final final draft) I think most of my cohort is in the same boat if I'm not mistaken, almost all of us are behind schedule because of COVID and other issues (things at home, working restrictions blah blah).  \n\nI have trouble working on one section at a time because what if I can't muster up any words to write down?  I would just be wasting my own time.  But I do want to go about this in a more organized manner, idk what to do \ud83d\ude15",

              "text": "Well, the situation doesn't look so grim, with respect to the deadline. That's good.   \nSo focus on meeting the requirements for this 'review' by your committee. Forget about the word count for now. If you can't meet the required number for a section, that is a problem for later I would say. Currently just write words without bothering about the number of words. You need not write linearly going from section to section. One advice my supervisor gave me is to write the results first (whatever you have ready), followed by literature review, and finally introduction and conclusion. This way, you are writing what is concrete and more crucial first. Also these sections have less creative freedom, as compared to say writing an eloquent introduction, so you might find it easier to write as well. I personally shuffled between subsections and chapters when I was writing, but don't be too fickle. Some times you have to stick with it a bit to get in to the flow. Sometimes leaving a half done section and writing another one may help you to resume the half done section better with more clarity later.",
