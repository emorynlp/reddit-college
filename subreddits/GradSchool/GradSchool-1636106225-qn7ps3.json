  "title:": "Thoughts on Work/Life Balance 1 Year Out from PhD - Confessions & Self-Loathing",
  "text": "I finished my PhD in a STEM field (MS&E) a little over a year ago. I got a job doing research & development in a specialty chemicals company so have been working full time since graduating. So far the main difference between grad school and life-after is (probably obvious) I don't spend a lot of time second-guessing how much time I should be working. Basically I just work 8 or 9 hours and then go home, because that's the culture. However, strangely, I've also been getting a lot more accomplished in an average week than when I was in school. It's so unbelievably refreshing that it got my curious about my working habits and hours from school and how they compare to before/after.\n\nFortunately I actually had data on this (sadly, not complete) in the form of work logs. In my pre-grad school job I got in the habit of logging all of my work activities (measured down to 1/10 hour or 6 minute increments which I admit is slightly psychotic) and I kept this up partially in grad school (interspersed by times I was either too busy or too lazy to track my hours). I also resumed tracking my time to this level of precision AFTER grad school.\n\nAs we all know, grad students face a lot of explicit and implicit pressure to work long hours and just generally disregard activities that don't help their career (or more accurately, their advisor's career). I was no exception to this and I can honestly say that **there was not a day in my 5 years of grad school that I was not stressing about and/or second-guessing my dedication**. But actually, when I looked at my data I found an interesting pattern both in my working hours and my level of success.\n\nBefore grad school (I worked 4 years between degrees): I worked very consistently about 40 hours per week. I \"exceeded expectations\" on every single one of my annual reviews.\n\nDuring grad school phase 1: I worked about 50 to 60 hours a week and was constantly stressed.\n\nDuring grad school phase 2: I more-or-less burned out during the second half of grad school and it looks like I averaged around 30 hours a week (note - I was present for a full 50 or so hours, but actual work is another story). My outcomes in grad school were decent but could have been a lot better. I would occasionally get my shit together enough to bang out a 10 hour day here and there, but generally I was doing well if I put in 6 actual hours of work. This led to a lot of self loathing and guilt, as you can imagine. Here's an example from an actual day of work recorded in 2019:\n\nTASK, TIME\n\n think about job prospects and do some online research, 1.6 hours\n\n get more di water, 0.4 hours\n\n see if 23-1/23-2 is soluble in chloroform or DMSO (it's not\u2026 the samples may have degraded from being in vac oven :(\u2026 , 0.4 hours\n\nTOTAL HOURS FOR DAY: 2.4 hours\n\nThere were a fair number of days like this. At the time I really hated myself and thought I was a shit grad student.\n\nAfter grad school: I work about 40-45 hours per week. I just got my first annual review and I am back to being \"exceeds expectations\".\n\nThe moral of the story: trying to work long hours did not help me, in fact it back-fired and I ended up lazier than average. If I had to do grad school again (God forbid) I would just say fuck-off to all these over-the-top external and internal pressures to overwork and just focus on working 40 hours per week but in a highly efficient way.\n\n**Tl;dr: Try just working 40 hours per week but being energetic and efficient.**\n\nI also made a youtube video about this topic that is probably more of a rambling self-therapy session than I intended, but if you think it would be helpful for you to hear more of my take on grad school work/life balance, feel free to check it out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92IEW9JKopM&t=1207s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92IEW9JKopM&t=1207s)",
