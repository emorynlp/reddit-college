  "text": "Hello,\n\nI graduated with a degree in Political Science in 2019, and have fortunately been employed since. I am at a point in my career where  I am getting great experience in my work, but I want to take it to the next level. I have been wrestling with going to grad school for a few years but I have decided it is a potential good next step for me. However, I really cannot fathom the idea of going to school full time and not working. I have also found programs I like, but they are in unaffordable cities (SIPA-NY, Price, LA, Luskin, LA) \n\nI have been in the DC area for years at this point, which is a good city to be in for people with a Poli Sci degree. However, I am dying to move out of this area and move to a new city which I have also decided is a good next step for me. BUT, none of the programs I like are in that city. I am currently struggling on whether I should just do an online program so I can live my life and move to where I want to, or should I suck it up and move to another city for school. An online program doesn't sit right with me entirely because I feel like I may be missing out on some stuff, but it definitely would be the easier route with working/flexibility. Any insight is appreciated.",
