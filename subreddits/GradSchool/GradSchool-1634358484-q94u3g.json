  "text": "Hi y'all! I'm applying for the GRFP soon, and I'm likely going to be applying to PhD's in a couple departments. I'm still between computational biology and computational chemistry (with applications to biology), and programs in these areas seem to span the Biology, Chemistry, and Computer Science Departments (maybe as well as Chemical+Bio engineering). If I apply for a particular area (e.g. life sciences vs computer science vs chemistry, etc.) and receive the grant, if I matriculate to a different department would I still be eligible for the grant? Thank you so much!",

      "text": "Since you're applying before enrolling in grad school, the restriction is that your grad program needs to be in the same Major Field of Study as your application---so, on the level of life sciences, etc. The info is here: [https://www.nsfgrfp.org/applicants/application-components/field-of-study/](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/applicants/application-components/field-of-study/) \n\nHowever, there might be a way out---IIRC, you can indicate that your proposal is interdisciplinary among up to 3 subfields, which can be in different major fields. \n\nNot going to lie, a major reason I didn't apply as an undergraduate was because I didn't want to deal with this headache (I was applying to both biostats and computational biology programs, which are in different major fields). \n\nI hear that people have get pretty quick replies from the email helpline, so this is definitely worth asking!",
