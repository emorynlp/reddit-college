  "text": "I'm sure all of us had our own ups and downs when it comes to our thesis. I've finished my MS thesis proposal defense around the middle of the year and during my consultation, my adviser finally said \"I'm convinced. You're ready to graduate. Let's schedule your final defense\". Still some writing left to do and some paperwork and the actual defense but man, I never expected to hear those words after going at it so hard while working full-time as well. I teared up a bit when I heard that. All my exhaustion from my full-time job and efforts for my graduate studies have all led up to this moment.\n\nI'm really happy and I'm hoping I can schedule my final defense this coming January. I hope all is gonna be well until then and that I can finish strong. I don't know where else to tell the news first because I don't wanna jinx it by telling my labmates. Hope everything's going well for all my fellow grad students out there!",

I finished the project ran experiments on the final molecule, got results, It was the end of a 8 million dollar NIH grant (4 post docs, three grad students, I was the last one) Epic struggle at the end and it wasn't even on my mind to be done. Writing, job applications, writing, reproduction permissions, writing, job interviews, writing, airplane trips, writing on airplanes, Defense......",
