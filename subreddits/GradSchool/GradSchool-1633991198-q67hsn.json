People tend to get busy around the time applications start coming due, so you want to at least give them a long enough head up and potentially enough time to schedule a meeting or two with you (I met with all my recommenders) before finals.",

      "text": "Depends on the person entirely. If you are close with your professors, then the more time you give them the better letter they can write. If it's a perfunctory relationship, they will probably use a template where they will copy paste your name but you still want do it like 6-8 weeks in advance where a reminder every 3 weeks should be fine. If it's a shitty professor, then don't even bother because even asking a year in advance does no good.",
