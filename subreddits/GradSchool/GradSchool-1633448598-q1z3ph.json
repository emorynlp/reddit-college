  "title:": "Asking for a letter of recommendation - undergrad",
  "text": "Hi all. I'm currently a senior undergraduate studying anthropology, and I'm looking to apply to grad schools this semester. I'm in a class where I get a lot of lab time with TAs who have been so helpful - one of them even gave me recommendations to reach out to a professor I had never had before and helped me to secure a part in a research project. She mentioned this to me because I wasn't sure I could get three letters of recommendation, and she mentioned this teacher would be very helpful. \n\nHowever, I have only been working with this professor for about a month now, and while I don't want to spring the question on her at the last minute, I also don't want to come across as entitled. I'm not sure I should ask her for the letter, but I spent my first two years of undergrad in a very poor place mentally, and then the last year and a half was online for COVID. I don't have a lot of teachers I feel could write me a letter. Should I wait a few weeks until she knows me better, or just write it off?",

      "text": "Letters of recommendation are not usually due until January or later. Is that true for where you're applying?\n\nIf so, then wait a few more weeks and then ask. That will still give your professor plenty of time to write the letter.",

          "text": "With most of my applications, all the required items like transcripts and letters of recommendation are due the first of December, but a handful of places I\u2019m applying to have mid January as their application deadline. I was thinking I\u2019d just wait until the end of October before asking, so that she\u2019d still have about a month to write it",

      "text": "I have similar deadlines to you, but the opposite question (I graduated over a year ago and my professors haven't heard from me since). In both cases I think we're probably a little bit early. For early/mid December app deadlines, I think we'll both be fine asking for letters at the end of October. That gives you time to continue developing the academic relationship. (and it gives me time to make contact again without an ask)\n\nI've been trying to juggle the awkwardness of reaching back out to my professors only because I need a recommendation letter. I think I'll send an initial email updating them on my post-graduation life and ask for the letter at the end of the month...? Or maybe it's better just to ask right away without the subterfuge :)",

          "text": "Thank you for your advice! One of the professors I\u2019m asking for a recommendation letter is a professor I took three times but haven\u2019t talked to in about a year, as well. I\u2019m a little intimidated because he\u2019s very blunt, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. A year\u2019s not so long - I don\u2019t think we have too much to worry about.",
