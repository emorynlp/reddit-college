Just got out of the ER where I spent the night after the cops showed up at my lab and took me away because someone told them I was crying in the lab and when they showed up they determined I wanted to kill myself. I've begged my university for mental health care for the last six years and been turned down because I have \"pre-existing depression and anxiety\" and the counselors refuse to see me. I've tried for six years to get off-campus help (I wonder how many hundreds of therapists I've called by now) and only just found a therapist four weeks ago, who I can't see anymore because I'll lose my health insurance when I leave grad school. My \"mental health care\" until this point has been a combination of involuntary and voluntary visits to the ER when I get to the point where I feel the only other option is killing myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to have promise and potential. Somehow I managed to get into a top PhD program in STEM and work for one of the most well-regarded researchers in my field, even though everyone always told me I was too dumb, that I only got in because I check \"diversity\" boxes, that I don't deserve to be where I am. I am so excited by my research and it is the only thing that has been keeping me going, and now it has been taken away. If I had gotten help one of the hundreds of times I asked, begged, pleaded--perhaps I would have a chance to be successful. Now I'll never know what my life could have been like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear universities: when you offer counseling services you have an obligation to help all students. You have an obligation to make sure students get the care they need when they ask for help, not cast them out into the cold when they are at their most vulnerable.

I\u2019m not in grad school, but right now I think it\u2019s really important that you focus on your mental health.  I have bipolar and anxiety disorders, and that getting out of control affects everything.  I think right now the most important thing for you is to find a good psychiatrist who can evaluate you.  (Unless you have already been diagnosed - in that case I would definitely find a permanent one who can prescribe/adjust/monitor your meds right now.). It\u2019s not good to wait until a crisis to see a doctor.  It\u2019s possible you need to take meds to get better.  I don\u2019t think trips to the ER are going to help figure that out.  I have a therapist, but she is an additional help for my mental illness, not the solution.  \n\nI\u2019m sure grad school is very stressful but especially if you have an untreated mental illness.  If possible, I would take a medical leave until this gets figured out and wait to make any decisions regarding quitting all together until your mental health has been addressed and stabilized.  Right now you may not be in the best state of mind to make that kind of decision.\n\nI don\u2019t have insurance at the moment and pay out of pocket for my medications, but they\u2019re really not very expensive.  (I think the most expensive is $14.). Also you might want to see if you can find a counseling center with a sliding scale.  I also found out Obamacare has subsidies for low income so I could have been getting insurance for like $30/mo. last year.  Also I find it odd about the pre-existing conditions.  That was eliminated under Obamacare.  I would look into that.  Your biggest expense will probably be the psychiatrist.\n\nI really hope things turn out for you.
