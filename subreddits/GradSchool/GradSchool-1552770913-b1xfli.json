  "text": "It's all finally come to an end. Just got out of the ER where I spent the night after the cops showed up at my lab and took me away because someone told them I was crying in the lab and when they showed up they determined I wanted to kill myself. I've begged my university for mental health care for the last six years and been turned down because I have \"pre-existing depression and anxiety\" and the counselors refuse to see me. I've tried for six years to get off-campus help (I wonder how many hundreds of therapists I've called by now) and only just found a therapist four weeks ago, who I can't see anymore because I'll lose my health insurance when I leave grad school. My \"mental health care\" until this point has been a combination of involuntary and voluntary visits to the ER when I get to the point where I feel the only other option is killing myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to have promise and potential. Somehow I managed to get into a top PhD program in STEM and work for one of the most well-regarded researchers in my field, even though everyone always told me I was too dumb, that I only got in because I check \"diversity\" boxes, that I don't deserve to be where I am. I am so excited by my research and it is the only thing that has been keeping me going, and now it has been taken away. If I had gotten help one of the hundreds of times I asked, begged, pleaded--perhaps I would have a chance to be successful. Now I'll never know what my life could have been like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear universities: when you offer counseling services you have an obligation to help all students. You have an obligation to make sure students get the care they need when they ask for help, not cast them out into the cold when they are at their most vulnerable. You all have blood on your hands.",

In a different part of the world, but with probably even less access to usable mental health help. And I am still in my PhD, and no-one seems interested in kicking me out for that.\n\nSo... who told you that you have to quit? Did you actually officially get fired / terminated / expelled / lost funding? Otherwise I don't understand why you feel that you have to either quit or kill yourself. From what you wrote it seems you have livable funding and are interested in (even excited by!) your research - which are probably the two most important things for completing a PhD (I think the third is having an advisor and/or a postdoc, a staff scientist or a more advanced student able and willing to sufficiently mentor you in research... but that may not necessarily even be in your current research group - from what I understood from people who did their PhD in the US, isn't too uncommon to switch groups, add a co-advisor, rely more on a committee member, or closely collaborate outside the group).",

I have bipolar and anxiety disorders, and that getting out of control affects everything.  I think right now the most important thing for you is to find a good psychiatrist who can evaluate you.  (Unless you have already been diagnosed - in that case I would definitely find a permanent one who can prescribe/adjust/monitor your meds right now.). It\u2019s not good to wait until a crisis to see a doctor.  It\u2019s possible you need to take meds to get better.  I don\u2019t think trips to the ER are going to help figure that out.  I have a therapist, but she is an additional help for my mental illness, not the solution.  \n\nI\u2019m sure grad school is very stressful but especially if you have an untreated mental illness.  If possible, I would take a medical leave until this gets figured out and wait to make any decisions regarding quitting all together until your mental health has been addressed and stabilized.  Right now you may not be in the best state of mind to make that kind of decision.\n\nI don\u2019t have insurance at the moment and pay out of pocket for my medications, but they\u2019re really not very expensive.  (I think the most expensive is $14.). Also you might want to see if you can find a counseling center with a sliding scale.  I also found out Obamacare has subsidies for low income so I could have been getting insurance for like $30/mo. last year.  Also I find it odd about the pre-existing conditions.  That was eliminated under Obamacare.  I would look into that.  Your biggest expense will probably be the psychiatrist.\n\nI really hope things turn out for you.  That\u2019s tough.",

Part of me wants to tell you to sue the university for breach of duty of care for not providing mental health services *because* you had mental health problems, but first and foremost I just hope that you take the time you need to take care of yourself.\n\nI also agree with u/Cindifrid that it may be worth you enquiring (once you feel ready) whether it will be possible for you to take a break and then come back to your research if you want to one day. And even if that isn't possible, please know that this doesn't necessarily have to be the end of your research career, just a break in it. Should you choose to you may very well find a way back to it when you are in a better and more stable place.\n\nIn the meantime I would suggest (but I am an internet stranger not a licensed therapist who knows you well, so take with a big ass pinch of salt) taking this opportunity to find things outside of your research that you enjoy and can focus on. Relying on one thing to keep you going comes with the risk of that thing going away (as is unfortunately happening now, although hopefully it is not gone forever) and so broadening your horizons seems, to me at least, a healthier approach.\n\nAgain, I hope you take the time and find the support (formal, friendly, familial, or whatever form it might take) to take care of yourself.

A lot of people take the view that if you can't work within the system, it's on you, instead of recognizing how the system has failed. He already accepted my withdrawal so it's a moot point now anyway. ",

Outside psychiatric help is not cheap, though, even if your health insurance covers it, and sometimes you just get fucked. I went months without meds simply because I couldn't afford the co-pay to get my prescriptions refilled...or buy the prescriptions.",

Fast forward to the present, after six years of working myself to the bone in extremely stressful conditions and my functioning has deteriorated to where I am suicidal, self-harming, and calling the crisis line every other night wanting to end it all. All the counseling office can say is \"I'm sure it's very frustrating that you can't find off-campus help\" and then sends me the same list of phone numbers that I've been calling for the last six years. Finding a therapist who's not grossly incompetent four weeks ago was too little and far too late. ",

They were only equipped to deal with 'academic issues' and were basically useless and told me to stop focussing so much on my 'other problems', and that if I needed help I'd have to look for it elsewhere essentially. I felt shocked, sitting there in that counselors office. That day really went far towards me deciding not to continue on to do my PhD there, that and the shitty way they treated international students like cashgrabs and nothing more.\n\nHang in there, OP. Life does get better after academia. You will definitely miss it but it's NOT the most important thing in the world. You are way more important and you need to focus on yourself.",
