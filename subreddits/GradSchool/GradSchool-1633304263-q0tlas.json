  "title:": "How to deal with unsupportive family?",
  "text": "I come from an academic family, every single one got their doctorate in some STEM field. I originally dropped out of college, but returned and got a degree in botany and now getting my masters in architecture as I have an interest in urban planning/forestry. Maybe what I\u2019m going to school for is irrelevant, but I mention it because I\u2019ve always wanted a career that might close the gap in food insecurity. \n\nThing is, my family treats my career interests like a cute hobby. I\u2019m trying to publish a paper soon and asked relatives for some help (since they all have extensive experience in this), and the snobbery began immediately. I was told my efforts are pointless. \n\nI\u2019ve officially had it. They acted like it was a huge blow to the family that I didn\u2019t get a college degree, and were in shock when I didn\u2019t want to get a masters (I had job offers), but now that I\u2019m here and trying to work on something I\u2019m passionate about, they waste no time to put it down. \n\nI know their feelings shouldn\u2019t matter, but it would be nice to have some validation. The biggest feeling that jumps out at me is to never talk about my grad school experience with them anymore, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s an immature knee-jerk reaction. What on earth do I do?",

      "text": "So I had a similar issue with some friends I had. I originally was an engineering major but it wasn't something I was passionate. I eventually transferred to Wildlife Biology and I feel in love. My friends, who were still in engineering, looked down on it like it was meaningless. I had gotten a few really cool scholarships, graduated undergrad with a 4.0, and started a cool pop gene research for my Master's. But to my friends it was stupid and they acted like all my hard work was incredibly easy because it was \"playing with animals\". The work I do is in no way easy. I use more computer coding and unique computer software now then I ever did as an engineering major. \n\nRecently I had told them about my Masters and how I was incredibly proud of winning so many grants (including free pages for publishing my research). They dismissed and one of them literally said \"wow people actually wasted money on you.\" I was incredibly hurt and I finally snapped. I sat them all down with my proposal and then had them look at all the software and coding I had to do for my research. A few of them apologized and said they didn't realize that it was so important to me or how difficult it actually was, but some just blew it off. \n\nMy advice would be to really sit down and explain how passionate and important your work can be (especially if you are considering helping with food security). If they still blow it off, to hell with their opinion (which I know is easier said then done, but if they can't respect something you care about, you shouldn't care about their opinions). You earned your masters and obviously you are extremely passionate about your work. \n\nAs for getting published, reach out to others grad students at your college and to professors in your section. I know the people I work with have been extremely helpful in letting me know how the process of getting published works and helping improve my writing.",

          "text": "Good grief, reading this made me so frustrated for you. And I had a similar situation where family members told our family friends (their former colleagues) that I \u201clike plants\u201d. I was deflated. However, one of them looked at them confused, when I clarified by saying \u201cbotany\u201d he perked up and said something along the lines of my career being undervalued. That meant so much to me. \n\nI\u2019ve already tried to tell them my passions in a serious manner, it really got nowhere, so I think you\u2019re right that I just need to disregard their opinions.",

My degree was more in line with cognitive neuroscience, but okay. \n\nGood people do not need you to prove your worth to them. You should not have to sit these people down and have a rational conversation about what should be the default. If these people are not willing to give you the most basic amount of respect, then they are not worthy of the privilege of being in your life. You deserve to be treated with respect and dignity because you are a human being, and if they can't see that, then I feel really sad for them.",

I'm getting my masters in parks & rec, a huge focus in my program is green space, sustainability education, urban forestry, etc. I'm the oddball in the program because I'm an archaeologist studying climate change risk of archaeo sites in parks. Super niche, super \"whats the point\" kinda deal. But man, there's a use for it, climate change is everywhere and everyone has a past! Anyways. Urban planning/forestry is a huge field, food insecurity is driven by climate change, climate change can be adapted to through urban forestry and sustainable architecture. I think what on earth to do is keep doing good science, you're doing great! I'm glad you're happy.",
