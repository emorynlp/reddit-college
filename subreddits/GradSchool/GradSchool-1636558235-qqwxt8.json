  "title:": "Can you submit a paper to journals for publication after it has been publicly uploaded by your university's archive/library?",
  "text": "Sorry for the confusing rubric. A year ago, I wrote the final thesis for my Bachelor's. I had previously gotten a research-project published in an academic ournal but for this project, we were expected to automatically upload the final paper to our University's library-system after finishing. I put a lot of work into the study and looking back at it, I feel like I should have tried to get it published. However, if you google the title of the paper, it is available for anybody on my University's website and through some other random sites that seem to profit from re-uploading papers. Does this disqualify it from being published in real journals or could I try to submit it?",

      "text": "Hmmm, in my case I made sure that my thesis would be embargoed for about 2 years after my graduation to allow for journal publication. It is not publicly available so I can submit my paper and its under review now. Could you try to ask your university policy if it's possible to embargo your thesis for 2-5 years depending on how long you want to try for publication.",
