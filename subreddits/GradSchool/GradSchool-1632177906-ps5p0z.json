I knew it would be difficult but I am starting to feel like I am in over my head. The imposter syndrome is already kicking in. I cannot physically read everything that is assigned to me and I feel like I\u2019m already falling behind while it seems like most of my classmates are doing fine. I never struggled much in undergrad so this is a new feeling for me. Does anyone have words of encouragement or advice?", "author": "blakerz11", "created": 1632177906, "retrieved": 1632844101, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdrq93q": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ps5p0z/4th_week_of_grad_school_i_am_about_to_lose_it/hdrq93q/", "text": "I also started an MSSW program in one of the top programs in the country. I'm in week 4 here, too. I was pretty blown away by the sheer amount of reading that was assigned. It's really impossible to read every single word AND retain that information AND expect to also not be completely consumed by grad school. \n\nBUT I have discovered that reading every single word assigned isn't necessary. I've come to rely on reading groups with other students in my class. I lean on my practice/field cohort. We share a lot of the load. Do you have a faculty advisor? Have you been able to reach out to other classmates? Are you making space to take care of yourself (I know. Self-care gets mentioned a lot in social work school.)", "author": "HurleyGirlATX", "created": 1632260498, "upvotes": 2}, "hdnoqim": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ps5p0z/4th_week_of_grad_school_i_am_about_to_lose_it/hdnoqim/", "text": "here\u2019s a lesson I myself am trying to be mindful of: failure is a good thing, a necessary thing. we learn more about ourselves in failing than we do in success. learning to accept failure as a natural part of being a human being will allow you to let go of perfectionism and black and white thinking. the most important thing is that you do the best you can with what you have, and ask for help if you need it. I guarantee you that your fellow classmates are struggling just as much if not more than you are - ask them! I\u2019m positive they\u2019ll gush about how stressed out and drained and exhausted they are, and how they too feel like imposters. I find that I tend to viscerally reject failure because I\u2019m usually clinging to this fixed idea of myself as someone who\u2019s always capable, always has it together, is always on top of everything, but in allowing myself to fail I\u2019m reminded that I will always be a work in progress and, more importantly, that that\u2019s okay! good enough really is good enough. prioritize what needs prioritizing and let the rest go - if you don\u2019t get to all of it that\u2019s okay. really. I\u2019m not just saying that. also if you really feel like you\u2019re drowning, talk to your professors and let them know! 85% of them will likely be able to work with you in some way. but I guess the biggest message I want to drive home here is that failure doesn\u2019t make you bad. it doesn\u2019t make you \u2018not good enough.\u2019 it\u2019s just a part of life that we\u2019ll all experience to varying degrees throughout our lives, and learning to make peace with it is really what allows you to find peace with yourself. I hope this helps, keep your chin up - you can absolutely get through this \ud83c\udf24", "author": "van_swearingen", "created": 1632182995, "upvotes": 7}}}
