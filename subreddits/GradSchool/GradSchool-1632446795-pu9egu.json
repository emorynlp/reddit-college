However, looking at the instructions it says your ineligible if you\u2019ve completed over a year of grad school. \n\nDoes this mean, if I\u2019ve completed a Fall + Spring Semester (18 credits total), and then started a Fall Semester of classes in August that I wouldn\u2019t be eligible? And therefore would need to apply this year?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nEdit: I\u2019m doubly confused because one member of my MA committee said I am eligible next year, one said I\u2019m not\u2026", "author": "PHXNights", "created": 1632446795, "retrieved": 1632952091, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he1k4ip": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pu9egu/help_w_grfp_eligibility_question/he1k4ip/", "text": "They did not change the guidelines from last year (at least I remember the same wording) when I applied during the beginning of my second year as a PhD student (I did a fall and spring semester and applied at the beginning of the following fall semester).
