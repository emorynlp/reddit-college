  "text": "I am currently in the first semester of my MA, and will be pursuing a PhD directly after. I previously applied once for the GRFP in undergrad and did well\u2014but not well enough to actually get it.\n\nTherefore, I planned on applying again in the start of my second year of the MA next year. However, looking at the instructions it says your ineligible if you\u2019ve completed over a year of grad school. \n\nDoes this mean, if I\u2019ve completed a Fall + Spring Semester (18 credits total), and then started a Fall Semester of classes in August that I wouldn\u2019t be eligible? And therefore would need to apply this year?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nEdit: I\u2019m doubly confused because one member of my MA committee said I am eligible next year, one said I\u2019m not\u2026",

      "text": "They did not change the guidelines from last year (at least I remember the same wording) when I applied during the beginning of my second year as a PhD student (I did a fall and spring semester and applied at the beginning of the following fall semester). The wording is super confusing, but you should be eligible to apply. You will have to talk about your plans for a PhD rather than masters.",
