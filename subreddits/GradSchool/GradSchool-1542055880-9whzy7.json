Sometimes those stop working and you should have more than one. I got back from the field with about 20gigs of data from a colleague. Didn't have internet in the field capable of putting it in cloud storage. Didn't have extra storage on my computer or thumb drive because I wasn't expecting to get the data. When I get back home, a happy dog tail swipes the external hard drive off the table just as I'm hooking it up. When I plug it back in, the hard drive was not recognized.\n\nNow I'm obsessed with redundancy and it has super saved my ass in at least three instances. I use two Google drive, the Box account from my university, server storage from my university, one external hard drive that gets backed up and stored in a locker at the library (in case of a fire at my apartment), two external hard drives that get backed up daily (I'm in data collection) and are with me in the field, and one external hard drive that is dedicated only to dissertation research, though dissertation research is redundant on all others, too.", "author": "stiltss", "created": 1542066103, "upvotes": 7}, "e9l3mrx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/9whzy7/friendly_reminder_to_back_up_your_data/e9l3mrx/", "text": "Two different cloud services, three different hard drives in two different locations, two different laptops, a PC, a server at uni ...
