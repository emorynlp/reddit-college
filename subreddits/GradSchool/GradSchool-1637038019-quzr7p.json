  "text": "First semester of grad school and I\u2019m scared that I might fail. Currently, taking three classes. One is hard but the curve is huge. The second is doable and straightforward but I messed up the first exam and failed. The third I was doing fine until today when I bombed my exam. I swear I got like a 20% if I am lucky. I\u2019m getting discouraged because no matter how hard I try, I fail. I guess this is more a of vent but like how does retaking class work in grad school? Will I get kicked out ?",
