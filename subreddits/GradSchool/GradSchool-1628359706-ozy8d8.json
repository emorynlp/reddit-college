For me, eating well, cooking, and eating in general, has often feel to the wayside for me. The variety in my diet is just not what It used to be.\n\nI was recently blood tested and found my iron levels were a bit low. This inspired me not only to take an iron supplement, but also a multivitamin.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this consistently for a month and a half now and I feel markedly better physically, mentally, and emotionally. Sleep is better, energy levels are higher, anxiety and depression is a little less intense.\n\nAt first I thought it must just be placebo, but then I noticed some small physical issues I had been having just totally went away too.\n\nI really think I was malnourished. Grad school robbed me of the time I used to cook and prepare proper meals for myself.\n\nConclusion: Eat well if you can, and if not, take vitamins.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  **Follow-Up Comments**  \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFIRST, genuine thanks for all of the easy food ideas! Next grocery trip I make I'm definitely tossing some of those in the mix!\n\n**ON IRON:**\n\nSome pointed out that iron can be dangerous if you don't have an iron deficiency! My iron levels were low enough that it *was* advised by my doctor to take a supplement, but at a certain dosage which I'm guessing is lower than that given to full-blown anemics.\n\nObligatory reminder you've pointed out (with which I agree):\n\n\\- It's probably not a great idea to take an iron supplement unless your doctor advises you to. If you suspect you have an iron or targeted vitamin deficiency, go get your blood tested for sure!\n\n**ON MULTIVITAMINS:**\n\nI also noticed that some of you pointed out that multivitamins are a load of trash and I should just eat better. To that I say, *you're probably right!*...\n\nHonestly, I should have expected this from the amount of you that are probably researching medicine.  Lest we not forget the misguided kink Linus Pauling had for Vitamin C....\n\nI still mostly stand by my original post in that it might be worth trying if your diet kinda sucks and you're not getting much solar Vit D (like me). At the very least, I get the [delicious fruity gummy vitamins](https://www.target.com/p/one-a-day-women-39-s-multivitamin-gummies-170ct/-/A-76150803?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tmnv&DFA=71700000079335722&CPNG=PLA_DVM%2B0060H00000uKC5SQAW-NATL_OAD_Google+Search_Feb_2021_Flight&adgroup=PLA_OneADay_Adult&LID=700000001393753pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9021715&gclid=CjwKCAjwpMOIBhBAEiwAy5M6YA5z0bPlE8K2y2ntbi5N6ZbwAVRthj6DoZkBRQewUXyPUt3iOy4Q7xoCRcYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) which are kind of a nice little treat every day.\n\nAnother obligatory reminder:\n\n\\- Taking vitamins isn't a long-term, nor *standalone,* solution to be \"healthier\".\n\n**I will say, based on the comments from people who probably know a lot more about medicine than I do,  I will seriously consider switching from a multivitamin to just vitamin D and Iron (and whatever I need to absorb it). I would revise my \"advice\" by suggesting that one get  a blood test at  the next doctors app. to see if there's actually any vitamin deficiencies.**", "author": "ImportAstroPy", "created": 1628359706, "retrieved": 1632846336, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 310, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"h86kigv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ozy8d8/advice_take_vitamins_regularly/h86kigv/", "text": "OP, glad you are feeling better. Sorry to rain on your parade, but your multivitamin supplements aren't responsible for improvements in your mood. There is close to zero evidence for that. A balanced diet (even a very lopsided one) is generally capable of providing adequate amounts of nutrients for people of graduate student age (people in their 20s and 30s).\n\nYour symptoms have to do with first, not eating enough (you clearly mention skipping meals in your OP) and second, are classic signs of iron deficiency, which is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies. Because iron carries oxygen in the blood, lack of energy, brain fog, depression, etc. are commonly recognized signs of iron deficiency. Less total body iron --> lower red cell count --> lower oxygen capacity --> reduced metabolic capacity.  Exacerbated by lack of nutrients overall if you are skipping meals. If you are female and \"grad student\" age, you're kind of smack dab in the demographic where iron deficiency is very common. I would recommend following up with your provider once you've been on the iron supplements for a while, it is completely possible to take too much of these (although rare), especially if your diet has improved in the interim to include iron rich foods (meats, fish, poultry, beans/legumes).\n\nSo yes, this is the core issue -- your title should read \"eat regularly\":\n\n    I really think I was malnourished.", "author": null, "created": 1628439050, "upvotes": 2}, "h858fb8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ozy8d8/advice_take_vitamins_regularly/h858fb8/", "text": "Thanks !", "author": "thisnotasillywatch", "created": 1628406165, "upvotes": 0}, "h8576r5": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ozy8d8/advice_take_vitamins_regularly/h8576r5/", "text": "That happened to me last year of undergrad.

I\u2019m happy to hear you are feeling better! I want to mention that I\u2019d be careful about attributing this to the vitamins, and even more careful about extending that advice generally. \n\nMeasurements of iron levels in the blood are volatile and cannot be used to assess iron deficiency. Ferritin is a marker and is more reliable. However, most people with low ferritin (meaning lower 2.5% of a healthy individual) will see no benefit from supplementation, but may have the side effects.\n\nD vitamin as some people mention in comments has had a lower threshold which included 30% of the healthy population. This had led to wide-spread over-diagnosis and over-treatment.\n\nMany argue \u201cwhat\u2019s the harm, might work\u2026\u201d \n\nWhile I agree that long term use of supplements is probably not majorly harmful, multivitamins have been consistently linked to unchanged or INCREASED risk of cancer - and never to lowered risk, despite the market incentives. There is biological reasoning to back this up - the vitamins in food arrive from cellular systems like our own, with cofactors appropriate doses. Synthetic vitamins are purified. Moreover, some multivitamins contained dosages of vitamins that are orders of magnitude greater than the daily recommended intake, e.g. a single pill may contain 8000% of vitamin E required daily. This is equivalent to eating kilos of almonds in one day (almonds are naturally high in vitamin E).\n\nAll this to say; if you are concerned that your diet is unvaried to a degree that is affecting your health, then don\u2019t rely on pills - vary your diet, especially fruit veg (sorry it\u2019s not a fancier answer, but that\u2019s the science). I\u2019m not taking a Puritan diet at all, but those few greens + your other foods will make it virtually impossible to develop a deficiency, barring pregnancy or significant chronic diseases.\n\nThe scientific literature on this in very extensive.
