  "text": "A bit of odd advice and not seemingly  connected to grad school\u2026 I\u2019ll explain:\n\nGrad school is a lot of work and takes a lot of time. For me, eating well, cooking, and eating in general, has often feel to the wayside for me. The variety in my diet is just not what It used to be.\n\nI was recently blood tested and found my iron levels were a bit low. This inspired me not only to take an iron supplement, but also a multivitamin.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this consistently for a month and a half now and I feel markedly better physically, mentally, and emotionally. Sleep is better, energy levels are higher, anxiety and depression is a little less intense.\n\nAt first I thought it must just be placebo, but then I noticed some small physical issues I had been having just totally went away too.\n\nI really think I was malnourished. Grad school robbed me of the time I used to cook and prepare proper meals for myself.\n\nConclusion: Eat well if you can, and if not, take vitamins.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014  **Follow-Up Comments**  \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFIRST, genuine thanks for all of the easy food ideas! Next grocery trip I make I'm definitely tossing some of those in the mix!\n\n**ON IRON:**\n\nSome pointed out that iron can be dangerous if you don't have an iron deficiency! My iron levels were low enough that it *was* advised by my doctor to take a supplement, but at a certain dosage which I'm guessing is lower than that given to full-blown anemics.\n\nObligatory reminder you've pointed out (with which I agree):\n\n\\- It's probably not a great idea to take an iron supplement unless your doctor advises you to. If you suspect you have an iron or targeted vitamin deficiency, go get your blood tested for sure!\n\n**ON MULTIVITAMINS:**\n\nI also noticed that some of you pointed out that multivitamins are a load of trash and I should just eat better. To that I say, *you're probably right!*...\n\nHonestly, I should have expected this from the amount of you that are probably researching medicine.  Lest we not forget the misguided kink Linus Pauling had for Vitamin C....\n\nI still mostly stand by my original post in that it might be worth trying if your diet kinda sucks and you're not getting much solar Vit D (like me). At the very least, I get the [delicious fruity gummy vitamins](https://www.target.com/p/one-a-day-women-39-s-multivitamin-gummies-170ct/-/A-76150803?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tmnv&DFA=71700000079335722&CPNG=PLA_DVM%2B0060H00000uKC5SQAW-NATL_OAD_Google+Search_Feb_2021_Flight&adgroup=PLA_OneADay_Adult&LID=700000001393753pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9021715&gclid=CjwKCAjwpMOIBhBAEiwAy5M6YA5z0bPlE8K2y2ntbi5N6ZbwAVRthj6DoZkBRQewUXyPUt3iOy4Q7xoCRcYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) which are kind of a nice little treat every day.\n\nAnother obligatory reminder:\n\n\\- Taking vitamins isn't a long-term, nor *standalone,* solution to be \"healthier\".\n\n**I will say, based on the comments from people who probably know a lot more about medicine than I do,  I will seriously consider switching from a multivitamin to just vitamin D and Iron (and whatever I need to absorb it). I would revise my \"advice\" by suggesting that one get  a blood test at  the next doctors app. to see if there's actually any vitamin deficiencies.**",

      "text": "OP, glad you are feeling better. Sorry to rain on your parade, but your multivitamin supplements aren't responsible for improvements in your mood. There is close to zero evidence for that. A balanced diet (even a very lopsided one) is generally capable of providing adequate amounts of nutrients for people of graduate student age (people in their 20s and 30s).\n\nYour symptoms have to do with first, not eating enough (you clearly mention skipping meals in your OP) and second, are classic signs of iron deficiency, which is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies. Because iron carries oxygen in the blood, lack of energy, brain fog, depression, etc. are commonly recognized signs of iron deficiency. Less total body iron --> lower red cell count --> lower oxygen capacity --> reduced metabolic capacity.  Exacerbated by lack of nutrients overall if you are skipping meals. If you are female and \"grad student\" age, you're kind of smack dab in the demographic where iron deficiency is very common. I would recommend following up with your provider once you've been on the iron supplements for a while, it is completely possible to take too much of these (although rare), especially if your diet has improved in the interim to include iron rich foods (meats, fish, poultry, beans/legumes).\n\nSo yes, this is the core issue -- your title should read \"eat regularly\":\n\n    I really think I was malnourished.",

      "text": "Hi, medical doctor/cancer etiology researcher here. I\u2019m happy to hear you are feeling better! I want to mention that I\u2019d be careful about attributing this to the vitamins, and even more careful about extending that advice generally. \n\nMeasurements of iron levels in the blood are volatile and cannot be used to assess iron deficiency. Ferritin is a marker and is more reliable. However, most people with low ferritin (meaning lower 2.5% of a healthy individual) will see no benefit from supplementation, but may have the side effects.\n\nD vitamin as some people mention in comments has had a lower threshold which included 30% of the healthy population. This had led to wide-spread over-diagnosis and over-treatment.\n\nMany argue \u201cwhat\u2019s the harm, might work\u2026\u201d \n\nWhile I agree that long term use of supplements is probably not majorly harmful, multivitamins have been consistently linked to unchanged or INCREASED risk of cancer - and never to lowered risk, despite the market incentives. There is biological reasoning to back this up - the vitamins in food arrive from cellular systems like our own, with cofactors appropriate doses. Synthetic vitamins are purified. Moreover, some multivitamins contained dosages of vitamins that are orders of magnitude greater than the daily recommended intake, e.g. a single pill may contain 8000% of vitamin E required daily. This is equivalent to eating kilos of almonds in one day (almonds are naturally high in vitamin E).\n\nAll this to say; if you are concerned that your diet is unvaried to a degree that is affecting your health, then don\u2019t rely on pills - vary your diet, especially fruit veg (sorry it\u2019s not a fancier answer, but that\u2019s the science). I\u2019m not taking a Puritan diet at all, but those few greens + your other foods will make it virtually impossible to develop a deficiency, barring pregnancy or significant chronic diseases.\n\nThe scientific literature on this in very extensive. The book \u2018Overkill\u2019 by the Dr Paul Offit give an excellent lay-person review for those interested.\nPlease always put your physical and mental health before academic performance.",

However, in (pre)pregnancy multivitamins play a proven beneficial role and certain diseases require supplementation, especially those that lead to decreased fat absorption. However, the latter are often given shots, cause pills are ineffective.\nProbably the main cause of the wide-spread use in the healthy population is good marketing, since there\u2019s no credible science that would sell anyone on that idea.",

All I encourage you to do is look into it a bit. There may be a very good reason to take d vitamin; like risk of osteoporosis. But the majority of my patients think it\u2019ll affect thing like seasonal effective disorder (scientifically an unclear condition) and make them \u201cless tired\u201d. The science does not back up this claim. It is the same tedious answer; varied diet (not conventionally \u201chealthy\u201d, just varied) and exercise is evidence-based to improve most if not all of the standard concerns. In essence neither patients or doctors should treat blood testing numbers with pills, it should be rooted in treating symptoms or preventing disease later imo, test results can inform these decisions; not dictate them.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced doctors may recommend vitamins or similar just because they sense or presume that the patient wants to \u201cdo something\u201d, and the doctor can sometimes forget that a simple \u201cthis is nothing to worry about\u201d or \u201cthis can only be addressed meaningfully with life-style change\u201d is what the patient actually needed or may want to hear.",

I eat steamed spinach with most of my meals, me and my gf like it so we split a bag every meal. They sell it at my local Kroger for $1.99/bg, $1 on sale. And spinach is jammed packed with good nutrients. Another good alternative is frozen veggies. I would get California Blend or Asian Stir-Fry style in 5lb freezer bags. They were ~$8/bg, and a bag would usually last me about two weeks. Again, the heavy greens are good for dietary nutrients, and the cauliflower is no joke either. And it takes minutes to cook in a pan or a microwave! \n\nTo be quite honest, in terms of the economics of food production, if you look very generally high calorie count food items and higher fat content items tend to cost more. This is true of both highly processed foods as well as raw ingredients. Beef is more per pound in cost and calories than chicken, chicken is higher than broccoli. Convenience is the other big variable. So if youre buying out (convenient) high calorie foods, you could be saving money eating more veg at home. Likewise if youre eating a diet higher in animal proteins, substituting in even a little plant based food can save you money, in addition helping your health.",

I was blamed for my diet, \u201cexcessive\u201d running (ran competitively through high school and college, peaking around 50 miles per week in college), and my period. The anemia was the worst right after college when I cut down on my mileage a bunch and didn\u2019t get a period because I was on birth control, needed a blood transfusion bc my ferritin was undetectable and hemoglobin was 7.8, and yet was still told at the ER that they thought I was lying about taking my pills and my diet.

And this is just one factor, might not apply in your case - like any profession laziness may be a key player\u2026\n\nThe second is the information boom; and not just sound, helpful information. Misinformation about gluten, supplements, alternative medicine, etc., has made it harder for certain groups to be taken seriously perhaps. Some doctors are flooded with concerns about eg gluten, It makes it more challenging to select which ones to take seriously. \n\nAnother thing is that giving a benign suggestion for a supplemental unlikely to do harm can be an effective (although misguided) strategy for filtering out patients. My competent and compassionate co-worker pediatrician confessed to using both bronco-dilators and acetaminophen like this out of desperation. Called it a jaw-breaker (cause you can\u2019t complain while sucking on it), then the symptoms will go away on their own in the meantime, basically fulfilling Voltaire old adage: \u201cmedicine is what humans do while nature cures the disease.\u201d (Truer in the 1700s, but not obsolete today\u2026)",

Probably wouldn\u2019t have known otherwise without the iron causing issues. I wasn\u2019t a healthy runner by the end of college, I was constantly injured and it was waved off as female athlete triad for years. It took me much longer than my teammates to heal from stress fractures; I would be out of running for 10+ weeks, ease back in for a month, and then get a new one within a few weeks of coming back to full mileage. It was super frustrating to watch literally everyone else recover from the same injury on the same bones within 6-8 weeks and have no issues once back to full mileage. \n\nA bunch of my cousins have ranging v mild to moderate (?) thalassemia, but they\u2019re all younger than 10. My aunt and mom are mostly of Mediterranean ancestry (3 Italian/Syrian grandparents and an Irish grandparent). My dad is also adopted, so we have no clue what genetic conditions he could be a carrier for. I was born in the 90s, so way before genetic counseling was accessible in the way it is today.\n\nOne of my cousins was missing milestones and got blood work as a toddler, and they tested for thalassemia. Her siblings have a different father and unfortunately never got tested because health insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it without symptoms \ud83d\ude43 This was all about 2010, so right before information was 24/7 accessible and by the time I started having problems, my parents didn\u2019t realize it could be a possibility (especially when you\u2019re a teen girl growing with heavy periods)! I have a wonderful hematologist who really listened to my concerns and was actually very thorough in asking about my family history, and decided to push for just about everything she could think of because I simply didn\u2019t know half of my genetic history. I actually called her up a few days after the test like \u201coh my aunt just told me my cousin has thalassemia too!\u201d and they\u2019re like \u201cyup we can see\ud83d\ude43\u201d",

Many vitamins  inhibit the uptake of other vitamins or at least your body cant uptake all of them at once.

And you want to look into when to space the timing of taking vitamins if you take more than one pill.  \n\n\nBest of luck on your personally physiological journey!",

A targeted change in diet could be better. \n\nIf you have a specific deficiency, diagnosed by a doctor with real tests to back it up, then a targeted supplement is great to treat that!
