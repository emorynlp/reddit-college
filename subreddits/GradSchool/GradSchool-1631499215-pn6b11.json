I\u2019m finishing up a masters of economics. I decided to try to do a PhD program. I have flying colors in every other criteria for admission: 4.0, TA and research assistant work, letters of rec from professors to attest to different skills, and I know I can write a good statement of purpose. \n\nHowever, I made a big mistake not studying enough for the GRE (working 60 hours a week over summer left me not much time or motivation). I got 151 quant and 161 verbal. Completely average (maybe below?). Should I bother wasting money applying to PhD programs? I really love economics.

I was over 5 years from my last marh class and only had through Calc 2 when I first took the GRE, yet I got a 158 without reviewing. GRE math is ridiculously basic. I'd retake it now that I'm taking higher-level math classes to prepare for an econ PhD, but my mid-160s quant score I got on my retake 3 years ago is sufficient for me given covid's impact on the GRE & I'm hoping schools will realize that my GRE probably isn't the best indicator of my current mathematical skills.", "author": "era626", "created": 1631536618, "upvotes": 8}, "hcnb81z": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pn6b11/151_quantitative_gre_should_i_even_bother/hcnb81z/", "text": "I\u2019m surprised your verbal is so good and u want to do your PhD in econ.
