  "title:": "151 Quantitative GRE. Should I even bother applying for econ PhD?",
  "text": "Hi all. I\u2019m finishing up a masters of economics. I decided to try to do a PhD program. I have flying colors in every other criteria for admission: 4.0, TA and research assistant work, letters of rec from professors to attest to different skills, and I know I can write a good statement of purpose. \n\nHowever, I made a big mistake not studying enough for the GRE (working 60 hours a week over summer left me not much time or motivation). I got 151 quant and 161 verbal. Completely average (maybe below?). Should I bother wasting money applying to PhD programs? I really love economics. I want to be an economist.",

Look at your list again and figure out how many schools don't require GRE.\n\nBut, while the GRE isn't the greatest measurement, such a poor score may mean you need to brush up on basic math skills. I was over 5 years from my last marh class and only had through Calc 2 when I first took the GRE, yet I got a 158 without reviewing. GRE math is ridiculously basic. I'd retake it now that I'm taking higher-level math classes to prepare for an econ PhD, but my mid-160s quant score I got on my retake 3 years ago is sufficient for me given covid's impact on the GRE & I'm hoping schools will realize that my GRE probably isn't the best indicator of my current mathematical skills.",
