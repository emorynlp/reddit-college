  "text": "In my first-year review a faculty member said they didn't think I would make it through my Ph.D. program. The next year I aced my prelims. I'd almost quit multiple times, drudged through my prospectus defense, and had to deal with finishing and defending during a pandemic. But yesterday, I successfully defend my thesis. My friends and family were with me remotely. I got to hear my advisor say I was a doctor and my committee members sent me wonderfully supportive emails. I finally made it! A few revisions are all that separates me from my tenure-track faculty job in August and I couldn't be happier or prouder of myself.",

          "text": "I don't know reasons for sure, but I have some speculations coming from STEM myself. Often we are told to be as 'unemotional' as possible when conducting scientific research, and unfortunately I think that ingrained thought process seeps into other aspects of one's life. Also, while some lab supervisors/PIs are great reasearchers, they are often terrible managers, and may even lack basic empathy for the emotional well being of others. To top it off, I have met other head scientists who have quite poor social skills and lack awareness in social situations. These are just my observations, but I'd be interested to chat to my friends doing their PhDs in humanities to see what their thoughts are.",
