The next year I aced my prelims. I'd almost quit multiple times, drudged through my prospectus defense, and had to deal with finishing and defending during a pandemic. But yesterday, I successfully defend my thesis. My friends and family were with me remotely. I got to hear my advisor say I was a doctor and my committee members sent me wonderfully supportive emails. I finally made it! A few revisions are all that separates me from my tenure-track faculty job in August and I couldn't be happier or prouder of myself.", "author": "maribellee", "created": 1590249343, "retrieved": 1632845966, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 338, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"frlulm1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gp79pz/6_years_and_im_finally_finished/frlulm1/", "text": "I, similarly, was told three years ago that I wasn\u2019t \u201ccut out for research\u201d and graduated with my PhD this semester.
