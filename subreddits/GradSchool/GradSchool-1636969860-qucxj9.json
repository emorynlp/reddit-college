  "text": "Hi,\n\nMy grandma passed away yesterday. I was close with her so the last 24 hours have taken me through some very complex feelings. Despite suffering from late-stage dementia, I was the one person she still recognized. I miss her very much. The emotions come and go, and I can feel when the next wave is coming.\n\nI'm currently a PhD student in my last year and working on a manuscript for journal submission. I've enjoyed my time in graduate school and am grateful for the opportunity to explore some interesting questions. My advisor doesn't know what has happened with my grandma, but she has been supportive throughout my degree and we've had a productive work relationship. I don't plan on taking time off, because otherwise I would think too much which has been a trigger for the waves of emotion.\n\nI'm wondering for those who have faced loss or grief during graduate school: How did you cope? Who did you talk to? Did counselling work? Also, did you tell your advisor? If so, how did you approach that? I don't want to be a burden at work, but I'm also bracing for the possibility that I might not be able to keep it together one day and then my advisor will ask what's going on.\n\nThanks for any comments. I lost a piece of myself yesterday and it has shaken me to truly understand what people mean when they say health is no.1 and time is priceless. Being in graduate school, it's easy to tunnel vision and forget about health and spending time with loved ones. Take care of yourselves, and don't forget to tell the people you care about that you love them.",

      "text": "First, sending much care your way.  \n\nMy situation was a little different in two ways - I am completing my masters and when my dad passed away I also needed to help take care of him.  My faculty were aware before and after.  \n\nCounseling - 100%.  I also think it\u2019s valuable to tell your advisor, it gives you more space if you have a bad day and you can avoid explaining it in the moment.  I sent a professional \u201cI wanted to let you know that X happened and I plan to do Y about my work\u201d.\n\nI have found that my work in someways helped me get through the worst times because I had something very specific to focus on.  I also needed days where I took a little space.  I find grief to be unpredictable and the way you grieve today (probably feels a bit like shock) will be different than the way you grieve in a few weeks.    Letting your advisor know now gives you room to ask for what you need if that changes.  In the case of my faculty, I felt very supported and it helped ease the transition back into my work.  I think most schools have bereavement policy of some kind as well.  \n\nTake care of yourself, first and foremost.",

          "text": "Thanks a lot, I'm sending a lot of care your way too. I helped take care of my grandma as well so I can understand how that can factor into the feelings. Yes, having something specific to focus on is more helpful than not, and yes I'm swaying between being in shock and being \"ok\".  \n\n\nWhat you said made a lot of sense, so I told my advisor yesterday and she was very understanding. It was the right thing to do. Now I feel like I have more room to ask for space if I happen to need it. I am so glad that your faculty supported you through that, this is such a vulnerable situation and support is needed more than ever.   \n\n\nI am wishing you the very very best, take care.",

I'm so happy your advisors gave you some time, this is really difficult to work through, especially if you were close with your grandparents. Did you lose both this year?  \n\n\nCongratulations on making it to the your second year of the phd! Even pursuing a graduate degree is a big achievement in my eyes and I have a lot of respect for people who choose to do so. Don't forget to take breaks and reconnect with loved ones (I wish I did more during my early phd years), and take care. All the best!",
