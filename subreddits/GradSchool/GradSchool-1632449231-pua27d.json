I already have a first author pub, which I understand certainly doesn\u2019t mean I know everything about paper writing. But my advisor just seems to be confused by everything I write and disagrees with most of my main conclusions; my last paper draft was just painted red in some areas, and I\u2019m really concerned getting papers out is going to keep me in this degree longer if I have to spend so much time on these drafts to fit my advisors wishes. In my classes and with my undergrad advisor, no one seemed to want to reconstruct my writing so badly, and I was always told I was a great writer. I\u2019m nearing the end of my degree and i just feel like this person thinks I\u2019m so incompetent because they won\u2019t try and understand my way of thinking; they also just talk to me about everything like they assume I\u2019m wrong off the bat and my way of doing things couldn\u2019t possibly be right. It\u2019s so discouraging and makes me feel so bad about myself as a scientist. I just don\u2019t even want to do this anymore", "author": "FPatt737", "created": 1632449231, "retrieved": 1632844034, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he1lshw": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pua27d/advisor_seems_to_hate_everything/he1lshw/", "text": "You should be worried if your advisor *isn't* marking up your papers heavily and challenging your assumptions.

That said, it might be worth having a discussion about conclusions and big picture ideas before you actually start.", "author": "mediocre-spice", "created": 1632451036, "upvotes": 6}}}
