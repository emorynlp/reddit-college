Classes are only 8 weeks but really only 6 when you exclude the intro and final. You have 6 weeks to learn a class while working FT. Only one class per week. Sorry, but 6 weeks isn\u2019t enough time to master a course. Pre 2010 classes were double their current length 10-12 weeks and classes met more than one time per week. Tests were not open book and open notes. Learning modules were often approved prior to the start of the year to include new material. \n\nI started data science this year and noticed the changes. Schools are completely disorganised. One class in and I\u2019m already convinced I\u2019m in a junk university.\n\nFor example: I\u2019m in SQL. We\u2019re using exam # 70-462 MCSA MCSE (2012 edition) Well that might have been fine and all in early 2020 as microsoft hadn\u2019t yet retired this exam. They now use a different version making the material outdated. I\u2019m paying 2400 to learn outdated material!? I relayed this information to CS office and they stated they found out this late and couldn\u2019t require all the current students to re-purchase new books. \n\nWell its not our f-up. Its theirs. They should be supplementing the material for their oversight.
