Of course grad school is the ultimate goal, but I\u2019m ok if it takes 5 years for me to get there. I really think you shouldn\u2019t put things on hold IF they wouldn\u2019t majorly impact your chances of going into graduate school. But that\u2019s completely up to you, but having the mentality that you WILL get into grad school at one point helps a lot. \n\nHope that was helpful, sorry if it isn\u2019t!",

Maybe in retrospect it was overly ambitious since my undergrad was just some regionally known state school and I applied to some good schools. Oh well. This year I\u2019ve been blessed enough to find a great job in a totally unrelated field and although it doesn\u2019t interest me the crew is great. I\u2019m back at applying this year for masters programs at some same schools and some different ones/different programs. But I\u2019m not gonna lie I was super depressed for a few months there (I graduated last December so I think the rejections combined with being unemployed for months cuz of the pandemic just fucked me all up). It\u2019s great that you don\u2019t let it get you down, cuz it mentally fucked me for a while. I was communicating with some professors this year and they emphasized that a lot of great scholars currently in their program were rejected at least once at some point before getting somewhere. So if anyone is reading this and feeling down, it gets better trust me!",
