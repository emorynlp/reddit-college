I\u2019m back at applying this year for masters programs at some same schools and some different ones/different programs. But I\u2019m not gonna lie I was super depressed for a few months there (I graduated last December so I think the rejections combined with being unemployed for months cuz of the pandemic just fucked me all up). It\u2019s great that you don\u2019t let it get you down, cuz it mentally fucked me for a while. I was communicating with some professors this year and they emphasized that a lot of great scholars currently in their program were rejected at least once at some point before getting somewhere.
