  "title:": "Should I apply to this school?",
  "text": "I am a current senior at meh college, hoping to go to grad school for PhD next fall. I asked for the information packet for this school 2 months ago. Then I soon realized how this school is out of my league and I removed it from my list of the schools. Now today, I randomly got an email from this school from their dean. I'm sure that the email was for everyone who requested the info packet or anyone who showed them interest. \n\nMy self-esteem is pretty low at this point and I don't think I can get in anywhere. I don't have a higher than a 3.5 GPA, zero publication (Will have some before I graduate but definitely not before applying). I am trying to change my major, and I am also international. \n\nSo me being very unsure in myself, this one sentence in the email got me thinking, wait do they want me? The sentence is \"I write as a follow-up since we would like to have you apply for admission, and we are committed to helping you do that.\" \n\nI really need to stop thinking that I have a chance at this school. So can guys tell me so. I need to kill my rising self esteem:)",

      "text": "On one hand, you shouldn't be afraid to apply to \"reach\" schools that you aren't convinced you can get into. A good strategy (if you can afford it :/ ) is to apply for a few reach schools, a few schools you're fairly comfortable you could probably get into, and a few safety schools that you're very confident you could get into. \n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't rely too much on \"we want you to apply\". Sure they do, they want to charge you an application fee, and they want to say they rejected so many applications. I got an actual letter from a school inviting me to apply - a school I should've been able to get into. Didn't get in. Don't let that kind of invitation influence your decisions.",

For grad school, especially the phd program, i have no freaking idea if i have chances\ud83d\ude14",

              "text": "Is there anyone more experienced you can talk to, especially someone who is familiar with your work? Professors are an obvious resource, but don't overlook people who graduated ahead of you from your own program who went on to graduate school. They might be able to tell you their application profiles and admissions results. If you can identify some programs you're interested in, grad students from those schools are probably happy to talk to prospective students and usually not shy about discussing their academic backgrounds. You may be able to get a grasp of how you match up, but obviously it's a biased sample of just those who got in.\n\nI recommend thegradcafe.com with some caution. That site allows applicants to post what schools they applied to, what their qualifications were, and what admissions decisions they received. You should know what schools you're looking for ahead of time, but you can use the search function and with some patience get an idea of what qualifications schools will accept. Bear in mind that the admissions process is nuanced (some might say almost random) so you'll sometimes see people with 900 GRE scores and 4.0 GPAs getting rejected, or much \"less qualified\" students being accepted; the information they share might not include something crucial that a reviewer thought made them a good (or bad) fit.",
