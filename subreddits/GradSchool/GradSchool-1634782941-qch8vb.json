  "text": "I feel like it is in the nature of this sub to post when you are feeling down and in the need of advice. I\u2019ve done it before and I see it all the time. I just wanted to post because I\u2019ve had a lot of hard times in grad school but right now I feel pretty good. I\u2019ve gotten into a decent rhythm, I\u2019m getting exercise, I\u2019m working 6 or so very solid - distraction free - hours a day plus maybe a few extra distracted ones, and then I\u2019m spending the rest of my time with friends, labmates, and outside. I haven\u2019t published anything recently, in fact I\u2019m not even close to any publications right now. I\u2019m just getting a decent amount done and still feel like I have been living my life. \n\nI guess I just wanted to remind those who are not in their rhythm right now that there will come a time when you get back onto it and things will feel a lot better.\n\nFor me it took moving and having a good internship to get me into the right mindset but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a number of stimuli that would work for others.",

          "text": "Yup! It\u2019s weird cause in my department there\u2019s a few people who complain a ton but the majority of the department seems wildly more successful than me, so I actually get the opposite feeling like I\u2019m the only one struggling sometimes. I guess the important thing to remember is that every perspective you get is biased in how you get it.",
