  "text": "I plan on applying for a school counseling grad program, deadline Feb 1st. I literally don\u2019t know anyone to get letters of rec from. I graduated undergrad in May of 2021 and of course I haven\u2019t kept in touch with any of my professors. Not to mention I didn\u2019t really do that well in Undergrad (I graduated with a 3.15 GPA). I feel awkward emailing my professors because I feel like it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in class that they probably don\u2019t remember me and would be offended if I asked them. I didn\u2019t really ever have any chill professors that I think would just do it, and I didn\u2019t really have a professor that I got close with (I was stupid in undergrad, I know). I just want to note that grad school was never originally my plan so I stupidly didn\u2019t really do anything in undergrad that would make me a good candidate for grad school.\n\nAnyone have any tips? I have a pretty relevant job right now so I could ask my boss except I have only been working for a month so far. Ugh. I feel so stuck.",

      "text": "You need to give them a reason to write you a letter.\n\n>Dear Professor,\n\n>I have recently made the decision to apply for graduate school and I am reaching out to you to request a letter of recommendation.\n\n> I took your course (ECON 201) in Spring of 2019 and received a B (87%). For me the highlight of the course was the final project where I designed a product and wrote a business plan. I not only enjoyed the project (and is part of the reason I decided to apply to graduate school!) but I received an A+.\n\n>I am attaching a current version of my CV and a copy of that final project. I plan to apply to three schools which require LORs due: 1/9/22, 1/15/22 and 1/18/22. If you are willing to write a letter I will supply your name and email and they will send you a form to fill out. I can also send you a reminder early January of the dates and schools.\n\n> Please let me know if you are able to write me a letter. Thanks again for being a great professor and I hope you have a nice break!\n\n> Best,  Outrageous.\n\n\n\n\nSo what this email does is remind the prof who you are. Reminds them of work you did. Does all the leg work (with CV and a piece of work you have done) for them. You also give the dates and what you are asking of them. And it is polite.\n\nTip: Don't ask anyone you got less than a B grade in. Don't ask anyone outside of the field you are applying (there letter will be irrelevant). And don't ask anyone in a course you cheated in. Because I can't believe students do that.\n\nIn the event that no one responds and you get no letters you can also take a course as a post bac in the field you want, tell the prof your intention is to prepare further for grad school, ace it, and ask them for your letter.",
