  "text": "Hello!\n\nI am very interested in pursuing a MS in Statistics however, I was curious about a few things. What does a MS in Statistics admissions office look for in a candidate? I was hoping to gather some insight as to how I can augment my skills to become a better candidate. I have a BSE in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan and in my professional life have worked as both a software engineer and a data scientist. I have worked with several doctors as a data scientist to publish papers regarding heart surgery but found that I could work on more complex and interesting papers if my knowledge in the field of statistics was a bit more expansive. Which is what led me here!\n\nAnyways, I was hoping to become a bit more informed about MS in Statistics programs and learn what I can do to become a better candidate. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",
