So I decided going to grad school would be a safe option as it would give me a job for the next two years and some additional training. I have a computer science degree but no internship experience (reason mentioned above) and getting a job without prior experience is damn near impossible in this industry. My grad program is a life science program and I had worked in a life science lab writing code for two years of undergrad so I figured it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. Turns out I have zero interest in my current field of study. I don\u2019t want to work in the life science industry regardless of pay. I\u2019m terrified of telling my advisor any of this. She was my boss for the last two years and I can\u2019t let her down. My spot in the lab could have gone to someone else. I\u2019m terrified of telling my family any of this. They were all so proud of me for getting accepted to grad school and for getting free tuition and a stipend. I have no job prospects and if I drop out of school I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never get a job in software development. However if I stay in my program I\u2019ll never get a job in software development either. I have no idea what to do.", "author": "the_trees_ofslim", "created": 1632278365, "retrieved": 1632952133, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"hdt2ts9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/psy5oh/i_want_to_drop_out_and_its_only_been_5_weeks/hdt2ts9/", "text": "Relax.  Take a step back.\n\nSpend some time re-evaluating your life goals.  The old \"Where do you see yourself in 10 years\" question.  Build those ideas first and then you'll think about strategies to get there.\n\n1. Will a graduate degree (you said 2 years, so I'm assuming a Master's) still helpful?  My evaluation is a resounding \"yes\". \n2. It seems like your skillsets are in demand in life science.  You're in a coding capacity, so I'm assuming numerical modeling work.  Sounds like you'll be building models and algorithms.  Does this feel better if you think of it as applied computer science?  \n3. Can you tough it out for two years?  I understand you want software development but I think this harder-science/algorithm-building is a good opportunity to build those experiences/toolkits to make you a more attractive developer.\n\nLook.  I'm not going to lie.  If you want to get into software development then just leave and join a software development firm.  There are many job openings right now and target for January or something.  Shit happens.  \n\nBut, I think you can think of this experience from \"I'm not interested in life sciences\" to \"I get to actually learn and apply principles of computer science to solve a real-life cutting-edge problem\".  Yes it's not a full-on software development job, but these are elements that can make you a bit more attractive as a software developer.  More of a jack of all trades who has had strong algorithm experiences.  I think this is a great opportunity to learn about applied data science, another skillset making you a more seasoned software developer.  \n\nAlso there are high demand of software developers in life sciences.  Maybe your advisor can help you network into an industry job doing what you want once you're done.  This also gives you the potential mobility to data science if you get tired of the software development world.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1632284368, "upvotes": 2}}}
