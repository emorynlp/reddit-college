  "text": "Hi all, I just finished applying to 9 very carefully chosen PhD programs and got an invitation to an \"information session\" with a PI who I would very much like to work with. I'm super grateful for the opportunity to learn more about the lab, but I'm honestly just not sure what to expect. It's too early for formal interviews and this isn't a department/school overview session. I'd like to be as prepared as possible. Anyone experience anything similar, and if so, what did you encounter? Thanks in advance for any help or feedback.",

      "text": "I would recommend reading up on that PIs research. They will likely ask you about your research interests, why you want to be a scientist, and what specifically about their work you find interesting and how that fits into your goals. Ultimately they will be trying to assess if your interests and personality will be a good fit for the lab, so go in fully prepared to articulate those interests and to express who you are.",

Be prepared to talk about research you\u2019ve done as well, and feel free to ask them what they\u2019re currently working on. \n\nRemember that they know you\u2019re not a graduate student yet so they won\u2019t expect you to be an expert. Be honest about what you don\u2019t know if they ask something and you aren\u2019t sure about it. The best thing you can do in that scenario is say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d followed by an honest attempt to answer or speculate about an answer. PI\u2019s love that. Almost no PI is going to try and bait or trick you.",

He also sent me his recent paper to read too get an idea of how much of the lab's research I'd understand; plot twist it went over my head but I managed to link some themes to things I read before. \n\nOtherwise, we talked about why I want to do research in that field, about why I think that a PhD is a better choice for my career given that going straight into industry would be a better financial choice. I ended up skipping a formal interview because of that talk as we ended up covering a lot of topics that would have been covered in an interview.\n\nSo... maybe read about what kind of research their lab does, try to read a paper, make some mental connections of how your background would be relevant to the lab.",

      "text": "Remember that picking your program/PI/workplace is also about having a nice place to work at for the years you will be there. Try not only talk about science, also talk about why they think their group and department is a good place to work at and why you would want to work there. Try to find out about their attitude about a healthy work/life balance and what kind of culture there is in the department. Of course it can be hard to navigate that kind of discussion when you want to be picked for the position, but it's so extremely important. A PhD will be one of the most challenging things you have done and so you will want to do it in an environment that is not only scientifically satisfying but also a good place to work at. If possible, discuss with their students what they find the best and worst things about working there, but also ask the PI this. Find out if people usually take all their vacation (idk how vacation works in other countries but where I am we get a few weeks vacation every year), if most people there work weekends and so on. You can have a good and productive PhD without working weekends and skipping vacations, but it can be hard to do it if the workplace culture is to never take any time off.",

I was exceptionally selective in where I applied and who I flagged (many programs I only flagged one PI) because I really want that alignment. However, the personality of the PI and lab seem so critical to being able to complete the program and do good work. I feel like I'm so busy selling myself out of anxiety from that void of the unknown and I need to put the focus back on my own path and process, for sure.",

Read up on the lab\u2019s latest research and have a good idea of why you would be interested in doing similar work and how you would be a good fit for the lab. In my experience, academics love to talk about their work with people who show genuine interest. If you know even the basics you\u2019ll get them talking about their passions and you\u2019ll get a sense of their priorities, attitudes, and research interests. It doesn\u2019t hurt to do some standard interview prep as well.",
