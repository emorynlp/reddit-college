  "text": "https://dev-pbsci-intranet.pantheonsite.io/2020/03/02/addressing-the-graduate-student-strike/\n\nDean Paul Koch sent an email to physical sciences bragging about low STEM TA participation in the strike (STEM students are very sympathetic to the strike but TA a lot less and are paid more).  He then claimed that offering a salary that doesn't rent burden students is not fair because the hourly rate for the part time work would be higher than other FTE employees, and re-hashed the usual line about tuition being a part of compensation.\n\nNot only is this email ignorant, it's a flat out lie. I was compensated perfectly well as a STEM grad student while at UCSC, easily at the level that is being asked for by strikers, and so were all other grads in my program. This is what university leadership actually thinks being a grad student is like.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs, the admin are woefully mismanaged from UCOP down.",

      "text": "Aren't STEM student stipends supplemented by the grants their advisors hold?  Typically you have some base stipend from the University that is going to be like $17k and then on top of that you get an extra like $15k from your fellowship, training grant, or PIs grants that isn't coming from the University.  So even if you get $32k a year the University is only paying $17k of that.\n\nI mean that is usually how it works...its not that the University pays STEM students more, its that STEM students stipends are supplemented by external grant funding.  As a STEM student you should know that right?",

          "text": "...yes? I described in multiple other comments in this post how the funding situation works.\n\nYou do have a lot of the details wrong: UCSC pays an (approximately) equivalent rate for GSRs and TA-ships during the 3 main academic quarters quarters for 50% \"billed\" (loosely) time, the difference being whether the stipend + tuition remission comes from the university or the grant. It's not uncommon for students to switch between the two from quarter-to-quarter, or even combine the two (e.g. tuition remission from a 25% TA-ship + stipend from GSR). It's not like the two come in different formats, you get the same paycheck on the same W2 with the same pay restrictions from both funding sources.\n\nAdditional funding in the summer can (again) come from either GSRs or TA-ships, the difference being that the university can pay out at up-to 100% time in the summer and there's no tuition remission component. It's more common for students to have GSR pay in the summer since there's limited TA/teaching opportunity, but again, people will mix and match stuff. This is where the statement that STEM gets paid more comes from - they're just more likely to have opportunities for summer funding, but summer funding is never guaranteed. \n\nFellowships add another level of complication. \n\nThere's no \"usual\" for the way universities divide up their TA and GSR funding to pay their students, I think just about every one of my PhD offers had their own weird quirks about how things are divided up, whether certain funding sources pay more, and which account tuition comes from. \n\nNone of the discussion around Koch's letter was as to the details of which pot of money the paychecks + remission was coming from.",

If the University pays out of pocket the same for a STEM grad student as for a humanties grad student but STEM grad students make 75% more because they have additional funding sources that humanities grad students do not have then pointing at how much STEM grad students make total and saying \"see....the University CAN afford to pay that much\" is a bit disingenuous or misleading.  \n\n\nNow if the University does actually pay out of their own pocket considerably more for STEM grad students than humanties grad students then you have a point about why they couldn't even that up.  But I don't think that is the case.",

The pot of money for funding isn't his objection. \n\nNo one is saying the university just has this money sitting around, they obviously don't. The point of the strike is to get additional leverage to force the university to make cuts in other places, or to put additional leverage on UCOP to change revenue splits (which are currently slanted heavily against UCSC in favor of other campuses).\n\nAnd if you think the university's response is about money, it's much more about union busting. There's a general understanding among UCSC faculty that UCOP is adopting a \"don't negotiate with terrorists\" stance.",

Pretty different from other students at my same university! Some MBA folks get paid a lot more than this, and I've met another masters student whose department has 0 funded positions!",

Look at the amount of money brought in by different departments.  The humanities receive more core funding than engineering and yet have fewer graduate students.  Do you have a bleeding heart for that too?  Am I licking boots for pointing that out? The vast majority of the contributed and grant funds come through astro/genomics or Silicon Valley so why is it unreasonable to pay the GSR\u2019s in the money making depts more?

Elevating ourselves above the level of adjuncts only creates more disparity.  \n\nFurthermore the bulk of responsibility lies on the state for continually decreasing funding, and Silicon Valley for populating the area.  That *and we live in paradise*\n\nYou all act like this is a meager wage, and while I agree it could be and should be better, this movement has done itself very few favors, and the more outspoken of you have only polarized and made an enemy of the rest of us.

Hourly averages don't matter, it's an artificial cap that Koch is using as a crutch when the university obviously gets around it for STEM grad students. Are you also saying STEM should be paid more also? Sure, go for it, I don't have a problem with that. \n\n> And using your poorly constructed argument to deter prospective graduates from attending UCSC is not only insulting to me as a UCSC grad but also diminishes the value of my degree.\n\nYou're entitled to your opinion of course, but I don't understand what point you're trying to make.

Unfortunately, last time I checked, it went down to 3 years for my program so it seems like they are enrolling more undergrads and grads. Housing in that area is of course more, but still not like San Francisco or Santa Cruz prices and can get cheaper within a 30 min drive away (I\u2019m estimating here since I never had to make that sort of commute in the morning).",

You seem to not understand where money comes from and what money covers what, but that is ok it can be very confusing and I spent a lot of time talking to all levels of administration to understand it. I would suggest you spend some time learning about it, I know the time i spent learning about the money at universities helped me a lot, I managed to get \\~80k in the last year to get my projects done and license my work to private companies for over 100k upfront and a good amount of royalty money once sales start.\n\nIf the point of grad school wasn't to get those three letters (phd), i would leave tomorrow because i have my job lined up but  they need  for me to have those three letters. \n\nI am in a paid program, and made sure to pick one that would pay me enough to live in the area the school is located in. Which was a very smart choice. If graduate students should be thought of as employees they should all be fired because almost all grad students are a net loss for the every university. \n\nMost graduate students (phd's) take classes for 2-3 years, and if they are working hard and not getting screwed they will graduate in 4-5 years. Even when they are not taking classes they are taking up lots of the time of many professors and the university is spending a lot of money on the facilities that the graduate students use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat i would ask you to consider is where will the money come from to pay these striking students more money? Who do you take it from? Do you take it from hard working families that are far less privileged than people in graduate school? And if the students get their demands where do you get the money to pay for the increased wages of other government employees who will demand more money when they see that graduate students who work part time get paid more than them?

It comes down to balancing institutional and state budgets, which can always be negotiated. \n\nYour whole \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d and \u201cpaid what they\u2019re worth\u201d rhetoric is a pseudo intellectual\u2019s take on the short sighted libertarian ideas that my edgy teenage nephews are drawn to. If you can\u2019t understand my point within the context of my comment, I legitimately cannot help you. I just hope you demonstrate better reading comprehension skills in your graduate work.",

They will set you straight if you are willing to learn\n2. The most important point you keep ignoring is where will the money come from? What people are you going to take it from to give to those who have enough privilege to be in graduate school. And a TAs time is worth probably about $20 an hour, which with the 0.5 FT that most TA are at that would come out to be a bit under 20k a year. Now that is also ignoring the fact that grad students get massive tuition waivers.\n3. \"slack jawed parroting\" another good example of you going ad hominem. Also who do you think I am parroting? I was smart enough to look at the situation in California and get out, so that is where i am coming from, not parroting anyone.\n4. Almost all of the grad students i work with are similar to you, a complete lack of understanding of basic economics so i don't feel bad when academics say they don't agree with my views on economics. And I am not staying in academia. I already have my very nice high six figure job offer lined up for when i graduate in a few months and the closest i plan on getting to academia after is an adjunct position to help my university out. \n5.

This is true because there is no traditional market to demand TA labor, it\u2019s simply budgeted for and provided by the university. While you don\u2019t seem to understand this, it\u2019s not clear whether the misunderstanding is willing or not.\n\n2. Oh how very quantitative of you. How did you come up with $20 per hour? Did you pull it out of your ass? Is there no difference in schools with differential cost of living? What about schools that charge more for tuition? Am I really supposed to take you seriously after writing that? This is hilarious coming from a guy who just called his position \u201cwell reasoned.\u201d \n\n3.

I think this is a much more reasonable point to make, and this would get much more into the nitty gritty of the economics of government organizes, but I believe the crux i my point still holds that economics still plays a large part. When it comes to this specific set up a simplified way to look at it is through the economics of supply of graduate students and availability, scale, and allotments of grants and internal funding.\n\n2. No it was not just pulled out of nowhere the median starting hourly wage is around $20  for those with bachelors degree, so i thought this was a very generous valuation for a TA's value. The skill and labor given are fairly equivalent across geographic locations so why should this specific pay be different. It is the same at the jobs i am looking at pay offers in the midwest are coming in about the same as those in CA. You don't have to take me seriously, but if you were able to entertain a though that was different than your and look at its merits you might learn something, but you do love attacking the person over the merits of a point.\n\n3. You are making a common mistake i see, well educated doesn't mean well rounded. Most graduate students are extremely well educated in a very narrow field, but without taking the time to become educated in other fields, such as economics, they arrogantly believe that because they are getting a doctorate that their education gives them an expert opinion in everything. And it isn't handwaving away the disapproval of my peer. Let me give you an example from a lecture i was in last semester. The professor asked which of a list of programs would be the best to implement and everyone, except me, in the class agreed that it was the one that gave the greatest gain per dollar spent. I had to explain to them that market share gained by the year over year improvement would lead the the programs that led to overall gain likely being the better options. None of the other graduate students understood competitions, ROI's (returns on investments), market shares, or any of the other basics that need to be understood when attempting to implement solutions. The issue with the graduate student strike shares many similarities with that issue brought up in the lecture.\n\n4. As i pointed out above, that was not greatly mischaracterized, you directly stated that you believe graduate student pay is not dictated by economics. You said it is simply budgeted for by the university, do you know where the money for a university budget comes from? \n\n5. Time after time the fact that you completely ignore the main point that I bring up seems to show that you have no way to address it and without an answer you show that there is not logical foundation for your entire view point. Where does the money come from? Who will you take the money away from to give it to the graduate students? Who will you take the money away from to give it to the other government employees who will demand more because now graduate students who work part time are getting paid more than them to go to school? Will you take it from the tax base in California most of whom are far less privileged than those who have had the privilege given to them in life that allows them to attend graduate school? \n\nRemember you can keep just saying I am an idiot to make yourself feel better, but until you can address the points I made in point 5 above, you have no foundation. You are not wanting to just give money to grad students you are wanting to take it from someone. And that is going to be someone are far less privilege the graduate students.",
