He then claimed that offering a salary that doesn't rent burden students is not fair because the hourly rate for the part time work would be higher than other FTE employees, and re-hashed the usual line about tuition being a part of compensation.\n\nNot only is this email ignorant, it's a flat out lie. I was compensated perfectly well as a STEM grad student while at UCSC, easily at the level that is being asked for by strikers, and so were all other grads in my program.
