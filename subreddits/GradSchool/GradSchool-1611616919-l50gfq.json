Learn how you learn best. Structure your way of getting and processing information. A couple of hours on how to manage your files, articles, work and project management tools will save you TONS. For me, Zotero and Obsidian are life savers. Learn their more advanced functions.\n\n1b : Read / write every day. Journal you thesis. \n\n2 : Social. Even in COVID times, you can reach out to people. Be seen. Twitter, LinkedIn, present abstracts in conferences. It will help you later. Find your \"crown\". There are key people in the world having a conversation on your subject. Find them, listen and contribute.\n\n2b : social personal. Doing online game via Discord or whatever with friends and family weekly helps also. It's surely a lot better than nothing.\n\n3 : Health. Sleep, eat well, exercise. No need to put in 1h each day in exercise. Just a 15 min run around the block daily will do a whole lot to your physical / mental health. Some free weights on the floor near your bed. Do 2-3 sets of whatever each day. Don't think about it. Routinize it and in one month you'll see that you feel better. For food, planning in advance can help. Cooking a batch of quinoa, rice or whatever. Just assemble some veggies, spice, olive oil. You can have a tasty healthy meal in 15 minutes. (less than walking to a restaurant !)\n\n4 : Find something to relax your mind. I just took back chess (on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org)). Each day I play a couple of games. Takes me about 10-15 minutes, I realize it keeps my brain sharper. Also, I took back learning a language on Duolingo. again, 10 minutes per day when I'm on a break or eating, whatever. \n\nYou can see from this that in short : Prepare and routinizing are key. Shortcut your anxiety by not even having to think about what you have to do each day. Don't be afraid to try something that doesn't work. If you are not sure what to do, just do something that can work. At least you'll have feedback on which to build.
