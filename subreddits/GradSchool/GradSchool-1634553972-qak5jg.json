      "text": "I would ask the instructor for clarification this because I have never heard of \"APA reflection formatting\" and my discipline uses APA format mostly. I think the formatting of a class reflection paper is a bit beyond the purview of the national American Psychological Association lol\n\nMy guess would be that the APA formatting would apply to the references, so if you are citing the readings you would do so in accordance with APA style. However, I also wouldn't feel comfortable assuming this is also what the instructor has in mind. In my classes, this is pretty much what we did, but nobody did the rest of APA formatting for just a reflection paper (e.g. title page, abstract, references list, etc).",
