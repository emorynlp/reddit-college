  "text": "I really like sociology and ethnography classes I have taken but the cultural anthropology course 100% has a political agenda. Not that I disagree with it but it feels like brainwashing rather than academic discourse.",

      "text": "I'm not a cultural anthropologist but I am an archaeologist. Power relations are a key component of the human experience, both presently and in the past. Many of the topics anthropologists are interested in, like gender or race, have components that are intimately tied to power. Who has it? What are the impacts? You can't really understand humans holistically without talking about this kind of stuff. \n\nOn top of this, many of my fellow anthropologists & archaeologists are also really interested in social justice and activism. I think this was less true in the past than it is today. My peers don't really shy away from political topics. Anthropological research/work can have far-reaching impacts outside of academia. Even archaeology is very political, especially in the US. \n\nIdk. Just my 2 cents.",

          "text": "seconding this. I did medical & biological anthropology for undergrad, and an integral part of ALL anthropology is viewing concepts and structures from nonwhite perspectives. I see it as less of a political agenda, and more the amplifying of non-western/non-white identities and experiences. You're fully entitled to disagree with and/or challenge the viewpoints presented within cultural anthropology, but it's aimed to provide alternative views to the history taught by majority groups.",
