  "text": "Hello friends, I am applying to PhD programs this year and would like advice from those who have done this in the past (I have an MA in Classics and BA in Philosophy). Specifically, I'm wondering if I should reach out to potential advisors via email and whether or not I should attach a research proposal and bibliography? Any advice is appreciated.",

      "text": "I sought out potential advisers and that converted to an offer a few months later. At worst, you won\u2019t hear anything back or you discover you\u2019re not a match with the academic/department. It\u2019s a great way to develop a relationship with people you may potentially work with in the future, but I\u2019d only discuss your background, your research interests, and how you feel you could fit in to the department. A proposal and bibliography would be too much at this stage, as mentioned earlier.",
