I'm at a complete loss.", "text": "This semester, I'm a TA for my university's differential equations class. It's my first semester as a TA, and I am really shocked at the lack of math skills in a lot of my students. It's almost as if they completely skipped calculus and went straight into this class.\n\nThe mistakes I am seeing in my student's work is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I'm seeing students getting completely wrong answers for simple derivatives and integrals, students not remembering basic calculus/algebra rules, and students not remembering their unit circle/parent functions. I'm spending more time in office hours teaching students how to take the integral of e^(-t) and the rules of logarithms than helping people with differential equations.\n\nLast week, I gave them a quiz straight from their homework and was essentially a calculus 1/algebra 2 problem, and the average was a 4.8/10. I'm really trying to give students points for their work, but often the work is so wrong that I can't give any credit besides a single point for attempting the problem. I also had multiple students leave their quiz blank. I glanced over their quiz they just took (again, a problem taken straight from their homework), and it's looking like the average will be worse this time.\n\nFor those who taught stem classes before (especially before the pandemic), has it always been this bad? I don't remember it being this bad when I took this class in 2017, and the students I've previously tutored didn't do this poorly. Could the year and a half of online learning have something to do with it? Are the standards really this low, and I never realized it?", "author": "westscott6", "created": 1631686219, "retrieved": 1632844539, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "comments": {"hd1dstq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pokelw/any_stem_tas_seeing_a_severe_lack_of_math/hd1dstq/", "text": "Not exactly relevant to the question you're asking, but I would swap STEM for more field specific terms.

I went from a biology major where knowing Calculus 1 was considered great, to a CS major that was expected to know and understand Calculus III. \n\nHonestly, my experiences being taught math in HS and University were abysmal. I ended up hiring a tutor for all four years of HS, because my math teacher couldn't be bothered to teach (he refused to read our textbook, and said he did not want to be there). When I got to University, my professor was knowledgeable, but his favourite phrase was \"you should know this already\". As I'm sure any math professor knows - if you don't follow one single step, then you won't be able to understand the rest of the problem. When I went to him for office hours, he just screamed at me for not understanding \"basic polynomial math\" - it doesn't inspire confidence. \n\nI think it's a mixture of programs like Matlab, PhotoMath and Chegg, but I also think some of the blame lies with poor math education starting from the post-secondary level.", "author": "Aardeehar", "created": 1631749648, "upvotes": 3}, "hcza5tc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pokelw/any_stem_tas_seeing_a_severe_lack_of_math/hcza5tc/", "text": "A year and a half of chaotic online learning absolutely has to do with this.

For example, I never really learned the unit circle. I was introduced to the idea of it in high school, but was taught to derive the trig identities from the Pythagorean theorem and the quadrants. My mathematics education was a lot less memorization and a lot more derivation. \n\nIn calculus at college, it didn't matter how we got the angles/identities we needed, so long as we got them. So consider how your university teaches all this and try to align with them.\n\nThat said, math is easily forgotten. Having the summer off could be enough to forget stuff. I made it through college without really knowing logarithm rules. They're not as intuitive as everything else and honestly are only really learned through sheer memorization. When I really needed them for a graduate class, I spent an hour watching Khan Academy videos and was set for that particular class.\n\nDo you give out a table of integrals and derivatives or have one you can point to at the back of the book? If you handhold less, they'll have to do more of the work themselves. Memorization comes from doing it themselves. You might also have a tutoring center you can send them towards. If you do all the work for them in office hours, they have no incentive to change anything. You should guide them through the problem, not do it for them.", "author": "era626", "created": 1631691589, "upvotes": 19}}}
