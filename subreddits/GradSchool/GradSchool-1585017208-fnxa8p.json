This  helped me to deal with the frustration and added anxiety with this new, unexpected experience. For me, the silver lining is that my unusual defense is a conversation starter I can use for years to come. And maybe I didn't wear pants, who knows?\n\nSecond, your committee understands this is an unusual situation. It doesn't mean they will go easier on the questions, but it does mean they will be more flexible with the whole process. For instance, it's very difficult to give a fluent, natural presentation when you are sitting in front of a computer with no real audience. They won't expect you to give the best talk of your life. \n\nThird, get a handle of the technical aspects. I used Zoom. My advisors had the pro version, they started the meeting and invited me to be the co-host, so I could share my screen and record the talk. I had two monitors so I could read my notes, and I backup computer at hand. I tested the sound, camera position, and internet connection beforehand, and had a backup plan (Skype).\n\nForth, practice giving the talk and talking to the computer while moving the mouse on your slides. This may sound obvious, but I struggled with it during the first practice round. I like moving my arms and pointing to things when I give talks irl, so getting used to the virtual setup made me more comfortable for the real thing. Also, for the defense day, my boyfriend watched the public presentation, and having a real audience in the room was really nice. Plus the moral support! I recommend the same thing if you have the chance.\n\nThe biggest advantage of a remote defense is that you can have your notes in front of you. Use this in your favor. I had a hard time with the transition sentences between slides, so I had these sentences right in front of me. It helped me calm down.\n\nAbove all, be nice to yourself. A defense is by itself extremely stressful, and with the added  stress and uncertainty of these times, it can feel overwhelming. I know it's easier said than done, but you worked really hard to get here and the defense is your time to shine. I bombed one of the questions, but in the end it was ok! The committee understood my brain was half paralyzed with anxiety, and as long as you don't mess things up too much, you'll be fine!\n\nI hope everyone is safe and healthy, and I'd be glad to answer more questions!", "author": "Mother_of_Brains", "created": 1585017208, "retrieved": 1632953791, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 446, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fle540w": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fnxa8p/successful_remote_defense/fle540w/", "text": "I'm really glad to hear all of this, thanks for sharing your experience and congratulations!", "author": "implicature", "created": 1585077764, "upvotes": 1}, "fle2n6t": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fnxa8p/successful_remote_defense/fle2n6t/", "text": "Congrats!
