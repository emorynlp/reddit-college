Luckily, I had funding from a SLOAN scholarship, but it wasn\u2019t enough, so I had to work as a lab instructor. After that ran out, I got a gig performing STEM outreach shows at public schools to get some money, and finally ended up getting a personal loan. \n\nSide jobs take a lot of time away from thesis work. On top of that Hurricane Maria ravaged our lab, we lost everything.\n\nI got offered a position as a temp professor which is good! But I am looking for something more permanent. I can only hope interviewers look at my CV and realize I am resilient and dedicated.",

A year after starting my project my professor became a Dean at the university, so he had no time for his grad students (13). Basically, we had no mentor for that period of time and sort of had to wing it, this of course led to erroneous results in my methods and the data was not worth publishing. \n\nAfter that my PI suffered kidney problems for which he took leave (more than justified).\n\nLastly Hurricane Maria devastated our lab, we lost all our instruments. I had to switch my background from wetlab biophysics to computational which I knew nothing about. I was lucky enough to be able to use my wetlab data in conjunction with the computational. Thankfully the good people of Ann Arbor Michigan gave me some help with this! Plus, I discovered and fell in love with Linux and opensource programs\u2026Thank you ORCA!",

It can be disorienting especially for first generation university students. Consequently, the imposter syndrome is also more common in a PhD program. There seems to be more uncertainty as well, particularly after you become ABD and finish fieldwork or research and begin nearing the end of the program.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t regret it and I do enjoy it overall. But I\u2019ve been dealing with anxiety the past few months and I am typically not an anxious person. \n\nOh yea, one important thing. It is more difficult to have relationships, SO and start a family (if that\u2019s something you wanted to do). Honestly, I have only seen my parents and sister 3 times since 2013 let alone settle down with someone. I am in a relationship now and we imagine a future together but logistically it is super challenging because I have no idea where I\u2019ll end up after I graduate.   \n\nActually writing this just now made me realize much of my anxiety has to do with the impact the program has on my personal life. Although there is still a bit of imposter syndrome. I hope I don\u2019t come across too negative because there are some amazing aspects to this whole process too.",

Some people might scoff about the affect it has on a student but it can be real (simply not having point of references in your own family on what to do). I started my MA in 2013 and finished by 2015. So that wasn\u2019t the problem. There was structure and I also had and still have an amazing advisor. \n\nMy field is in social sciences (human geography). In social sciences and especially human geography it is very common to conduct fieldwork which is often abroad on your own gathering data. The methodology varies but usually includes some sort of interviews etc. My fieldwork is in Southeast Asia and East Asia and my research plan was to stay for 1 year. I sort of made a life here and decided to stay longer while I begin writing. I haven\u2019t been back to my country (USA) since November 2017. Maybe that\u2019s part of the problem for me.\n\nSo you are probably right about your PhD program being structured and mine also was fairly structured up until the point I became ABD. Complete course requirements, create a committee (slightly uncomfortable for someone without a professional background but still not bad), pass comprehensive exams, proposal, proposal defense then go to the field. \n\nEverything was very smooth for me until I hit the field and I became very uncertain of what I was doing which I think is common. Also, my background was in history so this was a different methodology for me. I think I finally realized I was on the right path collecting data. Now I\u2019m just overwhelmed about dissertation. I think I\u2019m a fairly decent writer and I already have several publications. But for some reason I am falling behind schedule for the first time.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant hopefully this is hopeful. Long story short I am social science background and my PhD program was fairly structured up until the fieldwork phase or maybe even the comprehensive exam phase.",

                                  "text": "I completely agree. I\u2019m wondering if it could be that in the social sciences or humanities where it may feel a bit less structured than in the sciences. In the sciences, a lot of the methodological groundwork has been laid out (unless you are going to be a methods specialist) and there are lots of step by step references that you can use to get to where you need to be. \n\nI am in a field where it is not even required to collect your own data for your dissertation so that definitely speeds up the process and provides even more structure (you only have so many ways to analyze certain types of data). I know the humanities and social sciences get a lot of flak but I honestly commend you all because it seems increasingly difficult to navigate a CRAZY amount of dense literature to even begin to focus in on your topic of interest. Even once you identify a dissertation topic, having to go out and collect data on your own seems even more difficult. I can see how this can get confusing very fast - even with supportive advisors. But you\u2019ll get through it! You wouldn\u2019t be in the program if you didn\u2019t have that potential!",

When lab instruments malfunction hire a technician, don\u2019t expect your students to magically fix it.\n3. Realize your limitations, only take in so many grad students.\n4. Dedicate time to guide your students, it is your job.\n5. Provide constructive criticism. If you don\u2019t like something about your students work, tell them alternatives on how to make it better. Don\u2019t expect them to magically figure it out.\n6. Don't get involved in politics while having grad students.\n\nOnly the most important from my experience.",
