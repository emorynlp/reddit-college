THEY WANT ME! This is my dream postdoc, with a guy I applied to do my PhD with but later turned down as I felt I needed more foundation in my main area (I kinda straddle 3 different, related departments). We've been talking for 5 years and today he offered me a postdoc, with relocation costs covered, full medical/dental/vision, and above NIH minimum salary. He said: we want to make this happen and you come to * University, because we know you've applied other places and you'll have lots of offers.\n\nI'm shocked. I'm amazed. I had never heard of this - I was expecting to put in 40+ applications and not get an offer. Oh. My. God. \n\nFor those of you stuck in the defeated mindset, I was there, I've been in therapy for most of grad school, I have failed classes, I redid a human subjects experiment 8 different times before it worked (like IRB, data collection, analyze results) and questioned why I was putting myself through hell. But this is why. It CAN get better. If you're struggling, reach out for help. If you're thriving, extend that help to others.

So again take all this with a grain of salt.  It could be that he/she is figuring in the medical benefits and the University's contribution to your medical plan as part of this 'above' NIH minimum, for example.

Before this, you are still just playing in a foam playground with parents.
