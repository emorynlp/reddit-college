This has been in my room for the past few months.\n\nOh man, I can't believe I submitted. Finished (rushed) the last chapter today and submitted 4 minutes before the deadline. I've been working on this for the past 5 months.  It's been incredibly mentally challenging, probably the hardest thing I've done in my life. Not because the subject is hard, but because of the writing process. I've had a REALLY REALLY hard time forcing myself to write.\n\nThe thesis is essentially an empirical exploration of deep learning methods on a data set containing biometric data. Implementation, lots of experiments, interpreting results, suggesting further work. The coding was enjoyable and I learned a lot. Did all the coding, experiments and analysis that I wanted. Achieved good results. Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering.\n\nThe writing on the other hand, was a nightmare. COMPLETE nightmare. I had nothing written 3 weeks before the deadline. Now I submitted 87.5 pages of pure content (no title page, no table of contents, appendixes, bibliography, empty pages, half pages or similar). I can't believe I've made it.\n\nI'd like to write here about this writing nightmare and ask if you guys think this is normal.\n\nSo I was having a complete mental breakdown every time I needed to write something. In a bad way. I was placing myself in front of my laptop, shutting off all distractions and I couldn't get myself to write. Impossible. I would suddenly get thirsty, had to pee, was hungry or similar crap. I felt fear all the time, a fear that I won't make it. I felt that I'm not good enough to do academical writing and explain ideas in a pertinent way. I felt my writing will never be good enough.\n\nI googled it and found out this is called '[Writer's block](https://www.proof-reading-service.com/en/blog/writing-cure-writers-block/)'. Well, I had/have a really bad version of it. I would walk around the apartment and talk out loud, trying to convince myself to write and that anything that I write is fine. I started eating sweets and drinking soda (even though I usually don't), as a gesture of trying to sugar please my brain, in hopes that it will allow me a little bit more to write. I stopped everything else that was going on in my life and resumed to writing (or trying to), sleep and food. No friends, no girlfriend, no nothing. Still couldn't write. Have in mind, this wasn't a question of delivering something suboptimal and just pass, it was rather feeling unable to deliver anything at all.\n\nWhat seems to have done the trick was to make a list with the bad things that will happen if I won't deliver by the deadline. Who will I disappoint, what actions will have to happen if I need to extend (minimum 3 months more). Wrote it all out on a A4 piece of paper. Everything I could think of. Then I stayed awake until 3:30 AM and I wrote my first chapter. This felt awesome.\n\nHowever, it wasn't the case that the rest of the chapters just magically flowed. Had the same damn issues with every chapter. I would spend most of the day trying to convince myself to write, only to succeed in the evening and then stay awake until 3-4-5 AM to write, because I was afraid of getting out of that productive zone. I did this everyday for the past 3 weeks. Also, I wanted to be able to send out a new chapter to my supervisor by morning time, so he has time to review my shitting writing. I think that also motivated me to not go to sleep.\n\nAt some point, I thought I might have some form of ADHD and I should take some Ritalin / Adderall in hopes that it will help me focus. I was so afraid. However, I previously saw this [Take Your Pills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6Xebo1pngM) documentary on Netflix and I decided some time ago that I'd never do that, because I consider it highly messed up. Taking pills to remain competitive, fork that. So I didn't.\n\nThis has been really really hard for me, probably the hardest thing I've done. Is this normal? Does anyone else here struggle with this? Must be something wrong with me, this can't be normal.\n\nOk, need to defend now.  \n\n\nEDIT: I just remembered one of the desperate measures that I used to force myself to write. I saw this post on Facebook about a recent graduation ceremony at my university with pictures of master students and their diplomas. I printed 2 of those pictures and had them on my desk, thinking 'I wanna be like them, I need to write, please write'.

If you can write that much in 3 weeks, I can finish another 2-4 pages between now and Thursday :) (which is all I have left to write; the research part is taking up the majority of time though). \n\nNot going to lie though; having a snow day from work today really helped me make a lot of progress on it and was a huge blessing.", "author": "AuroraRose41", "created": 1575345822, "upvotes": 3}, "f9i6hxl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/e4qmwd/master_thesis_submitted/f9i6hxl/", "text": "congratulations", "author": "yigitaga32", "created": 1575329445, "upvotes": 2}, "f9hfo0q": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/e4qmwd/master_thesis_submitted/f9hfo0q/", "text": "thanks for sharing!\n\nive not submitted my thesis yet but i managed to pass my proposal defense some months ago and i went through the same hell but shorter time spanwhat i do understand is that when i compare academic/any/technical writing to music making, comic making and software making, theres almost no pressure when 1) im noodling or practicing on guitar-trumpet compared to finally performing; 2) drawing from life or just sketching with no expectations compared to drawing on the final board; 3) making software change compared to committing final patch;those comparisons tell me one thing, stress for me comes when i think theres finality, 'no freedom', 'no way back', so usually for all those instances when theres no way back i either try to convince myself 1) its just practice (on stage) 2) i can always redraw on another board (or do digital) 3) commits can be backed out and rewritten\n\nwhat this tells me about writing is what everyone is saying/has said about it; just write anything and keep iterating, regard each writing as practice. the brain loves doing things it loves doing(!?) and it loves doing something its good at, and being good at something happens after repeating, and practicing and failing at it multiple times... applies to any skill, music, drawing, code, writing. For me i also need to visualize the whole chapter and its subsections and the thesis in my head and the act of delivering or finishing to the people who i deliver it to. i think shame based motivation is not really my thing so i try to focus on finality of a work (and dopamine)", "author": "stuff1111111", "created": 1575314361, "upvotes": 3}, "f9gfg98": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/e4qmwd/master_thesis_submitted/f9gfg98/", "text": "Congrats!

It is purely a motivational thing and the best way to fight it to write something even if you feel it is pure crap, just write.  As you found, once you start writing, it is easier to keep writing.  \n\nAnd yeah the thesis was the toughest thing I ever did.  I am not a strong writer grammatically and my committee disagreed with a lot of concepts of machine learning, which I leaned on for my thesis, so concepts like an oracle solution were not understood so I could not use them in the text. When I finished though I thought the paper was damn good.  Sadly it was meant to be chapters 1,2 and 3 of a dissertation and my health did not hold up to do the next 3 chapters that were proposed.  The real value was in chapters 5 and 6 :(.\n\nFor what it is was worth, I did an empirical thesis too about implementing subset selections methods in education and by the time I finished the thesis, the oral defense was a breeze.   The hard work was the writing IMO.  Once you got everything written down, the defense should be just talking about what you wrote and what you had to omit.  Know your assumptions, the weaknesses of your methods and the boundaries for drawing conclusions and you should be fine.\n\nGrats for finishing.
