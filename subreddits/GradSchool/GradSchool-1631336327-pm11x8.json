  "title:": "I got an awesome job that\u2019s not related to my grad program. My career counselor messaged me to ask if it was \u201crelevant to what I want to do with my degree\u201d and now I feel stupid",
  "text": "I\u2019m in grad school for corporate communications. My ultimate goal when I started the program was to work in Corporate Communications for an entertainment company. I have a strong drive for entertainment and tbh, I was gonna use my degree to try and \u201csneak in\u201d to the creative side (lesson learned: it doesn\u2019t really work like that lol).\n\nAnyway, I got a dream opportunity as a talent management associate that was due to both the stars aligning and hard work. Someone suggested that I apply to a talent agency, and I\u2019ve come to find that it was probably what I was \u201cmeant\u201d to do, thinking even all the way back to my childhood passions. I never had the thought of becoming a talent manager/agent but it sort of happened really fast and feels right. The position has made me happier than I have felt in years. I feel so comfortable to be myself there. I\u2019ve had once in a lifetime experiences on a daily basis, have helped actors that mean a lot to me, and overall it\u2019s just awesome. Honestly, it has made me re-think my career trajectory/grad school. I feel especially self conscious about this because I previously dropped out of an education grad program 3 weeks in because I couldn\u2019t see that life for me and wanted something closer to entertainment.\n\nFast forward: I update my job on LinkedIn. I get a message a few hours later from my career counselor at my school saying congratulations but then she asked, \u201cIs this position relevant to what you want to do with your degree?\u201d She\u2019s a very nice person but I question what she meant, and now I feel increased doubt. \n\nWhat do you think about what she said? Any advice?",

      "text": "I would consider if any of what you're studying will be useful to your career. I don't know anything about talent management, but it seems like communications would be super useful.\n\nI also made a career change from instructional designer to project manager, but my degree is for instructional design. However, project management is incredibly important to the field of instructional design, and many ID skills are incredibly useful for project management.\n\nIt's really just your perspective. I also would say what others are saying: don't look too much into it. My response would be to tell her \"yes\" and then list how communications and talent management share skills. I'm sure there are lots!",

      "text": "I wouldn't read too much into it. She probably doesn't know how much this position means to you or how much you enjoy it unless you explicitly told her, so she might be concerned that you took a job you potentially dislike and may get distracted.\n\nThe other question, however, is whether the *degree* is relevant to the position you want to ultimately have. A degree in corporate communications might be a good thing to have, but is it necessary for what you want to do? The purpose of getting a degree isn't just to have an expensive piece of wall decoration, it's to equip you with skills that are valuable in the job market. You already have a job, so is the degree necessary?",

I\u2019m actually taking a semester of leave from my design MFA because I\u2019ve gotten a bunch of production gigs that I know will help my career.  I am going to go back because there are some skills I still need to learn that would make me more bookable for bigger gigs, but if you don\u2019t have anything concrete to get from school it seems more worthwhile to grind and pay your dues in the industry.",
