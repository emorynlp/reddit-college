  "text": "I graduated from my undergrad in June with a computer science degree and have been working fully remotely as a software engineer for the past few months. I thought having a job would take up 40 hours/week of time, but realistically I spend far less time than that actually working.\n\nSo, I'm considering doing grad school of some kind while maintaining my job. Perhaps feeling a bit robbed of a few years of undergrad by the pandemic, I'd especially like it if whatever grad program I did had a strong component of partying. Does such a grad program exist?\n\nYou know *those people* from your high school who went to Arizona State, Miami FL, Miami OH, and the like. Basically, I'm curious if there's a grad equivalent of this. Maybe the answer is simply going to grad school at one of these party schools?\n\nAlso, I don't particularly care about the field/program/etc. I'm pretty comfortable with the employability that a CS degree provides, so getting a grad degree would be more for fun than for anything else.\n\nThanks folks! Curious to hear your input.",

You can go to any of them maybe other than the frat parties but, tbh, you don\u2019t wanna go to those anyway. They are pretty outrageous.\n\nBut I think you need to understand that partying is not why you go to college or graduate school. You go to college to find a passion and you go to graduate school to sharpen marketable skills. Parties are fun but not a factor for choosing a school.\n\nI did a PhD, so I chose the school based on the department and advisors I found interesting. UGA had 3 people I was really interested in working for and that pulled the trigger. \n\nDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking grad school is just for fun.",

However, I also wouldn't pay a lot of money or go into debt for the sake of it, which may not be a terribly realistic option. So it might be ruled out just for that reason.\n\nOh well, I'll think it over. Thanks for the help",
