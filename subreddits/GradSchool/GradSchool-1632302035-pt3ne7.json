He told me he would send me feedback on one of my chapters last week, which he didn\u2019t do. I also cannot progress on my other chapter because he said he\u2019d contact someone about getting some extra data, so I\u2019m waiting on him to do that. As a result of these delays I\u2019ve been unable to do any work on my thesis for the past week! I\u2019d already done every bit of reading, writing and analysis that I can possibly do before getting this feedback and data. On top of this, we\u2019ve agreed to request an extension (which he said shouldn\u2019t be an issue with the department) and I\u2019m waiting on him to sign and return the form to me. I was due to finish 30th September so should be sending the form ASAP!\n\nI have sent two emails in the past week gently reminding him to get back to me with the feedback and, most importantly, the extension form, but no reply as of yet. He\u2019s notoriously bad at responding to emails. Normally I\u2019d leave it a week before trying again but given the urgency of the extension request, and given I want to finish my masters as soon as possible, I feel I should prod some more to get him to respond. \n\nMy partner has suggested I WhatsApp him as he is more likely to check his phone than emails, but I\u2019m concerned that this is a big overstepping of boundaries. We\u2019re have each other on WhatsApp from when we did fieldwork for my research, for safety and quick updates etc. I don\u2019t want to annoy him too much because his reference for future applications is very important, plus he said he\u2019ll help me to publish my work. Would this be a bad thing to do, or is it appropriate in this situation? If anyone has been in a similar situation, some advice would be really useful! \n\nTldr: supervisor not responding to urgent emails, should I WhatsApp him or would this be a terrible idea by potentially overstepping boundaries?", "author": "beautyonthebiside", "created": 1632302035, "retrieved": 1632844079, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hdtr5pr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pt3ne7/is_it_inappropriate_to_prod_my_supervisor_for_a/hdtr5pr/", "text": "If Whatsapp isn\u2019t a regular method for communication then I wouldn\u2019t do it.
