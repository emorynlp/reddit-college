  "text": "Hey all,\n\nThis may not be the best place to post this, and if anyone knows a better sub tell me to post it there.\n\nI'm looking for shirts/sweaters or jackets (any visible clothing really) I could wear while I'm TAing as a joke. Since I mostly TA in Theoretical Computer Science I wanted related content. Stuff like P vs NP, Automata, Algorithms, Coding theory, one way functions, discrete math, etc.\n\nI'm having trouble finding shirts related to theoretical computer science so if you have any sources or even specific samples I'd love to take a look!\n\nthanks in advance",
