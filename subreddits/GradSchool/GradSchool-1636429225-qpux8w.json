  "text": "My PhD advisor (also the dept head) is constantly undermining me amongst colleagues and my students. He will disparage my ideas one day, but then the next day, share them as if they were his own. He has told me multiple times that just because I have two MA\u2019s does not make me smarter than him and I\u2019m like \u201cYeah, I\u2019m aware, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here to study under you.\u201d He has told me on multiple occasions I\u2019m not as \u201cgood\u201d as him in this field. He has told me that positive feedback I receive from other professors and colleagues is only because they\u2019re being nice and it doesn\u2019t mean anything because, had they worked with him on that project, they would have seen what a true professional looked like. I\u2019m at my wits end. I keep my head down and say \u201cokay\u201d or apologize for no reason. It\u2019s worse than I\u2019m making it out to be. I\u2019m a tough person but I feel extremely broken & cry nearly every night. I have a year and a half left. How do I get through? How did you get through? I need advice.",

So I think you should switch PIs, it'll be more harmful for them than it is for you, even if they don't see it.

I've been with my current advisor for almost 2 years now and he's been doing the same sort of gaslighting to undermine my achievements or restrict my progress. For example, in the early days I would organize meetings to discuss my research but this would turn to him disparaging my work and suggesting a different direction which I would pursue out of deference. However when I would present this work to the main group, he would turn around and say my original ideas were correct whilst presenting them as his own and at the same time criticizing the new direction that HE suggested. I tried all sorts of things to charm them and improve things like inviting them to a dinner, to do some of their work for them like helping out some of the students in his (our) group with experiments and when none of this worked I tried to just take it and be patient but that only made things much worse cause I think he felt like I'd given him full reign. I then decided to stop all non-essential contact with him and this has minimized much of the bullshit I've had to experience since he has no ammo with which to attack. I also plan to switch advisors next year to completely eliminate his influence over my future but I'm keeping this between myself and my prospective advisor for now just in case he finds a way to mess that up.",
