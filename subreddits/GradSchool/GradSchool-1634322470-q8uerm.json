  "text": "I just recently got into academia and grad school, and I have to write literature reviews for my professor's textbook. Each chapter is at an average 4000 words long and has over 20 citations. I am taking a whooping 20 hours to write one chapter's lit review, this includes searching for lit, reading and synthesizing sources, and writing it into a condensed review. However, I feel bad about myself being slow and taking 20 hours which is 2 weeks of work. Is 20 hours a decent pace for such a task? My professor hasn't told me anything about my pace, but my anxiety takes the better of me!",

But, I personally had anxiety creeping in thinking I\u2019m too slow at my work. This is the first qualitative research project I\u2019ve engaged in, so I personally had no idea what is even considered a heuristic standard in writing a 20 page lit review",
