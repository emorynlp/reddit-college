I also within the last year or so developed issues with feeling anxious. Sometimes the depression isn\u2019t that bad and I am very high functioning. Other days I wake up exhausted and it takes everything to get through the day. And since I am in the sciences you have to preferably be in the right frame of mind doing lab work so you don\u2019t mess it up, especially as a third year PhD student.\n\nI have been struggling really hard with depression lately. It mostly comes from issues and history with my mother (refer to previous posts if you want more info). When things come up with her it\u2019s like a curtain comes down over me and I shut down. Also, my maternal grandmother passed away just last week so I have been grieving her passing. I am getting back into therapy to help with these issues.\n\nMy question to you all is how open, if at all, are you with your PI about your mental health? Obviously everyone has different relationships with their PIs. My main concern is that with my PI I get the assumption (which granted could TOTALLY be wrong) that they wouldn\u2019t be that receptive to it. They seem to be the person (again could totally be wrong about this) who would have the \u201cjust push through it mentality\u201d. Any advice on this?", "author": "Pigeonheart21", "created": 1631837435, "retrieved": 1632844180, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hd88do6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pppb84/debating_on_telling_my_pi_about_my_mental_health/hd88do6/", "text": "I would meet with the school's disability office (they go by different titles) and talk frankly about your mental health issues. They can't disclose any information unless given permission, but they can offer advice, and, if needed, accommodations.\n\nIt might be worth exploring medications, even if it's just for the duration of your PhD. \n\nI guarantee that there are other graduate students at your school -- and very likely some in your program -- that are dealing with similar issues.\n\nYou don't need to struggle alone.", "author": "DJGlennW", "created": 1631898314, "upvotes": 1}, "hd7eicc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pppb84/debating_on_telling_my_pi_about_my_mental_health/hd7eicc/", "text": "What is the purpose of your discussion?  There's no point telling your PI if you don't have a goal in mind - otherwise you are sharing info that they don't know what to do with. \n\nFor example, if you feel that your health issues are affecting your productivity, what is your solution?  More flexible hours?  An extension of deadlines/expectations?  More frequent meetings with your PI?  If you feel you need to take some time off to manage your health issues, then how much time and how will the work continue while you are out?  If your productivity isn't an issue now but you feel it might be in the future, then what suggestions do you have to minimize the impact?\n\nI would suggest:  talking to your PI if you have specific concerns/issues, and suggestions for specific accommodations/solutions that you would like them to consider.\n\nIf you want general advice on how to deal with things, then speak to your graduate program director instead.  They will have had similar conversations with other students with the same issues.  You might want to have this conversation whether or not you talk to your PI.", "author": "dazedandbemused1", "created": 1631885577, "upvotes": 3}, "hd6fuoc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pppb84/debating_on_telling_my_pi_about_my_mental_health/hd6fuoc/", "text": "I've gradually become more open with my supervisor as she's responded really well to the small details I've given her. I started with \"health concerns\", moved to \"mental health\", then gradually we had a few more conversations going a bit more in depth as I felt comfortable and felt it would be helpful for myself for her to know more. It's definitely hard to judge with a lot of people, especially in cases where I've felt very fragile in terms of the thoughts and opinions of others, so it can feel pretty high risk.\n\nI also do lab work where not being in the right frame of mind (brain fog, anxious, scattered, or physical symptoms like shaking, eyes not focusing, etc) can mean expensive mistakes both in terms of time and money. So getting the support and understanding of my supervisor has personally helped me a lot. I did discuss it all with my therapist in advice though, how to go about it, what to expect, which also helped give me a framework.\n\nI've also found that mentioning that I'm seeing my doctor, in therapy, and working with a psychiatrist, makes a huge difference in how people in general respond. Especially if I expect the \"just push through it\" mentality.

I want to encourage you to be open to working even when you feel bad. There is no \"right frame of mind\" to do science. You can still do quality work even when you feel down. These negative feelings have very little to do with your ability (even though I know it seems like they do).\n\nOn the other hand, there are times we feel so bad that work is not possible. If this is where you're at then I think you should tell your PI right away. It is their job to help you do your job. If you are unable to do your job then they should know. Hopefully they will rise to the occasion. How do you want your PI to respond? What would \"being receptive\" mean in this situation?\n\nIn my case, I started talking to my advisors about my mental health towards the end of my program. I'm lucky. They were both receptive, concerned, and sensitive. My conversations with them gave me perspective that I needed. They suggested therapy and gave me a bit more time to finish my degree. You are already starting therapy so you don't need any encouragement there. If you want formal assistance (for example, more time or funding) then you should definitely bring this up with your PI.\n\nI hope you get some relief soon.

My supervisor is very open about this kind of thing and always encourages to take breaks if needed and to let her know if any special arrangements need to be made. I actually told her when I started taking medication (didn\u2019t get into the details, just that it was for mental health) and she was very supportive about it and told me if I ever need time off just let her know I won\u2019t be in and it\u2019s okay.\n\nOf course, it totally depends on the person. There\u2019s definitely professors I know that wouldn\u2019t be so open about it, but it\u2019s still worth telling them. I think people are more open about this kind of thing now, and if they care about you/your project I would hope they are respectful.   \n\nAlthough I would suggest having some sort of action plan along with you. Don\u2019t just dump this all on them with no sort of plan to get back on track, they may not be as understanding if that\u2019s the case. If you need to talk to your doctor or a therapist, maybe start that process so you can say that you at least have a plan to overcome it.
