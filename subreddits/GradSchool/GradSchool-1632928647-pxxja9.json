  "text": "Hello. So I have a degree in a design field, but reflected a lot on how I\u2019d love to get into academia, preferably theatre studies and eventually, a Ph.D.  That being said, I haven\u2019t had any research experience because my goals were so different back then and I\u2019m only realizing now how I wish I had figured it all out then. What do you think I do about this? I\u2019ve emailed multiple professors for research, and I haven\u2019t heard back from them yet. What else is possible? \n\n(Research interests for the theatre and performance studies field include anthropological, sociological and psychological aspects too. Mine is narrowed down to the region I\u2019m from.)",
