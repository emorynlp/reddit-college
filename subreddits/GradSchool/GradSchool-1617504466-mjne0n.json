I also know that I\u2019m extremely prone to being distracted and following whatever thought comes into my mind whenever I\u2019m trying to work. I\u2019ve recently started seeing a therapist about this and have come up with a few things that help me. \n\nThe first is a strict imposed schedule that I make using my planner (I use Panda Planner and I think it\u2019s great for someone like me). Without this I really have little direction during the day. The second is having a set of things I complete every day (I use Habitica to help with this). Mine includes things like shaving, meeting some minimal level of physical activity, mindfulness meditation, and working on research or coursework. This helps me with adding structure to my day as well.\n\nThe last one is the most important to me I think. When I sit down to work, I try extremely hard to eliminate distractions and agree to work for a specific length of time (e.g, 30 mins.) I use the Forest app to remove the temptation of using my phone, and I try to maintain a clean desk. Or during class I will leave my phone in a place I cannot reach it. Honestly I was shocked how often I found myself reaching for my phone, remembering it was somewhere else _for a reason_ and hopefully pulling myself back to the class. \n\nNothing is perfect, I still struggle with organization and focus, but I\u2019m still working on it and these things have helped _me_ to make some improvements over the past few months.

While it's possible, there are a few reasons why work can be different based on my experience working during grad school and having these difficult times when doing schoolwork:\n\n- academic work can be really isolating, whereas I've found most workplaces are collaborative and you're allowed to work on things together/get people to help you\n\n- the academic tasks we work on are very long-term and not easily broken down into pieces, whereas I've found that even knowledge work in industry is shorter and quicker\n\n- we usually feel like our research has to be at a 100% level before showing anyone, while this is not compatible with most workplaces. This is actually a criticism of PhD folks in industry, if they can't let go of needing things to be perfect. In my work experiences, making a rough sketch or sharing a first draft is the goal, so there's less time sitting there trying to make the first version perfect\n\n- if you are writing, it's usually gonna be a lot shorter than what we're trying to write! And if it's a very long document, it's probably a collaborative effort (see above).\n\nBurnout and attention issues could be the issue here.

Many of my classmates and I felt this way when we were going through our program. Anecdotally, most people find it easier to balance work/life in industry, where you have greater external enforcement of working hours; without that structure in grad school, you subconsciously know you could always be studying or working on something and are thus more likely to burn out.\nIn the meantime, I have found that the following combination of preventative measures make it less likely for me to go down anxiety spirals or burn out after big projects/exams: \n\n * (1) **Exercising** (esp. cardio) for 30 min in the morning: I highly encourage cardio since it forces \nyou to take a break from worrying about things other than the need to keep moving until the end of the workout. The endorphin boost will also give you the energy to finish your administrative tasks and think more clearly.\n * (2) **Pomodoro** (25 min work, 5 min rest): Bonus if you can switch your tasks after 25 min. The key here is to ONLY do work for those 25 min, and ONLY rest for the 5. I'm often intimidated by the thought of having to work continuously for x number of hours, so establishing strict rest periods makes it easier to focus on the work.\n\nI've also found /r/getdisciplined helpful for productivity tips.
