  "text": " I'm thinking about applying for to a program that is pretty much identical to my own but at a much higher-ranked university. A few faculty teach at both schools and I imagine there is a lot of various sorts of connections between the 2 schools. Is there any risk to applying i.e. a chance the program I'm applying to would let my current program know I applied? I don't really have a good sense of common sense sometimes so I'm wondering if this is a stupid idea on its face.",

Personally, I haven\u2019t heard of anyone transferring MA programs but a quick Google search tells me it\u2019s not impossible. \n\nI doubt the institution you\u2019d apply for would let your current institution know - unless it\u2019s a nosy faculty or in this case, one of the faculty at both schools feels inclined to tell. Said faculty would only find out if they are part of the admissions committee. \n\nIf it\u2019s something your certain of, try it out! Worst case is your are not accepted - but have current program to stay in if you\u2019d choose. Best case is you are accepted and transfer.",
