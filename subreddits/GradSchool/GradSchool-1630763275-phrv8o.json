Honestly the best way I learned to write the specific style for archaeology papers is to read a ton of archaeology papers. Look at how they are organized, what kind of language (high vocabulary, or more accessible vocabulary, or more theoretical etc), how they structure paragraphs. Country of origin matters too, like I have to read a lot of [Norway](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep28690)\\-based papers and their use of scientific language is different than [British](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281609773_Archaeology_in_the_age_of_the_Anthropocene_A_critical_assessment_of_its_scope_and_societal_contributions), which is different from the papers that come from [China](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161348933.pdf). You can see how different the writing style and paper organization is just by skimming them. Once you have read a lot, you can start imitating writing style based on what suits you the best.
