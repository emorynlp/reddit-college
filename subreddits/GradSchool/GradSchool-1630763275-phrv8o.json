      "text": "Fellow archaeologist here! Honestly the best way I learned to write the specific style for archaeology papers is to read a ton of archaeology papers. Look at how they are organized, what kind of language (high vocabulary, or more accessible vocabulary, or more theoretical etc), how they structure paragraphs. Country of origin matters too, like I have to read a lot of [Norway](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep28690)\\-based papers and their use of scientific language is different than [British](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281609773_Archaeology_in_the_age_of_the_Anthropocene_A_critical_assessment_of_its_scope_and_societal_contributions), which is different from the papers that come from [China](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161348933.pdf). You can see how different the writing style and paper organization is just by skimming them. Once you have read a lot, you can start imitating writing style based on what suits you the best. I personally use a lot of accessible language and technical vocabulary only when I feel like I can explain it well to a general audience.",

              "text": "Okay, I\u2019m 6th year PhD in English doing a 6th year because I didn\u2019t know how to write a dissertation and couldn\u2019t adequately demonstrate my readiness for the field. Often, because we are English majors who teach writing and focus on written texts\u2014our discipline *assumes* that we just know how to write within it. My friend did her dissertation in rhetoric on why graduate students in our institution can\u2019t write\u2014and discovered that other disciplines get more writing focused instruction on their field-specific genres than we receive in the English department. All of that is to say\u2014not knowing how to write as an academic is a feature, not a bug. \n\nI recently found a rhetorical analysis someone did on literary studies scholarship, and it helped me IMMENSELY. I suggest you find something like that in your field. I just googled \u201crhetorical analysis archaeological academic writing\u201d and got some hits. The rhetorician\u2019s field of expertise is to analyze rhetorical moves and genre conventions. If you can find something like that it should help you understand the rhetorical moves that are expected in your field. Thus, help you shape your arguments for your intended audience. \n\nAcademic writing is formulaic. Another thing you can do is your own sort of rhetorical analysis of some essays in your field. Instead of reading for the content look for how that piece is arranged\u2014what sections does it have? What information is in each of those sections. What does each section DO in the building of the whole. \n\nFinally, a good basic thing to know for your own rhetorical purpose is going to be determining your own level of argument regarding stasis theory. The stases are levels of questions: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. Perdue\u2019s Online Writing Lab has a section that should get you oriented. \n\nHope this helps. You are not, by any stretch of the imagination, a singular case of a graduate student not knowing how to write in their field.",

Also your writing sucks!\n\nIt has taken me literally 3 years to get my writing to a decent place and that was because I messed up so much that eventually it somehow clicked. I went to our school's writing center (which is staffed by mostly ABD English PhD students, lol) and got good feedback. I'd send my paper to my advisor and would get nothing but vague negative comments to the point that I had to print out one of my papers and sit down with it with him and go through it line by line to actually get something useful out of him. \n\nIt's so messed up that there's an expectation that we already know how to write. All of my advisor's current PhD students (there are 3 of us) went into PhDs right after undergrad, and there has been no real support to help us regardless of our lack of experience. It's so disheartening, that I've made a concerted effort to help my advisor's youngest student because she is already struggling with the same thing and I do not want her to take as long as I did to get on the right track.",

Try and observe what conventions are forming that genre. And above all else, recognize that the first drafts of your first papers in grad school are in all likelihood going to be rough. \n\nGood papers emerge from iterated brainstorming and revision.",
