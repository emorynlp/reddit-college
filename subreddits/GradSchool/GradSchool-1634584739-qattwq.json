  "title:": "First time lecturing-- seeking advice",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a first year PhD student, and recently got the chance to substitute teach a lecture, as the regular professor will be out for the day. I asked for the opportunity so I'm excited about it, and it is for the class that I am TAing so i am comfortable with the material. However, this is my first time lecturing as opposed to presenting research, and I am looking for advice on how to make this go smoothly. \n\nI will be using the professor's slide deck, so I don't have to prep slides or make a lesson plan, but if you have any advice on how to make a lecture compelling and how best to field questions from the students it would be appreciated. Also if anyone has general recommendations on preparation that would be awesome, the class is two weeks from today so I have plenty of time to prepare. \n\nThanks in advance!",
