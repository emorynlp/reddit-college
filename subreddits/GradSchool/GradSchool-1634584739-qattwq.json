  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a first year PhD student, and recently got the chance to substitute teach a lecture, as the regular professor will be out for the day. I asked for the opportunity so I'm excited about it, and it is for the class that I am TAing so i am comfortable with the material. However, this is my first time lecturing as opposed to presenting research, and I am looking for advice on how to make this go smoothly. \n\nI will be using the professor's slide deck, so I don't have to prep slides or make a lesson plan, but if you have any advice on how to make a lecture compelling and how best to field questions from the students it would be appreciated. Also if anyone has general recommendations on preparation that would be awesome, the class is two weeks from today so I have plenty of time to prepare. \n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Not knowing what you\u2019ll be lecturing on, I\u2019d say that you might want to do a dry run with the prof\u2019s slide deck, where you\u2019re actually speaking out loud and timing how long it takes. If you\u2019re not used to public speaking/teaching (maybe you are), it can be hard to estimate how long a lesson will take (you\u2019ll get better at this). Also, if you\u2019re nervous, a really good piece of advice I got is to kind of \u201cput on\u201d your teaching persona before you enter the classroom. What does the teacher version of you look like/sound like, etc? This is a good way to kind of distance yourself from anything you\u2019re nervous or uncomfortable about (for me at the beginning, it was massive imposter syndrome). You\u2019ll do great, though. Have fun!",
