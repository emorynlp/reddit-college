      "text": "If you can't focus, then spend less time on work and more focusing on the holidays. The worst thing you can do is feel guilty about not working before the holidays and then trying to work during the holidays. Alternatively you can use this time to take a step back, review your accomplishments and plan your future work. Personally, I would back up my data and organize my folders right before holidays when I couldn't focus well.",
