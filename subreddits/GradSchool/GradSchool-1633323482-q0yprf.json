      "text": "I am! It's my first semester. Two things I should mention. 1. I have ADHD and this does not help. 2. I LOVE the program so much!!\n\n I work full-time in the field already, and this program is designed so that folks like me can do it. There are virtual classes for discussion but if you can't attend, they are recorded. We have virtual reading assignments as well as books (I'm reading 5 at once). We do weekly discussion board posts and respond to one another.\n\nFor one class I also have 5 major writing projects all due at the end of the semester but we are supposed to be giving each other feedback as we go. For the other class I also have 2 presentations. \n\nIm 10+ years into my career and I also manage a team at work. I work 40 - 50 hours each week, I'm married, and own a home with house full of pets. I'm struggling to balance work, school, chores, and spending time with my husband.  look forward to discussion, reading, writing, projects in my classes. For me it's just learning how to organize my life.",
