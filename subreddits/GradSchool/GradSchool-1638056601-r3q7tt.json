  "text": "My PhD application has nowhere to submit a resume or CV. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s ok to mention more things in my SOP because of this.\n\nEx: I want to go somewhere that has some sense of community that I can be a part of and wanted to talk about how I\u2019ve taken up leadership in our graduate student association for my MS and would like to continue to do similar things in their grad student association.\n\nEx2: I love to do community service and outreach and have done that during my MS. I noticed there was an outreach program at PhD school that I would like to continue or be a part of. \n\nAre these things that can go in my SOP? They are on my CV but since we aren\u2019t asked to submit that I want them to know that I take part in these activities and would like to continue to do so.",

This statement has only to do with your experience in your specific field and what you think a PhD from a particular school will allow you to do in the future.",
