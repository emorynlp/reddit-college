  "text": "Okay let\u2019s say I graduate undergrad in Spring of 2023. I don\u2019t necessarily understand the whole idea of like when I should be studying and taking my GRE. \n\nSo for example Drexel\u2019s application cycle opened June 15th of 2021. The application deadline is February 11, 2022. \n\nSo if I wanted to apply to I would need to be studying almost end of fall semester (occurring right now) and taking my GRE and sending in my application by February, so I would enter grad school in May of 2022 - which would be directly after I graduate from undergrad\u2026also in May? \n\nAdvisors won\u2019t break this down for me because they never understand what I\u2019m talking about when I say Pathologists\u2019 Assistant so they just shut me down before I even talk about grad school logistics in general. Live in FL so understandable I suppose.",

      "text": "After you take the GRE, your scores are good for 5 years of applications. I used mine for 2 masters and a PhD admission. I\u2019d plan to take them at the END of next summer. And I\u2019d plan to start studying now and work like crazy next summer. \n\nI know in my department GRE are optional but most of the top candidates are still submitting them so\u2026 if your competition is coming from an Ivy and has a GRE, and you are coming from a good school and don\u2019t have a GRE\u2026 seems pretty obvious to me.\n\nEdit: to the OP- did you get your dates wrong? \n\nI\u2019d be really nervous about trying to jam a GRE before December while you\u2019re still in classes. Not impossible, but risky for sure.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not sure about the program and I didn\u2019t take the GRE for any of my grad school applications because they were waived because of covid but you generally take it your senior year of college fall time and study 2-4 months before you want to take it. In terms of turning your application in it takes around 15 days to get your score back. You can schedule the tests online and maybe take an online version of it with a lockdown browser? This is excluding subject tests you may want to take. Most of my applications were due in December / January for Engineering. So it just takes some planning for what schools you want to apply for.\n\nEdited: Spelling",
