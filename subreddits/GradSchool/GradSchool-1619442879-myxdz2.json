After reading the suggested papers, they seem pretty much unrelated to my manuscript. Imagine you are submitting a paper about a clinical study involving functional MRI, and a reviewer has asked you to reference a few papers on brain surgery. Sure, they are both loosely related by the brain, but otherwise they aren't really comparable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterestingly, the papers he asked me to cite were recently published and have the same set of authors on all of them. I suspect my reviewer is one of these authors.
