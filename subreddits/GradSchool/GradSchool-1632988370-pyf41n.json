Also, I personally find brown noise to be a more effective filter than white, but ymmv.\n\n2) taking your setup on the road -- if you have a laptop, a cellphone that can be converted to a hotspot, a few high capacity portable batteries, and maybe a portable external monitor or two (can get them for ~$100 pretty easily), can you mosey on over to a quiet corner of a public park and work there?\n\n3) you can try supplementing with nicotine in addition to caffeine, which supposedly helps more with sensory gating stuff.
