  "title:": "Submitting Work to Present at Conferences",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm a linguistics undergraduate hoping to continue linguistics in graduate school. I'm working on my honours project right now and it's been going all right. My supervisor is wonderful and she has encouraged me to submit my work to two different conferences happening next year -- which thrills and terrifies me at the same time.\n\nI imagine it would help my grad school prospects if I have shared novel research at a conference, right? But I'm also wondering if it's a \"big deal\" for her to have made this suggestion. Of course it would be an absolute privilege to be able to present my work, but I'm asking myself if this is a sign that I'm doing well and is something I should be excited about... or if it is normal for supervisors to make these recommendations. Is it anything extraordinary for an undergrad to present work at a conference?\n\nI'm also mildly afraid of getting rejected and demoralised, and from there comes the impostor syndrome and the cruelly ironic doubt of whether I'm even \"good enough\" to experience impostor syndrome. Of course, I'm not going to let these opportunities pass by and I *will* submit abstracts, but I'd be really grateful if anybody could provide this chronic overthinker with some clarity.\n\nThank you so much!",
