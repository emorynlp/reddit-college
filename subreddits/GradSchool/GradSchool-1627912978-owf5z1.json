It's not as morbid as it sounds\n\n>But the biggest problems the Anthropocene poses are precisely those that have always been at the root of humanistic and philosophical questioning: \u201cWhat does it mean to be human?\u201d and \u201cWhat does it mean to live?\u201d In the epoch of the Anthropocene, the question of individual mortality \u2014 \u201cWhat does my life mean in the face of death?\u201d \u2014 is universalized and framed in scales that boggle the imagination. What does human existence mean against 100,000 years of climate change? What does one life mean in the face of species death or the collapse of global civilization? How do we make meaningful choices in the shadow of our inevitable end?  \nThese questions have no logical or empirical answers. They are philosophical problems par excellence. Many thinkers, including Cicero, Montaigne, Karl Jaspers, and The Stone\u2019s own Simon Critchley, have argued that studying philosophy is learning how to die. If that\u2019s true, then we have entered humanity\u2019s most philosophical age \u2014 for this is precisely the problem of the Anthropocene. The rub is that now we have to learn how to die not as individuals, but as a civilization.  \n>  \n>The biggest problem climate change poses isn\u2019t how the Department of Defense should plan for resource wars, or how we should put up sea walls to protect Alphabet City, or when we should evacuate Hoboken. It won\u2019t be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning off the air-conditioning. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one: understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront this problem, and the sooner we realize there\u2019s nothing we can do to save ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal humility, to our new reality.\n\n[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/)\n\nGood luck", "author": "PoorGetPrison", "created": 1627917088, "upvotes": 15}, "h7fq6cd": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/owf5z1/feeling_a_little_hopeless_for_the_future_as_i/h7fq6cd/", "text": "This is something I've thought about a lot.
