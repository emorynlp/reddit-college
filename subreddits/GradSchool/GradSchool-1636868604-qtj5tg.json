  "text": "I've really been struggling the last few weeks with motivation and the ability to focus. I am in CRNA school and halfway through the 3 year DNP program.  I did awful on my last exam and since then have struggled to study.\n\nYes, I am on antidepressants and get enough sleep. Any tips to motivate yourself to just start again?",

I meet with a group of students over zoom each week and we all study together in silence for an hour. It forces me to be productive and accountable because 1) we set goals for the hour and 2) we check-in after the hour and update if we met our goal/why we didn't meet the goal. \n\nWe also have a group chat that we post to when we need to get something done for the day. The group will check in throughout the day to see if you've made progress. My accountability and productivity have really gone up.\n\nThere are also websites that do this (studystream.live and hours.zone).",

      "text": "It helps me to stay hydrated, go to a public place, and just eliminate all distractions. \n\nAlso, I like to sometimes imagine myself getting an immediate award for getting up. Block out whatever reward/punishment your body is used to getting and imagine your own.\n\nAlternatively, just imagine yourself doing the action and then plan to do it. \n\nI think fatigue and depression are a sign you reward signals aren't working properly. That's why you should make sure you are staying hydrated and nourished. \n\nExercise helps but if you do it too much it can deplete your nutrients and therefore your ability to plan effectively.  Exercise is draining if you aren't nourished I feel.",
