  "text": "Only 2/3 writers have submitted my LOR on time, so the overall status of my application package is listed as \"Incomplete:  Some required application package materials have not been received.\" I'm wondering if they'll still at least look at my application?\n\nThis is a huge bummer because I reminded my prof multiple times and we have a pretty good relationship. Unfortunately, he is usually very busy and does things last minute. I'm assuming that even if they consider my application, the fact that only 2/3 of my recommenders submitted will make me look bad.",
