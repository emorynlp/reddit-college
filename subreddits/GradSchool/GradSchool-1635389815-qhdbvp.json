  "text": "I\u2019m prepping my internship applications to submit next Monday (11/01), and I\u2019m also preparing to propose my dissertation this coming Friday. These major milestones, on top of my typical duties (teaching and practicum especially) are really grinding me down. \n\nPlus, I keep experiencing waves of anxiety about not passing or not getting interviews. I recognize these are emotion based thoughts that don\u2019t reflect the most likely outcomes, but it\u2019s just a lot to work through. Anybody else feeling the burn at this stage of their education?",
