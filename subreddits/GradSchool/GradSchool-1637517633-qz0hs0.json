  "text": "I currently work as a software engineer and would like to get a master's degree in CS while working. Ideally, I would like to perform research during the program to keep the option open to go for a PHD in the future. I understand that programs that allow this are generally in person, but I want to confirm that this is the case?",

      "text": "I am in a completely online MS CS program. It has 3 options, courses only, project, or thesis. I think being able to research online would depend on finding an advisor who supports this. My advisor supports me researching online so I am doing the thesis option. I am part time. Advisor fit was the biggest factor in making this situation work. I am lucky in that I am in state for my university so the tuition paired with my employer tuition reimbursement is affordable. Perhaps your state has a similar program.",

      "text": "I can't give specific programs but for many masters programs offer two tracks: research or course based. After you finish your core courses you have an option of either taking advanced topic courses or doing a research project. You don't have to be on campus to do the research project, which makes it popular for people who want to start working. It is not always the case that the research project tract is the better alternative if you plan to pursue a PhD.",

          "text": "I see, I am aware of this split in tracks, the issue I am encountering is many programs only offer the course based option for their online program, at least from what I have seen so far. Can you please elaborate on your last point about how a research tract is not always the best alternative for eventually pursing a PhD?",

              "text": "It depends on which field you are in and which school. Generally the research track is easier and for those who want to start work. The course based track requires taking advanced courses that would be closer to what you would take in a PhD program. In some schools they can even be PhD courses.",
