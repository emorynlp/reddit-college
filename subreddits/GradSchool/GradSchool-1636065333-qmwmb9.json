Don't really feel like talking about it right now, but if I'm going to do that, I'll be suing them for moral damage. I'm not too hopeful about my chances, but somehow I still want to do it.\n\nBtw, I'm in Russia. And not in Moscow or StP, either, a smaller place. So a lot of things would not apply to most of that subreddit, if I was ever going to share my experience :-)",

Just the idea that it could be an email from my  MSc thesis supervisor talking about a draft would send me down an anxiety spiral... She could be pretty harsh with her criticism and helping would only be her last resort option. So much that now I work with 2 incredibly supportive supervisors for my PhD and I still tense up everytime I have to open one of their emails or send them one asking for help.\n\nHell, I credit my MSc supervisor as the main reason for always having my cell phone on silent mode xD",
