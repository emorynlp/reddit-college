I mainly do qualitative, so I understand the basics of analysis, research questions, literature reviews, etc. The instructor is not very clear on how go about research design..... the main purpose of taking this class and the backbone for the final project. There are video lectures, but they aren't help me understand methodological design, validity, and the other key parts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo.... can some please help me understand how to create a pre- and post-survey design. How do I develop position statements that would help me measure transitions? \n\nI keep getting information and \"advice,\" but I need context and resources to even decode it.",
