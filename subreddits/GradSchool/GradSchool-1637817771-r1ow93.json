That degree was at a different college than my theater degree but they didn\u2019t make me do any extra gen Ed classes, just the classes to get the math degree which was really nice. It\u2019s also why I just did the BA in math and not the BS - just made more sense because I didn\u2019t have to fill in science courses I didn\u2019t have and made it quicker",

      "text": "I have a bachelor's in a performing arts field. I don't have a math degree, but I'm in grad school studying statistics and have taken grad level math classes and have the equivalent of about 90% of an undergrad math degree. \n\n> I feel like I missed out on picking up some math courses.\n\nYou can go back and take courses. Community college is cheap, so I took as much as I could at CC, and then for upper level courses I took all the relevant ones as a non-matriculated student at my local university. \n\nWhat I've found is that in grad school even those with the \"right\" degree feel like they \"missed out\" on something because there's so much to learn that there's inevitably going to be a course you didn't take that's going to be helpful. The more relevant coursework you have, the better, for sure, but being able to teach yourself is an absolute necessity in grad school and if you can do that you'll be fine. Just make sure you have all the fundamental/basic classes under your belt and you can make a graduate level math degree work. \n\nThat being said, my experience is with statistics and applied math fields. Pure math might be a whole different beast. You're still going to need proof writing skills in applied math fields, so at minimum try to take an intro to real analysis course before grad school (although I've known many people to succeed without it, the proof-writing experience you get from it helps a *lot* imo).",
