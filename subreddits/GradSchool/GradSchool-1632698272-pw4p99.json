  "text": "Hey y'all,\n\nSo I'm about a month into my new master's program. It's a good department and my advisor has been great so far.  However, in my new school I don't love the city and my views don't align with the majority of the pubic here and it kinda sucks. Anyway, Im just having a hard time fitting in and settling down and I'd be nice to know I'm not the only one that has felt this way. I've made some friends but admittedly I just know I'm not gonna have the same relationships with them that I did with my other closer friends. I just feel lonely. I like hanging out with people and going to bars and I just haven't made connections like that here. Maybe to an extent it's also just part of growing up and getting further into your 20s, idk.",

Every friend group is unique in my experience and I really limited myself in undergrad by trying to find people just like my old friends. You never know where friendships will go!",

I honestly sent in a job app today to leave. Not anything against the program, I just think I can mentally do better anywhere but here.",

I also would question how you can tell your new friends won\u2019t be as close as your old friends. You\u2019ve known them for a month \u2014 not a lot of time to build a solid connection. Good luck!",
