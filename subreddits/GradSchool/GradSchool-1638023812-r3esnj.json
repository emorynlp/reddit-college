  "title:": "Can't solve assignments, end up seeing solutions, feeling like shit.",
  "text": "Hi everyone. I wanted to discuss something with peeps here. I am in my first year at a grad school in Physics. I am taking a course in Electromagnetism. And of course, as you all know there are assignments to solve. Now the problem is that my professor doesn't teach things in detail at all. He sort of rushes over the material and rarely makes us do problems  (so much so that he skipped the entire electric field in matter chapter). In one of the assignments, he gave a question that involves knowledge of the contents of a chapter that he didn't teach (how we use multipole expansion in matter). Now in an ideal scenario, I read the chapter on my own, solve all the examples and then at the end I might be able to solve that question in the assignment. But because the allotted time is 3-4 days and there are other questions, it is not possible. So I end up reading the solution to the problem (or a very similar one) over the internet, understanding it rigorously and then writing it up or solving the question. This does solve the problem but I end up feeling like shit. I feel like I know nothing because I \"solved\" the problem by looking at the solution. Does that happen in grad school to others? Am I not supposed to solve the problem but just know how to do them or how to look up and read about the problem? Is that the aim of assignments? I asked about this to my prof and he says until u understand the solution, even though u read it somewhere, it is fine. What do you guys think?",

      "text": "Lol, I did this constantly, for the same reasons. Professors sadly aren't great at teaching, sometimes. My rule was that I read the solution, tried to understand the principle being used, and then did the actual problem on my own without referring to it. A competent lecture would have included problem examples.",

          "text": "That is so true. I feel the same. I mean the prof is not bad, but I feel that he should put more effort in teaching the course and selecting the problems. The problem one faces becomes an integral part of learning. And I always feel that there should be a correlation between what is being taught and the questions asked.",

Often times the prof. created problems had typos a were not really solvable unless you looked at last year's solution manual.\n\nGrad school is different than undergrad. There is never enough time to fully understand a problem the way you would in undergrad. Sometimes you do need to look at the solutions.",

          "text": "Yeah that is why I intended to ask the question. I mean in my undergrad days, I did solve the tougher questions even if it took time, because at the end there was not a lot of pressure in terms of time and the question were in accordance to the techniques we learnt in class or the examples that we did. I was struggling with the general philosophy of what the assignments are for. In undergraduate they were to test if we have understood the technique and maybe a couple of problems to help us think out of the box. But here, the technique itself was not introduced, let alone examples. So I was wondering where am I going wrong.",
