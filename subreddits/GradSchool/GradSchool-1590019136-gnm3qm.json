Because of the pandemic I have not seen the rest of my family for over 2 months (at a time when I really need their support).\nBut I finished out the semester! Kept my 4.0, did my research (still a little behind but oh well), and fulfilled my TA duties. Right on track to finish my masters in December.\nI had days when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed but I still finished the semester strong.
