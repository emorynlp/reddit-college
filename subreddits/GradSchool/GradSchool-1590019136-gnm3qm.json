  "text": "I just had the semester from hell\u2014my dad died unexpectedly 2 weeks before the world went into pandemic lockdown. I go to school 5 hours away from my family and I remember telling my mom that I just couldn\u2019t do it\u2014I couldn\u2019t finish the semester or my degree which broke my heart because my dad was so proud of me for being in grad school. Because of the pandemic I have not seen the rest of my family for over 2 months (at a time when I really need their support).\nBut I finished out the semester! Kept my 4.0, did my research (still a little behind but oh well), and fulfilled my TA duties. Right on track to finish my masters in December.\nI had days when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed but I still finished the semester strong. If I can do it, y\u2019all can too",

Basically the same shit that happened to me finishing off strong is damn impressive. Mad respect.",
