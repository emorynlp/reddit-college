  "text": "I don't know if I'm smart enough for grad school. I've never had so many thoughts of wanting to drop out of school or just wishing I'd die so I don't have to continue. \n\nIt's just one course I need to get through and I would be okay but I don't even know if I'll pass. I've been looking for tutor but no luck. I have an apartment lease of 18 mos and I've been looking at either breaking the lease or finding a job here so I can just pay the rent and leave the city after. \n\nWhat should I do? I've never been so overwhelmed by school, I don't even know if it's the actual grad school itself or the one course at this point but I have buyers remorse and I want a refund...",

Maybe you were exaggerating to make a point, but if you are not (with my last job I would debate driving my car into a pole on the side of the road on the way to work on a weekly basis so I would end up in the hospital for a while and not have to deal with the unbearable stress) please speak to a professional ASAP or get out. You have other options for the direction your life takes now. You have none if you are dead.",

              "text": "Maybe it is about adjustment or you need a break and will decide to come back to it later in life. But feeling like you want to die is cause for more serious action then toughing it out.\n\nCan you find a job locally so you can pay your lease until your plans for a different path are set? Or sublease to someone else, Air b&b? I once took a year off from my very intense career which involved life and death decisions on a daily basis and took a part time job at minimum wage where I had no responsibility that mattered in the large scope of things. It was an amazing mental break. If the pay had not been unrealistic for long term I would have loved to keep doing something like that.\n\nAnother thing I had been considering before I left my most recent job to make this career change (because I was having those thoughts for over a year before I made the plan to change careers) was going on disability so that I could pay my bills. I was such a mess I wasn\u2019t sure if I would ever be able to work in my field ever again and I didn\u2019t know how to do anything else. Part of my wanting to drive off the road was in order to relive the severe anxiety and panic attacks I was having associated with going to work. \n\nMental health issues are a disability with respect to collecting insurance if they are so severe you can not work, if this is an option talking to a doctor can help get you started (and help you to cope with these feelings).\n\nA reason I stuck with my last job so long despite what a mess it made me was because it paid well. Going to grad school means being poor for years. The jobs I can get after grad school in my new career will not pay anywhere near what my last one did. I finally broke free of it when a therapist asked me \u201chow much would you be willing to pay not to feel this way\u201d? My answer was \u201cthat much\u201d.",

Sounds pretty smart to me.\n\nBut if it makes you feel better, you could start looking for a job and if it turn out you can't finish, then make a switch, but never give up because you think it is going to be hard as I can assure you, you will regret that afterwards. Just keep your head up and try your best. And remember your almost done.",

You could try to find a job there and see what happens? \n\nAlso, in regards to stats MANY of us struggled through our stats/quant series in the first year. It's typically a survey style course so you're thrown into the deep end and bombarded with tons of different analyses. But you're not expected to come out as an expert, you're just meant to be more familiar with a variety of techniques so you can begin to figure out what you'll want to focus on for your own research. Most of the people I saw who became overwhelmed were the ones who thought they had to understand and master everything. What helped me was letting go of my need to be \"good\" at stats and joining a study group. We would meet once a week and review the homework assignments. Together we'd help whoever was struggling that week and it was a really wonderful bonding experience. I'd also visit the GSI and instructor office hours EVERY week. Part of their job is to help you navigate this stuff so don't pass up that valuable resources. Finally, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos. Sometimes it was really helpful to hear things explained in different ways. \n\nWhatever you decide, I hope you can find peace in your decision!",
