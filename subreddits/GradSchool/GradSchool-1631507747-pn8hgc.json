I've never had so many thoughts of wanting to drop out of school or just wishing I'd die so I don't have to continue. \n\nIt's just one course I need to get through and I would be okay but I don't even know if I'll pass. I've been looking for tutor but no luck. I have an apartment lease of 18 mos and I've been looking at either breaking the lease or finding a job here so I can just pay the rent and leave the city after. \n\nWhat should I do?

Sounds pretty smart to me.\n\nBut if it makes you feel better, you could start looking for a job and if it turn out you can't finish, then make a switch, but never give up because you think it is going to be hard as I can assure you, you will regret that afterwards.
