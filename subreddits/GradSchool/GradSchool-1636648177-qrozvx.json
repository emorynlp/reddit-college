Then do not fraternize.\n\nDo you want to be the hip 1970s prof who smokes weed and bangs students?\nThen you should totally go.",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t. If a student who didn\u2019t go to the party just so happens to get a lower grade in the class than a student who did, they could accuse you of preferential treatment, which can create a whole new set of problems. It likely wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, but I can see a professor looking down on it as irresponsible. After the semester is over, it\u2019s not at all uncommon where I am for TA\u2019s to hang out with and keep in touch with former students.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of an \u201coverthinking it\u201d scenario, but as a STEM TA I\u2019ve learned my lesson the hard way about some pre-meds who think they should get a higher grade than they worked for because MCAT or med school, and they\u2019ll throw you under the bus in a second if it means they have a chance at a higher grade. I once got reported for \u201chasty and unfair grading\u201d by a student who would turn in assignments half-completed and then complain about his med school chances when appealing his grade, which the professor and I had a good laugh about.",

If there might be underaged minors drinking, then as their TA it is best that you not know/witness that.\n\nBut if it does not involve consumption of alcohol, or it takes place in an establishment where anyone drinking will be carded and have to follow a minimum standard of good behavior (eg. you will not be witness to anything the university would want its employees to object to/not endorse), then it\u2019s up to you. If you like your students/want to hang out with them, go.\n\nIf you go, keep in mind that to the students you are a member of university staff. No more than one drink, and zero is better. Don\u2019t let them see you even a little tipsy.\n\nMy reply assumes you are done with grading by the time you go the event. If you aren\u2019t, it\u2019s not a hard no, but in that case you might want to check with the professor leading the course and get their OK.",
