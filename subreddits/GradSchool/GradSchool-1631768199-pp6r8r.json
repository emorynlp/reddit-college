  "title:": "Is It Normal To Not Feel Excited About Program?",
  "text": "Hi, all. I was accepted into grad school in early 2020. My first year began in fall 2020 and now I\u2019m heading into my second year. I just finished the first week of classes and I am not feeling great. I know it\u2019s just the first week but there\u2019s no assignments/courses/profs I\u2019m really excited about or especially interested in. Maybe it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have a lot of choices with courses as this term it\u2019s all required core courses. But it just feels awful to have no excitement. \n\nI was never 100% into going to grad school. Tbh I did it because in my field it seems harder to get a decent job without an MA. So it\u2019s like a means to an end. I guess I like what I study and I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do if I chose a different pathway but thinking about the tuition costs makes me feel awful because I feel like I\u2019m wasting money in a way. Kind of like \u201cwow, I\u2019m paying this much for something I\u2019m just doing to level up to get a job\u201d. \n\nIs feeling like this normal? I know people don\u2019t love their program 100% of the time but I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s cause for concern. I have 2 years left and it truly feels like forever but I also can\u2019t conceive of what my life would be like outside of school.",
