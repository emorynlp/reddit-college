Just got an email from them letting me know they got into the program I had recommended them for. Its made my day in a funny way. It was nice being asked originally, because it felt good to be told someone had enjoyed my classes enough to want me to recommend them. But its really validating as an educator to feel that you made enough of a difference that its helped them get into something competitive. Grad School and Academia is a constant grind, but days like today make it really worth it.", "author": "boringhistoryfan", "created": 1628093278, "retrieved": 1632953906, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 370, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h7ujll3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oxvxro/some_days_its_really_worth_it/h7ujll3/", "text": "Ah, I've been contemplating writing to my letter-writers about my acceptance because it just feels weird to me.
