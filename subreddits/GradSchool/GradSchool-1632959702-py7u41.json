  "text": "First let me say that as bad as I am doing right now, and as much as I wish nobody else felt like this, it genuinely makes me feel so much less alone to see I am not the only person going through struggles and considering leaving grad school.  \n\n\nI am a month into my second year, and I am miserable. I started grad school in the middle of the pandemic, and while I struggled with my motivation and mental health I (at the time) had a line of support with my supervisors (I'll call them supervisor 1 and 2) and finished all my classes with high grades. It was around the spring of last year that I started really realizing that this wasn't the field I wanted to stay in, but figured it would still be beneficial to get the MA.   \n\n\nThis summer I went out of province for field work and it was.... about as disastrous as one can imagine. Extremely poor preparation on supervisor 1's part, zero communication, him lashing out at the 4 of us grad students constantly, literally getting stranded in the middle of nowhere and having to get evacuated, near-hypothermia, and multiple wild animal scares. Throughout this, I suffered multiple panic attacks, couldn't keep food down, but kept working. The worst part was that I wasn't even collecting my own data, I was out there to help my friends who had missed data collection in 2020. Eventually after speaking with supervisor 2 and the other Ph.D. there, I decided it would be best for me to go home. I felt terrible for leaving, but my mental health was about the worst it ever had been and was affecting me physically. I was under the impression that everyone fully supported me, and I spent the last month of the summer trying to feel better.   \n\n\nThis term has been rough. I have barely seen and spoken to supervisor 1 since returning from the field, and have recently found out I have been basically excluded from any of his other projects and left to my own devices. I have no motivation to work on my own research, no drive to stay in the field, and am left feeling pretty abandoned and betrayed by a person I used to look up to and had a good relationship with. I've spoken with friends that share him as a supervisor, and they have been receiving varying levels of ambivalence and disrespect from him as of late. I don't feel happy anymore, and the main thing that is keeping me here is the money (debt) I've sunken into my program (as our dept. has literally almost zero funding), and the teaching fellowship I accepted for next term. I don't want to feel like a failure, but I just don't know what is keeping me going anymore besides the friends I have made.",
