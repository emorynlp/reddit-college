  "text": "From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank all you wonderful people!\n\nAs much as professors are great and lovely, you all CARRY the class. I have no idea where I'd be without the mentorship, education, and motivation. I really look up to you and am always so curious to hear about your research and passions.\n\nEspecially with over a year of Zoom seminars and labs, I needed some extra support. You guys were there for me when I wasn't understanding concepts, having difficulties with lab reports, and looking for advice in general. You made me feel appreciated and more confident in my abilities. You were all approachable and challenged me in the best ways possible.\n\nMany of you were on tight deadlines, struggling with completing important research due to COVID, working two jobs, and dealing with health issues. That didn't stop anyone from always showing up, making students laugh, and putting aside hours of your time to help us.\n\nYou guys rock!",

I started as a TA last fall and it was SO MUCH to deal with, but the kind words from my students always made my day!  One of my students told me at the end of one of the semesters that they'd miss me and my memes and it warmed the cockles of my little grad student heart.",

I miss seeing everyone's pets over Zoom, having wild seminar conversations, and all the dumb inside jokes our classes made by the end of the semester. \n\nI am 100% honest with the praise, and to tell you the truth, I often like you grad students much more than my fellow undergrads haha!",
