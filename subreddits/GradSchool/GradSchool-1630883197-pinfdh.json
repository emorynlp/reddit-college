I have no idea where I'd be without the mentorship, education, and motivation. I really look up to you and am always so curious to hear about your research and passions.\n\nEspecially with over a year of Zoom seminars and labs, I needed some extra support. You guys were there for me when I wasn't understanding concepts, having difficulties with lab reports, and looking for advice in general. You made me feel appreciated and more confident in my abilities. You were all approachable and challenged me in the best ways possible.\n\nMany of you were on tight deadlines, struggling with completing important research due to COVID, working two jobs, and dealing with health issues. That didn't stop anyone from always showing up, making students laugh, and putting aside hours of your time to help us.\n\nYou guys rock!", "author": "tellmeguru", "created": 1630883197, "retrieved": 1632952903, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 202, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"hbs5j95": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pinfdh/appreciative_undergraduate_student_wanting_to/hbs5j95/", "text": "I've been lab manager for my research lab for a while now, recently started as a GSGA, and this made me happy.

Seconding the comment that the positive feedback and appreciation from our students means A LOT!  I started as a TA last fall and it was SO MUCH to deal with, but the kind words from my students always made my day!
