I\u2019ve also told my department head and my program director what is going on. That being said, I do need to get advise on how to deal with my toxic advisor. He\u2019s demeaning, belittling, demanding, etc. Today I asked him for a more clear idea of when I would be graduating, as I\u2019ve had a company reach out to me about jobs and he did NOT react well. Belittled, was rude, really just tried to put me down. \n\nIt\u2019s to the point I have hives currently because of the anxiety I got from the meeting today, so I need tips on how to not let it control me.", "author": "JustAHippy", "created": 1632268162, "retrieved": 1632844080, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hdsj0u2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/psv98q/tips_for_toxic_advisor/hdsj0u2/", "text": "Finish up and get out. If you burn that bridge, well... is it worth keeping anyway?\nI finished up everything and left for big pharma. My former PI hasn't spoken to me in 3 years and vice versa. At this point, I need nothing from my former PI and no one at this company even really cared about who my former PI was etc (they care more about what I can do for them). It helped, and also didn't help, that every lab in the department and a lot of important people at our former institution (long story) knew exactly what was going on. They all did nothing; grant money and sweeping things under the rug are more important.", "author": "kirby726", "created": 1632274006, "upvotes": 4}}}
