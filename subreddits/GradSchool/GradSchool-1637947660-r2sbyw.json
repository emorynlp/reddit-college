  "title:": "Anyone in grad school and dating someone in a program at a different but nearby school?",
  "text": "My partner (29M) and I (26F) lived together last year, but this fall I started a M.S program and he started med school. Our schools are an hour apart, we see each other at least once per week and we chat on the phone every night just to check in and talk about our days. He's a bit more introverted than me and really likes alone time, whereas I am extroverted and like being around people. \n\nBefore we started, we both decided it would be good to live at our respective schools and that we would likely live together after the first year. Recently he decided he wanted to live alone next year (something he's never done but always wanted to), which was not my preference but also i want to support him. Especially because living together would mean each of us commuting 30 min everyday vs one of us driving an hour each way every week. So neither is really ideal. I've also decided that I want to pursue a dual degree which would keep me at my school for 3 years total. He's doing clinicals his third year, but we'd really only get able to live together then if he gets placed at a hospital near my school.\n\nIt's frustrating. I'd always wanted to do a PhD but since I've started considering a dual degree I've been realizing that I could probably do the kind of work I want to do with just 2 M.S degrees (the degree i want to add is in data science so that opens up a lot of doors). I feel like I want to start settling down-ish, i.e not moving every year and living with roommates, but i feel kind of stuck. I feel like I'm waiting around to move in with my partner but also even if I were to date someone else (don't really want to) I'd have to wait to get to know another person. \n\nSo yeah, on top of the existential crisis that is grad school, i feel the weight of this too. I was wondering if anyone else is/was in a similar boat?",

      "text": "I was in a similar situation, and the added pressure likely contributed to the relationship ending. That said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a death sentence for a relationship; you both just have to make sure you\u2019re on the same page about how much time you\u2019ll be able to make for each other and that you\u2019re both willing to put in the extra effort needed to make things work.",

      "text": "My girlfriend and I both started our PhD programs at different schools this year. We wanted to live together and because of that I drive an hour to school everyday and she drives 45 min during rush hour. While it sucks, I also think it's awesome we are both pursing our PHDs and happy at the schools we are at. It has been tough at points but also the drive allows me to clear my head before coming home and jsut gives me time to think. But communication is key. It would be really easy to get frustrated since the situation isn't ideal but we both agreed to it and just talking about it and expressing to her how I feel and how she feels makes it alot easier to feel like we are in it together. Again not ideal but I wouldn't want to live separate (especially because we have cats) and at the end of the day it is just so nice to come back to our home we've created together. \nSo I would encourage you to think about what you really want to do in your academic career, how serious you are about this relationship etc. One day my girlfriend and I won't have this long of a commute but for now that's our situation and that's totally okay!",

      "text": "Before I started my PhD, I was an undergrad at the other side of the country and my (now) fiance was a grad student. We both agreed to travel to see each other frequently and made plans for our life together. However, since I was applying for FT roles and grad school, we did realize that IF I ended up getting into my dream school or a really great job offer far from him, I'd move and we'd decide whether the relationship was worth pursuing. \n\n\nI know so many women in grad school who have had painful breakups after relationships lasting 5-7 years! I'm of the opinion that it's better to end things early rather than waiting that long. When you're young you can easily find great people. As you age, it's significantly harder to find someone else. It's much better to end relationships that are too risky early imo, especially for young women.",
