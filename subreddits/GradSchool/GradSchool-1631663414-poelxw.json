I started my MSW program recently and am wondering whether this field is right for me. I have experienced homelessness in the past, been on SSDI, and have had a difficult time getting resources for myself, despite advocating on my behalf. In the past, I've been turned away from shelters due to lack of space. I am still receiving state assistance as a low-income person. While reading some policies for class about Section 8 I noticed a huge disparity between the policies and my own experiences and feel very angry about it. I have been let down over and over again by the system. How can I help others if I can't help myself within the system? My ultimate goal is to become a licensed clinical social worker and do clinical work. I know that can take a while and at my age (35) I'm questioning if this is the right path for me. Has anyone had their own experiences with the system failing them while also working in the social work field?", "author": "ferventsoul", "created": 1631663414, "retrieved": 1632844548, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
