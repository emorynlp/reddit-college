  "title:": "Grad school is NOT like undergrad/med school, and using it to give your life direction is a bad idea.",
  "text": "Title. I'm a third year PhD student, with a friend who, after getting rejected from med school, is going through the \"I did well in undergrad and now I don't know what to do with my life, and need direction. I guess I'll go to grad school!\" phase. I've been (gently) trying to get him to think about this a bit harder, and wound up writing a message, edited a bit here, that might be of interest to some people here thinking about grad school.\n\n^((Also, for optional background context, this friend worked as an undergrad in my lab for a year, and his performance was...extremely mediocre, though he didn't realize it. He never progressed past a superficial level of knowledge on the project he worked on, and his final paper was, in the words of my PI, written at a high school level, and so bad it was basically uneditable. This was the assessment of me, my PI ,and the postdoc he worked under. We tried to help him take more ownership over his project and really understand it, but that horse would just not drink. No, I have not told him his performance was mediocre because at the time, I figured it didn't matter because he was going to med school anyway and being bad at doing research doesn't mean you can't be a good doctor. He's always wanted to be a doctor, but since he can't get into med school, he now wants to pursue a PhD in organic chemistry. We are a neuroscience lab (not that he really learned much here..)) ^(Why does he want a PhD in chemistry? Because he liked his one undergrad OChem class and thinks doing drug design/discovery would be cool, completely ignoring the fact that an OChem class does NOT give you a good idea of what grad school is actually like. TL;DR: dude would crash and burn in grad school, assuming he even gets in, which he likely won't anyway. He's a nice guy and a genuinely good friend, so I've tried to be gentle, but I figure it's better he get the rude awakening now than later.))\n\n>Grad school is nothing like both undergrad and med school for two main reasons: the degree of independence/lack of structure, and the nature of the intellectual work.  \n>  \n>Your time in a PhD is almost entirely unstructured. With the exception of classes in your first two years, you set your own schedule, conceptualize your own project, design and conduct your own experiments, and interpret data almost entirely independently. You do get training from others in your lab, but when it comes down to it, you are the one doing the work, and no one is going to make you do it. There are no tests, deadlines, nothing -- so there isn't the sense of fulfillment that comes with getting a good grade like in undergrad. Milestones are few and far between so it is extremely common to feel like you have no idea whether you're succeeding or failing. Also your experiments will fail badly and often. You will sometimes go weeks with nothing but failure -- and you still have to go on and do the work and figure out how to fix it. This happens again and again. If you are used to the success high of good grades in undergrad, this can be very demoralizing. You will be perpetually time-poor and always feel vaguely like there is something you should be doing. I consider myself to have a good work-life balance and I probably work a minimum of 50 hours/week and often come in on weekends. And I am limited by the fact I have chronic fatigue -- a lot of people who do not have this limitation go even harder. The rates of grad students with anxiety and depression in grad school are insanely high.  \n>  \n>Intellectually, it's very different from both med and undergrad. In med/college, you are learning things that are already known. There are answers. Oftentimes, when people say they loved their science classes in undergrad, what they enjoyed was the satisfaction of learning new and easily-packaged information. And it is satisfying! And it's good and important to know what's already known. But that isn't what you do in grad school. In grad school, you are creating new knowledge: identifying gaps in the field, then identifying what tools you can use to fill them. There isn't the satisfaction of a known correct answer in grad school. In fact, the whole point of grad school is to answer questions that haven't even been asked yet. Again, this is a VERY complex process, from experimental design to interpretation. Even that first step of figuring out what questions to ask is difficult. Figuring out what's known, unknown, what's important or trivial, what kinds of questions you can even ask given the tools available to you -- none of this is easy, and all of it requires a very high degree of intrinsic motivation.  \n>  \n>IMO a PhD shouldn't even be thought of as school because it's really more like a 40+ hr/week research job. For ex, my main thesis project on \\[topic\\]: to even just come up with it, I did WEEKS of reading on \\[topics\\]...etc. All of this was self-directed: \\[PI\\] did not tell me where to find information, what to read, how much I should read, or what my project should be. Designing the experiments required deep knowledge of how various techniques work and what their limitations are. What can \\[technique A\\] tell you that \\[B\\] can't and vice versa? What limitations does \\[B\\] have in terms of \\[thing relevant to my project\\] and how does that affect my analysis? Are the characteristics that distinguish \\[thing of interest A\\] from \\[thing of interest B\\] measurable by these methods or are the two phenotypes too continuous in some senses that differentiating them is hard without very high resolution? What have other people already done and what are the best practices in this field? Almost all of this knowledge is self-acquired, i.e. no one will sit you down and give you a project with a hypothesis and the means to test it. You will often be cribbing material together from many many different sources, drawing non-obvious inferences, and really having to dig to find stuff. And that's before you even step into the lab and have any data to analyze.  \n>  \n>To be brutally honest, not having the incentive to read up on the difference between med and grad school when there is so much info on the internet (and from mentors in undergrad including \\[PI\\]) and considering applying to grad school without understanding what the day-to-day life is like or not knowing how or trying to learn how to look for tech or postbac research positions is a big sign you are probably not ready for grad school. If you don't have the self-motivation to seek out that info, then you will struggle with all the other tasks in grad school that require miles more self-direction and are much less straightforward. I know this sounds very blunt and negative, but I'm not saying this because I think you're stupid or should never ever go to grad school. I'm saying it because going to grad school without having fully thought it through is a recipe for disaster. I have seen so many people go down this path and they end up miserable, and as your friend, I don't want that to happen to you.\n\nHe later said, \"I guess I have been looking at what careers would bring me fulfillment and not as much the day to days of the degrees that get me there. I know what I want to do with the degree but maybe knowing I'd like it is not enough to commit to it.\"\n\nTo which I replied, \"The day to day is so important because that's gonna be your life for 5+ years and the career that follows won't necessarily be that much different. To know that career will bring you fulfillment, you have to know what doing it is actually like, not just what it sounds like in an ideal world. It's important to look at grad school as its own thing and not just as a stepping stone because of the opportunity cost (your time, money, and emotional health) associated with doing it. And pursuing research as a career means your day-to-day as a PhD level researcher likely won't be all that different from grad school -- otherwise, those PhD jobs wouldn't require a PhD\\*.\n\n^(\\*to clarify, I don't mean that there is no difference between being a PI, postdoc, industry scientist, or grad student. Obviously, there is. And it is a big problem that basically nowhere in the academic pipeline do we get the managerial/leadership training required for running a lab. But the point I was trying to make is that you shouldn't look at a PhD as just something to get through to get to what you actually want to do, because if you don't have the intrinsic drive to get through a PhD, the stuff that comes after is going to be even more difficult. Of course, this is discounting circumstances that make doing the PhD difficult, other than the work itself (e.g. abusive PIs).)\n\nI once jokingly said to my therapist that we should require at least 3 months of therapy, proof that a person has made connections with current grad students and understands the reality of grad school, and an endorsement from a mental health professional before we let anyone go to grad school (similar to what's required of transgender patients before accessing hormones/surgery). She laughed but then said, \"We probably should because then less of those people would end up in my office after being traumatized by their PhD.\"\n\nMy point isn't that grad school is all hell and misery (and in fact, I think negative experiences are overrepresented here and on other grad subs). I love grad school a lot, much more than undergrad, and even when experiments don't cooperate or deadlines pile up, I wouldn't rather be doing anything else. But that's because I knew what grad school would be, and what it would demand of me, and decided that that was compatible with my personality/lifestyle/brand of nerdy-obsessiveness, and that the good outweighed the bad. But you cannot even make that evaluation for yourself if you don't have a baseline understanding of what it is.",

I know that paths will look and be different depending on what the area of study is and whether it's a master or doctoral degree being pursued, but there is a huge difference between undergrad and grad programs that I think a lot of us are unprepared for. \n\nEven after finding some information and waiting (many) years between undergrad and grad school, I still think this would have been beneficial to read before starting, if even just to alleviate some of the stress during adjustment at the beginning.\n\nI hope your post gets a lot of upvotes so that a lot of people can see it.

The higher-end jobs in private industry and at national labs will edge closer to 130-140k. However, those are sort of rarer in my opinion, so the average falls to around the 100k mark. Maybe a bit higher. This is just from what I have learned and experienced. Could be off.

      "text": "Very well written. I am a 4th year MD/PhD student so I have seen both sides of the coin. And actually I enjoy grad school more than med school. The ability to determine my own schedule and ask the questions that I'm interested in without someone trying to shut me for distracting them from information that's more pertinent to an exam is freeing and gratifying for me. So too is the (relative) lack of hierarchy, where I can discuss my own ideas with my PI and work out a plan of action instead of just doing what I'm told (and I encourage everyone to develop this sort of relationship with your PI so that you aren't just treated as labor. Of course it is still very labor intensive...) \n\nBut you're wholly right in that it is not for everyone. You really have to be self-motivated. And sometimes that can be exhausting. Sometimes I find myself wishing for more structure - \"if I do X, then Y will happen and Y is something positive.\" Unfortunately it doesn't often doesn't work that way...haha",

It's not just about studying and working on problems, but about making real tangible research progress every week and reporting to your advisors for thorough feedback. Couple that with the VERY strong feeling of \"I don't know what I'm doing\" which is especially bad early on, and it becomes a pretty stressful situation. \n\nI think most people don't realize that the *kind* of stress grad school brings about is like nothing they have ever felt before.

Not saying this was the right (or wrong) way to go about it necessarily, but I ended up really finding my stride and quickly realized it was where I needed to be. I'm a highly intuitive, seat-of-my-pants, and yes, idealist type of personality, so that was the only way I could go about it.
