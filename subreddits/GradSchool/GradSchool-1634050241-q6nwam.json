  "title:": "Turning someone in for \"light\" plagiarism?",
  "text": "This semester I'm taking an elective that covers most of what I do for a living, and it's as low stakes as you can possibly make any class. Most of the assignments is watching videos and reading/taking in other people's work and writing a small blurb about them. I touch on a lot of outside references in my blurbs because *it's what I do for a living* and also because I've studied this field extensively before this class. \n\nOne of my classmates copy and pasted one of these blurbs (they're all posted in a forum accessible to everyone in the course), reworked the words and presented it as his own work, outside references and all. He used the formatting I used and left in the same images I used to illustrated my points. Again, it's just a blurb, it's not a whole paper or project. But I am angry at the blatant laziness, the arrogance, of this person thinking that changing a few adjectives would be enough to make it seem like his own. He is a graduate assistant for the university to boot.\n\nTo add some context about why I'm so angry about one blog post -- for the last several semesters I've been noticing a trend of male students leaning on or harassing the women in our STEM program to get work completed for them. They call and text after midnight(!!), they pester for answers during our work hours(!!!), they do the bare minimum while expecting us to do the heavy calculating, coding, algorithm building and project management, but they're still very fond of swooping in and taking credit at the end of the semester. This copied blog post is the straw that broke my back.\n\nWould emailing the instructor about a copied blog post be the thing to do, or should I just let this go until it becomes a pattern? If it matters, the instructor is an employee of the university, and it is obvious he is uninterested in teaching. I am acquaintances with his immediate coworkers and colleagues and not one of them have had a good thing to say about his work ethic. So if I reach out to him it's highly likely he will blow me off, and I am hesitant to follow up with his boss (whom I am also distantly acquainted with) over one blog post.",

The professor just said \u201cok\u201d and passed on me and the other guy was told to stay after class. The guy came back after 2 weeks to present with an entirely different lesson that was nowhere near what I told him. I later found out that the professor reprimanded him and chose his topic for him. From what other students told me, the guy struggled to build his lesson and during his presentation, he was boring as fuck. My point: fuck yeah you should. Turn their ass in.",

I lost 15% for not citing a source. When I confronted the professor with the fact that the idea was my own, she said \u201cwell you had to have copied it because you\u2019re not the only student to use they exact sentence.\u201d I read all the other papers and found it and turned them in. The professor changed my grade to an A and said drop it. This was a tenured professor at a top 10 public school.",

      "text": "I've been a TA for courses that repeat the same assignments year after year. I was the one that made the solution sheets. So I know exactly how you feel -- when your own solutions are posted somewhere online, it feels awful reading your own exact sentences and arguments presented back to you as an \"original\" piece of work. \n\nUnfortunately at my institution the enforcement of punishment is haphazard and based on the whim of the professor. Some profs take it seriously and will have interviews with the plagiarizer. This will just end in a grade of zero for the submitted assignment. Some profs would rather skip the paperwork entirely, so catching the cheaters with my own work just ends with them passing on investigating altogether. When I realize my prof doesn't care, I just take it into my own hands, skip the bureaucracy, and give them no marks myself. They often come into my office hours asking about why they got no marks for a question, and I just show them the solutions I made in previous years. If it escalates, then I can hand it off to the higher powers, no skin off my back.",
