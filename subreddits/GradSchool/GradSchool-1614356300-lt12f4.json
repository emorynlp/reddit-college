  "title:": "My best bud in the lab is planning to move for the rest of his PhD... and I'm so sad...",
  "text": "When I moved to Toronto to do grad school I made fast friends with one of the guys in the lab. Over many beers we'd gotten pretty deep into each others lives, I counseled him through the aftermath of his break up for example. Well he got a new girlfriend and like any semi-socially-awkward dude he disappeared into that relationship. She's a fine girlfriend, though I find her to be occasionally a little mean to my buddy but he seems fine with it. \n\nAnyway, the two of them have been trying to find a house in Toronto and it's been going -- predictably -- badly. So they have now decided that they are going to move to another province to maybe find housing there. I'm a pretty social guy, so I'll make another friend, it's just that I really like this dude and I'm going to miss my buddy. \n\nThat's it, grad studies makes it so we meet lots of people from lots of different places and then they move away and that sucks... just looking to share my grump of the morning.",

I was born and raised in Toronto, and I have all intentions of staying in Toronto for the next 5-7 ish years as I complete my PhD and establish a career. My girlfriend and I plan on marrying in the next 2 ish years (once my qualifying exam is done) and renting an apartment out in downtown. With my poverty stipend and her decent salary straight out of UG, we should make by just fine, but we don't plan on becoming homeowners for at least another 8 years or so, and chances are settling in Toronto will be out of the question until we're well into our 30s (if we even want to move), especially with the crazy housing market nowadays. \n\nAs a student with a serious girlfriend, I think I'm qualified in saying that love makes you crazy, so I really don't blame your friend. Just watch out for him - in a healthy relationship, both people have to make sacrifices for the other person. If you think your friend is making a lot more sacrifices than she is in their relationship, those are huge red flags. I wouldn't want your friend getting hurt by this girl and harm his career in the process.",

It's always seemed like a really weird dynamic of heterosexual couples to me. They either make little emotional jabs or they treat their male partner a bit like a child... it's weird. Maybe I'm just not understanding the heterosexual relationship vibe properly... gay guys will do it too but those relationships usually dissolve while straight ones seem to linger...\n\nAnyway, that's my experience it's most certainly not a comprehensive observation of modern relationships. I just found her behaviour to be a little more \"I treat you like a child\" than most. He says he loves her though so... okay. (shrug)",
