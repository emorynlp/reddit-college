  "text": "I finally completed my data collection! I did 50 interviews for my research study. The average interview length is 1.5 hours. However, some of my interviews are 4 to 6 hours in length. I tried to transcribe finished interviews in between interviews but I usually winded up exhausted after talking to someone for 1.5 hours. So now I have a bunch of audio to transcribe... Any tips or tricks on how to get through this next hurdle? What sort of programs did you use to help you transcribe? Also, how to stay motivated throughout all this without losing my mind would be greatly appreciated! Thanks ya\u2019ll!",

      "text": "You can use a website like [Temi](https://www.temi.com/) to get a rough transcription so that you only have to clean up the transcripts rather than create them from scratch. You can also use [Rev](https://www.rev.com/), but that costs $1.25/minute so unless you have grant money or something, it seems like that'd get pretty pricey rather quickly. As an undergrad, I really liked using [HyperTranscribe](http://www.researchware.com/products/hypertranscribe.html) to create transcripts from scratch ($99 for a [student license](http://www.researchware.com/sales/pricing/educational-pricing.html)). Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.",

But it does have a 30 sec. preview option to see if it's transcribing well before you commit to paying for it. You can also let it transcribe and go back and fit bits. You could consider investing in a transcribing peddle to make it easier.\n\nIf you have the money you could also consider getting someone else to transcribe some of them professionally for you.\n\nHonestly just take it slow. Transcribing takes so much more time than you would think. I've also been coding themes/topics by color and highlighting or bolding important things I definitely want to remember in the transcript.",
