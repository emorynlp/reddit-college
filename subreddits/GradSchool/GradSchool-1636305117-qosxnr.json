I have dreadful social anxiety which keeps making me question every move and feel inadequate :(",

Might not work for you, but changing that in my case let me be more excited about it than scared. Also the practice makes perfect thing is real in this case, you will stumble all the time, just move past it and learn from the mistake if possible. If you need boot camp mode for this, I recommend starting a YouTube channel of anything you are interested in and talking about it. It will get you use to speaking knowing people might be listening but without any real repercussions of a stumble. Don't treat the channel as something you want success from necessarily, treat it as a tool for practice at speaking.",

I teach an intro survey course and it has helped my fear of public speaking tremendously. There are moments that I don't know the exact answer to a question a student has, but they are very receptive to a response of \"I'm not sure, ill check and get back to you\". In my experience students prioritize their grades so I've never been asked an esoteric question that an academic may ask.\n\nAlso, PhD students are in the same position as you, so judging you is probably the last thing they are doing!",
