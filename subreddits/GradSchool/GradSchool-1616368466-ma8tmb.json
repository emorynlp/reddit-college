Our IT department took the computer to reboot it. Our computers are supposed to have automatic backups but I told them to back the computer again b/c I am paranoid that the backup wasn\u2019t up to date. \nGot the computer back on Friday and nothing was backed up. Apparently backup that was set up on my computer was just backing up install files IT set up and the person in charge of backing up my computer was some part-time/intern who didn\u2019t back everything up before wiping my computer. Going to talk to IT on Monday but they already warned me that its 99% certain everything is gone. \nI have already have had super low motivation to do anything and this is just another major setback that has me really questioning if I should even stay in school.", "author": "Idontevenknow5555", "created": 1616368466, "retrieved": 1632845257, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 651, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gru1rbi": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ma8tmb/gentle_reminder_to_make_sure_you_have_a_backup_of/gru1rbi/", "text": "I was so paranoid back in grad school, that I backed up my work to 2 different USBs daily, and always took one home with me.", "author": "Schedonnardus", "created": 1616434703, "upvotes": 1}, "grtyqml": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ma8tmb/gentle_reminder_to_make_sure_you_have_a_backup_of/grtyqml/", "text": "there is a form to sign before IT do anything on any computer in my school, it is legal binding document saying that the owner has to backup everything and anything that is loss during the inspection or repair, the repair department is exempt from any legal consequences.", "author": "yinshiyi", "created": 1616433385, "upvotes": 1}, "grtu4ho": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ma8tmb/gentle_reminder_to_make_sure_you_have_a_backup_of/grtu4ho/", "text": "This happened to me last week.

I had an old Dell several years ago, and it straight up died and I don't know what was wrong with it. I ended up having a date with this guy who was super into computers and just made an offhand comment about my computer and he told me he could take a look. Long story short, he was able to take out the hard drive and transfer everything to an external hard drive. I didn't really have anything backed up, it was just saved on the hard drive. \n\nI would definitely get it looked at elsewhere. If someone else was able to fix it, I'd probably contact the IT department to let them know, because it's something they'd need to be aware of so they don't end up misinforming other people. \n\nIn a comment, you mentioned that the computer is university property and IT folks are the only ones allowed to look at it. I agree with others' suggestions to go over their head and keep asking to speak to a supervisor until you get the very last person in the chain if need be (I'd also loop in your supervisor and/or department chair since this is a broader issue and may impact others). In the meantime, is there really any harm in getting a *consultation* from elsewhere? Your IT folks told you there was a \"99%\" chance the data is not recoverable (which, btw, I tend to interpret figures like that more along the lines of 'I don't know how' or 'I could, but I'm too lazy'), but if there was someone else who told you it was a 40% chance the data could be recovered, maybe it's worthwhile to have a discussion and let them know what the IT people did/said.", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1616413569, "upvotes": 2}, "grsnyda": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ma8tmb/gentle_reminder_to_make_sure_you_have_a_backup_of/grsnyda/", "text": "Yeah everything is backed up through a school-provided cloud drive, lab provided server, my personal cloud service account, and on external hard drive where I occasionally save my back up files....am I missing anything?", "author": "geometer2015", "created": 1616408119, "upvotes": 1}, "grsfjz3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ma8tmb/gentle_reminder_to_make_sure_you_have_a_backup_of/grsfjz3/", "text": "thats devastating..... have you considered checking the computers hooked up to the measuring equipment for the raw data? not sure what type of experiments you were doing or if this applies", "author": "moffedillen", "created": 1616399513, "upvotes": 1}, "grrzbep": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ma8tmb/gentle_reminder_to_make_sure_you_have_a_backup_of/grrzbep/", "text": "Once you get through this, I recommend use the cloud back up, I understand you thought that was happening.
