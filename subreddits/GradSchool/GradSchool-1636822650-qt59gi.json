  "title:": "How to deal with feeling absurdly stupid in from of my of advisor?",
  "text": "I'm a first Computer Science PhD student at a \"highly-ranked\" program, whatever that means. I just finished undergrad in May. I am my advisor's first ever PhD student (they've been TT for only one and a half years now after finishing a few post-docs). The workload is very intense (both research and coursework) as we tend to meet twice a week and I also have to manage classes, since I have many breadth requirements to meet. Also, my advisor doesn't have any other students this year, so we frequently have very long (numerous hours) research meeting where we're often coding/actively learning something together. I knew all this going in and took the gamble cause I thought we gelled very well together and had a research match. \n\nWell, here's the thing. With these super hands-on meetings, I tend to feel very stupid and feel like I'm losing credibility in front of my advisor. The reason I'm making this post is something that happened yesterday and has got me feeling down for the last the day and a half. I asked a question that I guess was so basic that they just laughed. They gave me an answer but it was in a very  \"oh it's obvious\" tone. I have no senior PhD students to ask these questions to so I'm left having to ask my advisor. Couple that with the fact that we've been trying to solve a research issue for a month now and it just makes me feel incompetent. I know I'm overthinking it and I have to grow a thicker skin if I want to succeed in grad school but I just can't help but feel like my advisor thinks I'm stupid. Even though I had great research success in undergrad (which is why I got into this program), I never felt like I was truly a part of those projects and now I'm being found out. Sometimes I wish our meetings were less hands-on. Things would move slower but I feel like I would have more time to gauge the technical ideas that come easily (and obviously) to my PI. \n\nEither way, it's been a hard few weeks. I know there's a lot of folks on here who have a plethora of experience. Would really appreciate some help.",

      "text": "Feeling dumb sometimes is natural, especially when you\u2019re doing a lot of work together with your advisor. They\u2019re supposed to know more than you or at least know how to conduct research better than you. I would take full advantage of learning as much as you can from your advisor about the material and more importantly how they approach a research problem. Since you\u2019re working with him/her so often you have more opportunities to literally see the way they think. This is valuable. Remember you are there to learn how to do research. You are mot expected to be a proficient researcher from the get go",

I just finished undergrad in May.\n\nIn your first semester, you should feel like your advisor is *way more* knowledgeable than you. And that's okay. That's why you're there. To learn from them.\n\nEven once you're at the dissertation stage, given that you're at a top-ranked program, your advisor is still going to be more knowledgeable than you :)\n\nSo don't sweat it. The first year of the PhD is where you start to learn the scope of what you *don't* know. \n\n>I know I'm overthinking it and I have to grow a thicker skin\n\nI don't think you have to think of it that way. Other than in your specific specialty area, there will always be people that know much more than you. That's just the limits of how much knowledge we can learn as humans.\n\nAnd recognizing our own limits is important. Part of being an expert on something is not only knowing things, but being able to say we don't have an educated opinion or information on something.\n\n>They gave me an answer but it was in a very \"oh it's obvious\" tone.\n\nMaybe that's your own anxiety misinterpreting it. I wouldn't read much into it.",

      "text": "Laughing at a first year student for asking a question is so fucking mean. Why not, \u201cOh sorry, I guess we haven\u2019t discussed that topic\u201d? The mark of being a good grad student is being a dedicated learner, not having some pre-existing memory bank. These technical ideas \u201ccome easily\u201d to your PI because they\u2019re a fucking PI!!! They\u2019ve got way more experience than you! The only expectation they should have of you is that you earnestly try your best. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t necessarily advice, but I think that knowledge of reasonable expectations can help you keep your head above the water in those brutal moments, so you can accurately assign blame and not come away thinking there\u2019s something wrong with you (because I assure you there isn\u2019t).",

You will be asked to critique him at the end of the semester, and if he has poor people skills, that should be addressed. Til then, just starts to see professors as your tool to get where you want to go, not at some wizard to whom you must aspire.  In the end, it's about $$.",

      "text": "Did you think about having a frank discussion with your advisor? Even if they are a new TT faculty member, they may have words of advice to share with you. Maybe they felt the same way as you do now. Since you are already having long sessions together, these conversations may be easier in some ways. \n \nFirst years are for learning your way around, so it is normal to feel this way. But I would add some concerns. If you are really this unprepared with what they consider as basic stuff, you should consider addressing these points. Your advisor is a new TT and may expect you to ramp up fast to assist in their own career. Hiding your deficiencies may hurt you later. Finally you can think about transferring to another school given this unique situation.",
