I'm also a college English instructional assistant during these Plague Days 2020, so I see the negative effects of ripping students out of the classroom and into a digital learning environment.\n\nMy advice is to prioritize the readings you *have* to do and skim the readings you *ought* to do. The most effective way of skimming is to read the abstract, the introduction, the first and last sentence of every paragraph, and the conclusion (remember when you took English 1 and we were all Thesis! Topic sentence! Transition! - this is the point). This will also help you identify which paragraphs seem most relevant; read those. \n\nIf you are reading PDFs or anything digital, mostly, Ctrl+F (or command on Mac) is your new best friend. Search for important terms and maybe some synonyms, and read the surrounding paragraphs. This is especially useful for research! If you're looking for research on high school classrooms, you don't want to be half way through and figure out the article only discusses ECE, y'know?\n\nThe BEST discussions are the ones that ask questions. Professors love that shit. This also helps your classmates respond and will make you more popular, lol. Good questions are based on questions you had while reading, so don't overthink them and just ask about that term's social meaning, how it applies to classroom learning, and why the author only cited themselves (looking at you, Chompsky)! I always tell my students, be stupid simple. It's better to be straightforward and clear than clever and vague.\n\nI hope those helps in some capacity!

If it's for a class the treat it as lower relevance. \n* For low relevance, read the abstract carefully, look at the figures, and their descriptions, if necessary to understand. If you get the story, you can move on. If you don't get it, skim the results section to see if it can help you make sense of their narrative. Skip the introduction, methods and discussion unless there's something that catches your eye. Write the narrative in your own words either on the front page, or beside the figures. \n* For high relevance, do the above first, and the read the whole damn paper. The methodology section becomes super important here. Take copious notes. Go through the author's logic piece by piece. Think about whether there are alternative explanations that fit the data.
