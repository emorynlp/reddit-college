My first year of grad school sucked but the second year (thus far) has been even worse. Day by day, I just feel less and less invested. With classes being online, I push things off and do the absolute bare minimum. I\u2019m extremely frustrated with myself and although I know I\u2019m the only one that can change it, I am so drained that I don\u2019t even want to. I jumped straight from undergrad to grad school with no break in between. The fatigue is really catching up to me. I\u2019m grateful that I am able to work from home but working from home + online classes is really beginning to mess with my head. I really think the breaking point was when my program gave us the news that spring semester will also be online (with the exception of a few hybrid classes). It just feels like there\u2019s no end in sight. I completely understand why things need to be this way & I support it but I guess I am struggling with what I imagined grad school would be like, in my head, and the actual reality of it all.",

      "text": "I got my MA in English Literature online, so you can probably imagine the amount of reading and writing I had to do (I wrote around 8-10K words every week for two and a half years - more when major assignments were due!) I'm also a college English instructional assistant during these Plague Days 2020, so I see the negative effects of ripping students out of the classroom and into a digital learning environment.\n\nMy advice is to prioritize the readings you *have* to do and skim the readings you *ought* to do. The most effective way of skimming is to read the abstract, the introduction, the first and last sentence of every paragraph, and the conclusion (remember when you took English 1 and we were all Thesis! Topic sentence! Transition! - this is the point). This will also help you identify which paragraphs seem most relevant; read those. \n\nIf you are reading PDFs or anything digital, mostly, Ctrl+F (or command on Mac) is your new best friend. Search for important terms and maybe some synonyms, and read the surrounding paragraphs. This is especially useful for research! If you're looking for research on high school classrooms, you don't want to be half way through and figure out the article only discusses ECE, y'know?\n\nThe BEST discussions are the ones that ask questions. Professors love that shit. This also helps your classmates respond and will make you more popular, lol. Good questions are based on questions you had while reading, so don't overthink them and just ask about that term's social meaning, how it applies to classroom learning, and why the author only cited themselves (looking at you, Chompsky)! I always tell my students, be stupid simple. It's better to be straightforward and clear than clever and vague.\n\nI hope those helps in some capacity! Lmk if you need clarification/have questions. <3",

If I want to I can very easily set up a quiz or assignment for basically every class, some of which can be graded automatically. Also I'm finding I'm able to grade much faster due to centralization + ease of use for our online platform. It makes it very tempting to up student workloads to our capacity to assign, rather than their capacity to learn.",

Devote your attention to this task without distraction. \n* Decide *a priori* how relevant the paper is to your research. If it's for lab journal club, treat it as highly relevant. If it's for a class the treat it as lower relevance. \n* For low relevance, read the abstract carefully, look at the figures, and their descriptions, if necessary to understand. If you get the story, you can move on. If you don't get it, skim the results section to see if it can help you make sense of their narrative. Skip the introduction, methods and discussion unless there's something that catches your eye. Write the narrative in your own words either on the front page, or beside the figures. \n* For high relevance, do the above first, and the read the whole damn paper. The methodology section becomes super important here. Take copious notes. Go through the author's logic piece by piece. Think about whether there are alternative explanations that fit the data. Identify the gaps in knowledge. Then read it again, but this time think about how it relates to your own research. Take more notes. \n\nYou will forget what you've read. But you will hopefully remember your notes and why you wrote those notes. \n\nNot all papers deserve the same degree of attention to serve your purpose. You can churn through a lot of papers relatively quickly by just getting the gist of it and moving on.\n\nNB: you really need to read a lot of papers first before you get a feel for understanding a narrative from the abstract and figures alone. But as with anything, the more practice you have at something, the better you'll get at it.\n\nNB2: I have no idea what other STEM field papers look like and I don't have a clue about non-STEM fields. I suspect a similar attention-priority approach is generally applicable.",

Many assignments that used to be group assignments have to be handed in individually. While that seems like much more work for you, doing an assignment on your own you have to consider the people going over the assignments.\n\nLast year I was assisting in teaching the same course of genetics I'm helping with now, we had approximately the same amount of students but instead of 160 students handing in roughly 60 assignments I'm getting the full 160 assignments to grade. This actually forced me to simplify the assignment just so I could get through grading them on top of everything else I have to do.\n\nWe're all struggling, the students, the teachers and the TA's. \n\nAlso, not to sound too mean, but how do you know it's more work due to COVID-19? Unless you've taken all those courses before and have some frame of reference for the workload?",
