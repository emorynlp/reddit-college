Things are finally over and done, and I passed with no revisions :) I couldn't help but cry a little when they announced it haha. My advisor sent me a note saying \"Congratulations, that went extremely well\", which made me so happy! Good luck to everyone who still has their defense upcoming!!!\n\nI never thought this time would come. Up until only a month ago, it really did seem like it's never going to happen! I can't believe all this time passed, I can't believe I published some papers and had some results people actually find \"cool\". I can't believe after everything that happened during my PhD, including a change in advisor, some traumatic events, a move cross-country and finishing it remotely, that I'm finally at the end. So grateful for the support of my advisor and my friends, who didn't want to let me quit for the wrong reasons the many times I've wanted to.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm ready for tomorrow but I'm confident I did the best I could given circumstances. I hope to make my advisor proud and pique the interest of my committee. Initially I just wanted it to be over with and planned to keep it private, but then I realized having familiar names on the zoom call would be invaluable moral support, and decided to invite my friends.\n\nI'm really anxious that I've forgotten something, that my talk is not good enough, or when I get to the darkest places of my mind -- that my entire research is one big five-year joke. I kept thinking \"your thesis title is boring and lame; should have given it more of a Netflix documentary title flare\" or \"no, this can't be me, this is a mistake; this problem isn't real science\". I hope I can silence these thoughts so I can focus on practicing, and that all goes well. To everyone who's in the same position right now: I understand and empathize with you, and am cheering for you too!", "author": "researchshowsthat", "created": 1593643484, "retrieved": 1632845832, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 408, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fwpbp0m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hjkymk/my_phd_defense_is_tomorrow_and_im_both_excited/fwpbp0m/", "text": "My best advice was to a young man who was beginning to establish himself in the workforce: When you have no strength in your arms or legs left to fight - Bite them in the face!\n\nYou went this far.
