  "title:": "I am just incapable of finding words at this point. < Rant about grandiloquence in the social sciences >",
  "text": "I don\u2019t know if anyone who studies in social sciences/humanities experiences this but I\u2019m truly getting fed up with my field. Anthropology is really getting to me, my passion for this subject is slowly deteriorating, not that it was necessarily strong to begin with. The overuse of academic jargon is really starting to annoy me. I am completely used to academic jargon at this point so it\u2019s not even that I can\u2019t understand it, but it is so unnecessary half the time and makes it so inaccessible to the average person. My degree is taught in English at a Flemish University and I feel so bad for the Flemish students who have to read this sh* t in their second language. English is my first language and sometimes reading these assignments just confuse the living hell out of me. Why do I need to reference a dictionary for half the words on a page? Why use some of these words in lieu of a simpler one that conveys the exact same meaning? Whenever I try to write any work to be submitted why am I struggling to find words to properly convey my thoughts? Maybe it\u2019s because my mind is filled with all these f***ing niche words that no one outside (or inside) of this field uses or knows what it means. I really feel like my progression is being stunted at this point. This is ridiculous!",

      "text": "I started grad school while living with a journalist and it was a really interesting contrast. Journalism is not without it's flaws of course, but compared to social science it seems like a lot quicker and more accessible way to accomplish many of the same goals. No months long IRB process before interviewing for each topic and no jargon encouraged in the results - just get out there and ask whoever whatever and try to make sense of it in a straightforward way. I'm almost positive she learned more and made more of an impact in her time in a \"beat\" spent on a topic (eg homelessness) than a social science researcher would in the same time period, at least on a local level. \n\nI get so frustrated when my committee tells me my writing needs to be more \"professional\" in tone, when this essentially translates to inaccessible. I get using certain key words but it seems like they just want, as you say, grandiloquence",

There is a world of difference between the two with the latter having people that tend to only pepper their writing and speech with jargon, and only when the jargon is functional.  I'm actually the odd man out in my cohort because I still use so much jargon, but I  do have a penchant for theory and philosophy.  \n\nI don't know if others have noticed this but I find most of the jargon has subjective interpretations that can vary so much that they functionally just seem to be buzzwords when people use them (i.e. neoliberalism).  I will say though that I kind of like jargon, it helps express complex ideas or concepts quickly (not all the time, though),  but I've been making a habit to just be more descriptive when writing and speaking on \"academic\" topics.",

They'll throw around terms like \"elasticnet\" that would confuse the public at large and make themselves sound super smart to a layperson but without really knowing what's underlying the term \"elastic net\".

To use your example of the elastic net, we could decompose it into smaller and smaller concepts but eventually we'd still have to use words like 'objective function', 'optimise'/'minimise'/'maximise', 'parameter', 'absolute value', etc., that taken together don't mean much to most lay people, who don't necessarily have the background required to even understand why we're trying to optimising a function or what estimating parameters means (even if they knew what that meant).\n\nWith that said, again I'm 100% on board with the idea that we should be able to decompose those ideas. I think there's a big, endemic problem in my own field (linguistics) that people don't and often can't define simple concepts like 'subject' and 'pronoun' because they're intuitive enough for them for the languages they work on. And the result is that the meanings of these terms can change over time and in different ways in different regions and research traditions, usually without people being consciously aware of it. (There is a certain research tradition that loves redefining terms to confuse outsiders, but that's a separate issue.)",

The jargon is itself easy to pick up anyway so it's not a real issue. Writings in French, Chinese, and what I've seen in Japanese are pretty straightforward as well. However, I've heard from a professor that German papers can get pretty intense; at one point apparently some German linguists believed that if you write too simply, you're insulting the audience. I don't know any German so I've never had this problem lol.\n\n*However*, the overlap with anthropology is another matter. I've had a class where we had to read some ling anth papers and some of them were cool, but some were really. brutal. I'm looking especially at Michael Silverstein and his students. I don't think it's a 'big words' thing or even a jargon thing though. It's just the way they structure their sentences and organise their paper etc. I'll have to force myself to read some more stuff by Agha (a student of Silverstein) because it's close enough to my research, wish me luck lol.",

What kinds of sociocultural variation do they exhibit? What variety of things do people do with varieties of money? How are activities involving money differentiated into registers of money conduct in specific times and places? How are specific forms of money conduct recognized and differentiated from other cultural routines by those who encounter them? It has long been understood that money is intimately linked to varied forms of discursive semiosis through which distinct forms of money are created and endowed with distinct use characteristics; that specific forms of money are readily linked to (or appropriated by) group-specific interests or ideologies; and that differences in types of money conduct readily differentiate social roles and relationships among persons and groups in social history. Yet the role of discursive semiosis in the existence and use of money is not well understood, a lacuna that links most descriptions of \u201cmoney\u201d to voicing structures (or discursive positionalities) that are not grasped for what they are by those who offer such descriptions (e.g., \u201cspeaking like the State\u201d without knowing it). This article clarifies the role of discursive semiosis in the social life of money. It shows that such clarification is a prerequisite on ethnographic answers to the questions listed at the beginning of this abstract. It presents a comparative framework for reasoning about forms of money in forms of life.",

More recently, one is expected to borrow some kind of theoretical framework from outside the discipline (sociology is popular) to be accepted. These two trends, one dying, one emerging, are the main reasons behind the problem of unnecessary language in my field. The issue with the former is scientific language is not good at describing music, and the issue with the latter is that most musicologists don't have enough training in other fields to be able to credibly apply them to music.",

      "text": "This definitely is something tied to what researchers within a discipline declare is valuable. I distinctly remember taking a seminar related to the literature around military strategy during my masters. About half the class were history students and the other half political science students. The history students focused mostly on how authors use specific examples to support theories, and how context informed the authors. The political science students, meanwhile, dived deep into the literary side of strategic writing and the theories behind it. This different approach often led to arguments where the historians would ask the political science students to give specific, tangible pieces of proof that their theory (which they just spent 15+ minutes discussing with jargon laden terms) actually applied. The political science students, meanwhile, often dismissed the historians' arguments as simple-minded and too narrow.   \n\n\nTl;dr the historians wanted empirical evidence, the political science students wanted broad frameworks.  \n\n\nI am admittedly grateful I am in history because I despise overly dense text and needless abstract theory.  think one of the reasons history isn't as bad for jargon is because there are a lot of academic historians who also write for the general public, who wouldn't have the same background in the theory. Many historians also used ot follow specific schools explicitly, but this practice has somewhat fallen out of practice by the early 2000s in favour of \"I will study x topic and incorporate ideas from y authors.\" I may also  just be lucky that my supervisor despises inaccessible writing.",

I think it's important to write in an accessible way and to encourage more public engagement.

My writing has gotten better with every short sentence and common word. The problem isn't with Anthropology, it's with academia in the 90s and early 00s and I swear the stuff coming out now is readable by a human.\n\nIt's something my cohort and i discuss alllll the time, and we keep each other in check. If you're struggling with your writing, don't be afraid to dumb things down. If you don't feel comfortable with a word (say, biopolitics or ontology or whatever) just footnote it and say \"this term has been used in many different ways in the literature. I'm using it here to mean xyz\". And remember that The Bad Writing Contest exists.\n\nHave hope! And if you don't like reading something just put it down, skim it, read the abstract and a review, and go chill out. My point is that most scholars would agree with you and the ones who wouldn't just have different tastes. Is all good.\n\nEdit: Basso! I fucking love him. Also Tsing. And  Willerslev.

It's so intense and you have to read so many dumb old white dudes who think they're the literal shit. When I was doing my masters I had a habit of just yelling at professors. One notable moment was during our Foucault class when we were just questioning everything, hardcore postmodern relativity wankfest and I just yelled \"So are we all stuck in the fucking Matrix then?\" And stormed out. I almost dropped out because I was so disappointed in anthroplogy and the fact that we were being forced to read dumb crap full of theory and not enough actual ethnographic work of the 21st bloody century. It was also as it happens finally the year that I did find something to love about anthroplogy and decided to do a PhD (after two years off to earn some money mind you). The thing I loved was finding my niche (multispecies work, anthroplogy of place and environment, linguisitic anthroplogy...). Try to find your niche and treat the other stuff as boring piffle. I never have to reference Clifford, Malinowski, geertz, levistrauss, bourdieu, foucault etc now. They're not relevant. BYE BOYS \n\nNow that I'm doing my PhD I'm still livid on a regular basis about the crap that's labelled important and I have to be familiar with BUT without that cluster fuck cocktail of a master's being incredibly demanding on your time and mental energy, and incredibly not-independemt in terms of what you read, I'm so much happier. I'm taking my time to read when I can, and when I do have compulsory readings I have the confidence to determine if I'm into it enough or not.\n\nWhat am I trying to say...... Basically, what you're saying sucks about anthroplogy does suck. It sucks big time. I guess what I'm trying to say is just also that there are academics and writers who care about accessibility a lot, care about the applicability of their work. \n\nSo I've decided for my own sanity to let those who want to waffle on about the meaning of the word \"sensory\" to do so, because Anthropology is a big ship and there's a berth for all of us. And we, the legible ones, are doing important work. \n\nEnd of rant. I'm just super mad about exactly what you're mad about and I couldn't agree more and I want more people like you in the discipline and I'm scared this experience now is going to make you want to kick it to the curb.

Chop it up into smaller, simpler sentences, allow for some redundancy.\n\nI recall reading in an HN comment that a good way to explain something in a technical manual is to repeat it three times as in \"I shall now explain The Thing.

Someone in a higher SES will be more likely to comment on symbolism, appreciate the symmetry or style of brush strokes, whatever, because they've been conditioned to think more abstractly and \"read between the lines.\" This is in turn informed/structured by economic and social position.\n\nWhat I don't like about Bourdieu is that it's like shopping at theoretical Costco. You can't just pick and choose certain items, you gotta buy the entire package. It's a helpful and empirically verifiable theory, but it's a behemoth that demands conceptual monopoly.",

I was pretty taken aback by this whole thread (particularly appearing in an academic sub) so I didn\u2019t really formulate a coherent response. \n\nI definitely get that some texts are hard, particularly critical theorists and all that. But the humanities often takes the hit as seeming like \u201cgibberish\u201d when someone like Foucault\u2019s theories are highly thought out and researched. Complex topics and engaging with critique of complex structures sometimes leads to complex and confusing texts. Now on one hand I get and agree with the sentiment that academics should try to make their texts as readable as possible, but I find it wild that a group of academics will just say \u201cthis is too hard so I don\u2019t find value in trying to understand it.\u201d Like that\u2019s what we do as academics, engage with intellectually challenging research and pursuits. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, what one might consider \u201cgibberish\u201d often changes depending upon knowledge base.

I'm from the humanities and some of my work has some overlap with the social sciences, though I have some STEM background, and I think that the humanities papers I find to be deliberately obfuscating are *way* harder to read than papers from the STEM field that I only have an undergrad background in, or in the social science field that some of my work overlaps with (even though I don't have a formal background).\n\nI have never needed to read Foucault or anything remotely related to his work (maybe funny considering that my work also heavily uses the word 'discourse'), so I can't speak to his writing, but my current pet example of writing that's close to gibberish is [Silverstein (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271530903000132). He has sections discussing Brown and Gilman (1960) as well as Labov's New York City experiment, *which I'm familiar with*, yet I am completely stumped when I try to read Silverstein's discussions of these studies. And when I read [Eckert (2008)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9841.2008.00374.x), which builds on Silverstein (2003) and is extremely well written, I instantly understood what Silverstein's main idea was. Considering that I am familiar with the literature that Silverstein was citing, and that I had no trouble understanding literature that cited Silverstein, I think I have good reason to believe Silverstein was making his writing needlessly and deliberately obfuscating.",

My work itself is largely quantitative but I am totally aware of the qualitative work that went into establishing categories, generating hypotheses etc that I build on and sometimes have to do myself. However, there's nothing about qualitative research that makes it necessary to present it in a convoluted way. Martin Haspelmath is an example of a purely qualitative researcher who has crystal clear writing (and had a great influence on me).\n\n> Additionally, on your use of Silverstein as an example, you say yourself that somebody was building upon that previous text, so there was use in it however it was presented.

He presented a new way of interpreting data from some previous studies without presenting new data and that's fine; I'm just saying that his presentation was unnecessarily complicated and unclear, frustrating even. I don't think the issue is with the idea being new. I've read other writings from both Silverstein and Eckert and I think it's clear that Silverstein writes to confuse the reader while Eckert writes to elucidate.\n\n> Overall, I\u2019ll say though that I understand academics can sometimes over complicate work in order to make things seem more complex and \u201cAcademic.\u201d But I think we should be wary of just using this as a blanket explanation for anything that is challenging.\n\nSure, but I don't get the sense that this is what's happening in this thread.",

That includes writing simple sentences: maybe the nouns are some weird mathy terms, but the syntax is easy to process. That was definitely not the case with reading Foucault. I reread sentences like 20 times, and still couldn't figure out what the syntax was. \n\nAt some point I decided it was a waste of time, I just couldn't parse his sentences. So I decided it was a better idea to look at other people writing *about* Foucault --I can judge the ideas they write on their own right, even if the ideas were a misrepresentation of Foucault. (And usually they *are* interesting ideas!)\n\nE: Sorry for making this even longer, I just thought of an example to make my point clearer: Marx's Capital. It's a very dense book with many subtle arguments that take time to grasp --especially for someone outside political economy. But his writing is clear, I can read Marx and then discuss my confusions with people. That is the difference to Foucault.
