The political science students, meanwhile, dived deep into the literary side of strategic writing and the theories behind it. This different approach often led to arguments where the historians would ask the political science students to give specific, tangible pieces of proof that their theory (which they just spent 15+ minutes discussing with jargon laden terms) actually applied.
