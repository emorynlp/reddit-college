  "text": "I just began my first year of my M.A. and accompanying TAship and I was wondering: did you request to receive copies of your letters of recommendations upon applying? I overthought it and decided to check \"no\" in my application as to not seem like I was doubting the quality of my references - even though I wanted to read them and was not sure they'd know either way. I've since regretted this decision solely due to my own curiosity and have found myself wondering if I missed that boat and will just never know what they said. Is it too late? Is there any way of requesting access to them at this point without sounding weird? Honestly, I just think the validation factor could be helpful for me.",

          "text": "Yeah, but if a professor is comfortable letting the students see the letter, they will typically offer it to the student during the application process, despite the fact that the student waived the right. Waiving the right did not prevent the professor from offering it anyway.\n\nSo asking after the application process is over could easily put the professor who wrote the recommendation in a very awkward position. If the professor says no at this point, that's going to create more anxiety about what's in the letter with the student then if they had not asked.\n\nBest just to let it go and stick with what the student agreed to when they requested the letter. That would be the professional thing to do.",

              "text": "I dunno, I think it depends on the relationship with the professor. As a professor, I don't always offer, but I will offer if I know the student could really use the confidence boost.  So if a student asks afterward, I have no problem sharing, because I said what I said, and I don't tend to write letters where people wouldn't know what's in them anyway -- I give a lot of student feedback directly.\n\nSo sure, if you don't know the professor well, maybe don't ask and assume that since you got in, the letters were fine. But I wouldn't recommend students go to people they don't really know well to ask for letters of recommendation in the first place, unless they absolutely need to, because the point is to ask someone who has a good idea of your strengths and weaknesses.",

And they're all going to have anxiety about what the letters say unless they see it.\n\nSo I always give students a copy of the letter after I submit it. As I don't write letters of recommendation for students I can't recommend. \n\nThat being said, once the student has waived the right to the letter, I do think it inappropriate for them to ask.",

It's not like I deny others the ability to see it, just sometimes they don't seem that interested in knowing. I've offered to send people their letters and they've specifically said they don't really care to know. So I don't make a big deal about it either way.",
