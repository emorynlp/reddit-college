I overthought it and decided to check \"no\" in my application as to not seem like I was doubting the quality of my references - even though I wanted to read them and was not sure they'd know either way. I've since regretted this decision solely due to my own curiosity and have found myself wondering if I missed that boat and will just never know what they said. Is it too late? Is there any way of requesting access to them at this point without sounding weird? Honestly, I just think the validation factor could be helpful for me.", "author": "xoxo_angelica", "created": 1631678913, "retrieved": 1632844550, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcy09ox": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/poir5x/reading_lors/hcy09ox/", "text": "I mean, you can always just ask, since the application period is over.
