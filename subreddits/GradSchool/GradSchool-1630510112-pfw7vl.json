  "text": "Instead of continuing this upcoming semester, I\u2019ve decided to drop out. I\u2019ve been going through a lot with my health and mental health, as well as realizing my program wasn\u2019t what I thought it would be. I feel so relieved, but now I\u2019m stressed about how others will perceive my decision (I know I shouldn\u2019t truly care). \n\nI haven\u2019t told any of my friends or extended family yet and I\u2019m terrified. They were all so proud of me. I was to first in my family to pursue a Master\u2019s. I talked about this program non stop prior to starting and I\u2019m afraid that everyone is going to see me as a quitter or a failure. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell anyone. I don\u2019t have any solid plans at the moment. I do have a job, but it\u2019s not sustainable so I will be looking.\n\nEDIT\n\nThanks for all of the support! I know that I made the right decision for myself. My close family have all been supportive of my decision. This was not a quick or easy decision and I have been considering dropping out for about 3 months. I\u2019m glad that I was able to recognize what was or wasn\u2019t good for me and make a decision that I know is very scary for a lot of us. \n\nA little more info on my decision to withdraw:\n\nOther than the personal health and mental health issues which played a part in my decision, I felt that my program was a disappointment. Due to the pandemic everything was online last minute and the adjustment was a struggle for my peers and professors. It seemed that education became a second thought to some of my professors. \n\nI was doing very well in my classes, but I also realized that I quickly started to lose interest. I was excited about grad school but I believe a big reason I applied was because I felt that I \u201cshould\u201d go to grad school and I wanted the title, rather than truly wanting the further education. \n\nI decided that it was not worth continuing with something that was negatively affecting my health, something I was no longer interested in, and receiving a poor education during a pandemic that would also put me into debt to continue.",

It was scary and hard, and I am still recovering mentally and physically, but it was the best decision! I know it may seem hard to do right now but I hope you can find happiness knowing that you accomplished this feat. I was worried that my family and friends would be disappointed in me, as I am a first generation college student, but instead they were ecstatic that I was coming home and proud of me for putting myself first.  I already have a job kinda in my field and will continue my MS online through a different program. When one door closes\u2026so many more can open!",

You\u2019re not just dropping out for no reason or because you\u2019re lazy, you have a genuine reason why you are choosing to take another path in life right now. The people around you will understand. \n\nI dropped out back in 2019 because I was majorly burnt out after my Bachelors and didn\u2019t realize just how badly I was. Combine that with a teacher who made my life hell that I couldn\u2019t avoid classes with, advisors who set me up with a research project I had very little interest in, and being newly married and 500 miles away from my new husband, I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Taking care of your mental health and doing what is genuinely best for *you* as a person instead of trying to do what you think other people want you to do is always the right choice.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe someday in the future you will look at another school and decide to go for your degree there instead. Just because you dropped out once doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a permanent decision.",
