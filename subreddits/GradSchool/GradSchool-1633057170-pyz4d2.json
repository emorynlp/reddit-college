  "text": "This situation isn't my own but a friend brought it to my attention (names changed for confidentiality)\n\nSo my friend Brynn was friends with a girl named Kelly. So Kelly isn't the best student, received two write ups for professionalism, and overall doesn't care about the program or being an SLP. She believes with her experience as a substitute teacher she should be the one teaching the class. Anyways Kelly contacted Brynn asking to reference her assignment since Kelly claimed to be undergoing a lot of stress. Brynn kindly sent her assignment to Kelly and Kelly ended up turning in Brynn's work as her own. The professor who is also the program director gave them both 0s on the assignment and Kelly is scheduled to meet with the academic integrity panel since the professor is worried she is faking competencies. What is likely to happen to Kelly? She hasn't been caught plagiarizing before but she's had disciplinary write ups in the past. Will she be removed from the program or just fail the assignment or course? Kelly also confessed to cheating to the professor/program director and described it as a \"moment of weakness\" and that she needed the guidance of her classmate then when she read it she felt inspired.",
