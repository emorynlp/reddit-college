  "text": "Tomorrow I defend my MSc that has taken me just over 2 years to finish. Always thought I didn\u2019t have imposter syndrome, but rather i just really didn\u2019t understand my field well enough for the program or to pass this defence. Realizing now that this is EXACTLY what imposter syndrome is. Here\u2019s hoping tomorrow goes well - and to anyone else who feels like they are not smart enough to be in grad school\u2026 you are!",

A colleague of mine wisely pointed out that \u201cto be good at this, you have to enjoy feeling stupid\u201d - I.e. not quite understanding what you are dealing with in research.  If you fully understand your subject then you aren\u2019t stretching yourself (or by extension humanity).  \n\nFor me IS faded far and deep once I got a bit of peer recognition - and now it is an old friend that comes \u2018round once in a while, not a looming cloud of worry.",
