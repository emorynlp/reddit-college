And I don't really know how else to explain to her that just because she's done at 5, doesn't mean *I'm* done at 5 and if I'm still on my laptop with earbuds in, it's not the time to chat.

More meetings because it's now easier to just grab someone who's online.

Office supposed to process my visa closed, but the office that nitpicks on my budget use is somehow still fully operational.\n\nSince January, supposed to come in at 0830 every day to \"show the world that our university can fully operate\", but most service desks still wouldn't process my shit. Meetings begin 0900 but co-op (the only reasonably close place where I can get a snack) opens 0930 (used to open 0830 because school starts 0845 for undergrads).\n\nPresident restructured our org and that cost us a deal with a national laboratory (I'm not in the US). In terms of \"org ops obligations\" I got transferred from infrastructure to educational content, effectively ending my career as a computer science researcher.\n\nIt isn't just the students.
