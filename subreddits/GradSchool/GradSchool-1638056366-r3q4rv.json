  "text": "Finishing up my CV for my PhD application due in a couple of days. I'll have a manuscript published in the next few weeks, so unfortunately that means my only publication as of now is a 250 word abstract, in which I am listed as a corresponding author. Is this appropriate to include on my CV?\n\nAdditionally, my recommenders have made sure to mention my in-progress manuscript in their letters, but should I notify the schools once that is formally published? If so, how?\n\n\\- A PhD hopeful with zero guidance :)",

(Or will give?)\n\nIf so: I think the abstract maybe shouldn't go on your CV, but the presentation definitely should!\n\nMy impression is also that this is a relatively uncommon thing that most disciplines/conferences/journals don't do. Most commonly there's just no direct connection between conference presentations and journal articles. Some conferences in some fields publish full papers from conferences as \"Conference Proceedings,\" which are essentially the same as journal articles.\n\nBelow are some more informed previous threads on this more specific issue. Sounds like opinions are varied and some folks do feel like this is worth including on a CV, but clearly marked in its own section.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/bp4b8e/is\\_a\\_published\\_abstract\\_considered\\_a\\_publication/](https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/bp4b8e/is_a_published_abstract_considered_a_publication/)\n\n[https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/54087/could-a-paper-thats-just-a-title-and-abstract-be-listed-as-a-publication-in-cv](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/54087/could-a-paper-thats-just-a-title-and-abstract-be-listed-as-a-publication-in-cv)\n\nIdeally, you might find some other folks working in this specific field and chat with them about how they handle this on their CVs.",
