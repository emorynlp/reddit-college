  "title:": "Friend isn\u2019t understanding of grad school demands?",
  "text": "I am in a healthcare grad school program. Our days on campus are 9-5 and then many hours are spent studying after for practicals, exams, etc. I don\u2019t have much free time. I also have a boyfriend and a family who are high priorities to me.\n\nI have a friend for many years, who just graduated college and has a lot of free time. She\u2019s been going out & partying a lot. It seems like we are at different points in our lives, which is fine, but she often makes me feel guilty for being so busy.\n\nIn the past, I could see her many times a week, but these days, once every few weeks is feasible. I see other friends similar amounts and there are no problems. However, this friend texts me incessantly about making plans sometimes texting 2 or 3 times in a row to make the plans if I don\u2019t answer. Basically, she is making me feel guilty and giving me anxiety. If I mention how busy I am, she talks about how busy her retail job is. \n\nHow do I make my friend become more understanding about the demands I am under from school right now? Or, should I distance myself more and figure she will never change?\n\nTLDR: friend guilts me for not hanging out as much as she\u2019d like, because my program is so demanding, what should I do?",

      "text": "Have you directly brought it up to her? Like next time you hang out, say, \"hey friend, I'm really glad you want to hang out with me so much and I really wish I could hang out more, but unfortunately because of grad school, I'm just too busy to go out as much as I used to.\" You can't just say things about how busy you are and expect her to read between the lines.\n\nAlso, it's not clear from your post, do you feel guilty about it just because she texts you a lot? Or does she specifically say things to guilt trip you? There's a big difference. Maybe she isn't mad about it but texts a lot because she figures if she texts less, it'll be even less likely for you to make plans together. But if she's saying stuff like \"you're not really my friend because you don't hang out with me enough,\" that would be manipulative and you should tell her it makes you feel bad. People make mistakes when they're feeling hurt, but if you point out that it's not cool, a good friend would try to stop doing it.",

          "text": "I have brought it up directly to her.. probably a few times but I feel as if it's not \"sinking in\". So I guess I feel guilty for a few reasons.. she will text me repeatedly, but she has said things like \"I'm so upset, I feel like I never see you anymore.\" or \"I've been trying to make plans repeatedly and you aren't getting back to me, I'm getting frustrated\" Statements along those lines. Which I guess makes me second guess my boundaries and availability even though I feel as if I've been being true to myself and my schedule.",

      "text": "I have a pair of very dear friends who have more free time than me. What ends up working for us is having a standing meeting time---every week during the summer, every month during the semester---so that there's always something on the calendar for when we'll hang out next. This means that they aren't feeling too neglected by me and I can plan around them in advance.",
