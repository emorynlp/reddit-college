After grading the first lab I've had multiple people email me disputing their grades or asking to resubmit. The other section's TA, who graded harder, has not had this same issue.\n\nIs this a female thing? \\[Other TA is a male + male dominated field\\]\n\nShould I provide less feedback so they don't try to dispute every point lost?\n\nI'm trying to be fair, so any advice appreciated. The professor only provides coarse direction on how to ascribe partial credit. The quality of some of these lab reports has been low, and I feel like I've been extremely generous. I am frustrated.\n\nThanks.",

Give them feedback so they can do things differently next time. If someone genuinely found a mistake (it's happened to me), give them those points back, but otherwise stand your ground. \n\nI think the way to approach teaching is to pretend to be a hardass and then be nice later. It's way easier than being really nice and then having to put your foot down later. If you do your job and grade fairly and give them feedback, but they don't use that to do better next time, it's not your problem.",

When I used to be the grader my most important rule was to be fair in the grading. Some students put in a lot of work to get the best grade possible and it isn\u2019t fair for others to get those points without having to put in any effort. \n\nTo be honest though, TAing kinda sucks. It\u2019s a lot of hours and a lot of stress at some points. I\u2019ve made way too many mistakes as a TA, but that\u2019s just how it goes sometimes. I wouldn\u2019t overthink things; students are worried for their grades and it\u2019s understandable. I just wish they would understand that grad students do care for their success and want them to do well and be prepared. We don\u2019t just care about our research we have a responsibility.\n\nOh about the feedback. If your writing walls of feedback on their reports then that may be too much. Concise feedback is best and if they are confused about something or don\u2019t understand something they should talk to you in person or email.",

      "text": "Hehe here's a funny story for you. When I started TAing for my current class, the prof sent me examples of some feedback/grading by his previous TA (male). My TA involves giving feedback + grading on first drafts of lab reports and revision submissions. Anyways, this one student turned in a very bad paper for the first draft, I made shit ton of comments for him to improve, and he submitted the very same paper again for his final submission (prob bc the prof makes me grade them VERY generously). So I didn't know what to write in his revision feedback because obviously I can't just say \"hey you did no changes whatsoever\" so I looked at this former TAs examples. He wrote to one student something like \"you could've implemented more changes\" and I copied that sentence to this student's feedback. When I sent the feedback and grades to the professor, he sent me a long response, about that sentence, saying that while he understands that I come from a more straightforward culture, American students might be offended for a comment like this. And he made me change that sentence to something like \"I believe that you can def improve your paper even more...\" I didnt tell the prof anything but I talked to his former TA, who's also his grad student. He was like \"ofc he is extremely sexist and you're a woman, don't you know you are supposed to be nicer\" I legit did not know haha I alwsys loved my \"mean\" female professors, it never occured to me that they were expected to be nicer but it did make me realize a lot of things... \n\nSo yes, it's a female thing. \nStand your ground as much as possible. Don't let them walk all over you. Because they absolutely will lol",

      "text": ">Should I provide less feedback so they don't try to dispute every point lost?\n\nNo. Feedback provides two purposes: to let students know why you took off points, and to CYA in case of a grade dispute. \n\nPeople are going to dispute grades, and I would imagine being female in a male-dominated field plays a role in how much they think they can get away with, but my approach when a student wants to dispute their grade is to ask them what about my feedback was unclear to them. If they have a specific question, I'd be happy to clarify why I took off points so they can understand. They should be able to articulate clearly and concisely why they think their answer, *as written*, requires full points. What they *meant* doesn't count because I am, unfortunately, not a clairvoyant. \n\nI always use rubrics, and students have access to these ahead of the assignment submission deadline, so that also helps. I also have a policy that, if a student feels very strongly that their assignment was graded incorrectly, I will be happy to regrade it with the caveat that I will regrade the *whole* assignment so their grade may be higher but it may also be lower if I find a mistake that I missed before (since we're all human). I also require them to acknowledge via email that they would like the assignment regraded this way. I do make a point to be fair, so I will wait a few days to regrade it so I'm in a more neutral mood and not influenced by the annoyance of having to regrade an assignment. The number of times I've actually had to regrade, however, is very low. \n\nIf they are unhappy with their grade and just want a \"do over\" and resubmit, I just say that is not possible. To improve their grade, they should go over written feedback and do better next time, but students are not allowed to resubmit work until they get the grade they want. The class has a schedule and ain't nobody got time for that. \n\nIf you are worried about differences between TAs in terms of grading, you could do a T test to see if there are significant differences between the two of you. A 3-4 point difference doesn't seem like it would be statistically significant, but maybe it is.",
