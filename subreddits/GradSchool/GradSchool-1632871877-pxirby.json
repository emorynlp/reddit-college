When I started TAing for my current class, the prof sent me examples of some feedback/grading by his previous TA (male). My TA involves giving feedback + grading on first drafts of lab reports and revision submissions. Anyways, this one student turned in a very bad paper for the first draft, I made shit ton of comments for him to improve, and he submitted the very same paper again for his final submission (prob bc the prof makes me grade them VERY generously). So I didn't know what to write in his revision feedback because obviously I can't just say \"hey you did no changes whatsoever\" so I looked at this former TAs examples. He wrote to one student something like \"you could've implemented more changes\" and I copied that sentence to this student's feedback. When I sent the feedback and grades to the professor, he sent me a long response, about that sentence, saying that while he understands that I come from a more straightforward culture, American students might be offended for a comment like this. And he made me change that sentence to something like \"I believe that you can def improve your paper even more...\" I didnt tell the prof anything but I talked to his former TA, who's also his grad student. He was like \"ofc he is extremely sexist and you're a woman, don't you know you are supposed to be nicer\" I legit did not know haha I alwsys loved my \"mean\" female professors, it never occured to me that they were expected to be nicer but it did make me realize a lot of things... \n\nSo yes, it's a female thing. \nStand your ground as much as possible.

If they have a specific question, I'd be happy to clarify why I took off points so they can understand. They should be able to articulate clearly and concisely why they think their answer, *as written*, requires full points. What they *meant* doesn't count because I am, unfortunately, not a clairvoyant. \n\nI always use rubrics, and students have access to these ahead of the assignment submission deadline, so that also helps. I also have a policy that, if a student feels very strongly that their assignment was graded incorrectly, I will be happy to regrade it with the caveat that I will regrade the *whole* assignment so their grade may be higher but it may also be lower if I find a mistake that I missed before (since we're all human). I also require them to acknowledge via email that they would like the assignment regraded this way. I do make a point to be fair, so I will wait a few days to regrade it so I'm in a more neutral mood and not influenced by the annoyance of having to regrade an assignment. The number of times I've actually had to regrade, however, is very low. \n\nIf they are unhappy with their grade and just want a \"do over\" and resubmit, I just say that is not possible. To improve their grade, they should go over written feedback and do better next time, but students are not allowed to resubmit work until they get the grade they want. The class has a schedule and ain't nobody got time for that. \n\nIf you are worried about differences between TAs in terms of grading, you could do a T test to see if there are significant differences between the two of you.
