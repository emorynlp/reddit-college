This might sound trivial but his experiments haven't been working well for a while and it made him really nervous because he feels like he's disappointing his professor and the other members of his lab look down on him. When I came to see him at his place (his meeting were online), his breaths were short and he kept obsessing with the time, saying something like \"30 minutes more\". Close to the time the meeting should have started, he checked the email and his professor told him that the meeting is postponed from the morning to the afternoon.\n\nHe broke down crying.\n\nHe asked me why he couldn't function, why he's not able to do things like other people, why he's wired differently (referring to his anxiety).\n\nHearing all that broke my heart. He's one of the brightest and smartest person I've ever known. His knowledge are far and broad and he's always excited to share them, his eyes would light up whenever he has something new to share. The fact that grad school could make someone as bright and excited about knowledge as him to be a person who's questioning if he's smart enough to study is just so sad...\n\nIt may be a wishful thinking but I really hope this awful no-fail-whatsoever culture in academia would stop. Grad students are just, well students. We are learning and we will definitely fail a lot, some more than others. The failures might be our own doing but sometimes things just don't work even after we all do the right things and this will happen to anyone. I wish a lot more people would be more understanding to that.\n\nAnd to the others who are nervous about anything grad-school related and/or think you are good enough: I see you. The fact that you're in the program means that you ARE good enough. And please be kind to yourself and others", "author": "roseleaf8926", "created": 1601014427, "retrieved": 1632953830, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 412, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g7rmnwx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/izecsv/just_something_i_would_like_to_share_here/g7rmnwx/", "text": "As you said: you're learning and you will definitely have ups and downs in your research. It's just inevitable. But, it is important not to let our emotions rule our life. Why does your bf feel like he's disappointing his professor? Is it what he thinks? Did his professor tell him that he is disappointed?  It is important to differential these two scenarios. Often, our thoughts are not correct. We assume something and feel really bad about it, but it doesn't mean it corresponds to the reality. Maybe his professor is not disappointed since he knows that research is not straightforward. I would suggest that your bf talks to professor and explain his concerns and figure out a solution together. We usually can learn a lot from our failures, but we need to change our perspective. It is helpful to see what is not working and to understand why it is not working. It can give us idea what we can improve and how to make something working. That's how research works.  \n\n\nSometimes we need to take a short break, relax, do something else, and come back to the problem later. Often, we get to understand it better and come up with a solution easier. I am sure your bf is smart and good enough, he just got stuck and need to find his way out.
