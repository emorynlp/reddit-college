  "text": "I\u2019m in undergrad with a communications major and a minor in legal studies, seeking an eventual career in arts administration (working with development for an arts non profit like the state symphony or art museum). I hope to go to grad school because I just really love school and it would of course give me an edge in the hiring pool, but I\u2019m already taking out student loans just to get through undergrad and I don\u2019t know how to tell if getting my Master\u2019s degree will pay off. What made you decide to go to grad school, and how will I know if it\u2019s the right choice?",

Then through that experience, you'll develop a more precise career plan and know what graduate degree would best suit your needs.",

You can also try talking to folks in these types of careers to see what type (if any) graduate degree was necessary or beneficial for them.",

      "text": "I was introduced to a professional sector of my field that was unfamiliar to me, and I decided to go get my masters when I realized that new sector combined a lot of discrete ideas I loved but never figured out how to combine. Now four years later, I realized that the ideas were always the most exciting part for me, and I've decided to go pursue them in a PhD because I enjoyed the research and teaching prospects more than any actual commercial applications. A huge part of that decision involved talking to professionals in multiple sectors. When conversations with people in private practice left me annoyed but talking to academics got me excited, I listened to those feelings.\n\nAs for knowing the right choice, that's on you. My limited advice is learn about your emotional, financial, and other needs, and then assess how different paths will impact those as best you can.",
