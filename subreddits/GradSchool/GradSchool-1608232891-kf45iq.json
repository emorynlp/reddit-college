I knew what I was good at (physics and math) and which subjects i enjoyed (music). But it wasn\u2019t so clear what I wanted to study or what name I wanted after \u201cbachelor in...\u201d\n\nAfter college, I worked in the audio industry for close to 10 years as a product designer. I did a lot of engineering work designing audio products. But i never enjoyed it. So now I\u2019m in grad school pursuing a degree in acoustics. \n\nThe thing is that I didn\u2019t know academia is what I truly love. If I had went on to grad school after undergrad, I would\u2019ve been lost. For me, taking some time off from school helped me to determine what I wanted to do in life. \n\nI find that going from high school to undergrad to grad doesn\u2019t give you enough opportunity to find what you are passionate about. \n\nI\u2019d say you should get a job after masters. Don\u2019t let that experience discourage you from academia. Perhaps your work experience might inspire you to study more. \n\nSchool is just a tool. It\u2019s not the end of everything. If you need education to pursue what you love doing, that\u2019s when you need academia", "author": "Relatively_Curious", "created": 1608241024, "upvotes": 34}, "gg6dge2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kf45iq/is_it_ok_for_grad_school_to_feel_like_a_means_to/gg6dge2/", "text": "Absolutely it's ok to feel that way. Not everyone wants to be in academia. While I don't have any data, I think the majority of people don't want to go into academia but it's just not emphasized. Many people pursue advanced education to further their career goals and that's okay.\n\nI'm also in the same boat regarding wanting to get the hell out and live my life. Although I do like my research and would like to continue doing research, I don't actually enjoy being in grad school.

While I kinda find my research cool, I'm definitely not as interested in research or publishing or anything like that compared to my peers. I felt really bad about being so apathetic towards grad school, but someone in this sub gave me pretty good advice: just treat grad school like a job. Do the amount of work it requires to get by, clock out at 5, try not to think of it on weekends, etc. As someone once said to me, you're not the first person to feel this way about grad school & certainly not the first student that your supervisor has had that feels this way.

People talking about research are probably PhD students, whose degrees are also a means to an end in that they hope to land a job in academia or research.
