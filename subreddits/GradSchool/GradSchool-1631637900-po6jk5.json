It took a couple years of school to teach me that sacrificing your happiness for another degree is just not worth it. If you have extra time, take that extra time to finish. If you can work part/full time while going to school, give it a try. Even if you need to take a semester off, I'd look at your options and just consider what you could do if you weren't in school and weigh that against the benefits/drawbacks of both continuing and stopping before making any decisions.   \n\n\nHang in there!
