  "title:": "Differences between Undergrad and Grad school",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm a grad student and wanted to share some of the things that I noticed between undergrad and grad school for any new students who are starting grad school soon and don't know what to expect.\n\nOne of the main differences I've noticed is the expectations that professors have for students. This makes sense because grad schools are very selective and want to choose the best students based on performance in undergrad. In my program, we had a mandatory attendance policy where you can't miss more than two classes. We also have to achieve higher grades than undergrad; it's not enough to pass the course, in my program we needed to get at least a B in all classes to stay in the program.\n\nI also noticed that students have stronger relationships with professors. In undergrad, I remember a lot of people were intimidated or scared to speak to professors. I think because grad school has smaller classes and because you usually end up doing a large research project (thesis, dissertation) with professors, that makes it easier to form those student-professor relationships.\n\nI also think that grad school is generally better at preparing students for their careers. In my program, we are constantly practicing our skills (I'm in a counselling program) and we also have to do a two-semester practicum. I know many other grad program provide some kind of work experience/internship. I think because the grad programs are generally more specialized they are better at preparing students for specific careers. \n\nIf you're in a grad program, feel free to share your own thoughts about the differences between undergrad and grad programs! I also created a short video about some more differences between these programs if you are interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bBs2twTNxE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bBs2twTNxE)",

For anyone reading this, these are just my experiences, and different programs/schools may look differently",
