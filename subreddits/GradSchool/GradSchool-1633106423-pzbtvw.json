  "text": "Recent undergrad graduate and first grad semester here. \n\nI'm studying full time (that comes with some fieldwork to do) while doing a part time job. I recently got an offer for a full time job that I am willing to take. \n\nThe problem is that the job will affect the fieldwork portion of one of my courses. I'm planning on talking to my advisor soon. If I withdraw, will the \"W\" mean anything on my transcript?",

      "text": "It won't affect your GPA at all.. The W just means a withdrawal to anyone who looks at your transcript. If you go for a PhD, you may get asked why you withdrew from the class which you have a valid reason for. As long as you don't have a lot of them, I don't think you'll have an issue.",
