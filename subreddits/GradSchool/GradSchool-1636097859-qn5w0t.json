  "text": "I am 28, and recieved my Bachelor Degree in a creative field in 2017. \n\nSince graduating, I have worked within my industry (theatre) and built a strong profile and portfolio of work.\n\nThis is the third year I've applied for the same highly competitive postgraduate arts degree in my field, and not been accepted. I have been shortlisted twice in my last two attempts, but I am facing down my third rejection for the same course. Each time I have interviewed and submitted practical assessments to showcase my ability; consulting with previous alumni who have mentored me in my application.\n\nThe university does not offer feedback for applications, as it is a prestigious institute - the university is considered something of a career maker where I am from. \n\nI am really feeling crestfallen that after another intense application, and two interviews, I am again at a loss with no feedback.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar experience of trying many years to get into a postgrad? What made the difference for you?",

          "text": "Absolutely.\n\nThe degree itself is highly specialised, and there are two other schools in my country that offer an equitable alternative in terms of the specific qualification and course opportunities. \n\nIn the past, I have applied to two other schools in my country with similar degrees, and have similarly been shortlisted and had good feedback. This year I switched it up by only applying to the one school, as the application process for each school is rigorous. \n\nThere are several more universities in my country offering a postgraduate degree in the field that is more generalise in the field, that I will be pursuing next year, as well as some international institutes - but I do not think I can afford an international postgraduate opportunity.\n\nI am a firm believer that its the student, not the university or college, that makes the most of the course they pursue - but the valuable feedback from this post is highlighting that my actions, in terms of casting a VERY small net, aren't congruent with my beliefs.",

          "text": "You are very correct! I appreciate from the feedback that I've created a situation where its one uni or bust, and although I have previously applied to two similar universities with similar degrees, and enjoyed more feedback, its probably time to let go of the dream of doing this VERY specific degree at a uni that is known mostly for its clout in my field, due to the exclusivity of the opportunity. \n\nAs stated in another reply, its definitely time to apply to several more schools if the most important thing to me is postgraduate study - even if casting a wider net could mean a more generalised degree with less of a reputation in my field, at another school.",

I also don't have a lot of feedback and that has been the most difficult part. I feel like I could improve on my research project and actually have a shot. Instead, I keep losing the spot to people who already had relationships with the faculty.\n\nSo yeah, nothing helpful to say, but hang in there! You are doing your best.",
