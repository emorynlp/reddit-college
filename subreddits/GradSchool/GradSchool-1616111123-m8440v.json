I can say that Graduate School can be one of the best or worst experiences of your life.\n\nLet me just say that just because people have a Ph.D. does not mean that they are good supervisors/mentors/advisors or even good people.  I had a professor in my first MA program who tried to sabotage me by pairing me with the worst performing students in the class just so he could watch me struggle to complete a group project by myself.  He told me he did this on purpose while laughing at my tears when I went to talk to him about their lack of work and their habit of plagiarism.  I found out later after I graduated from another faculty member in the department that he did this because I would often challenge him with peer-reviewed research that demonstrated the wrongness of his opinions and his bias.  He apparently didn't like that.  He wanted everyone to fawn over how intelligent he was (he had just got his Ph.D. and felt insecure).  The main problem was I had done research and presented at professional conferences when I was an undergraduate on the topic he was teaching on.  The professor actually yelled at me once in class for quoting my own research in his class, especially when he tried to challenge me on using it and I told him that it was a conference presentation at a conference he himself applied to present at and got rejected.   I only found this out when I told some people who I met at the conference and became friends with about his behavior to get emotional support.  I can't tell you how horrible it is to have a professor yell at you and berate you like you're a bad kid in a class full of your graduate student peers.  The people I was venting to choose proposals for this conference.  I still laugh that I could do as an undergrad what he couldn't do with a Ph.D.  I can't tell you how good it felt to curse him out in front of the entire department the day after I got my diploma.   I don't regret this at all.  He was such an insecure asshole.  That was the happiest I was the entire time I was in that program.  I could finally tell him everything I thought about him without having any undue consequences.  A few professors in that program actually told me privately that they thought I was awesome for doing what I did and secretly wanted to say the same things to him (of course they have their academic career to think about so I understand why they didn't).  I hated this program.  The material was good but this professor was my advisor both for academic concerns and thesis (he was the only person in the department that was the expert in one of the topics of my thesis) and it was a bitch to try to graduate when a faculty member literally tries to make your life absolute hell.  I literally had to stay an extra year in graduate school for thesis because he kept requesting me to make changes and then would request me to change it back to the original.  I eventually went to the chair and showed him all the things he was asking me to do and the chair took his spot on my committee and I successfully defended.\n\nCounseling was something that interested me but frankly I don't want to spend my time talking to other people about their problems because I'm required to diagnose in most settings I would be required to work in with an MA due to insurance.   To be honest, diagnosis is just another way to marginalize and label people who are different as dysfunctional.  It's horrible and I refuse to be a part of that shit.  Plus I refuse to do the work to process my own trauma... its painful so why in the fuck would I want to relive it and process it?  Yeah, that processing stuff is good but it isn't something I will ever have the desire to do (I say let the painful shit go and move the fuck on and live your life).  The program was awesome though and so were the faculty... they let me be myself and question everything and were very encouraging.  I felt like the faculty really tried to accommodate me which I greatly appreciate.  I really enjoyed my time there and everything I learned.  I am honestly a much nicer person because of my experiences.  I feel like I gained a lot of self-knowledge too... so I definitely don't regret being in the program at all.  It definitely helped me prepare for a Ph.D. program.  So I hate the field of counseling but loved the program.  It's just sad it took until I was at practicum and internship to realize this, but better late than never.  I don't regret my choice to leave... my advisor really tried to convince me to stay which was very touching.  Leaving was the right thing for me and I'm not ashamed that I did what was right for me.  :)\n\nPhilosophy is a better fit... I'm so happy about my choice.  Studying value theory and social and political philosophy is going to be so much fun!  They actually like students who challenge them.\n\nBasically I say what you put in a graduate program is what you get out of it.  Just try to be nice to everyone and fall in line... sometimes that is the easiest way.  Do your own shit and research on your own time... knowing when to shut the fuck up is very helpful advice for a blunt person like me.  You get along until you can graduate and then you can do what you want.  If I could go back to my first MA program I would have told myself this.\n\nHowever, I would say if you realize that something isn't for you (sometimes you have to try something to realize this), then cut your losses and get the fuck out.  I would have told myself this if I could go back... I would have saved myself a few semesters in my second graduate program... I had doubts for a long time about staying but I kept trying to convince myself it was better to just stick it out and graduate.\n\nBottom line... never give up your integrity.  Do what is right for you in all things.  That is the best thing I can tell you.", "author": "Counseling_grad", "created": 1616139813, "upvotes": -1}, "grggsnt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/m8440v/so_is_anyone_actually_enjoying_graduate_school/grggsnt/", "text": "Mixed emotions tbh.

Prior to COVID, yes I honestly loved graduate school, and I am very much looking forward to loving it again in the fall. As you say, yeah, I got to spend my time studying exactly the topics I loved at an advanced level. Was it challenging? Absolutely, I failed one of my final exams (a first for me) - but I still felt like I learned an immense amount from that class, to say nothing of the process of routinely reading academic papers and meeting with my advisors to discuss them. Just wow, I really was learning a ton!\n\nSince COVID, I really feel like I've been in stasis. I've been taking and passing classes but, between the classes generally being made easier and less demanding with work-from-home (timed exams became take-home exams or even just projects, deadlines were loosened and extended, etc) and everything for the past year being a dull gray blur in my mind, I really feel like my progress, both specifically towards my dissertation and generally towards \"academic enlightenment\" have significantly slowed. My advisors have also been extremely lenient and understanding in light of everything - and while I'm extremely thankful for that, between not getting slapped around by them and generally not having any motivation since I'm generally just home by myself all day, I feel like what little research I've actually done has really stalled.\n\nSo that's all to say, I think if you're starting this fall, you're going to love it or hate it exactly as much as you would in any other \"normal\" time.
