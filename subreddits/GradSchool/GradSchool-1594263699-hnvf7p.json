It felt great. \n\nHilariously the last two weeks was just having to wait for my advisor to figure out how to digitally sign a document after reviewing my post-defense edits. How someone can supervisor a dissertation but not know how to sign a PDF is beyond me. \n\nr/GradSchool I'm not sure I can quit you, but I'm sure as hell gonna try.", "author": "well---actually", "created": 1594263699, "retrieved": 1632845870, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 383, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fxghrvm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hnvf7p/officially_100_finished/fxghrvm/", "text": "Congrats Dr.!!!!", "author": "artofsanctuary", "created": 1594325112, "upvotes": 1}, "fxfhvt4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hnvf7p/officially_100_finished/fxfhvt4/", "text": "Stick around and provide motivation and guidance to the next group.", "author": "Lord_Blackthorn", "created": 1594308146, "upvotes": 2}, "fxfcemq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hnvf7p/officially_100_finished/fxfcemq/", "text": "Congratulations!", "author": "MasterofRevels", "created": 1594305377, "upvotes": 1}, "fxejkei": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hnvf7p/officially_100_finished/fxejkei/", "text": "Congratulations :-)", "author": "justincuss123", "created": 1594283025, "upvotes": 1}, "fxecchr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hnvf7p/officially_100_finished/fxecchr/", "text": "Congrats!!!!!!", "author": "ccupcakesrfun", "created": 1594276212, "upvotes": 2}, "fxe8dlp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hnvf7p/officially_100_finished/fxe8dlp/", "text": ">\nHilariously the last two weeks was just having to wait for my advisor to figure out how to digitally sign a document after reviewing my post-defense edits.\n\nYou'd think Docusign would be a well used tool-- esp by now  lol\n\n\nHuge congratulations, btw!", "author": "luna_Quix", "created": 1594272902, "upvotes": 5}, "fxe6x0r": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hnvf7p/officially_100_finished/fxe6x0r/", "text": "Now I'm kinda jealous lol.\n\nI defended 2 weeks ago and my edits have been approved by the examiners but the examination report has to go to the university graduate studies board to have the results officially confirmed.
