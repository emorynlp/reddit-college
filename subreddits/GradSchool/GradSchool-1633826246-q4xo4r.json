  "text": "I've been lurking this board for awhile, wanting to post, but have been nervous to do so. And I'm not sure what I am looking for in posting - I guess maybe some support, some way to get some of these feelings out, because I feel alone.\n\nI've struggled with my mental health for a long time - depression has been especially prevalent lately. I am in a great graduate program, and am thankful to be here. And yet I am struggling so much, to even keep myself fed and bathed, and alive, let alone complete my work. Concentrating is difficult, then I become so frustrated that I end up just not doing anything at all, laying in my bed scrolling social media for hours on end. I put things off til the anxiety kicks in, then I panic and feel physically ill, or else just completely numb out. I feel like I am not even alive anymore. And my will to live feels nonexistent. In a word, I am exhausted. \n\nI've already used up my medical leave time in this program. I've considered leaving, but it would have to be for good. And I don't want to leave, because this is what I wanted, and I know somewhere deep within myself, I still do want this. I am also terrified to leave because I feel I have nothing else going for me in my life, professionally or personally. The years of my life continue to pass by, and I don't want to give up the one thing I feel I have going for me.\n\nAgain, I am not sure what I am seeking. I am just feeling especially exhausted, afraid, hopeless, defeated, and alone tonight. Any thoughts you have to share, I'd love to hear them.",

      "text": "Dear friend - I have been there. Many of us have. You are not alone. \n\nI recommend going to a counselor. I first went to one on campus and then moved to a private one off campus. I got on Lexapro, and I know some people hate drugs, but it helped me a lot. \n\nThere's a lot of bullshit with grad school and academia in general that is f*cked up. It will change over time, but this is they way it is. If you're already prone to depression, you're at higher risk in this environment. \n\nGo see a counselor.",

      "text": "This is very much what I\u2019ve been experiencing. All of the feelings have been building up. It sucks and it\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it too. Today I had a bit of a breakthrough that maybe will help you. I have been struggling with getting homework done but obviously it needs to get done. I got to this point of frustration and crying. Feeling so negative and wanting to give up on everything. Then I thought - it doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, it doesn\u2019t even need to be good, I don\u2019t need to put 100% effort in, I just need to put in some amount of effort. I got part of my assignment done, even if something that could\u2019ve taken 30 mins took me days of mental anguish and phone scrolling breaks while working on it. I did a piece. I feel better. And I\u2019ll do another piece tomorrow. Just do a piece. Then rest and be proud of yourself.\n\nEdit to add: this is an intense time of transition. Be as kind to yourself as possible. I hope you feel better soon. Feel free to reach out.",

Mental health issues are extremely common in graduate school, as it\u2019s an environment that can exacerbate existing conditions. Treatments such as medications can also become less effective over time. Best of luck to you.",
