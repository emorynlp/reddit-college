My work is interesting. Not groundbreaking, but interesting. My advisor is spectacular. My group is great. I passed my candidacy exam this summer. I'm funded as a TA and frankly I love teaching.\n\nBut I'm overwhelmed with nothing in particular. Not two weeks ago I broke down crying while trying to cook dinner, because I let the rice boil over. I felt a rush of emotion like nothing I've ever felt before. And thank goodness I've been reading this subreddit because my breakdown was both terrible and liberating: terrible because I couldn't shake the feeling of my inadequacies, and liberating because I know that I'm not alone. I've read the posts on here and thought, \"no, that couldn't happen to me. I'm happily chugging along toward my degree! I've got a supportive network of friends outside of academia, and I'm confident in my abilities as a researcher.\" But it did happen to me, 5 years in.\n\nSo I want to say two things to those of you on /r/gradschool. First, *thank you* for being open about your struggles. It validated mine before I ever knew I needed it. Second, this post might serve as a grim reminder that you might not be out of the woods yet, no matter how close you are to your degree. But even if the pressure gets to you, even if you find yourself doubting your abilities, understand that you're not alone, and that your struggles are valid and real, and that the odds are good that you'll be able to power through it and get that sweet, sweet piece of paper!", "author": "its-been-a-decade", "created": 1603316656, "retrieved": 1632846454, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 278, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g9n2ufh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jfmelk/five_years_in_and_its_gotten_to_me/g9n2ufh/", "text": "You are almost at the finished line.
