I have loved science and the brain since I was 9 years old. Every answer to \u201cwhat do you want to be when you grow up\u201d has been consistent...\u201dscientist\u201d. \n\nI am completely torn. After my masters thesis and all of the experiments leading into it, I don\u2019t know if I am burned out or if I have lost my passion for research. I\u2019ve thought about quitting at least 3x a week since last semester. I don\u2019t even know what I would do outside of graduate school. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve lived in a fishbowl since 2017. \n\nI\u2019m also an officer in the Army Reserve, have been offered full-time jobs in units I have been in. As a graduate student I make roughly 22k a year, if I were to do the Army full time I\u2019d make 93k a year. I\u2019ve always declined though since money was never the priority. Knowledge, contributing to science, and truth have always been what I had envision as a kid, and what I\u2019ve worked for since I was 18. However, it seems that the scientific community isn\u2019t as romantic as I had envisioned. There is bias that you would not expect; there are cover ups; and the worst I have learned; greed, it is as if the pursuit of science is not discovery or knowledge but rather political, finding or twisting evidence to fit a certain narrative to gain money - the very thing I couldn\u2019t care less about. I admit I have been very naive in this regard as I know funding is imperative, but even after thinking about this in depth, it makes me want to break up with science.\n\nDuring C19, I\u2019ve noticed just how out of touch all of the faculty are with the real world. How it seems they eat, sleep, and breathe science, and although I love it, it just doesn\u2019t seem like I love it as much as they do. \n\nAre there any quotes or ideas any of you could share with me regarding this? I can only think of one, Marcus Aurelius - meditations, where he discusses everyone has a role to play in society, and that we should do it with 100% effort, dedication, and service. \n\nHow do I know if this is my role?

Maybe not the most relevant timeframe, but this post really struck me for a number of reasons so I wanted to chime in on the discussion.\n\nLike you, I always wanted to be a scientist - the wonder of discovery and understanding the world around me always piqued my interest in ways that other experiences did not.  I love teaching and I always wanted to work in academia from roughly 9th grade.  Went right into a PhD program in Physical Chemistry after undergrad and left after about 4.5 years.  Here are a few of my reflections over the past 10+ years:\n\n1)  Academic research is not at all a romantic endeavor.  You say it doesn't seem romantic and indeed it is not.  It's dictated by funding, bias, and politics.  Even government acquisition projects/R&D is dictated by these facts.  It's inescapable.  You might have great ideas, but if they aren't funded ideas they aren't going anywhere.  Hearing from a couple of Nobel Laureates has convinced me that a large amount of revolutionary discovery is mostly serendipitous.  For example, the chemists who discovered the materials that are now utilized for organic photovoltaics basically goofed a reaction and happened to study it rather than throw the flask in the trash.  If you have the equipment/funding for novelty, most PIs are fiercely attached to their theories, methods, and projects are loathe to venture outside of those confines.  I wanted to do some wild nonlinear four-wave mixing experiments and didn't receive any support.  If you work for a young faculty member, then you are just one of the cogs in their machine to get tenure and they will be playing all the Department/Faculty games to get that sweet, sweet tenure.  Older faculty spend a lot of time traveling and going to conferences and presenting your work.  Government projects for the military are dictated by election cycles rather than long-term strategy.  All this being said, even though this makes academia seem like a terrible environment it is one of the very few places where you get to \"choose your own destiny,\" so to speak.  It is way less driven by corporate requirements \\*COUGH GREED COUGH\\* than actual industry jobs and you often get to teach and mentor students which is it's own reward for those who enjoy doing that (personally, I LOVE teaching).  \n\n2)  If you go active duty you will never do anything remotely as interesting as cutting-edge neuroscience.  Period.  You may have more digits in your bank account, but the majority of your time will be spent doing mindless administrative tasks.  You will also encounter a disturbingly similar mindset to academia -- whereas academics want you to eat, breath, and sleep your projects, the military will want you to do the same with the military.  This is especially so if you are an officer.  It's basically expected that you let the military consume your life.  Personally, every time I do some BS administrative work as an active duty officer it makes me die a bit inside.  My job essentially exists at this point to facilitate my hobbies and outside-of-work activities.  Is that type of trade-off worth it for you?\n\n3) You need to establish boundaries, balance, and long-term goals for your life.  Boundaries in the sense that you don't allow your work (be it military, your graduate project, etc.) to consume your entire life to the detriment of your relationships and everything else.  Balance in the sense that you need to work on your health, maintain hobbies and relationships, and rooting out any type of toxicity in your life.  The long-term goals will help you identify if \"the suck\" that you're experiencing is worth it for a few years.  If you finish your PhD, you'll pretty much be locked into working within that discipline for the rest of your life and will be expected to get more experienced with age.  Ask yourself if this endeavor is giving you the skills you really want to possess.  I find myself thinking about grad school again on occasion (how I stumbled across this post) now that I'm older and I've identified what type of research \\*actually\\* stimulates my mind.  There's nothing wrong with switching projects, labs, schools, or even paths in life if it helps re-vector you towards your goals.\n\nFeel free to reply or DM me if you have any comments.

I\u2019m going to retell it in a way that dates me. \n\nRemember your first album?  How you played the whole thing over and over. Listened to every word, every hook, every bass line? You read the album cover, all the art, all the quotes the band included. You delved into the album with all your being.\n\nThen one day you woke up and thought, I really like the A side more than the B side (yep, back when you had to turn the album over). So you\u2019d just listen to the A side. And you stopped caring about the album cover and trying to memorize the lyrics because you knew them already. \n\nThen as more time passed, you realized there was really just two songs on the album that you really loved. You\u2019d just play those two songs over and over and over. \n\nUntil one day, it was too much effort to pull that album out of its cover just for 2 songs. You\u2019ll hear them on the radio or something. You could go months without hearing a song from that album and your life wasn\u2019t any less rich. \n\nYears passed and when one those songs played, you\u2019d think fondly on that album and the hours you spent learning and loving it. That time in your life would come flooding back. Friends you\u2019d listen with, events that were inextricably linked to that music.\n\nGrad school burns us out because it teaches us that we are NOTHING if we aren\u2019t scientists. And you better throw yourself into it with all your being and devote yourself to nothing but the grad school gods. Money? Who cares about that? Not us! We are ALTRUISTIC SCIENTISTS! If we cared about money, we\u2019d do something else! And we are so easily brainwashed because we LOVE the science.\n\nBut it\u2019s not true and it\u2019s not healthy. Getting your PhD has little to do with intelligence. It\u2019s the perseverance in the face of shit work and professors completely out of touch with the real world. \n\nYou follow your heart - you live this life once and only YOU can answer for your happiness.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you about me: 6 years of grad school, 5+ years of postdoc, and now 6 years in industry later and I am the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. I make over $200k, I lead a team of fantastic scientists and we are changing the face of medicine. \n\nLike you, I wanted to quit so many times. I stuck with it because I grew up so poor, I promised myself I\u2019d never be homeless again, I wouldn\u2019t need food stamps, I\u2019d do whatever it takes. And, I was more than a little unhealthy and brainwashed about the whole thing. But it worked out for me and I\u2019m SO glad I stuck with it. I am living my truest life now.\n\nIf your decision takes you away from science, so be it. Maybe one day you\u2019ll see a blurb about a neuroscience paper and think fondly of those years you spent living and loving science. \n\nIf you decide to stay, don\u2019t fall for the brainwashing. Find a way to do things for YOU outside of the lab. Don\u2019t LET yourself burnout. Remember the time you spend doing things outside lab actually ensures your long term success.

I was bummed out at the realisation that my PI was an awful person and I had more or less signed up to be a scientist out of the desire to contribute good to humanity. I also found out that it is very easy to be diverted ever so slightly from what you're actually interested in & instead have your focus be directed to stuff you don't care at all about, and that could last 20 or 30 years until you become a PI & steer back towards your true interest again, but of course that would depend on getting the grants to fund your projects of interest... And during those decades of trying to get some research freedom, if you're not working 70 hours per week for 40 hours of pay, you'll be treated like trash, never get a contract renewed, & be without a good reference to try working with another group. The upside being that your friends will think your job is really cool & people are impressed when they hear what you're working on, if you care about those things, which everyone says they don't, but I think most do. \n\nPersonally, once I lost motivation, being disciplined became much more difficult. I knew the whole thing would be a struggle forever, basically. After more than 10 years in a row at university, I left about a year from finishing my PhD. Unlike you, I didn't have a side job or a plan B, so I was a bit lost. But let me tell you, the feeling of uncertainty becomes a non-issue in comparison to the immense relief. I was in a kind of shock for a couple weeks, but the stress relief gave way to happiness and within a few weeks everyone was telling me how noticeably happier and more optimistic I was looking and acting.\n\nIt takes a lot of bravery to recognise that it's time to make a huge change in your life and to act on that recognition. It isn't weakness to leave a program that no longer serves your desired destiny - a destiny that changes as you do. An awful lot of people cannot recognise when something isn't working, and even most that do don't have the guts to pivot in an entirely new direction. Most people in your program who want out don't have the courage or the belief in themselves to pull the trigger, so they'll stay and suffer, just like how most of your childhood friends probably never found the courage to move out of their home town to experience a better adventure. They'll be miserable inside while they get their PhD, then they'll do a postdoc which is more of the same, then they'll become like every other overworked and underpaid academic that looks like their spirit has been sapped from their body. Or not... But my point is, leaving is an empowering move, not a weak move, in my experience.\n\nWhatever choice you make, if you aren't happy with where you find yourself, it's up to you to fix it. Nobody else will do it for you.\n\nAlso, it will all be ok in the end.

Remember, that we can always return to academia in future times when the grass might be greener. People master out all the time, and return to complete their PhD even decades later after obtaining success and finding practical applications to their skillset outside of academia. I think in our current job market, you should not view a PhD (even in STEM) as a career-building degree but as a valuable and unique life experience.\n\nI sense you also come from a non-traditional background. I come from poverty and rural America, and mistakenly saw academia as a means of obtaining a stable and intellectually rewarding life. Just outlining my experience: I obtained a B.S. in Neuroscience from a R1 institution, I have several publications in high-impact journals that have more than 400 citations, a host of references in which I still maintain research correspondence with; and I have had almost no success in grad apps. I do not say this with any bitterness towards academia, but because I have grown to learn that careers outside of it are not so bad: It is not at all shameful to leave a passion if you cannot reasonably live a good life, and move towards opportunity and grow new passions where that opportunity is. Most academics come from financial security, can weather the instability that comes with academia, and have been insulated their whole lives from poverty by their parent's assets. In many of them, I have noticed a common sentiment in which they devalue or even deeply resent when other people make decisions for monetary reasons. As I have learned more about their background and upbringings, I believe a crucial part of their identity (academics from non-working backgrounds) is to differentiate themselves from the overly-financial attitude of their family members and peers. Because of this, they are heavy-handed with criticisms of making decisions for financial reasons, and simultaneously ignorant of the fact that those sort of decisions are not made by most people for greed, but for survival.\n\nI used to also be of the popular impression that academia sucks, but it is worth it to the individuals who are the most passionate about their subjects of investigation or the process of investigation. That story is a white lie which is simply spouted by PIs and university admins towards the passionate people they exploit. What I used to view as a troubled field full of passionate individuals has not changed; It still is a field full of some of the most talented, gritty and incredibly self-motivated individuals I have ever met, trying to create something new out of nothing. But, in my experience, the ones who have the greatest success are not necessarily the most talented or the competent. More often, they just seem ruthless and shameless enough to exploit the plethora of non-scientific aspects of academia.\n\nI don't mean to be overly angsty, but academia is no different from any other career, in which the paths to obtain success and prestige are tightly controlled by an established elite. A laboratory can persist for decades and even have tremendous success by abusing the grant funding process, manipulating data, abusing researchers, and most importantly: engaging in cartel-like behavior to reduce real competition among established researchers and to gatekeep the field from new entrants. It is true that you will find similar behavior in the C-suite of every field. What seems to be unique to academia is a culture, from the top all the way to the bottom, which is wholly ignorant of their abuse, and a work environment entirely devoid of oversight. I think this is from toxic positivity: they would rather believe they are all self-empowered individuals part of something beautiful-- than recognize the exploitation and deception they are unknowingly victimized by. But hey they've never worked another job in their life so they have no idea what a normal healthy work environment looks like. The most forgivable reason academia is toxic is because it's participants are sheltered from the real world.\n\nIn my personal experience, a great deal of calmness and a new sense of meaning can come from recognizing that people are more important than science. If we engage in science so narrowly as to completely disregard the people taking part in it, what is the point?\n\nThis is a Marcus Aurelius quote on religion and the afterlife, but I think it is just as useful to interrogate your own motivations and desires in life when it comes to pursuing abstract goals.\n\n\u201cLive a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.\u201d\n\nI would suggest you try picking up these books.

She's recently been promoted to E7.\n\nI know there are a lot of issues within academia, and especially STEM, but my experiences with the military are far more common than they are rare.
