  "text": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m a Neuroscience PhD Student (26F) and am in my 2-3 year. I have loved science and the brain since I was 9 years old. Every answer to \u201cwhat do you want to be when you grow up\u201d has been consistent...\u201dscientist\u201d. \n\nI am completely torn. After my masters thesis and all of the experiments leading into it, I don\u2019t know if I am burned out or if I have lost my passion for research. I\u2019ve thought about quitting at least 3x a week since last semester. I don\u2019t even know what I would do outside of graduate school. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve lived in a fishbowl since 2017. \n\nI\u2019m also an officer in the Army Reserve, have been offered full-time jobs in units I have been in. As a graduate student I make roughly 22k a year, if I were to do the Army full time I\u2019d make 93k a year. I\u2019ve always declined though since money was never the priority. Knowledge, contributing to science, and truth have always been what I had envision as a kid, and what I\u2019ve worked for since I was 18. However, it seems that the scientific community isn\u2019t as romantic as I had envisioned. There is bias that you would not expect; there are cover ups; and the worst I have learned; greed, it is as if the pursuit of science is not discovery or knowledge but rather political, finding or twisting evidence to fit a certain narrative to gain money - the very thing I couldn\u2019t care less about. I admit I have been very naive in this regard as I know funding is imperative, but even after thinking about this in depth, it makes me want to break up with science.\n\nDuring C19, I\u2019ve noticed just how out of touch all of the faculty are with the real world. How it seems they eat, sleep, and breathe science, and although I love it, it just doesn\u2019t seem like I love it as much as they do. \n\nAre there any quotes or ideas any of you could share with me regarding this? I can only think of one, Marcus Aurelius - meditations, where he discusses everyone has a role to play in society, and that we should do it with 100% effort, dedication, and service. \n\nHow do I know if this is my role? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Full-time officer in the USSF who left a PhD program in chemistry in 2014 at 27 yrs old.  Maybe not the most relevant timeframe, but this post really struck me for a number of reasons so I wanted to chime in on the discussion.\n\nLike you, I always wanted to be a scientist - the wonder of discovery and understanding the world around me always piqued my interest in ways that other experiences did not.  I love teaching and I always wanted to work in academia from roughly 9th grade.  Went right into a PhD program in Physical Chemistry after undergrad and left after about 4.5 years.  Here are a few of my reflections over the past 10+ years:\n\n1)  Academic research is not at all a romantic endeavor.  You say it doesn't seem romantic and indeed it is not.  It's dictated by funding, bias, and politics.  Even government acquisition projects/R&D is dictated by these facts.  It's inescapable.  You might have great ideas, but if they aren't funded ideas they aren't going anywhere.  Hearing from a couple of Nobel Laureates has convinced me that a large amount of revolutionary discovery is mostly serendipitous.  For example, the chemists who discovered the materials that are now utilized for organic photovoltaics basically goofed a reaction and happened to study it rather than throw the flask in the trash.  If you have the equipment/funding for novelty, most PIs are fiercely attached to their theories, methods, and projects are loathe to venture outside of those confines.  I wanted to do some wild nonlinear four-wave mixing experiments and didn't receive any support.  If you work for a young faculty member, then you are just one of the cogs in their machine to get tenure and they will be playing all the Department/Faculty games to get that sweet, sweet tenure.  Older faculty spend a lot of time traveling and going to conferences and presenting your work.  Government projects for the military are dictated by election cycles rather than long-term strategy.  All this being said, even though this makes academia seem like a terrible environment it is one of the very few places where you get to \"choose your own destiny,\" so to speak.  It is way less driven by corporate requirements \\*COUGH GREED COUGH\\* than actual industry jobs and you often get to teach and mentor students which is it's own reward for those who enjoy doing that (personally, I LOVE teaching).  \n\n2)  If you go active duty you will never do anything remotely as interesting as cutting-edge neuroscience.  Period.  You may have more digits in your bank account, but the majority of your time will be spent doing mindless administrative tasks.  You will also encounter a disturbingly similar mindset to academia -- whereas academics want you to eat, breath, and sleep your projects, the military will want you to do the same with the military.  This is especially so if you are an officer.  It's basically expected that you let the military consume your life.  Personally, every time I do some BS administrative work as an active duty officer it makes me die a bit inside.  My job essentially exists at this point to facilitate my hobbies and outside-of-work activities.  Is that type of trade-off worth it for you?\n\n3) You need to establish boundaries, balance, and long-term goals for your life.  Boundaries in the sense that you don't allow your work (be it military, your graduate project, etc.) to consume your entire life to the detriment of your relationships and everything else.  Balance in the sense that you need to work on your health, maintain hobbies and relationships, and rooting out any type of toxicity in your life.  The long-term goals will help you identify if \"the suck\" that you're experiencing is worth it for a few years.  If you finish your PhD, you'll pretty much be locked into working within that discipline for the rest of your life and will be expected to get more experienced with age.  Ask yourself if this endeavor is giving you the skills you really want to possess.  I find myself thinking about grad school again on occasion (how I stumbled across this post) now that I'm older and I've identified what type of research \\*actually\\* stimulates my mind.  There's nothing wrong with switching projects, labs, schools, or even paths in life if it helps re-vector you towards your goals.\n\nFeel free to reply or DM me if you have any comments.  This was a bit rambling, but hopefully you got something out of it.",

I am considering leaving my PhD program, mastering out, and going into the private sector with the hope of eventually achieving a government job. My field is archaeology and for awhile I thought I wanted to be a professor doing great research throughout my home state and training the next group of archaeologists. Sadly I have found that view further and further away from my reality. While it's not necessarily a good position to be in, it makes me happy that other people are dealing with it too. I am currently working through my semester finals but I am saving this for later. Thanks for the post.",

      "text": "I heard a great Ted talk that sums up the grad school culture and how it leads to burnout. I\u2019m going to retell it in a way that dates me. \n\nRemember your first album?  How you played the whole thing over and over. Listened to every word, every hook, every bass line? You read the album cover, all the art, all the quotes the band included. You delved into the album with all your being.\n\nThen one day you woke up and thought, I really like the A side more than the B side (yep, back when you had to turn the album over). So you\u2019d just listen to the A side. And you stopped caring about the album cover and trying to memorize the lyrics because you knew them already. \n\nThen as more time passed, you realized there was really just two songs on the album that you really loved. You\u2019d just play those two songs over and over and over. \n\nUntil one day, it was too much effort to pull that album out of its cover just for 2 songs. You\u2019ll hear them on the radio or something. You could go months without hearing a song from that album and your life wasn\u2019t any less rich. \n\nYears passed and when one those songs played, you\u2019d think fondly on that album and the hours you spent learning and loving it. That time in your life would come flooding back. Friends you\u2019d listen with, events that were inextricably linked to that music.\n\nGrad school burns us out because it teaches us that we are NOTHING if we aren\u2019t scientists. And you better throw yourself into it with all your being and devote yourself to nothing but the grad school gods. Money? Who cares about that? Not us! We are ALTRUISTIC SCIENTISTS! If we cared about money, we\u2019d do something else! And we are so easily brainwashed because we LOVE the science.\n\nBut it\u2019s not true and it\u2019s not healthy. Getting your PhD has little to do with intelligence. It\u2019s the perseverance in the face of shit work and professors completely out of touch with the real world. \n\nYou follow your heart - you live this life once and only YOU can answer for your happiness.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you about me: 6 years of grad school, 5+ years of postdoc, and now 6 years in industry later and I am the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. I make over $200k, I lead a team of fantastic scientists and we are changing the face of medicine. \n\nLike you, I wanted to quit so many times. I stuck with it because I grew up so poor, I promised myself I\u2019d never be homeless again, I wouldn\u2019t need food stamps, I\u2019d do whatever it takes. And, I was more than a little unhealthy and brainwashed about the whole thing. But it worked out for me and I\u2019m SO glad I stuck with it. I am living my truest life now.\n\nIf your decision takes you away from science, so be it. Maybe one day you\u2019ll see a blurb about a neuroscience paper and think fondly of those years you spent living and loving science. \n\nIf you decide to stay, don\u2019t fall for the brainwashing. Find a way to do things for YOU outside of the lab. Don\u2019t LET yourself burnout. Remember the time you spend doing things outside lab actually ensures your long term success. Find similar allies - either peers or mentors - they\u2019ll help to remind you: we are human beings, not human doings.",

      "text": "I felt basically the same as you after a similar amount of time in a similar field. I was bummed out at the realisation that my PI was an awful person and I had more or less signed up to be a scientist out of the desire to contribute good to humanity. I also found out that it is very easy to be diverted ever so slightly from what you're actually interested in & instead have your focus be directed to stuff you don't care at all about, and that could last 20 or 30 years until you become a PI & steer back towards your true interest again, but of course that would depend on getting the grants to fund your projects of interest... And during those decades of trying to get some research freedom, if you're not working 70 hours per week for 40 hours of pay, you'll be treated like trash, never get a contract renewed, & be without a good reference to try working with another group. The upside being that your friends will think your job is really cool & people are impressed when they hear what you're working on, if you care about those things, which everyone says they don't, but I think most do. \n\nPersonally, once I lost motivation, being disciplined became much more difficult. I knew the whole thing would be a struggle forever, basically. After more than 10 years in a row at university, I left about a year from finishing my PhD. Unlike you, I didn't have a side job or a plan B, so I was a bit lost. But let me tell you, the feeling of uncertainty becomes a non-issue in comparison to the immense relief. I was in a kind of shock for a couple weeks, but the stress relief gave way to happiness and within a few weeks everyone was telling me how noticeably happier and more optimistic I was looking and acting.\n\nIt takes a lot of bravery to recognise that it's time to make a huge change in your life and to act on that recognition. It isn't weakness to leave a program that no longer serves your desired destiny - a destiny that changes as you do. An awful lot of people cannot recognise when something isn't working, and even most that do don't have the guts to pivot in an entirely new direction. Most people in your program who want out don't have the courage or the belief in themselves to pull the trigger, so they'll stay and suffer, just like how most of your childhood friends probably never found the courage to move out of their home town to experience a better adventure. They'll be miserable inside while they get their PhD, then they'll do a postdoc which is more of the same, then they'll become like every other overworked and underpaid academic that looks like their spirit has been sapped from their body. Or not... But my point is, leaving is an empowering move, not a weak move, in my experience.\n\nWhatever choice you make, if you aren't happy with where you find yourself, it's up to you to fix it. Nobody else will do it for you.\n\nAlso, it will all be ok in the end. If it isn't ok, just remember, it isn't the end.",

I explained what I was doing and she said:   \n\n\n\"Dumber people than you have gotten this fucking degree!\"   \n\n\nWhich was weirdly exactly what I needed.  I ended up staying and finding a rhythm that worked really well for me. The other thing I'll say is that there's always the private sector.  Having a PhD goes a long way in landing interviews.  Just because you're in school now doesn't mean that's what you have to do for the rest of your life. I genuinely hope you figure out what's best for you and make that decision because only you know what the right decision is.",

Pushing back against the exploitive aspects of academia does not mean you\u2019re not passionate about what you do. It means you want a healthy balance in your life. That should be normal! With that said, the pressure of not following the examples being set for you can be very strong, and it can be leveraged against you if you\u2019re not productive \u2013 and of course, productivity expectations can be unrealistic. \n\nI ultimately decided it wasn\u2019t what I wanted. The further I get away from it, the more I realize how warped it was. People get so wrapped up in it that it becomes a huge part of their identity, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t enjoy a lot of it. I love my research and I made incredible friends. I learned a lot. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not in that headspace anymore. I\u2019m still working as a scientist, just outside academia. I still have some of my projects ongoing. I still deal with it a bit, but I can step back when it\u2019s bad. \n\nIf you think you can find support and solutions to ameliorate the stress you\u2019re feeling, it sounds like you love what you do. Don\u2019t doubt that at all.  Keep in mind that last year just *sucked*, so on some level you have to separate out pandemic stress from academic stress. What was academia, your program, etc., and what was *gestures around*?\n\nIf that thought just exhausts you and you don\u2019t see it getting better no matter what, don\u2019t feel bad about moving on. That guilt is what happens when we get wrapped up in \u201cbeing\u201d something rather than \u201cdoing\u201d something. \n\nEither way, you deserve to be happy and have a fulfilling career that you enjoy.",

      "text": "That you have the self-awareness and perspective to not only see the critical flaws in academia and toxicity in the academic work environment, and that you are not blinded by a sense of grandiosity in yourself or the subject matter you study, suggests to me (in the best of ways) that academia is not right for you--or at least not as it exists in its current state. Remember, that we can always return to academia in future times when the grass might be greener. People master out all the time, and return to complete their PhD even decades later after obtaining success and finding practical applications to their skillset outside of academia. I think in our current job market, you should not view a PhD (even in STEM) as a career-building degree but as a valuable and unique life experience.\n\nI sense you also come from a non-traditional background. I come from poverty and rural America, and mistakenly saw academia as a means of obtaining a stable and intellectually rewarding life. Just outlining my experience: I obtained a B.S. in Neuroscience from a R1 institution, I have several publications in high-impact journals that have more than 400 citations, a host of references in which I still maintain research correspondence with; and I have had almost no success in grad apps. I do not say this with any bitterness towards academia, but because I have grown to learn that careers outside of it are not so bad: It is not at all shameful to leave a passion if you cannot reasonably live a good life, and move towards opportunity and grow new passions where that opportunity is. Most academics come from financial security, can weather the instability that comes with academia, and have been insulated their whole lives from poverty by their parent's assets. In many of them, I have noticed a common sentiment in which they devalue or even deeply resent when other people make decisions for monetary reasons. As I have learned more about their background and upbringings, I believe a crucial part of their identity (academics from non-working backgrounds) is to differentiate themselves from the overly-financial attitude of their family members and peers. Because of this, they are heavy-handed with criticisms of making decisions for financial reasons, and simultaneously ignorant of the fact that those sort of decisions are not made by most people for greed, but for survival.\n\nI used to also be of the popular impression that academia sucks, but it is worth it to the individuals who are the most passionate about their subjects of investigation or the process of investigation. That story is a white lie which is simply spouted by PIs and university admins towards the passionate people they exploit. What I used to view as a troubled field full of passionate individuals has not changed; It still is a field full of some of the most talented, gritty and incredibly self-motivated individuals I have ever met, trying to create something new out of nothing. But, in my experience, the ones who have the greatest success are not necessarily the most talented or the competent. More often, they just seem ruthless and shameless enough to exploit the plethora of non-scientific aspects of academia.\n\nI don't mean to be overly angsty, but academia is no different from any other career, in which the paths to obtain success and prestige are tightly controlled by an established elite. A laboratory can persist for decades and even have tremendous success by abusing the grant funding process, manipulating data, abusing researchers, and most importantly: engaging in cartel-like behavior to reduce real competition among established researchers and to gatekeep the field from new entrants. It is true that you will find similar behavior in the C-suite of every field. What seems to be unique to academia is a culture, from the top all the way to the bottom, which is wholly ignorant of their abuse, and a work environment entirely devoid of oversight. I think this is from toxic positivity: they would rather believe they are all self-empowered individuals part of something beautiful-- than recognize the exploitation and deception they are unknowingly victimized by. But hey they've never worked another job in their life so they have no idea what a normal healthy work environment looks like. The most forgivable reason academia is toxic is because it's participants are sheltered from the real world.\n\nIn my personal experience, a great deal of calmness and a new sense of meaning can come from recognizing that people are more important than science. If we engage in science so narrowly as to completely disregard the people taking part in it, what is the point?\n\nThis is a Marcus Aurelius quote on religion and the afterlife, but I think it is just as useful to interrogate your own motivations and desires in life when it comes to pursuing abstract goals.\n\n\u201cLive a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.\u201d\n\nI would suggest you try picking up these books. Just leave them around and read them when you start catastrophizing. Take the energy you have from worrying and over-thinking and use it to read these works and obtain a more neutral attitude towards your life decisions.\n\n*Discourses* by Epictetus\n\n*Letters from a Stoic* by Seneca\n\n*Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius",

      "text": "Sorry you're going through this. But one of the absolutely necessary, intensely personal, steps of a phd is transitioning from \"this is my PASSION\" to \"this is my job/career.\" \n\nThe only people I've ever seen graduate a phd program WITHOUT hating it at some point, and without thinking about quitting as well, are crazy ppl who drank too much of the Kool-Aid, or were just the charmed few (good for them...)\n\nIf you're in a 6~7 year program and industry isn't an option for neuro, then yeah, you can think about bailing. Personal & mental health is too important to surrender to the sunk-cost fallacy. \n\nHowever, if your program is only 4~5 years, you should REALLY think about how marketable and successful you could be if you push thru. A phd doesn't mean you have to be an all-in, drink-the-Kool-Aid type of person, in love with research for its own sake. You can go so many directions after finishing.\n\nI hate my field, and quit my program after year 2. But then I went into the \"real world\" and it was mind-numbing. So I returned to my program and I'm about to wrap up year 5. The past 3 years weren't fun but (knock on wood), in a year I'll be done and will be WAY more employable than I was before returning. And I've learned there's loads I could go do besides TT-or-bust academia, which was the only option I could see at the time I quit originally. \n\nIt's a personal decision either way. Don't fall into the very real trap of thinking there's something wrong with YOU. The phd process in America is ABSOLUTELY broken, and until it's fixed, every person who goes through it has to at some point decide whether they want to push thru the bad parts or bail. \n\nNo shame in getting out with your sanity. Good luck, whatever you decide!!!\n\nEdit ps i reread your post and to give added context the reason you're only seeing faculty who eat breathe and sleep science is bc there's SO many more phds than jobs these days. So the hyper competitive market for faculty gigs weeds out all but those folks who are willing to work themselves to the bone for tenure. So it's a selection effect you're seeing, not the whole picture! Hope that helps give added context.",

There is bias that you would not expect; there are cover ups; and the worst I have learned; greed, it is as if the pursuit of science is not discovery or knowledge but rather political, finding or twisting evidence to fit a certain narrative to gain money - the very thing I couldn\u2019t care less about.\n\nI just want to let you know that you are going to find very little difference in regards to this as far as the Army goes. In the 4 years I was in, I saw 2 First Sergeants be moved to other units, rather than kicked out, after there were multiple sexual harassment allegations made against them I saw 3, THREE, officers get shuffled around for the same reasons. While I was in, the whole SFC pimping out his soldiers scandal hit Ft Hood, where it was found an E-7 has 8 female soldiers he was getting paid to let people have sex with. \n\nI saw field exercises on more occasions than I can count be cut short the day before the unit would have to pay family separation, and then bring the whole unit back out to the field immediately after in order to avoid having to pay soldiers the family separation, with no regards to the mental health or stability of the soldiers.\n\nI had an NCO that was so terrible and bullied one of my soldiers so incessantly that he ended up being pulled from a deployment because he was was trying to kill himself, in spite of the fact that we had been issuing complaints about her for 9 months, and everyone in the unit knew she was horrendous and somehow nothing was being done about it. She's recently been promoted to E7.\n\nI know there are a lot of issues within academia, and especially STEM, but my experiences with the military are far more common than they are rare. I LOVED being the Army, I wouldn't trade it for anything, but I think you have a case of \"grass is always greener\", the military is rife with controversy and scandal. \n\nYou'll get plenty of advice on this, and I'm sure you'll make the decision you think is best. But I just don't want you to be under the illusion that I think a lot of people are, that the army is all proper and squared away. Its far from it.",

This is one of the fundamental concepts in stoicism, which OP has quoted, and which I also agree with.\n\nWhether this is truly how OP can find their good life, I can't say and neither can you, but I can say that it's extremely patronizing of you to suggest that they shouldn't even be exposed to the suggestion because they're too vulnerable to think about it clearly. That's bullshit and a half.",

I\u2019ve come to realize that everyone reaches the transition point between student and scholar. \n\nStudents revel in learning and gaining insight; what they don\u2019t always realize is that they are learning things new to them, but which are already relatively well understood and systematized. It\u2019s like skiing a double black diamond run - challenging and exhilarating, novel to you, but ultimately something someone has already figured out and which you know is doable. \n\nScholars have to figure things out. It\u2019s messy, often wrong, almost always frustrating. You have to do it, get others to do it, make sure it\u2019s done. And you have to advocate for it, support it, gain recognition and support for it so it doesn\u2019t die on the vine. You often don\u2019t have the luxury of learning for learning\u2019s sake, or being a gentle person scientist, or a philosopher king or queen. \n\nAnd, well, the system selects for people who are good at that scholarship part - often, the political part of it - even if they aren\u2019t great students. After marinading in that for a while, you realize there\u2019s a devil\u2019s bargain to be made. \n\nAs far as I can tell, that\u2019s true in just about every other sphere of human endeavor.",

It's gotten to the point that I'm not sure if I'm staying in the PhD program because I want to, or because I don't want to be another trans POC that got weeded out by the white patriarchy of my field. And I ask myself, why stay in an environment that inherently doesn't value me even when my voice is needed?

Discovered that academic research isn't all what it's cracked up to be and it's been extremely disappointing and demotivating.\n\n\nThat being said, I think there's a fundamental difference between academic research and industry R&D. In industry, at first glance you could think \"it's all about the money.\" But then also realize, especially in your field (I would assume), these big companies don't make money if they don't produce a product that's useful for humanity. Neuralink, for example, is purely in research mode at the moment and isn't focused on the clout of its personnel. Maybe that side of research would interest you more, if you can get over the top level profit motive. I have a feeling that's where I'm headed, at least. Also, there is nothing wrong with changing your goals. Perhaps that path includes some active duty time to recalibrate. \n\n\nLove hearing that other people also benefited from Meditations.

I did not give one ounce of thought to industry while I was applying. I really should have. If I could I would go back and slap myself into really think about industry as an option incase my whole academic dreams got shattered. And if they did (which they obviously did lol) was going into industry worth the PhD, and right now, it might be because  its easier to go up the ladder with a PhD than with a masters ( still not sure about this). If you see academia as something you no longer see yourself pursuing make sure industry is an area you are okay with. Big pharma thinks in terms of dollars and if the science makes the dollar it goes forward. Academia has its benefits of free thinking but really they're a slave to the dollar too in terms of grants. One of my old mentors always said you could study why snails have left or right handed shells bc you really think it's fascinating, but at the end of the day who will fund it?

If you go active, you\u2019re there at least three years and that takes away that 2-3 year progress you already have on the research side. I just finished my PhD and I phased out the Army in that time. Having just finished my dissertation and such, I totally feel wanting to quit. That long ass research you are working on right now gets old. That\u2019s normal. My advice would be maintain it until you\u2019re done but accept your feelings for it. After you finish you can do research in the Army or somewhere else, or just go do whatever your MOS is and forget about neuro. My point is you are so close and based on how you speak about wanting to contribute to research, I think you would regret taking that away from yourself (in respect to neuro research as a PhD). You started this program for a reason, and while what you\u2019re doing may have lost its luster, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay with academia style research. Instead you can go more practice based like in ARL or something.",

I don't disagree that being in the military could be fulfilling, but it's still pretty much manual labour as opposed to what seems to have been their dream of entering neuroscience. It's basically two ends of the extreme in terms of intellectual stimulation. Plus there's far more money and impact potentially to be made in neuroscience as opposed to the military where 99% of the experience produces no actual meaningful impact. I really see no reason for a person as educated as this to go to the military.",

Other graduate research assistants seem to sweat the small stuff and I was happy to be responsible for far less than I was previously.",

Private industry is all about personal gain and profits usually. \n\nThe main thing is, there is nothing wrong with quitting academia. Just make sure you have a plan!
