A couple have mentioned on their website about \"external funding\" - fellowships from NSF/NOAA etc. It seems like schools can also provide fellowships, or combo internal/external fellowships - like this one: [https://ncseagrant.ncsu.edu/funding-opps/fellowships/ncsg-apnep-fellowship/](https://ncseagrant.ncsu.edu/funding-opps/fellowships/ncsg-apnep-fellowship/)\n\nI'm a bit confused because I am used to fellowships only being for enrolled students (I do not have my masters so don't have all the background for grad school). However it seems like these fellowships are for people simply applying for grad school too, and make you more competitive when applying because you come in with your own funding attached to you as an individual as opposed to needing it from the lab. Do I have this info down correctly? A couple professors have said I am competitive enough for NSF fellowships so I just want to get my info straight before I deep dive and try to apply for these. On the other hand, I have one friend starting her PhD who does not have one of these external fellowships. How common is it to have one of these? I imagine they are pretty competitive too with big names like NSF and NOAA?\n\nThank you!!!!", "author": "AnxiousSuccotash7", "created": 1631733832, "retrieved": 1632844529, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hczynbx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pox01q/would_someone_explain_to_me_about_external/hczynbx/", "text": "The NSF fellowship applications are due soon, so it would be good to get going on it. Get someone to help, perhaps one of the professors who thought you were competitive.\n\nGrad students are really expensive for faculty, so it is really helpful when one wins an external fellowship.\n\nWriting a  GRFP application will help you focus on what you want to get out of your graduate education, which will also  sharpen your grad-school application.", "author": "IkeRoberts", "created": 1631739742, "upvotes": 3}}}
