I'm definitely an advocate of taking time off after undergraduate. In my case, I did my undergraduate part time because I worked full time. I had a whole ass career. \n\nThe disadvantage of going to grad school in your 30s is the stress of \"retirement/savings\". But the advantage is that I do notice that I'm a lot more \"together\" then most grad students. I approach it like a job. It's also a conscious choice I made. So many students I see going to grad school and leaving after a year or never finishing because they just don't know what they want to do, and they just think it's an extension of undergraduate. Not all, but a significant amount. I also do not value my worth on this particular job. I'm doing it till the money runs out. It'll suck if the money runs out but that's life. \n\nCurrently I'm making bank because I publish tons and generally just complete all my tasks. I'm also very passionate about the work since obviously this was a life changing choice I made. All that to say I've scored some big fellowships, plus I'm already teaching. \n\nSo why delay? To avoid imposter syndrome, to not have FOMO about other career choices, to understand what it means to make your career a significant priority not in theory but in practice, to generally just know yourself (your needs, wants, expectations, limits) better, to have perspective on expectations, etc.. \n\nOnce you drop out of grad school, there's basically no going back, so I feel you should be pretty sure this is what you want. Jobs, however, you can take a few years off, change careers, try out different jobs. Of course, if your expectation is to make 100K out of undergraduate, that's unlikely. But you can still work somewhat in the field and get a sense for problems that need addressing, and whether your prospective career is a good fit for you. If you've got even entry level experience in the field, you're more likely to get accepted, more likely to get a scholarship, etc. \n\nSo this is really just if your only reason to go right out of undergraduate is \"pressure\" -- that's a terrible reason and you shouldn't do it.

It's not because of social pressure to be fully educated like you seem to think. You don't go into grad school for fun*. Grad school opens up positions and opportunities that would have been off limit or very very very hard to achieve for someone with only a bachelor unless they have years of relevant experience.  \n\nThat's the case if you want to go into an academic career, industrial R&D or any other industrial position that require a grad degree. The ''opportunities'' that you seem to think that are out there for us do not align with our interests. What you see as opportunities are not career opportunities for those who have a career goal that requires grad studies. \n\nSomeone who goes on the job market instead of directly going to grad school isn't in the wrong either. Maybe they do not know yet what they want to specialize in and prefer to discover that through a job they like. Even better, maybe their employer will even end up paying for it to promote them in a specialized position! But for those who already know they want a career in a specialized field that require grad studies, there's not really any point in taking on an unrelated job and delaying gaining valuable work experience for their future career.\n\nFor example, if your goal is to become a lawyer, you don't have much choice but go to law school no? What's the point of spending years of your life doing something you don't like that could be accessible if you get the proper education for it? Being on the job market for something that you are not interested in is not going to further your career since it doesn't align with your career goal. The only true opportunity in this scenario is to make money to afford an above-average living quality during grad school. It's not much more rewarding to do a job you don't like just for money no? And also, those years you spend on the wrong job market are years that you could be spending furthering your career in the specialized field of your choice, which is the one accessible through grad school. \n\nIt's not about the ''rewards of education'' it's about the reward of a career that is not accessible without grad degrees either because it requires research experience or to be specialized in a field.\n\nEdit: Not going to grad school for fun *does not mean* you can't have fun during grad school or enjoy it.
