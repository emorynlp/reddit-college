  "text": "You and your work are still valuable. This is not a reflection of your worth. Academia is full of rejection, but I get this one hurts because it's big and early.\n\nI didn't get NSF GRFP. In fact, one reviewer said I had a \"poor record from a state school.\" (This taught me a lot about how to take criticism, and how some people understand prestige. I had a 3.3 overall and a 3.9 in my field. I went to a good school I could afford). I'm pretty sure I'm turning out okay. I did, however, send my application to other funding mechanisms and still got grants out of it.\n\nObviously, congratulations to those you received it! Don't let anyone make you feel bad for having gotten it either. I've seen people get very jealous over this win, especially if you're in a department that competes for funding. Don't be competitive with your peers; we're all doing the best we can out here in grad school, which is a weird situation in the first place.",

I wonder how much of this is just the students from these schools being better and how much of this is individual snobbishness of reviewers.",

              "text": "I'll say from experience that 1.) The caliber of students, on average, is better. They didn't get in for no reason, many busted their asses since high school to get into such Ph.D. programs. 2.) Most of them have already applied to NSF before, or other kinds of funding. 3.) Everyone who doesn't already have external funding applies to the NSF, and these programs are typically pretty large. 4.) The P.I.'s all have experience helping with such applications, and many students at the institution have already won and are willing to help/review . 5.) The dedicated administrative resources that exist to help students secure fellowships. 6.) These large schools have many departments in STEM, all well-populated with students that can inflate the institutional numbers.\n\nSo while my institution won \\~30 NSFs this year, 15 people in my department applied as second years, and only 2 won. At my previous institution, there were not even 30 grad students in STEM, and nobody applied for these grants because they hadn't even thought to.\n\nEdit: I also want to add that I think it's possible that many students in my program who did not win the NSF would have won if they were at a lesser known institution. I think the NSF stratify within the pool of applicants, try to spread their funding a bit, and try not to award too many fellowships to people all in the same department/program. That's despite how it looks. While Yale has a lot of awardees, the number of applicants is probably astronomically higher than from smaller schools.",

I also was rejected from many grad schools I applied to.\n\nI'm now a full professor at one of the top programs in my field in the world, with a bunch of awards. In fact, talking to a bunch of other faculty in my department, we all have a long list of failures. In fact, just yesterday, I was rejected for a fellowship I applied for.\n\nYou're going to get knocked down a lot in grad school (and in life in general). It's ok. Things will be ok. Take a day to recover, learn from your experience, and get back in the saddle. Your work matters, and you can do a lot of good in this world, through your work and through your interactions with other people. Don't ever forget that.",

Now, those activities, under normal circumstances, are awesome, but it was very clear he had included / mentioned them to win favor with the reviewers and not because he was passionate about them, per se. \n\nAs for why my app was stronger - I've always been a strong writer and have had several people (mentors, colleagues, etc) affirm that. Had a paper accepted to a top HCI conference my first year of grad school, at a venue where a mix of qual/quant writing is generally highly valued. So in the sense of the writing flowing well, my app was stronger. However, I'll admit mine was weaker in the implementation plan part, something the NSF prioritizes (and for good reason).\n\nOverall, what I'm trying to convey is that no matter how strong your writing is, pulling strings can sadly hold more weight than a strong application (thankfully, not in all cases, since so many GRFP recipients are indeed very well qualified).",

The NSF GRFP is more a measure of how you did as an undergraduate than how you will perform as a graduate student (as you have since shown), so it's not a judgement of who you will become at all. It's just a fact that the reviewers have many applications to choose from and have to use the measures provided to them to pick the best applicants.\n\nTo judge somebody for going to a small state school is ridiculous, but it's a fair point to criticize an applicant who failed to excel at one.  There is a difference between a 3.3 at a less competitive school and a 3.3 at MIT.  One of the best scientists I know went to a small state school (for financial reasons like in your case), but he absolutely destroyed every class because he was an order of magnitude better student than most of the other people there. With that said, there are small \"private\" schools worse than any state school, so I think prestige is the better point to emphasize than whether something is public or private.",

Once you start that game the personal statements become a pity contest. What about people from a similar financial situation in yourself who were able to earn merit scholarships to college or get into a college good enough to provide need based financial aid?  Should you get an advantage over them too, or just people from middle class backgrounds who were able to take out loans?\n\nThese fellowships are simply a contest for who has accomplished the most in science up to that point. If you think that's unfair, so be it, but I think more unfair would be giving the government funded award to the less qualified candidate. That's a misuse of taxpayer money. Grad school is a completely even playing field though, so you now have the opportunity to surpass the people who excelled as undergrads beyond what you were able to do (due to your financial situation).

The award isn't indicative of your ability to be a grad student, it's indicative of what you were able to accomplish prior to grad school.  Your abilities as a grad student will be judged when you apply for postdoc fellowship. There's nothing stopping you from surpassing those who accomplished more than you did as undergrads and being awarded with the top postdoc fellowships.\n\nWhen you have to give out an award for merit, you are going to give it to the people with the best credentials up to that point. If grad student \"A\" has a publication and grad student \"B\" does not, the award is going to student A. The reason you were criticized is because the reviewer was explaining to you why you were not given a better score.

I know a number of GRFP winners who didn't do much in grad school. All it is, is an award based off of specific criteria, most of which are decided as an undergraduate.  People who do not have the qualifications in those areas going into grad school can still be outstanding grad students-they just aren't great candidates for the award. \n\nI hope that clarifies my position a bit in that I am not judging you or your situation at all.  I'm simply saying that the award is going to go to people with the best qualifications in year 1 or year 2 of grad school. To me, that's a good system because the best candidates (at the time) get rewarded, while those who did not have the same opportunities  prior to grad school can now prove themselves in grad school and be more competitive for postdoc awards.",
