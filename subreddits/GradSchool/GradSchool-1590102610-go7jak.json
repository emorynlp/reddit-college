This is more of a venting post (although insights/advice is absolutely welcome!)\n\nI\u2019m currently finishing my 3rd year of a Sociology degree. I absolutely love this field. I also love doing research, particularly qualitative. I love the intellectual stimulation that doing research in this field has provided me thus far. \n\nWith that being said, I\u2019m also burnt out from being in school, and I\u2019ve begun to question if going to grad school is the right idea for me. I\u2019ve been planning on pursuing a PhD in Sociology since my first year of college, and everything I\u2019ve done in college since has been with that intention. A year ago, the thought of moving across the country to attend grad school was intriguing, but now it just scares me. \n\nI know being scared of change or something unfamiliar shouldn\u2019t deter me from a particular goal, but at the same time, I value my happiness and worry about being alienated in grad school. \n\nI also think that because I\u2019ve always been the \u201cgifted kid\u201d that I feel pressured to get the most advanced degree at one of the best schools. I realize that a big part of my self confidence comes from external validation by authority figures. I have a hard time seeing myself as anything more than an \u201cintellectual,\u201d if that makes any sense. \n\nLike I said, I love doing sociological research, but I\u2019m also very passionate about social justice, particular in gender and education. I\u2019m considering doing Americorps or some sort of social services position for a year or two, getting an MSW and doing macro research, and then going back to school for a master\u2019s in either social research or education research. \n\nI absolutely could still see myself getting a PhD later in life, but I\u2019m hesitant to go to a program straight out of college. As much as I love doing research, I also wonder if I should explore other options and develop an identity out of being a student. \n\nIf anyone has any insights or advice on this, I would love to hear :)", "author": "complihated", "created": 1590102610, "retrieved": 1632845772, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 444, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"frgiy1r": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/go7jak/do_i_actually_want_a_phd_or_is_being_in_academia/frgiy1r/", "text": "This hit me right in the feels. Obligatory [Spiderman meme](https://i.redd.it/bekphnqftcb41.jpg) because are you me?!\n\nPondering my motivations for entering and staying in academia do actually keep me up at night. Like you, I've often felt that so much of my identity is bound up in this idea of academic excellence that not pursuing academia would make me fell somehow *less than*. Less than what? I can't even articulate it. I don't really have any answers for you - except maybe a little story:\n\nI was similarly burnt out when I finished my undergrad (psychology). I went to a R1-equivalent (we don't have the R1 R2 system in my country) university that pushed its student extremely hard. Like, we're talking 'a couple of hushed up suicides a year' kind of hard. By my final year, I was juggling a full course load, a thesis, working in a lab, extra-curriculars and two community volunteering positions that I needed in order to even be competitive as a candidate for grad school and/or getting a job upon graduation. My mental health was shot to hell and I decided to take a gap year.\n\nWell. One gap year turned into four gap years. I have mixed feelings about those gap years. I was fortunate enough to secure a job in my sector that paid well *and* was related to my major. I got to see what working in community health was like, and also understand macro-level considerations for health policy and research. It gave me a much more well-rounded view of psychology than what academic psychology tends to provide - which is quite micro-level. Four years away from school also gave me the breathing room I needed to build on other areas of my life that were lacking, like meaningful relationships and personal hobbies. It also obviously let me have a better lifestyle than my default 'starving student' mode.\n\nBut. *But.*\n\nDespite all of that, I found it really hard to be happy. My job was somewhat research-adjacent, meaning that I was doing academic-lite. I would present at conferences, sometimes write a policy paper or two. But no original research and no hard data-crunching. I felt incredibly unfulfilled. I was at my happiest in my job when I was focusing on the most academia-like portions of my role. I *liked* grappling with abstract research ideas. I *liked* doing literature reviews. Heck, I even liked the process of review for publication! Other than those academic-y moments, most of the time, I didn't feel challenged, and I didn't feel like I was doing the things that mattered to me.\n\nIn hindsight, I would probably have done things differently. Maybe only taken 2 years instead of four. I can now identify that indescribable malaise that I felt as a kind of existential boredom. I felt stagnant. I felt like I was living in the intermission of my life, with no real goal and nothing to work toward. Honestly, I was probably at least mildly depressed throughout.\n\nWhen I finally got off my ass to apply for grad school and eventually got in, my entire outlook changed. All of a sudden, I had *purpose*. I felt like I was getting a piece of myself back - all the fiercest, bravest, most ambitious parts of me that I cherished. Academia obviously isn't without its challenges, but I would take that any day over giving up this part of myself again.\n\nSo - I didn't really answer your question. But I think it's okay to feel that your identity and all the things you love are bound up in academia. I tried to deny those pieces of myself for years and it didn't work out that well for me. In some ways, I lost four years where I could have been pursuing the things that actually mattered to me instead of the things society told me I should want (ie. relationships, material possessions).\n\nBottomline: Do what you feel is right for *you*. Nobody else is going to understand your motivations, dreams and drives better than yourself. If exploring other sides of yourself is something you really want to do, then do it! If being an academic nerd (and that is a compliment!) makes you happy, then be proud of it! :)", "author": "TwoSizes", "created": 1590162848, "upvotes": 2}, "frgdafm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/go7jak/do_i_actually_want_a_phd_or_is_being_in_academia/frgdafm/", "text": "Getting a PhD isn't a sprint it is much more like a marathon.

In the end I wound up doing a masters at UNC for educational research methods.  While my health did not allow for a PhD, I did finish the masters.  But more importantly the toolkit of research methods I knew and have experience using grow greatly, as did my ability to design, defend and promote my research.  Before my MA I did some qual research and some quant research.  Now I know several qual methods and the pros and cons of each one and have experience quantifying the results.  I also learned how to use different quant methods to systematically rip apart my data to look for what could give me false results.  Before while I did research in both areas I could not do research to the depth I do now, in particular use of triangulation or qual to quant designs (I always assumed they were exclusive methods or used in mixed methods).  The concept of using qualitative research as the input for quantitative research never occured to me.   Now this is my go to for a lot of research questions I may have.\n\nSince you are looking to do research out in the wild while on break, doing the PhD first will allow you to have a far stronger toolkit and make better use of the research you do.  If interested in almost anything else I would say take that gap year, but here it seems you would be better suited to get the degree first then go out and explore how to use it with the knowledge a PhD would give you to produce far better research.\n\nSo I say do it but do it for the knowledge it will give you.  Sure you  can get this knowledge on your own, but it will not be the same as doing it with a group of people and embedding yourself for several years into a research group.  Undergraduate research is nothing compared to graduate research and graduate school is about making research the primary focus of your day to day activity.  If you enjoy research like I do, this situation is a dream come true as you will be surrounded by people who generally share your love for research.  My life became a living hell outside of school during this time but would not trade the experience for anything and gladly walk through that hell again for it.\n\nIf you are seriously considering Educational Research feel free to drop me a line if you want to chat about my experiences.  I was in a Educational Psychology, Measurement and Evaluation masters program that merged into a Learning Science program.  I went all in on the quant side as I find qual research easier to self-teach than statistics but my program was split into a qual side and a quant side.\n\nAlso if you wish to transition research into a paying career look into program evaluation.  Not too many undergrads know what evaluation careers are, but essentially you use a mix of qual and quant research to determine if a program is actually effective at achieving its goals.  Very high paying career path as well.  If my health returns to the point of continuing education this is where I go to turn my love of research into a career outside of academia.", "author": "engelthefallen", "created": 1590156125, "upvotes": 2}, "frg43jn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/go7jak/do_i_actually_want_a_phd_or_is_being_in_academia/frg43jn/", "text": "Maybe the \u201cburnt out\u201d feeling is whats making you apprehensive. I had a very busy, very rough junior year of undergrad, followed by a summer of intense research as a part of a research program I partook in.

Expanding your horizons is not only a good way of better understanding yourself and what you want, but also teaches you a vast array of new skills that you would probably miss out on if you go straight through from undergrad to grad school.\n\nAnd I'm not just saying this to say it. I took nine years off between high school and going to college. I traveled abroad, waited tables, read a lot, tried my hand at being a freelance musician, and eventually felt ready to go back to school. By then, I knew exactly what I wanted and how to get it. Because of that I have been able to enjoy my education and accomplish so much, with both enthusiasm and confidence. I cannot overstate how much the skillset gained by being an independent adult living in and moving through the world helped me in undergrad and now in graduate school (anthropology).\n\nSo, I guess this is all to say that if you are feeling unsure about your original goal of going for that PhD then take time off and explore some different options that intrigue you- you might be surprised at what you find.
