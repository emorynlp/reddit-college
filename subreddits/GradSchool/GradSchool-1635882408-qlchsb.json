  "title:": "Does personal relationship trump prestige in recommender choice?",
  "text": "I have 2 options for whom I could get my 3rd recommendation from.\n\nThe first is a coworker at my job with whom I extensively discussed my work and have good personal relationship. He is applied mathematician, working in industry. I am  applying for grad school ( both ms and PhD, MS is backup), in applied math.\n\nSecond option is professor in medical school for whose lab I wrote an image processing algorithm. This fairly notable is a full professor, so recommendation could be seen as having more prestige, but I never interacted with them directly, and thus have no personal relationship. I worked with a lower down member of her lab and as thanks for my work they are offering for her to give me a recommendation. \n\nWhich of these would probably be the better choice?",

      "text": "Where are you getting your first two letters and what programs/labs are you applying for?\n\nIf the other two letters are from personal relationship with lesser known academics, having one with prestige might be better than another letter of the same type. For example, if the other two letters are from coworkers at the same place, you're almost certainly better off making your third the professor.\n\nMore importantly, if you're applying to professors who work in the subfields close to either of your options, that should also be considered. If you're hoping to work in image processing, that letter will help you get into labs/advisors doing image processing. Same can be said if the work you did with the coworker is close to the kind of work you're hoping to do in your graduate studies.",

Neither of them are super famous or anything but the professor has decent connections to some of the places to which I\u2019m applying. \n\nI don\u2019t know exactly what sub field I\u2019d like to work in yet. I may end up doing a masters first as to get more thorough background in 1 specific sub field first, but we\u2019ll see. Optimization and statistical algorithms is about as precise as I can get. Image processing certainly could be a context in which I do this kinda work, but the work I did in relation to this professors lab was kinda\u2026 trivial. I don\u2019t think an image processing person would really find it notable/interesting so the value of the rec would really purely be in the professors clout and maybe just the words \u2018image processing\u2019 appearing in the recommendation. \n\nThe work I did with my coworker is closer more in line with the main body of things I\u2019ve worked on and my research interest  as a whole. It\u2019s also more substantive.",

      "text": "Professors have a broader view of grad students and the grad school/research experience in a way that non-academics or trainees might not, so it's generally recommended that at least two of your letters come from professors. \n\nWhat I would recommend is either for your first letter (from the postdoc) or for the medical school professor, ask for a letter to be co-written between the PI and the person you actually worked under. This is fairly common practice in my field at least. Often, someone doing research will work in a lab under a trainee (grad student/postdoc) and not interact with the PI much. In these cases, often a letter of recommendation will be co-written between the trainee and the PI -- the trainee can provide specific examples of skills the student has, and the PI can put these examples into their broader context of how successful they think this student would be in grad school.",

We're talking about academia, so there is going to be academic bias here (and not *that* unreasonably in this case).
