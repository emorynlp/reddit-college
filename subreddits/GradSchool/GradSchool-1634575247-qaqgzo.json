  "text": "[Original Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/q86sla/im_afraid_that_tragic_life_event_will_derail_grad/)\n\nI thought I'd give an update on this situation. Everyone was so awesome and gave me some great ideas on how to handle it. I saw another post from today on here about experiencing trauma during grad school, so I realize it probably happens pretty often.\n\nIn short, all of these resources are great options but I didn't end up needing them. My PI was out of town during the week everything happened, so I let the other PIs (but not my actual PI) in my lab know what was happening and they basically just gave me permission to neglect my PhD work for the moment. My PI came back today and we had a meeting about it. She was so so supportive and I am very grateful. I told her everything and was basically freaking out with how overwhelmed I was with everything. She broke it all down for me, helped me decide what I needed to continue my PhD work, and then composed the emails needed together with me.\n\nI had already asked my professors for extensions on coursework but I was really not very specific and was afraid of being seen as lazy or lying or something. My PI helped me decide what kind of extensions I needed and we reached out together. My professors were also extremely supportive. I was able to get a midterm exam rescheduled a week out and got a month long extension for my other coursework so I can catch up. They even told me not to hurry and make sure I take care of myself and take the time I need.\n\nMy PI also is helping me access resources in my state (which I'm new to, obviously, and she is not) that will help with my situation which I am so grateful for.\n\nNow, I'm just the kind of person that likes to keep on keeping on after stuff like this. Staying busy and having deadlines to meet helps me cope, I just need less pressure and stress. And that's exactly what I got. My PI did make sure to ask if I would rather take a leave of absence or drop certain classes or receive any other accommodations. If I'd chosen to do those things, I would have been totally supported. But I know if I sit around I'm just going to get really depressed. Pushing forward with flexibility is the right answer for me, but it won't be for everyone. Whatever happened to you isn't your fault and you can access whatever accommodations are right for you.\n\nI was soooo anxious and stressed and worried about this meeting with my PI today. I started the morning absolutely overwhelmed and weirdly ashamed. I received nothing but support and understanding and had nothing to be afraid of. I'm a private person in general, so it took a lot to spill my guts about everything going on with me but I'm very glad I did.\n\nAll of this to say that having a supportive PI who wants you to succeed makes an absolute world of difference when life throws a curve ball at you. And well, if you don't, there are many resources to access that were described to me in the original thread. Tragedy doesn't have to be the end if you don't want it to be. If making it the end is best for you, that's okay too. Everyone handles things differently.",

I hope you know that by talking about your experience figuring this stuff out, you\u2019re helping people who might find themselves in a similar situation someday. Thanks for speaking up when you needed help.",

It can be really nerve wracking to reach to someone (especially a PI) and it sounds like she really stepped up.
