It was very interesting and I\u2019m glad took the extra time really, but it was so infuriating to watch students I mentored pass their viva before me. \n\nStill, after 4.5 hours of a really enjoyable discussion I was thrilled to be done. They passed me without any corrections, so I just have to print off a final copy and update my flair on this sub. Happy times!",

Does the extra time prepare graduates better in any manner or is it just the system dragging its feet? Even if it does, is there any reason it's better to remain a student longer versus transitioning into a postdoc or early career scientist position to continue your growth and learning? (Besides cheap labor...)\n\nIn dual degree programs like mine usually the goal for both degrees is 7-8 years. I'm about to enter year seven and am hoping to be done soon. I do wonder if streamlining the process a little bit like the European model would be helpful to US students. I did some graduate related activities during vet school, but this is year 3 of full time research and I'm itching to be done. I can definitely see how spending 6-7 years in a program can get you into a slump. Makes me think that adjusting things, and tapering expectations a bit, to try to make 4-5 years the standard and get rid of these 5+ year nonsense would help improve graduate student mental health as well as improve attrition rates. I know everyone has their own circumstances and goals, but from where I'm at (in a long distance relationship and getting married next year by where she currently lives), I just couldn't stick around that long.",

But one of the \u201cdownsides\u201d of studying ecology is that we\u2019re always at the mercy of mother nature.\n\nOur students sometimes have no choice but to stay longer because of fieldwork. Most people can only do collect data in summer. 1st year is all about prelim work, then they collect data over 2-3 or 4 summers, and the write up.\n\nA 0.5 year extension usually costs the supervisor nothing, since our department is pretty well-endowed with grants (mostly NSERC and CIHR in Canada). And most students get offered a post doc position before they defend. But personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to stay longer than 5 years if I did my PhD in any university",
