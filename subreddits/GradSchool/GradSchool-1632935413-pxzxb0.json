Hertie School of Governance\n2. Diplomatic Academy of Vienna\n3. Graduate Institute\n4. IBEI\n5. ESPOL\n\nFor  context I am an EU citizen that knows English and an Eastern european  language. Ideally I'd like to stay in Europe working in the field and  and want to know which would help the most with employment!
