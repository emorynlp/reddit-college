  "text": "Hi there.  I'm slated to discuss a recent manuscript of mine in a multi-university journal club.  Still casual and relatively small, but the manuscript that I'm going to discuss has been approved for publication and has gone through 3 Authors Proofs.  While I could always share the Word version of it, and I have a copy on BioArxiv, I'd rather show the much prettier Author's Proof without my comments and minus the cover page.  Is this acceptable?  The journal is open-access if that's any help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
