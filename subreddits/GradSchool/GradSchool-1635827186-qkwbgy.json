  "text": "I am an international student planning to apply for MS in Civil Engineering in the US before the result of all my semesters are out. I asked the admissions committee if I can still apply by sending my marksheets until now, and they told me that I can still apply using my unofficial transcript, and send them the official transcript later on.\n\nBut I'm not quite sure what an \"unofficial transcript\" is. \n\nIf it is the marksheets, the marksheets in my uni doesn't even mention the percentage or rank, just the score from every subject and the total score of the semester. Is that what I should be uploading? Or are they expecting some other kind of document? \n\nI'd really appreciate it if someone could help me clarify this confusion.",

      "text": "Not familiar with the ~~green~~ term \"marksheets\", but something along the lines of a document from your university with your grades by subject is what you are looking for.\n\nBy unofficial, they mean something you can download and send in yourself. Official transcripts go directly from your previous school to the one you are applying to (either via mail or electronically) to guarantee that you haven't tampered with it.",

              "text": "Schools may ask you to do the calculation yourself based on a formula they share. But it isn't the first time they will have received a transcript without an overall score or with one in a foreign system.\n\nYou should use the system they offer in the application, but here is an example: https://www.grad.washington.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/converting-gpas.pdf\n\nGood luck!",
