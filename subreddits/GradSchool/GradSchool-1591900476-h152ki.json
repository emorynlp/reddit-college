A reviewer whose job should be to get good work published? They're literally there to gatekeep. \n\nI don't review and am out of the academia, and a big part of that was complete lack of constructive criticism from peers since people had to be nice and were just mostly indifferent. So much poor work that had to be published in order to graduate even if it had no value.\n\nI'd say the most concise review I saw was a one sentence rejection: 'this was bad and I don't see the point'. We felt sorry for the guy, but it *was* really bad, it was just considered poor taste to say it outright.",

Maybe you have a different perspective if you are surrounded by more hardworking people and not people who want status.

          "text": "So to take your rhetorical question seriously... I'm trying to imagine this from the reviewer's point of view.  \n\nI'm definitely not saying this is a good approach to useful criticism, but if I had to guess what they were thinking: the reviewer was probably pissed off that they spent hours of time (for free, no less) reading something that was, in their opinion, not even close to the level or style of writing expected for a journal paper.  They're probably annoyed that neither the editor nor the supervisor addressed this problem before dumping it on the reviewer: the one person in this scenario who's *not* getting paid to deal with this.\n\nIt can be frustrating, as a reviewer, to agree to voluntarily spend your free time reviewing papers only to find out that you're being used as a free editing and revision service because someone's supervisor or mentors didn't bother to do their job.  And then, not only are you do you still have to spend more time writing the review, but you have to expend extra effort dancing around everyone's feelings even through they're the ones who've taken the piss.  Getting a poorly-written paper to review feels like a bit of a slap in the face.  It's a pretty nasty statement about how little other people value your time, and it can be very easy to be blunt in response.\n\nOP is a masters student and so only recently out of undergrad.  It's entirely possible that they haven't yet learned how to write at the appropriate level, and this would be quite normal: it's a part of grad school training.  But then OP's supervisor should have stepped in before allowing the paper to be submitted.  It's a harsh way to write this feedback but - *if* it's correct - it's a message that needs to get through to the student and supervisor as soon as possible.  It can be uncomfortable, but there's often a lot of value in a blunt opinion from a stranger who's not trying to make you feel better.",

The work didn't meet many basic standards, and apparently hadn't been vetted by (or at least well) by the student's supervisor. So I make all my suggestions, which then aren't implemented in the version presented at the conference. To make matters worse, six months later, we go through the whole song and dance again. Slightly updated work, still lots of issues. So I make even more comments, which of course get ignored again. It's one thing to have poorly developed skills, but it's another to not recognize that that's the case and do anything about it.",

Which can still be a vital (yet harsh) learning experience if the person receiving the criticism can put their ego aside enough to face it, but this particular criticism will be difficult to concretely learn or build from because it is so vague. It's clearly an insult, and one specifically targeted to be extra mean to an academic and to play up what appears to be most grad student's biggest insecurity (that they don't belong/shouldn't be in grad school), but it doesn't actually say what it is about OP's writing that comes off as underdeveloped to them. \n\nIt could be anything from vocabulary to grammar to the experiments or the hypotheses themselves. OP has no way of knowing. It's kind of ironic because their review really isn't up to the standard of what you would expect from a journal reviewer. If they had even made it more concise by saying something like  \"your formatting looks like an undergraduate paper\" or \"your writing style is not up to this journals standards\" it would give the same message but give them somewhere to start in terms of improvement. This feedback is abstract af and could mean anything.",
