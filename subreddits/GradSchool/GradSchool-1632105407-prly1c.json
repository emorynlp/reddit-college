I\u2019m in grad school now at a college where most people attend part-time because they have families and jobs. My schedule is personally slammed between work and school. So needless to say when I was assigned a group project that requires an 8 page report, I was annoyed. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. It\u2019s hard enough to coordinate our own schedules. Now we have to coordinate the schedules between 3 people?\n\n2. It always ends up being one person pulling the weight. Given my job, I don\u2019t predict I\u2019ll get As this semester and someone else shouldn\u2019t have to suffer due to my lack of time.\n\nJust annoyed is all.", "author": "anonymousalligator25", "created": 1632105407, "retrieved": 1632952175, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hdl250c": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/prly1c/group_projects/hdl250c/", "text": "I have done four group projects in grad school.
