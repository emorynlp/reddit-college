  "text": "I am a junior in college, planning to get my undergraduate degree in biology. I currently have a gpa of 2.8, which I believe does not testify my intelligence. A few classes, along with COVID really killed my gpa. Those classes being physics and organic chemistry. For reference, I ended high school with a 3.9 gpa. I want to become a microbiologist, and hope to get a PhD in microbiology. I am planing to get a mentor to work in their lab over the upcoming summer. I am worried that I\u2019ve reached the point of doom and cannot achieve this dream because of my gpa. I hope to study hard for the GRE, and get the best I can. Can I get into grad school if I do this? Or am I done for?",

Volunteer to work in their lab before grad school starts (that summer). Get in good with an adviser as most of grad school is politics especially in the physical sciences. I think I had a 3.8 or something when I went in and it was physics and biochem that jacked that up. Biochem? bleah, and physics...self explanatory....",
