I don't feel qualified to be here, I don't fit in with the rest of my cohort or the program's ivory tower/lit fic ethos, and I was rejected from every other program I applied to (no waitlists, just straight rejections). I received little to no feedback from professors on my work during my first year, and had some bad interactions with some of my peers. Don't get me wrong--there have been some bright spots--but not enough to overpower the feeling that I shouldn't be here and everyone knows it. My therapist suggested that I meet with one of the profs in my genre (program admissions are handled by the faculty here) and ask why I was admitted, but I don't know if this would be inappropriate/crossing a line.", "author": "maowski14", "created": 1632443069, "retrieved": 1632844026, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"he36859": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pu8dtq/can_i_ask_why_i_was_admitted_to_my_program/he36859/", "text": "Elite grad programs admit people that they think can be stars with the help of that particular program.
