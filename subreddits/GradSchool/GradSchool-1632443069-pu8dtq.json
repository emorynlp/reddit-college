  "title:": "Can I ask why I was admitted to my program?",
  "text": "Background: I'm a second-year student in a prestigious MFA creative writing program, and I've been struggling with a crippling case of imposter syndrome. I don't feel qualified to be here, I don't fit in with the rest of my cohort or the program's ivory tower/lit fic ethos, and I was rejected from every other program I applied to (no waitlists, just straight rejections). I received little to no feedback from professors on my work during my first year, and had some bad interactions with some of my peers. Don't get me wrong--there have been some bright spots--but not enough to overpower the feeling that I shouldn't be here and everyone knows it. My therapist suggested that I meet with one of the profs in my genre (program admissions are handled by the faculty here) and ask why I was admitted, but I don't know if this would be inappropriate/crossing a line.",

      "text": "Elite grad programs admit people that they think can be stars with the help of that particular program. The person's potential, professional-development needs and the programs strengths align in a particularly good way.\n\nThat combination is true for you as well.\n\nTo realize their hopes for you, they need you to take advantage of all the best things they can offer so that you'll achieve that professional maturation and success. \n\nTalking with faculty is essential. To get the answer you are seeking, the question is not \"why was I admitted?\", but \"What should I be taking advantage of that would best help me develop a writer?\"  Same answer, but with a completely normal question to an advisor (whether official or ad hoc).",

          "text": "That's kind of the root of the problem: I'm the only woman and non-realist writer in my genre cohort, and it's deeply, deeply isolating. I feel like I was admitted either as a clerical error or to check an institutional diversity box. Logically, I know that's bullshit. But emotionally, it's resulted in panic attacks, alienation, and intense depression. I've been trying to push through for a year now, and it hasn't worked. I'm at a point where I'm terrified to show my writing to anyone, which is exactly what I'm here to do.",

I want to develop some, but we were totally remote last year and the professors I had classes with are either not in my area of focus, or have since left the program.
