Even then, do absolutely everything you can to meet that deadline during week days.\n\nHonestly, you're better off doing an extra hour each weekday than working weekends (although even that should be avoided at all costs). Especially in the last 6 months of my PhD (I'm submitting *today* fingers crossed! -- let's quietly ignore the fact that I'm on reddit), I found that taking weekends of was not just good, but necessary. I was way more productive during the week, I kept my personal life together and helped kept the house a nice place to live, got to unwind and relax, which are extremely important at the end when you're super stressed.Work as hard as you can during the week, but take the weekend off, unless you absolutely can't (which is probably wayyyy less than most people think).\n\nNow for the more tough love advice. Depending on your field, I dunno if thesis by publication is common, but if it is, do everything you can to get at least 2-3 papers published. You will absolutely thank yourself when it comes times to write your thesis.\n\nWrite drafts as early as you can, and get lots of help and feedback. If you're supervisors don't give you feedback as often as you like, find someone who will. ***Heed my words. Feedback is one of the single most important things you can do for your productivity***. Everyone says this. It's 100% true. Can't stress it enough. Get feedback as much as you can, from anyone who will give it to you.\n\nSometimes feedback is icky, but in the black hole of PhD productivity and progress, getting feedback gives you constant benchmarks for progress, and gives something *concrete* to act on. There's nothing like the feeling you get when you accept a change, or make an edit, and watch the comments bar in your word document disappear, and you're done.\n\nAlso:\n\n* ~~Try to...~~ Read(!) at least one paper *every single day*, all the way through, don't skip stuff - this will get easier the more you do it. (pro tip: print them out, go to a cafe or park, and read them, take nothing but a pen and highlighter - the trees will forgive you)\n   * UPDATE: Some very helpful comments have come in, and pointed out that in some fields, this is just virtually impossible. Some papers take days to properly read and understand. So I thought I'd elaborate a little\n      * The point here is that you want to make a consistent, daily habit of pushing yourself, and straining your understanding, maintaining familiarity of your field. Even if it takes more than a day to read a paper, the goal is not being passive or shallow in your literature research, you want to really learn and understand your field, and the more you challenger yourself to do this, the more your confidence will grow - *I promise you*\n      * Obviously you don't have to read every single paper this way - there's just too many papers, but you should make the effort to have a consistent string of papers that you properly read and understand\n* Try to read several PhD theses (I wish I did this in my first year) - you can usually find them in your University library\n   * Read some from your own institution, close to your field\n   * Read some from elsewhere\n   * Find some that are as close as possible to your work\n   * You don't necessarily have to read them all the way through, but get a really good picture of the breadth, and variety of thesis out there, the formatting, length style, etc. You might be surprised to find just how different they can be even within the same field.\n   * It's so much easier to write your thesis, when you know what it's supposed to look like\n* Make friends, hangout a bit, volunteer (but not too much)\n* Trust your supervisors - if you have a good relationship with them, and work with them, *they won't let you fail (if you have a* ***bad*** *relationship with them, you should talk to someone about it, someone who can give you good advice about what to do in this case - your supervisor is your lifeline and the single most important factor in your success)*\n* ***Don't give up! Your PhD is 95% persistence - show up, everyday, and do something, anything, and you'll get there***\n* Read these things:\n   * [https://amberdavis.nl/worst-nightmare/](https://amberdavis.nl/worst-nightmare/) (not as scary as it sounds)\n   * [https://jameshaytonphd.com/quick-tips/how-i-wrote-a-phd-thesis-in-3-months](https://jameshaytonphd.com/quick-tips/how-i-wrote-a-phd-thesis-in-3-months)\n      * Also, don't leave writing your thesis until the last 3 months!\n   * Kiley & Mullins, 2002, 'It's a PhD, not a Nobel Prize': How experienced examiners assess research theses\n   * Golding, 2017, Advice for writing a thesis (based on what examiners do)\n* UPDATE 2: Oh man, I can't believe I forgot this the first time - *have regular meetings with your supervisors - this almost single handedly saved my PhD, and got me finished on time*\n   * If you struggle even a little bit to meet deadlines, or push yourself, then I highly recommend having regular meetings with your supervisor - every 1 or two weeks", "author": "ChristianValour", "created": 1624581578, "retrieved": 1632953291, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 614, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h31y4hp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/o7ctqj/my_top_tips_for_starting_phd_students/h31y4hp/", "text": "Thank you so much", "author": "LaraCroft792", "created": 1624665306, "upvotes": 2}, "h31l3fu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/o7ctqj/my_top_tips_for_starting_phd_students/h31l3fu/", "text": "I'm so saving this thread.

I've also done a literature review on my research topic so I have definely done more reading at that point.

At least in sciences, that's just not how papers are supposed to be read. In fact, I'd say you should probably be reading a couple dozen papers a week, but reading them very selectively to get just as much understanding as you need at the moment. Forcing yourself to read papers all the way through just hits diminishing returns and becomes a waste of time in my experience. You actually tend to lose track of the important stream of connections between papers.\n\nThen, and I'm sure this is more a personal preference, but I also disagree about not working weekends. One of the things I really like most about academic life is that you can make your own schedule. I can work weekends for a while and then take a whole week off if I want.

Learn what your advisor expects of you as a student with regards to work output and time commitment, and ask them what you can expect of them as an advisor. If they have seemingly unrealistic expectations, it's unlikely that you'll be able to manage them effectively without overworking yourself. \n\nCodify work hours and stick to them. Grad school is a job. Once you've put in your hours for the day, stop work and go be a person. Working more hours does not mean you produce better work, in fact research shows the opposite is true.\n\nTake weekends off.\n\nThere will be exceptions to the above, of course, for example your advisor might need a few paragraphs for a proposal, you may have a deadline suddenly change, or your experiment stopped working one week before a conference. There will be times when you need to crunch in a heroic effort in a short amount of time. Once you push through these times, take a three-day weekend. \n\nThe Pomodoro method and instrumental music work wonders for productivity, as long as you respect the breaks. Read up on this method and you'll understand what I mean. \n\nHave an exercise routine, even if it's just walking around the block three times a week. You don't need to get swole, you just need to stay active.\n\nEat well. Drink water. I mean it. \n\nTalk to people as often as you can, especially during pandemic times. I used to dread lab meetings, but now it's a time to catch up with friends. If your meetings are all \"camera on\", put on some nice clothes. \n\nGet a good ergonomic chair and do your work at a desk. Don't just slump into the couch with a laptop for 8 hours a day, you'll wreck your back. \n\nIt's okay to take a mental health day once in a while. You don't even have to take a full day off.\n\nA day wasn't wasted as long as you accomplish *something*. Anything like \"I responded to emails\" or \"I gathered the papers I need to read this week\" are good, actionable tasks that you could check off from a list.\n\nIf you make to-do lists for work, make them achievable and detailed. Don't put \"write journal article\", instead break it down into the individual steps required. You'll get to tick off more boxes as you go, and it'll be more satisfying to progress. \n\nMake to-do lists for real life, too.\n\nMultiply your predicted time frame for any deliverable by 3.\n\nNetwork, and take advantage of any career resources your university offers. Make connections that will serve you well when you graduate. I've seen several colleagues go through their PhD staying laser focused on work, and when they graduate, they have a useless piece of paper and no leads on a job. \n\nPick up a hobby that requires some sort of investment. I know money is tight as a grad student, but by investing money into something, you'll naturally want to spend more time with it. Cooking is a good one, you need to eat anyway so why not throw a few extra dollars into better ingredients and some cookware and make excellent meals? It's important to have hobbies because my biggest piece of advice is...\n\nYOU MUST GROW AS A PERSON OUTSIDE OF GRAD SCHOOL. It's easy to fall in to the trap of making grad school your only personality trait.
