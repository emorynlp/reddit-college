  "title:": "Imposter syndrome because of the kind of student I was in K-12",
  "text": "Sorry for yet another imposter syndrome post! I'm a first year PhD student, and I don't know whether I'm competent enough for the program that I'm in (will find out pretty soon). That said, I also feel a sense of guilt and shame because of the kind of student I was in K-12: never a straight A student, never really shined in anything, and was really dull, dim, and ditzy. Undergrad really changed me: I found a subject that I loved and spent most, if not all, of my time studying and doing research. In the process, I think I kind of found my intellectual 'voice.' \n\nI've seen so many grad students with spotless K-12 records (valedictorians, perfect SAT scores etc.), and I feel like I haven't really worked all my life to get here. I feel like I've robbed someone - maybe a hardworking middle school or HS classmate - who if given the same opportunities as I had would have done so much better. Of course, there are many other reasons why I feel like an imposter (some could actually be very valid) but, at this stage, I really don't want to get hung up on this specific aspect of my past since it is not very relevant to the work that I'm doing. I don't know why but this is bothering me a lot now that I've started the program, and it's reached a point where it is actively hurting my confidence. \n\nAnyone else have this experience? How did you reconcile with these seemingly contradictory versions of yourself? I know that people evolve, and that you don't have to justify or reconcile, but I am having a really hard time letting this go for some reason.",

      "text": "Let the imposter syndrome go, it takes a village. \n\nA rigorously structured and perfectionist individual might have great technical expertise, but their education may lack breadth, or perspective. We need the guys that can crunch out a manuscript in one night under coffee stress and we need the guys that can speak multiple languages and we need the guys that can code in Python and we need the guys that have perfect grades. \n\nDon't focus on your percieved weaknesses. Focus on your percieved strength.",

      "text": "I've spent my whole life feeling someone is going to discover that I'm not supposed to be here, take all my education away and make me go back to junior high. It's an irrational fear, but I fear being found out that I don't belong among the real achievers. Sure, I read a lot and people tell me I'm smart, but does that really count? \n\nYou're not alone. Women especially get hit with this because we've been conditioned to doubt ourselves. I'm in my 40s and I still do it.\n\nYou are doing fine and you are in the right place. Others can see that you belong but you might have a hard time convincing yourself.",

      "text": "Nobody is born deserving to be in grad school, it's not like you got stamped with \"no PhD\" and somehow defied that. You did the hard work and got in, and I think you should trust the opinions of people in your department who believe in you because they probably know what they're doing when it comes to admitting students.",
