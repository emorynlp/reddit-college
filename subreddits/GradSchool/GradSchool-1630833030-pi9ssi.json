A phd in this field is pretty good since all interesting data is high-dimensional i.e. you'll be working in data science, so your ML experience is great and an industry career is no problem. If you're more interested in the graphics side (shaders and whatnot), I can't really comment there. I think there is certainly room to design interesting interactions with complex data using graphics. Also, do you like working with users? The problem of \"how do I represent my data in a novel/understandable way\" requires user studies since, well, how else can you evaluate the quality of your new visualization?\n\nVis phds do take a while though, compared to ML.
