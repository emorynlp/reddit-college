  "text": "Hi!\n\nI'm in my first semester of my masters program. I originally met with my advisor a month ago about pursuing an MA, and he had talked me into changing to an MS and offered to pay for the credits. He gave me a month to mull it over and do some reading for background knowledge about the lab and I am supposed to meet with him again tomorrow morning. I want to be prepared with questions, but I don't know what I should ask. I definitely want to ask about a timeline and required weekly hours, but I feel like I'm drawing a blank on anything else. Is there anything you wish you would have clarified with your advisor from the start?",
