  "text": "The combination of asynchronous and accelerated is just crap. I'm getting an A in the first course and I'm sure I can continue to pull that off for the entire program, so that isn't my concern. However, I am concerned about my ability to actually learn anything in-depth with this format of both asynchronous AND accelerated. \n\nI'm about to spend a day searching for a different program in a different school which sucks because this program is the perfect balance of multidisciplinary with a focus on the sociological side of food systems and sustainability. But it's just giving me a huge feeling of being let down. Read this, write on the discussion board, turn in a paper. Done, next subject for 8 measly weeks. \n\nI've had meetings with the professor, which have been great and I've learned a lot of program-adjacent information from talking to her about her other jobs. I invited the whole class to find a time to meet on Zoom for an informal conversation each week (about 4 took me up on it, it is great to talk with them). But this isn't enough- I want weekly lectures that are more than 10 minutes, cohort conversations that push me to think, courses that are more than a series of discussion posts with one high-stakes assignment at the end. Bonus points if there's a chance for an online graduate assistantship or TA position. \n\nAm I dreaming here? Is online school just for crap anywhere you go? I feel foolish that I thought this format would actually work, and I'm place-locked due to family constraints so I'm not sure where to go from here. \n\nDoes anyone know of an online synchronous or at least NOT accelerated program that looks at sustainability through a bigger lens than just auditing- like the sociological and systems side of it?",
