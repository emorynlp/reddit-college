  "title:": "How to Drop out of PhD on Good Terms?",
  "text": "I need some advice.\n\nI did research in my undergrad, aced the GRE, and did extremely well academically (mechanical engineering). I got accepted into a grad program with an extremely nice and understanding advisor who's doing some very important research in my field. I started research over the summer, and now it's the fall, and I'm failing a few of my classes (never happened to me before in my entire life). For my research, I can't force myself to do lit review for the life of me (I can read papers but I find my project completely uninteresting suddenly). I don't even want to do the most basic research tasks anymore. I thought I had done the necessary research into what specifically I wanted to achieve in my PhD, and I completely misjudged - I think there's something really broken about my judgement faculties.\n\nI don't even want to do research anymore or take any more classes, period. I want a job that allows me as much free time as possible, and I'm just going to turn all my invention/research ideas into open source projects online. I joined a grad student support group and went to therapy a few times, but it really seems like my brain is beyond the pale at this point as none of it is helping.\n\nThe thing is my advisor is extremely nice, and the funding in his lab is sort of tight. I'm also a paid RA on a new project, which is supposed to finish in 2 years so...yeah. But honestly I can't take it anymore. I've felt depressed/suicidal my entire adult life, but this is by far the least optimistic I've ever felt. I'll never kill myself over some dumb stuff like this and don't have debilitating depression, but I really don't see a future for myself where I'm a functioning adult at this rate. I've heard I can \"master out,\" but I really can't take much more of this. \n\nHonestly, some of my classes are bearable and in theory I could switch to another lab, but everything in my brain makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. I just feel completely lost and maybe slightly dehydrated.",

      "text": "That's tough and depends entirely on your connection with your advisor. I think the best way is honesty without coming across as offensive. In general the more information both parties have the better. You said your advisor is very understanding so I think a clear honest talk about your situation could be fruitful for both of you. Your advisor will know where you stand and can potentially better plan a potential transition period but might even give you good advice. \nIn any case, all the best to you, it's a blessing to know what one really wants in life.",

      "text": "I would talk to your advisor, and tell him you're struggling with some mental fatigue, and ask him if its okay if you take a break from lab work for a week or two. He'll probably be okay with it, or at least it starts the conversation about you going a different path. \n\nNext, I would take the week or two as off as you can. You may still need to do course work and classes, but other than that just completely disconnect (and honestly, so long as you don't fall really far behind, It's okay to flub up a homework or two). I find that the real grind to gradschool is the 'never turning off' feeling you get from always having looming deadlines, so getting rid of some of those for a little while can help. Give yourself time to truly stop thinking about school. Not procrastinating-but-I-feel-bad-about-it time, but real scheduled blocks of time where you can guilt-free say 'what I need to do right now is go on this bike ride, or learn this chess opening, or read this fantasy novel.'\n\nIf your classes get beyond the pail grade-wise, talk to the professors, and maybe start just hinting that you may need to take an incomplete. Usually if you are past the prelims they will give you incompletes with little protest.\n\nand of course: drink a lot of water, get at least 7 hours of sleep every night (get on a schedule if possible), and stop doing any recreational drugs (alcohol included) until you feel sharper again mentally.",

      "text": "I feel like I could have written this exact post, except that my advisor was NOT supportive whatsoever. But the complete disinterest in my research, constantly wanting to be dead, I get that.\n\nI ended up mastering out and got a job in my field. I am WAY happier now and the suicidal ideations are nearly gone. The stuff I\u2019m working on is both easier and more interesting. (You mentioned lit reviews\u2014I don\u2019t have to do those anymore, thank god.) The standards are more realistic and I don\u2019t constantly feel extreme pressure.\n\nLike you, I really thought I would love my PhD. I had spoken to a lot of students and professors. I thought I liked research, academic writing, and being a \u201clifelong learner.\u201d Less than a year in, all that evaporated. I don\u2019t think I was underprepared going in, and neither were you, tbh.\n\nThe culture in my department was not understanding, which was the major reason I left instead of trying to stick it out. If it\u2019s better for you, you may want to talk to your advisor first about how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nI wish I had better advice for you, and I don\u2019t want to be all DROP OUT NOW, because that\u2019s not always the best option. I do think you can still be successful and enjoy grad school. Just wanted to say that whatever you choose, it will get better.",

      "text": "You aren\u2019t alone. Finished year three of a doctoral program , finished coursework but done no real work on my dissertation. Had a research job on a project that seemed perfect but I hated it every day. \nDepression and SI? Yup.\nOur family decided to move across the country to live next to my in laws. I took a non research job that is actually amazing and took a semester off. I am starting to recharge and today I was even thinking about doing some work to finish an incomplete class. \n\nI also want to drop out. But I received a very prestigious scholarship that has given me a lot of money. So I don\u2019t want to disappoint them either. \n\nTL:DR - you aren\u2019t alone. Consider taking a leave of absence and get some space away from school to reevaluate when life is not crushing you",
