I don\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy going the PhD route, but I want to be in a position where I make good money for how hard the subject I\u2019m studying is. I\u2019d love to go into the pharmaceutical industry and do research but I also don\u2019t want to be in school for 8 more years.", "author": "prettypurplepolishes", "created": 1630622251, "retrieved": 1632845136, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbdizj3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgsdb2/bs_in_biochem/hbdizj3/", "text": "I would NOT recommend PhD to maximize salary.\n\nEdit: for clarity", "author": "SnowflakesFlame", "created": 1630622622, "upvotes": 2}}}
