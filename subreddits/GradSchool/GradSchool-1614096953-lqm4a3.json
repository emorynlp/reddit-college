  "text": "I skim 75% of the papers, only paying attention to the important parts like the abstract, conclusion, certain paragraphs in the discussion section and certain other sections depending on where the important info is. In other words, I get in, and get out once I have the info that I am looking for.\n\nI'm just wondering if others do it too or whether it's the norm to read the entire paper. I'm too embarrassed to ask others. Our professors assign a lot of large research papers to read before each class and I never read 100% of them (rarely I do, if I am enjoying it a lot).\n\nI'm a first year master's student.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in my second masters, and yes, DEFINITELY prioritise your reading. If the prof relies heavily on a textbook, do your best with it (that might mean the concept highlights, definitions, chapter conclusion, etc). As for assigned papers and articles, read lightly. Exactly what you\u2019re doing (abstracts, discussion paragraphs, conclusions) is great. If you have the digital  copy of the article and a discussion question, use ctrl+F to find that term in the article. \n\nIf you\u2019re supposed to ~interact~ in online forums or discussion boards, don\u2019t try to read everyone else\u2019s work. Make a friend or two in the class and interact with each other. I will randomly pick a different person once a week and reply on one of their posts. \n\nDon\u2019t swamp yourself with the expectations to read it all. There aren\u2019t that many hours in the day. Keep your head above water, make some allies in the class, and bend the material toward your interests whenever possible. \n\nOne more thing: USE ZOTERO. Or Mendeley, or something. Any kind of offline library storage/research assistant/citation generator/bibliography generator is an absolute blessing.",

For a humanities or theory paper, you have to read it all, but one tip I was given was to just read the first sentence of each paragraph and decide if you need to follow the rest of the paragraph, if not, jump to the next one.

So, what are your strategies to read everything and not BS your way through it?\n\nTo be honest, I find that graduate school is what you make of it. One hundred percent. If you believe it's a \"tortorous, neverending boot camp,\" then that's what you going to get. If you believe it's a wonderful opportunity to play in a sandbox that's exciting and delightful to you, then that's what you're going to get, too. If you need someone to nurture you, then you might have to look elsewhere for that. And that's OK\u2014everyone needs to be nurtured sometimes. The best is when you can find a way to nurture yourself in the middle of it.\n\nThat's just my perspective. I would just rather find ways to curate my experience in a positive way than see grad school as an overwhelming, unending torture. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Not who you replied to but as someone who also (mostly) like to read thoroughly, thought I\u2019d chuck in my two cents (I\u2019m a clinical psych masters student)\n\nYou will struggle to keep up. Don\u2019t you worry. It will be hell the first semester. You\u2019re gonna have to figure out how to adjust your strategies. Trust me. When my professor found out I took three hours to do one reading for her class, she looked at me with such pity... \n\nHere\u2019s what I did in an attempt to expedite that process for you: \n\n1. The way you take notes? For me, That\u2019s a very exact system of bullet points, maybe some bolded subheadings. Make a Google docs template and copy paste it. Makes it a lot easier. \n\n\n2. Type. Don\u2019t write. This goes for most class notes too if you don\u2019t need to do a bunch of formulas or something. \n\n\n3. Stop writing so dang much. Put down the important stuff in each paragraph/under each heading and move the hell on. You\u2019ll learn what your profs are looking for. \n\n\n4. TEAM. UP. WITH. YOUR. CLASSMATES. Most of my cohort and I have a shared Google folder where we all take turns putting in reading notes. Everyone contributes or they lose access (I keep track). And if you don\u2019t get around to reading something, hopefully one of your other classmates did and took good notes (use this with caution, it is risky). You are all in this together. Divide and conquer. (Hoping this works better for you than for me). \n\n\n5. Do. Not. Fall. Behind.",

That's basically a content-based view of what grad school is all about, but grad school is actually about developing skills and one of those skills is effective use of your time. If you're wasting your time extracting details from a paper that aren't relevant to you or your research, then you're really not learning what you're supposed to learn in grad school.\n\nIf someone skims over a paper for the important points, but then appears in a discussion to have not really read the paper, what that actually means is that they need to get better at isolating the relevant information quickly. It does not mean that they need to spend more time tracking and cataloging all the details and references. You will always have access to the paper, so if there's a question about some detail that comes up at any point, you can look into it then when it becomes relevant. There's no need to delve into everything prior to actually needing it. That's just a waste of time.",

All writing is like that. There's always more meaning to plumb out of any text. So the only thing \"reading\" can really mean is \"looking at words and gaining some partial understanding of their meaning.\"\n\nSo as long as you've come away with some new understanding, then you've read a paper. That doesn't mean there's not going to be more in there to understand, more to read, but you've still definitely read it. In fact, it's often super valuable to return to papers you've already read, with a new context or a new goal, and get a new level of understanding from them. That re-reading might be just as quick as the first, though, depending on what it is you're trying to get.\n\nThe only difference between academic papers and a lot of other writing in this respect is that academic papers are generally written specifically with these \"levels of understanding\" and \"goal based reading\" ideas in mind.\n\nYou're doing it the right way.",

Sometimes I go back to the methods if I'm confused or curious about something but I usually only skim those. \n\nIt's been a long time since I've read every sentence of a paper.",

As long as you tie access to basic necessities with meeting some benchmark, there will be people who find unethical ways to cheat the system because failure means losing access to food, housing, and other basic necessities. Ethics is always secondary to basic survival and if given the choice between them, ethics goes out the window. \n\nIt's not just a problem in research. This behavior exists everywhere from banking to medicine to real estate to food service. Academics rubber stamp papers for the same reason that bankers take out loans for people who did not agree to it or cannot pay them back: getting X number of widgets out the door is tied to their entire livelihood, and if cheating prevents them from starving in the street or going homeless, guess what they are going to do?",
