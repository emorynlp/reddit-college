They mostly repeated undergrad material and had labs that only catered to 1/3 of the course material (I also happen to be the least interested in that 1/3).

I think providing a space for people to talk through things anonymously (and even very dramatically if that's what they need at the time) is invaluable, and especially when isolation is something that grad students often face.

There are also folks that consistently start threads asking about specific successes people have each week. If you don't see those often enough, you can start 'em as frequently as you want.
