  "text": "I\u2019m taking two comp sci classes. One I\u2019m doing well in, but the other I\u2019m failing. I don\u2019t have the time or the energy for the second one (work, family, etc.) after I\u2019m done with everything else.\n\nI feel awful that I\u2019m not trying more in this class, but I just don\u2019t have the bandwidth (time, a place to study, etc.) to deal with it. What are my options? Should I talk to the professor about this problem? What should I expect from him as a response?\n\nThis is a public uni in New England and I\u2019m doing remote & asynchronous studying.",
