  "text": "I'm currently a freshman at a top CS school and in the future have my sights set on grad school. However, the way things are shaking it it seems as though I might get a B in one of my first semester courses. I had a really bad midterm that will likely impact my overall grade. For college, getting a couple Bs was more or less a death sentence, and I'm wondering whether that's the same for grad school.",

      "text": "Grad schools typically only care about your last 60 credits (i.e. 2 years). Also, most want a 3.0 or higher for those last 2 years, which is a B average, so even if you do get only a B, you'll be fine. \n\nSide note, the letter you write as part of the application process is an appropriate place to address any shortcomings in your grades, work, etc. If you studied abroad and struggled with classes being in a foreign language, for example, you can explain that and the school will take that into consideration",
