      "text": "I can only speak for Canada, but if you're doing a research-based Master's degree, it will be funded. The amount will vary from university to university, but it is typically somewhere in the mid 20-thousand per year range. If you're planning on doing a course-based degree, I think the odds of this being funded are slim to none. (Sorry if you're applying in the USA, because I really don't know how MS degrees work there!)",
