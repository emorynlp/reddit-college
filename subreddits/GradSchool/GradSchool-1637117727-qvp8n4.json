  "text": "This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qrdc4w/is_my_burnout_justified/) may provide a bit of extra context to my situation.\n\nIn general, I haven't been feeling that great about myself for about the past 2 weeks or so, and it's only getting worse. I'm sleep-deprived and overworked and it's now bled into my work and teaching. My department/the graduate school recently sent out their annual mental health survey and I answered it really honestly. I didn't know that there was a depression and anxiety screening embedded into the survey (some psychological index? I think. It's a documented thing). \n\nBasically, when I went to submit my survey, it warned me that I had signs indicative of moderately severe depression and severe anxiety and pretty much told me to call mental health services immediately so I could get help. I plan to get around that tomorrow, but on Friday I have a pre-scheduled (as in months in advance) meeting with my advisor. I don't know how to broach the topic of my mental health because I don't know if that's ok to talk about with them.  I'm too young to have other committee members (i.e. a thesis committee) to go to for support and haven't even taken my qualifying exam yet. I don't know if I should tell my advisor I'm getting help (or at least plan to) or just how exhausted I am because I don't want them to think I'm lazy. Any advice for this situation?",
