I'm hesitant to send her emails because I don't want to \"overload\" her with questions about stuff.",

Do you know anyone else on your course to get a feel for what's normal for your particular course? I talk to my supervisor at least twice a week but we're running a lab together so it's likely very different!",

In this case, they\u2019re more of an academic advisor.",

To me, this sounds very much like they have an academic advisor, not a (research) supervisor, where meeting a few times throughout the year would be the norm. \n\nMost of the comments here are completely glossing over this aspect, probably because Americans aren't familiar with taught master's programmes.",

There have been periods of time where we haven't checked in in months, but that was due to there being nothing major going on (e.g. preparing for prelims) where I didn't have significant progress to update them on. When my adviser was on sabbatical, we still met regularly. \n\nI'm not sure what your program is like specifically and maybe this is normal, but it would be unheard of in my program. Even our department chair, who is an internationally known scholar who travels frequently, meets with their advisees multiple times a semester.",

During times when things were quite straightforward, we would meet once every few months (with regular lab meetings where I saw her), and during times when I was completing my thesis or major projects, we would meet more often based on my needs.\n\nHow was the initial meeting with the supervisor? If you two seemed to get along quite well, I would just send an email letting her know you might need more guidance and ask if it is okay to request a meeting whenever you felt like you needed direction. If she seemed distant and unsupportive, then perhaps you'll need to reach out to an advisor for assistance.",
