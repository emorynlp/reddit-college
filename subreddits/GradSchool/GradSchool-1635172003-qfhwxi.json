I'm hesitant to send her emails because I don't want to \"overload\" her with questions about stuff.",

Do you know anyone else on your course to get a feel for what's normal for your particular course? I talk to my supervisor at least twice a week but we're running a lab together so it's likely very different!",

To me, this sounds very much like they have an academic advisor, not a (research) supervisor, where meeting a few times throughout the year would be the norm. \n\nMost of the comments here are completely glossing over this aspect, probably because Americans aren't familiar with taught master's programmes.",

Even our department chair, who is an internationally known scholar who travels frequently, meets with their advisees multiple times a semester.",

If you two seemed to get along quite well, I would just send an email letting her know you might need more guidance and ask if it is okay to request a meeting whenever you felt like you needed direction. If she seemed distant and unsupportive, then perhaps you'll need to reach out to an advisor for assistance.",
