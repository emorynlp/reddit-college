  "text": "One of the medical doctors from the university hospital system said this to my PI today. Another doctor previously said to me \"Are you a med student or PhD student?\" upon answer he replied, \"oh so you're going to be a fake doctor\" dead pan, no smile.  If this is a joke it seems in poor taste especially saying stuff like that in a meeting, my PI seemed hurt by this. I am mildly annoyed,  I don't think we need a title hierarchy. But it seems like these two \"real\" doctors in particular need to place themselves above PhDs on a pyramid. \n\nFurthermore, I have heard of PhD students saying mean things in the same vein of this to Master's students and I also think that's terrible, I just wish some people didn't feel the need to make themselves feel better than everyone else.",

There is a  sort of poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our  scientific and technological abundance.

      "text": "Wow, the replies down here make me feel so weird. Like, I've never, \\*ever\\* called anyone \"doctor\" because they had a Ph. D. It's never been a sore spot with anyone. Most of my professors have insisted I use their first names. Others are very happy to be called \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\". All the Ph. D's that I know don't bother either, whatever the context. If anyone insisted that I call them \"doctor\" I would find that super weird.\n\nAnd the \"real doctor\" bullshit is weird. Like, do they mean you didn't go through the same training they did ? Of course you're not a medical doctor. (unless you are, idk) What's their point ?\n\nAlso, related : I've been a grad student for three+ years and I haven't witness much decorum, at my university or at other Canadian universities. I see on here people talking about \"proffessionalism\" (there was a post about someone who wondered whether they could answer personal phone calls in the hallway, wtf), and now the whole \"doctor\" thing -- and I think : wow. People go to universities that are so uptight / stuck up / stuffy ! Like, at my uni, professors teach in jeans and a T-shirt, we mostly call them by their first names, and I just recently had a very serious (k, maybe not so serious) discussion with other TAs about how loose the weave has to be on a fishnet shirt before you can't teach a class wearing it and no other top. Then we looked up the university's dress code for teaching staff and there isn't one. So I guess as long as the students don't mind, I could hypothetically teach bare-chested ?",

      "text": "I can shed some light on this- I trained as a (medical) doctor and worked as one for 5 years before leaving for research.\n\nI trained in Europe but now work in the US. The amount of respect and compensation that society gives physicians here is ridiculous. As a result, their egos are over inflated and disproportionate to their actual intellect and/or skills.\n\nThe reason why doctors are so pedestaled is manyfold but includes:\n\n1. There was a period during the last 200 years or so when medical knowledge was considered esoteric due to lack of overall scientific progress and the fact that the rest of society was largely uneducated. To be a doctor meant you had to in some cases be a graverobber so you could obtain anatomical samples to study. Thus, being a physician meant that you possessed almost occult knowledge which was worthy of awe.\n2. In places like the United States, the American Medical Association (and insurance industry) has almost cartel-like power - The AMA deliberately reduces the number of physicians available thus creating a shortage and subsequently commanding greater compensation as a result. The whole system over here is designed to perpetuate this status quo and keep physicians/insurers at the top.\n3. In a lot of places where socialized medicine is the norm - I'm from the UK - the fact that doctors by comparison do not out earn other learned professions by such magnitudes as they do in the US has resulted in a widespread exodus of physicians from the profession. Frankly, though some doctors are driven by altruism and a desire to help, the majority simply are not. This highlights that if a socialized model were ever to be accepted in the US, and their compensation were to fall commensurately - the exact same thing would happen here. The fact that doctors can easily pull in 200k + (on the low end) means that its probably worth it to eat all the proverbial shit that comes with looking after other people. Also, medical students are in huge debt and you are fucked if you quit before your debts are paid off.\n4. Medicine requires little to no lateral thinking or intellectual creativity. Its simply rote learning. This is the truth. You do not have to have a brilliant mind to excel in this, and it is one of the few \"academic\" professions where hard work can easily compensate for a lack of general intellect or idiocy. One thing I hated, for example, is that those who are perceived by seniors to be hard workers due to sheer inefficiency are the ones that get ahead.\n\nOverall - though there are some arguably brilliant minds in medicine, these are the vast minority. Medicine is unfortunately a cult of personality and an old-boys club. Stereotypes ring true. I have known plenty of drug addicts, those with criminal records and incredibly dense people to excel in the field.\n\nThe good thing is that I personally forsee an end to this hegemony. The rise of artificial intelligence will usher in an apocalypse for physicians. I know in the US though the lobbyists and AMA will not go down without a fight, but the fall will come.",

Which is of course something many MDs do as well, but the majority are, if you squint just right and have a chip on your shoulder, using a sort of product manual and standardized set of tools to fix common ailments of the human body.",

And to be so protective of the title outside of medical settings is simply obnoxious and when that happens I just remind them that in the end they stole the term from the theologians and that they aren't a \\*real\\* doctor unless the Church bestows them with a Doctor of Divinity.",

I remember when I was in highschool, I tried so hard to get into UCLA, but they rejected me and I only got into schools like UC Santa Cruz,UC Barabara, and other lower tier UC schools. I got 1330/1600 on the SAT while all my friends got over 1500/1600 on the SAT. I remember feeling like an imposter and I still do for some reason, even though I'll get my MD just the same. \nI know that my situation isn't exactly the same as yours, but sometimes people can be jerks.

But any random person who hears you being referred to as \"doctor\" -- especially in a hospital setting -- would assume you are a physician.

However, for people who have earned a PhD and experienced how incredibly gruelling of a process it is, I totally get why this kind of stuff would be pretty offensive coming from the right source.\n\nI used to hang out with a bunch of MDs in residency, and they would regularly complain about learning from profs who weren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d doctors. Considering those profs had spent decades getting a PhD, oftentimes multiple postdocs, and conducting original research to be experts in their field, it was pretty darn disrespectful and arrogant. Many of them weren\u2019t bad people, but they truly did seem to think that someone who had spent 30 years generating new knowledge about liver disease wasn\u2019t qualified to teach them about it because she hadn\u2019t done a 3-year MD straight out of undergrad. \n\nSo I guess my point is, it\u2019s really more about the source of the comment. If my family who work in different fields joke about me not being a real doctor, I laugh and tell them they\u2019re right and they\u2019d better hope they don\u2019t have a heart attack with me around.

I've met people with PhDs who are totally retarded, and others that are smart.  I've met people with bachelor's degrees that are smarter than some people with either.  At the end of the day, knowledge is knowledge, and a degree may or may not reflect knowledge.  But starting a pissing contest over who gets to consider themselves \"higher\" than others in society seems like a waste of time and pretty insecure.\n\nI used to do this with my pharmacist girlfriend who has a PharmD, and it was literally just insecurity on my part.  Are some degrees more challenging than others?  Yeah, probably.  But to make that a focal point of conversation is meaningless and immature.  We do different things.  As someone in research, I definitely want to improve PhD programs, science/engineering, and research, because it's my community, but I don't compare myself to people in other fields.",

          "text": "> Most PhDs loves to learn new things throughout their lives.\n\nDo they?  That's not necessarily been my experience. I've seen just as many academic scientists pigeonhole themselves and begin thinking rigidly as MDs.  Maybe even more so.  And I've seen plenty of PhDs who love money and status.\n\nI think the reality is being a quality person isn't a prerequisite for getting either degree.  And both are extremely difficult, in their own way.\n\nObviously, the person in the OP who made the \"fake doctor\" remark is an asshat, and I'm all for defending the value of working at and obtaining a PhD, but this whole \"I know you are, but what am I?\" attitude that springs up between PhDs and MDs just isn't doing either career path any favors.",

I was in a PhD program for a year and a half and hated it. I dropped out to preserve my sanity. When someone come out on the other side of that and has lost a part of themselves, and they latch on to the degree title... yeah it\u2019s insecure, but I think in some cases I\u2019ll let it slide.

They've also been super helpful in helping us by letting us know when weird street drugs and otc supplements start to show up more frequently, which allows us to screen earlier and more effectively.\n\nWe have one male and one female clinical pharmacist, and the female insists on being called doctor to highlight her role and establish a professional boundary because of some of the shit she has had to put up with from patients, staff, and other medical providers is mind boggling. Getting hit on by patients while treating them or treated like a go-fer (eg could you go-fer some coffee for everyone?) are some of the tamer stories.",
