The amount of respect and compensation that society gives physicians here is ridiculous. As a result, their egos are over inflated and disproportionate to their actual intellect and/or skills.\n\nThe reason why doctors are so pedestaled is manyfold but includes:\n\n1. There was a period during the last 200 years or so when medical knowledge was considered esoteric due to lack of overall scientific progress and the fact that the rest of society was largely uneducated. To be a doctor meant you had to in some cases be a graverobber so you could obtain anatomical samples to study. Thus, being a physician meant that you possessed almost occult knowledge which was worthy of awe.\n2. In places like the United States, the American Medical Association (and insurance industry) has almost cartel-like power - The AMA deliberately reduces the number of physicians available thus creating a shortage and subsequently commanding greater compensation as a result. The whole system over here is designed to perpetuate this status quo and keep physicians/insurers at the top.\n3. In a lot of places where socialized medicine is the norm - I'm from the UK - the fact that doctors by comparison do not out earn other learned professions by such magnitudes as they do in the US has resulted in a widespread exodus of physicians from the profession. Frankly, though some doctors are driven by altruism and a desire to help, the majority simply are not. This highlights that if a socialized model were ever to be accepted in the US, and their compensation were to fall commensurately - the exact same thing would happen here. The fact that doctors can easily pull in 200k + (on the low end) means that its probably worth it to eat all the proverbial shit that comes with looking after other people. Also, medical students are in huge debt and you are fucked if you quit before your debts are paid off.\n4. Medicine requires little to no lateral thinking or intellectual creativity. Its simply rote learning. This is the truth. You do not have to have a brilliant mind to excel in this, and it is one of the few \"academic\" professions where hard work can easily compensate for a lack of general intellect or idiocy. One thing I hated, for example, is that those who are perceived by seniors to be hard workers due to sheer inefficiency are the ones that get ahead.\n\nOverall - though there are some arguably brilliant minds in medicine, these are the vast minority. Medicine is unfortunately a cult of personality and an old-boys club. Stereotypes ring true. I have known plenty of drug addicts, those with criminal records and incredibly dense people to excel in the field.\n\nThe good thing is that I personally forsee an end to this hegemony. The rise of artificial intelligence will usher in an apocalypse for physicians.
