  "text": "Molecular biology--genetics, specifically. I'm in my 4th year, but I genuinely feel I was cheated out of my 3rd year because of the pandemic. I'm not making any progress, and I can't focus on my project and I just go through the motions. I'm supposed to have a committee meeting soon, but I have no idea what to tell them.\n\nAs an undergrad, even since high school, I loved genetics. I wanted to study epigenetics, and I have always wanted to be a researcher. I did undergrad research in bioinformatics, worked a few years in industry and academia to get wet lab experience, and moved clear across the USA to do my Ph.D. to study chromatin dynamics and gene expression. I burned out my first year in, and went through some deep personal trauma.\n\nI feel like I've never had structure or direction my entire time in the program. I've watched newer students come in and surpass me. I see others being successful, and I realize I don't have any excitement to see a project through week-to-week. I know now I most definitely don't want to stay in academia, but I still am pretty sure I want to be a researcher (private, government, or industry R&D).\n\nI want to rekindle my interest in this work, but I have no idea what to do. Help?\n\nTL;DR: Since high school, I've always been interested in genetics, and I've only ever worked towards completing a Ph.D. But starting sometime in year 2, I have just lost all excitement to keep doing this work. I watch everyone around me surpassing me because of it. What can I do to get my head in the game?",

      "text": "I think there are 2 options here.\n\n1) Take a break! Remove yourself from the high pressure environment and relax for a bit. When you go back, try to start fresh with a set 9-5 work day, and only go over that if you actually want to. \n\n2) Push through and hope something works soon. I've had some absolutely disastrous runs where nothing works for weeks to months, but then suddenly things start to work again and it is so exciting that all the passion comes back.\n\nOption 2 is much riskier, if you're already burnt out and dealing with personal things then it might just make things worse to push through. If you think this is still only a temporary setback though it might work.",
