He's starting his 3rd year of a PhD program. He ended up not going to his dream school so that we wouldn't have to be long distance during my one year MSc program.\n\nI've been putting my goals of getting a PhD on hold lately for several reasons, definitely some burnout after graduating with my master's during the pandemic, but more importantly because there are no universities nearby his university that have labs aligned with my research interests. \n\nI've kind of given up on my PhD dreams, but lately I've been worried that I won't be personally fulfilled in life if I don't do it. I want to get a PhD in Europe rather than the US, most importantly because the research I want to do is much more common there and also because they are shorter.\n\nI asked my partner what he would think about me moving to another country and he basically said that he would not want to try long distance. He said that he supports whatever decision I make as long as it makes me happy.\n\nI really love my partner and can't imagine my life without him, but I don't want to have regrets later in life where I wonder how different my life would be if I continued following this passion.

It was hard, but in the past decade or so I have built a new life in my new country, now have a career I love and an amazing spouse who is a more perfect match than the person I left even was.\n\nGiven how *young* you two are, and the statistic of 50% divorce rate and something like 60-70% of relationships will experience infidelity, it would be unfortunately not a safe bet the perfect, amazing partner you have now will be just as great in 5, or 10 years, or after life circumstances change. From 25, most people will change so much regarding what they want in life, and a sad fact, most people will want to still experience more partners before settling down.\n\nSo unfortunately, a very possible and even likely scenario would be you give up your dreams, career, idea for life in Europe, to stay with this person who you think now is an amazing match - you stay with them some more years with increasing discontent that your dreams/goals will now never be realised - and at some point, as is statistically so likely, one or both of you will cheat or grow emotionally distant and the relationship will fall apart. Then you will be 40, divorced, with no PhD, none of your dreams about living in Europe realized and now almost impossible to pursue, and a much crappier career than you wished.\n\nOr you could take the chance and take the leap to follow your lifelong dreams, and let the relationship evolve as it may. You could very likely build an amazing new life and career in Europe, and you will most definitely find another amazing relationship there as well. And you could live with no regrets, no wasted youth. Furthermore, he could be the one to realize that if he really loves you, he will follow you to Europe, or wait for you long-distance.\n\nOthers here are saying academia and grad school do not love you - this is true - but they also give you something that *no one* and nothing will ever be able to take away from you - your credentials, your education, and the experience you had doing it. It's far more unstable imo to rely on a single human to always be there for you and give you support, given how incredibly unstable and cheat-y and selfish and horny humans are just by their nature.\n\nTLDR: how can you give up such a substantial dream for the whims of an individual *person*, who may just as easily break up with you in the future?

I ended up finishing my masters and deciding not to pursue a PhD. I partly chose to do it because of health reasons and partly because it didn\u2019t make sense for our family. We wanted to have kids and even a program with a stipend wouldn\u2019t cover the cost of childcare.\n\nDo I regret it? When I\u2019ve had a sleepless week because the baby woke up every night and breakfast is taking forever to make alongside a screechy toddler, sometimes for a moment. But most of the time, I don\u2019t regret giving up 5 years of my life to undergo grueling studies for something that wouldn\u2019t guarantee me a decent paying job (since it\u2019s in the humanities). I look at the problems in academia today and now that I\u2019m a few years out, I am glad to not have to deal with them. I enjoy my time gardening and learning about the soil microbiome. We are launching a little free library for our neighborhood. We are working on sponsoring some refugees. These are pursuits I would not have time for if I were in a PhD program. I listen to audiobooks on my favorite subjects when I clean the house, and I actively support some organizations in the field so I stay in touch with those interests.\n\nMost of all, my children are 3 and 1 when I am 31. If we have more children as I get older, they will be old enough to provide help with their younger siblings. Their grandparents are in their 50s and 70s respectively. I am looking forward to being 40 and having trained my kids how to clean their grandparents\u2019 houses for them when they are 80 and too old to do so themselves. If we waited another 5-10 years to kids (with a PhD and then tenure track), we would be dealing with lots of baby care and lots of elder care all at once. So it\u2019s also obvious that I would have regrets if I took the PhD track instead.

It\u2019s a two way street and everyone involved has to be on board understanding that. \n\nBiggest logistics questions are: Is there absolutely no one in the states doing the research you want to do, and if there aren\u2019t are you intending to permanently relocate to Europe? Otherwise that PhD focusing on that research can potentially be virtually useless in the states if no one is doing the research. Not because it isn\u2019t good science but because that means no one is funding it here.\n\nPersonal questions/considerations are things only you can answer. It sounds like he compromised on his PhD program some for the relationship. Would he be open to moving anywhere in the US after finishing his program, or is he not very open to that? Are you happy right now with your current career positions? If so, perhaps take a few more years for him to finish his program and get some post doc jobs out of the way, and when he is more firmly positioned in his career field reevaluate the situation. That would give him more to work with as far as being able to be more selective in his job selection and not just having to take whatever post doc positions he can find, and gives you some time to really decide if the PhD is something you actually want, and something you don\u2019t just want to be disappointed about not getting.\n\nPhD\u2019s aren\u2019t easy, but many people that don\u2019t have one could get one. The biggest hurdles always seem to be emotional and mental tolls (I\u2019m sure you\u2019re perfectly aware of those though, as your partner is doing one).\n\nI would just suggest making sure you really think it all through and don\u2019t do something rash simply because you\u2019re scared of how you\u2019ll feel in a few years, and not waiting to see if that\u2019s how you\u2019ll actually feel.

However, I think once he realised that he wasn't ready to settle because the needs of the relationship could simply not be accommodated, he already knew that in the choice of me vs pursuing other goals he would not compromise his own pursuits. I think once you as an individual reach that point, it should be transparently communicated and acted upon.
