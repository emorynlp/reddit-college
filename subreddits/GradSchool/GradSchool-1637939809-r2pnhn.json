  "title:": "Does Cornell acknowledge when they receive your electronic IELTS score report?",
  "text": "Basically the title. My PhD program needs to have received IELTS scores before the application deadline (1st December). I sent mine weeks ago (electronically, as asked) from the IDP IELTS website to \u2018Cornell University Graduate Admissions\u2019. \n\nHowever, I have received no email from the university that they have received my score report and it doesn\u2019t show up on my application either, like it does for some other schools. \n\nDoes anyone have any insights? Did you get an acknowledge of your electronic score report being received? \n\nTIA!",
