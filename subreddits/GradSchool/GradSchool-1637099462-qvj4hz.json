  "text": "Is anyone else doing fine in grad school & have a great advisor & labmates but you want to quit?\n\n2nd year. Published paper first year. But I can\u2019t bring myself to work more than one day of the week on my research and it\u2019s just turned into a frustrating, hateful cycle. And now I constantly stress about whether I should drop out or not. Plus my PhD is in ME & my research is in machine learning. Bc of my research + last internship, I realized I want my career to be in ML or CS related (nothing at all to do with mechanical engineering). So now that\u2019s also weighing on me\u2014 the fact that if I wanted a job in these industries I wouldn\u2019t be very competitive after grad school (bc I\u2019m pretty much self studying programming and some of ML as I go). Plus it feels silly having a PhD in ME when I don\u2019t even like ME anymore. No passion or interest for it anymore. \n\nI\u2019m just lost on what to do because the topic, advisor, and lab are all great but I just can\u2019t self- motivate myself anymore. Probably bc of anxiety I feel related to my future career & how what I\u2019m doing now doesn\u2019t best align with it (especially compared to just getting an MS in CS). \n\nAnyone else in the same boat?",

      "text": "Goodness, me too. First-year of a PhD in English. I'm doing surprisingly well given how little I want to keep doing this, I feel like I'm putting effort in but it's just out of like... not having anything else to do rather than any sort of passion I may have had at one point. I feel like I should be failing, at least I feel like I've failed in every sense but the marks I've been getting in my coursework - I'm emotionally disconsolate, I'm stringing everything together by the skin of my teeth, I'm running out of money, but I'm getting through nonetheless.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm in my first term of a four-year program so it's probably easier for me to leave than it would be for you (and I am going to leave). But your situation sounds similar to mine, you might question whether the misery is worth it for an end you don't care about anymore.",

I\u2019m not sure if it was difficult or not since this person was gone by the time I got there but it is definitely possible. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure this person did not start off with ML. It seemed like half their PhD was on mechanical engineering research and the the other half was using machine learning. \n\nI would say that you would be pretty competitive if you graduate grad school with ML projects under your belt. If you have any question you can DM.",

You may even be able to switch over to EE on paper but keep the same advisor? Or have a nominal advisor in EE but still mostly work with your current lab group. \n\nOn the wanting to quit thing: I\u2019m going through my 3rd academic year now and am back and forth on this all the time for the last year. Take some time away if you can, and if not, try to immerse yourself in something totally new to rekindle the spark: a conference, trip to another nearby institution, work directly with a collaborator for a bit - anything to break the current day-to-day which gets insufferable, if for no other reason than that it seems endless and relentless. Try to close that chapter for a bit and turn to something new if you can.",

      "text": "I sometimes go through phases when I also struggle with my work and consider quitting. I\u2019m doing quite well, but have hit some nasty bumps along my journey, which largely stemmed from my PI. \n\nMy research, while incredibly interesting\u2026 relies on a demanding process. Most of my work is in vivo, and a full experiment can take months. I don\u2019t particularly care for some of the unpleasant tasks (harvesting blood and organs at 5am, then staying into the late evening in a single day). It\u2019s really disheartening when you have to repeat those experiments. 2 months lost, life lost, an 18 hour day wasted. \n\nWhenever I start to feel this way, I\u2019ve learned to take a small break. I\u2019ll change up my routine and focus on writing for a bit, or just take some time to have fun. I find that once I have a breather, I can get back into the game and enjoy my research more. \n\nHowever, if you constantly dislike your research, or the research process\u2026 it could be a sign that this isn\u2019t the right career for you. And that\u2019s totally okay!",
