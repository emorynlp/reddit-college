  "text": "between research, going to labs for fabrication, simulations, courses and meetings, god damn is it excruciating to grade homeworks. i don't know if it's my lot or not, but undergrads lack the basic courtesy of writing equations in order, or even have readable handwriting. i used to read lab reports in undergrad, at least those were digital and i didn't have to spend my remaining braincells trying to decipher what was written. just reading 35 homeworks (multiple subquestions, but still) has taken me more than 3 hours. anybody in the same boat?",

      "text": "I definitely appreciate the TAs I had in undergrad much more. However, I always had a pretty removed relationship with my TAs (never really emailed or sought them out unless I had a lab with them). I definitely never bothered them about a grade I was given. My experience as a TA is mind-boggling. I am constantly receiving rude and entitled emails about the grades students were given by me and my fellow TAs (and I tend to be on the generous side). I can't even fathom doing that to my TAs in undergrad and I'm wondering whether this is an increasing trend or if I was unaware that my classmates in undergrad were secretly harassing the TAs",

      "text": "The courses I taught rarely ever had to have things written by hand, but on those occasions where an assignment would need to be written, I would tell students that it needs to be legible by me in order for it to be assigned a grade. \n\nI also learned really quickly to specify what my expectations were in the assignment instructions, because students won't learn if you just tell them in class or remind them in feedback on their assignments (which they often don't read). They will, however, learn if you take points off for not following directions. For example, I required Word documents only because in the past students would think they were cheating on their word count by making the periods larger in every sentence so the essay took up more space. It's difficult to detect that in PDF, but super easy in Word. Nevertheless, I would get PDF's, google sheets (which I often could not access because I was not given permission to access it...lol?) and other random formats until I started taking off points and assigning 0's in instances where I couldn't access the assignment. \n\nSome folks got a bit of a hitch in their cognitive get along, but nothing a swift kick in the form of reduced points won't fix, hopefully.",

I used to be kind of salty about it, but now that I'm a TA in grad school, looking back I honestly just think he was going through a mental breakdown because of all the work on his plate. Like the poor guy taught 3 sections of a chem lab with 45 students in a section and had to do all the prep for lab and grade a lab report every single week and I looked at his linkedin once and realized he was in his 3rd year that semester and was probably doing his quals... yeah, I get it. I have no hard feelings towards him anymore.",

Stick it at the bottom of the page. Do some kind of work at the top. And then go to the bottom and kind of work backwards from the answer in some way. \n\nFinally, add some chicken scratch in the middle of the page.
