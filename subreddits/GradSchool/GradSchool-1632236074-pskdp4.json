  "text": "Hey everyone, I am applying for grad school next year and am wanting to do a MA/PhD program for sociology. The problem is, my undergrad degree is in Business analytics (something I hate) and l\u2019m pursuing sociology because I know I would genuinely enjoy it. A lot of schools are asking for a sample of written scholarly work and because I was in Business school I basically have none. Any advice on this and also on how to adapt from a business background? I wad an AA Studies minor briefly but dropped it because I wouldn\u2019t graduate on time and have a couple of short papers I wrote for that but other than that,nothing. Any tips or advice would be awesome! Thank you!!",
