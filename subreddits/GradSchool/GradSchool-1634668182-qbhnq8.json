  "text": "Stressed. Burnt out. Emotionally drained. These are some of the words I\u2019d use to describe how I\u2019ve been feeling over the last few months. I\u2019m a second-year Master\u2019s student in Industrial-Organizational psychology (basically, the study of work and how to make work not suck), but I already feel so *over* everything. Bureaucracy, no work-life balance, being overworked and underpaid, coworkers that I don\u2019t like and don\u2019t like me...these are all things that I\u2019ve identified as major stressors in my life, but I know that they will await me after I graduate and I'm working in the industry. I feel trapped, though, like my whole life has fulminated in me earning my degree and breaking the cycle of generational poverty and undereducation in my family, and that I can\u2019t have come this far for nothing. I don\u2019t know what to do. Is this a sign that I should change career paths? Drop out? Go on an 8-month trek through the wilderness? I would appreciate any advice or kind words a bunch.",

      "text": "Hey, sorry to hear your going through all this. Graduate study is hard, but you\u2019ve made it this far, so please take some solace in that. Of all your options, I\u2019d take the 8-month trek through the wilderness! In all seriousness, I\u2019d consider taking a few days away just to try and reset, reassess your priorities, and make a plan for your future. I wouldn\u2019t recommend dropping out or changing career path unless you know for certain that you hate the profession and can\u2019t see any future in it at all. It sounds like a lot of these problems are temporary and just need some thought to improve. Maybe a talk with your supervisor could also add a different perspective. As for the co-worker situation, you\u2019ll have other colleagues in the future that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get along better with, relationships take time and require a lot of work and effort to get anywhere. \n\nGood luck!",
