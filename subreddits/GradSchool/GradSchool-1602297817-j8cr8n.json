One big reason that is universally true is: you work better when you are rested. You obviously won't work optimally when you only sleep 4 hours. You have to reread paragraphs or switch between tasks because you realize you are too tired to do A, so you switch to task B, then C, without actually getting a lot done. And you work generally slower.  \n\nAnother reason is not always true but generally not taught well to students: how to actually organise your work in a way to avoid the things above. That includes setting monthly/weekly/daily goals, prioritizing correctly and getting in a daily workflow that works for you. For a lot of people that means tackling the harder tasks first and leaving easier stuff for later when they are more tired and being more strict on actually taking one big break instead of randomly procrastinating in small intervals.
