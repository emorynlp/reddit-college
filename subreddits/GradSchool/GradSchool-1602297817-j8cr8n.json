  "text": "I welcome challenging work, I embrace the craziness, the varied schedule, the deep dive into science, the research, the perplexing conversations, teaching, late nights thinking and planning \u2014-  but I cannot handle these 4 hrs of sleep per night every night, being too tired to move or show up and make space for my loved ones, my mental health deteriorating living in this insane moment in society. I refuse to believe grad school has to be this way in order to be successful, to have to sacrifice so much just to get through a day. Then day in and day out the same. So I\u2019m putting in some hard boundaries and if I cannot find a way to get my work done in that time then so be it. And if it means I don\u2019t make the cut and have to leave school, then so be it!",

      "text": "There are studies that show that people who work 8h a day are far more productive than people who work more (especially once you go to the extremes).  \nThe reason is simple: those who work 8h get more work done and work more optimally. One big reason that is universally true is: you work better when you are rested. You obviously won't work optimally when you only sleep 4 hours. You have to reread paragraphs or switch between tasks because you realize you are too tired to do A, so you switch to task B, then C, without actually getting a lot done. And you work generally slower.  \n\nAnother reason is not always true but generally not taught well to students: how to actually organise your work in a way to avoid the things above. That includes setting monthly/weekly/daily goals, prioritizing correctly and getting in a daily workflow that works for you. For a lot of people that means tackling the harder tasks first and leaving easier stuff for later when they are more tired and being more strict on actually taking one big break instead of randomly procrastinating in small intervals. Turning off email notifications and similar things and instead only checking on these things at set times also helps many.",

You should definitely get all your work done, but it can be done to varying degrees of perfection. So much of grad school is time management. Skim the things that aren\u2019t as relevant to your areas of focus or that aren\u2019t foundational, spend more time on the big things. Then again, when you\u2019re just starting, everything seems important because it\u2019s all new and you don\u2019t have a mental framework for it yet. That comes with time. But there\u2019s no replacement for hard work. I hate when people say work smarter not harder. What does that even mean? Hard work is a good thing. Sleeping enough and making time for hobbies and social connections is also a good thing. But at least in the readings with grad school, I\u2019ve found that if you want to take a deep dive it\u2019s important to do the work because otherwise you\u2019re missing out on important insights and opportunities to ask questions about the things you don\u2019t understand. You can get away with doing less, but you get out what you put in. Doesn\u2019t preclude sleeping or any of that. Need to be strategic about where you spend your energy.",

I'm an older grad student with young kids too, who I am homeschooling (COVID,  not be choice) in addition to finishing my MA classes FT, thesis, lab duties, TA, PhD apps and I give myself one day off per week.  I schedule my reading time by knowing my page reading speed. I schedule my work days in 30 minute increments outside of class, lab and longer meetings.  I know how long it takes me to write papers, thus my thesis, applications, school work...I do psych research... are all measureable by an average per page time that includes research time. This time has gone down as I have started specializing in my niche and have a well organized research library for my specialty on Dropbox.  I spend a week prior to each semester plotting syllabi on a calendar with due dates and estimates of ~time to complete assignments and readings, based on my ~reading,  writing, grading (essays vs discussion), TA, class time, lab time, publication time and schedule every last bit in.  I spend 2 hours on Sunday evenings looking for syllabi changes, moving around my schedule to accommodate my children's school needs  and organizing my whole week into increments (chunking), varying  assignments and readings,  scheduling break times, sit outside and  hate existence time, and I follow it. I, also, refuse to become the stereotypical grad student martyr and participate in the \"who works harder and longer hours\" pissing contests notorious in academia.  I will work smarter and shorter than everyone else and benefit from being well rested and significantly less anxious because I have everything planned and I know I have the time to complete it. Not that this works for everyone,  but the frontloaded organization makes me one of the most peaceful grad students I know. And yeah the initial time investment sucks, but I am so much happier than the rest of my cohort. Also, I am a MA student and recognize the variety of graduate programs,  I plan to employ the exact same strategy if I am accepted into one of the PhD programs I am applying to.",

I really believe that the level of initiative and discipline you\u2019ve described will make you a very lucky catch for whatever PhD program accepts you!",

I know that I am fortunate that my family hasn't been impacted by COVID and my hubs actually was hired at a UC in his, basic, dream role and so we have dodged the financial hardships of the pandemic.  After that disclaimer,  holy crap am I getting so much more done not going to campus 5 days a week and driving around like a crazy soccer mom to drop off and pick up my kids from every place in the known universe. \n\nI  hope to get to the  done with classes;  research, data analysis and mentoring point of my education and get to where you are!  I'm happy doing research and analysis in some dark empty hole in perpetuity.",

I think the biggest problem is the lack of empathy and simple miscommunication by both student and mentor that is left so rampantly unchecked.",

He started having us meet weekly for \"30 minutes\" which was actually closer to 2 hours to set weekly goals that were more reasonable for maybe 2 weeks. Said I needed to put in more work than 80+ hours while putting me on any possible project that needed help in the lab. Said I was too stupid for grad school. Went to my program director after 4.5 years when I was on the verge of losing it. Went no contact and they said he couldn't directly contact me. Really fucking hate that guy.",

Like fuck off, you treated me like shit, I think you're a terrible person. Like you said, that stress of meeting with them and just dreading it was terrible. He always wanted to meet at 8 am which sucked for a 45 min - 1 hr commute, tired as fuck, knowing you were about to get guilted/gaslighted/demeaned for a significant portion of your day. Glad you made it out of there, it was a very liberating experience for me, but I took a 6 month leave of absence just to get over all the self-doubt and hate that he had imposed on me from his actions.\n\nMine really liked having a conversation at the end of every quarter to \"evaluate if I would pass\", holding that over me and how if I failed I would have to leave school. Of course he would always pass me and then add on more 'expectations' for the next quarter. \n\nI was always amazed that we had postdocs join the lab after myself, another grad student, and a tech would take them out to diner. I should've been more blunt and direct in telling them that it was miserable, they would hate it, and they should never take the position. Of course he really liked micromanaging one person and going all in on them, so while I was miserable everyone else was ok, but knew that I was getting railroaded.",
