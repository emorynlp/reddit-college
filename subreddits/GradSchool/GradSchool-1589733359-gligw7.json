I took some weeks that I essentially just read random papers and articles with more or less relevance and took time to develop some ideas. Most of it probably will not transpire into your project, but maybe there's a few thoughts here and there that may come in handy at some time.\n2. No Zero days. Break your tasks down in tiny steps and make a list of these steps or a mindmap or whatever appeals to you (my recommendation:  [https://mimind.cryptobees.com/](https://mimind.cryptobees.com/) ). It's infinitely helpful to deliver a sense of progression, even if the steps are supersmall - ticking off items from a list is very satisfying and generates a feeling of having done something instead of nothing at the end of the day.\n3. Be gentle to yourself. Incidence rates of depression soar among PhD students, so in a way, we are obviously working in a hazardous environment. What I mean: When you develop new ideas, tick off items from your list or whatever it is that you are doing - don't be harsh on yourself. It's easy to develop a bad spirit, so don't push it. Take your time.\n4. Make plans: It takes some time (maybe a few days?) but I always found it helpful to draw up some sort of timetable. Where do I see myself in 2 months, 6 months, 1 year? Take this time and then, re-evaluate again. If you still feel the same in half a year - you may want to reconsider pursuing this particular project.
