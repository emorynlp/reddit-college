  "text": "I am losing my interest in being in a PhD program because of this pandemic. I don\u2019t know if anyone else is dealing with this, or if this is a sign of depression. To be honest, I have been dealing with some major health issues since spring break, so my research has not been on the top of my priority list right now. Plus, with the probability of a nonexistent job market next year, I don\u2019t even know if getting a PhD is worth it. Also, I just finished my first year, so I am nowhere close to finishing. \n\nI don\u2019t know, maybe this is just a phase because of everything going on in my life. I was just hoping others could relate.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words. I didn\u2019t realize there were so many other students going through this. I think motherhood and my health are most important right now. I appreciate everyone\u2019s comments.",

Esoteric research that no one really cares about outside of academia?\n\nIt doesn't help that when we DO go back, it's going to be one person to a lab at a time, and no group offices. I'm not nearly independent in the lab yet, I'm going to be scared of breaking stuff and having no one there to help. Not to mention that hanging out with my group in the offices was one of my favorite parts of grad school.",

What is happening at my university is happening across the country. \n\n* Our R1 university is proposing pay cuts and benefit decreases to 8,229 union workers as part of their contract bargaining sessions. \n\n* Unprotected instructors and non-tenure faculty are being fired or not-renewed left and right. \n\n* No hazard pay\n\n* Out of state tuition rip offs for so many students for rushed online courses. I don't want undergrads paying $1,500 a credit for what should be a $320 a credit online course. \n\n* 1.1% of the university workforce makes 36% of the wages (according to public wage disclosures), and they have not had any repercussions\n\n* Grad workers were forced to re-tool, re-organize, and remotely teach without any course development assistance or tech budget \n\n* The university is rushing to reopen while laying off and furloughing classified staff\n\n* The on-campus student health center is being CLOSED and the property landlorded off to a private company, under the guise of austerity \n\nIn all of this, 3 out of 4 people I live with have lost jobs. Amidst the pandemic... \n\n* My advisor for the first time in 4 years tells me I am not working enough (her and her husband make over $250,000 a year... they make as much as our whole house does every month). No sympathy for our inability to pay rent and the extreme mental duress we have been suffering with, and that I have been very transparent with. \n\n* Just got a very nasty, personally offensive peer review, feels disheartening to think of a future in such a machismo engineering academic field as a queer woman (where is the nurturing?)\n\n* My committee had one member fired to \"save costs\" and the overall vibe was acceptance by others, outrage by me and the fired committee member \n\nR1 public universities just seem rotten to the core. My advisor wants me to continue and always tells me of how great tenure and the benefits and the pay is. What happened to the students? I feel like if I did teach, I would love to teach at a community college or something. Big universities are ran like hedge fund corporations, no cuts to athletics while workers and students suffer.",

I will hand in my PhD thesis in the months to come and the lockdowns actually gave me some direly needed time away from my desk to wrap everything up.\n\nHowever, I do remember the feeling of uselessness and depression in the mid-PhD phase all too well. Felt like it wasn't going anywhere, pointless anyway, underappreciated, underpaid, overworked, the whole spectrum.\n\nThere were a few points that got me through it:\n\n1. Reading. I took some weeks that I essentially just read random papers and articles with more or less relevance and took time to develop some ideas. Most of it probably will not transpire into your project, but maybe there's a few thoughts here and there that may come in handy at some time.\n2. No Zero days. Break your tasks down in tiny steps and make a list of these steps or a mindmap or whatever appeals to you (my recommendation:  [https://mimind.cryptobees.com/](https://mimind.cryptobees.com/) ). It's infinitely helpful to deliver a sense of progression, even if the steps are supersmall - ticking off items from a list is very satisfying and generates a feeling of having done something instead of nothing at the end of the day.\n3. Be gentle to yourself. Incidence rates of depression soar among PhD students, so in a way, we are obviously working in a hazardous environment. What I mean: When you develop new ideas, tick off items from your list or whatever it is that you are doing - don't be harsh on yourself. It's easy to develop a bad spirit, so don't push it. Take your time.\n4. Make plans: It takes some time (maybe a few days?) but I always found it helpful to draw up some sort of timetable. Where do I see myself in 2 months, 6 months, 1 year? Take this time and then, re-evaluate again. If you still feel the same in half a year - you may want to reconsider pursuing this particular project. Who knows how the world will look like in half a year?\n\nHope any of this helps. It's a tough time. You're not alone with it!",

Now I feel completely uninterested in my research and that I should just get one of those cushy tech/consultant jobs that pays six figures to live in a major city. I feel like my research doesn't matter, and I'm sick of struggling so hard to stay in academia when they are constantly pulling the plug permanent positions. I keep thinking: why am I hustling so hard to make completely shit wages and not have any choice about where I live to stay in a profession that is increasingly precarious and exploitive?",

Now it's like, I wake up, walk to my kitchen table and stare at my computer screen for 8 hours a day and then get up at the end of the day with at most a paragraph written. \n\nWe are starting to talk about opening the lab back up but like, we still aren't going to be able to see anyone. We have to sit in separate rooms alone for half days with the doors closed. Slightly better than sitting at home all day, but still not adequate social interaction for me.\n\nI realize I'm absolutely depressed but like, what am I supposed to do about it?

Once I gave myself the time and space to deal with that, my passion came back. I definitely love my research and don\u2019t doubt my future in it, but I can see how it\u2019s hard to judge what your feelings mean based on what people on the internet say.
