One of my professors told me that I should email professors who I am interested in working with before I apply. Is this a hard requirement? Do I just email them out of the blue? What do I say? I have crazy social anxiety, so I could really use some guidance. \n\nAlso, how aligned does a professor's research interests have to be with mine? I'm interested in African American literature, technology/science, and DH. Should I only email professors who research all of these, or could I reach out to professors who study one or two?\n\nThanks for your help everyone :)", "author": "johnhenryroadkill", "created": 1631845950, "retrieved": 1632952524, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 28, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdaew34": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pprjz6/do_i_have_to_email_professors_who_i_am_interested/hdaew34/", "text": "From personal experience, you can send cold emails: emailing them with an introduction to who you are, your major, what you want to get a PhD in. It's also good to mention how you believe your research interests align with the prospective faculty member's. And then just let them know you're interested in working with them, potentially and that you're wondering if they're taking students for this upcoming cycle (reference the specific cycle year for clarity). I found that most professors will get back to you eventually, and be upfront with you on whether they think you'd be a good fit with them, and if they can take students. Some may not respond, and that's good for you bc that's one person you know not to apply for. \n\nSome may surprise you and invite you for a phonecall or zoom meeting, to discuss their research and yours further. If you can, try to make the meeting. Though, be wary of asking for a meeting first email, bc some institutions have politics against that sort of thing, for admission purposes. \n\nYou could also see if any professors at your undergrad are in contact with professors you're interested in. I've had that happen, and mentors or professors sent emails to introduce me to the faculty member elsewhere, which is pretty cool too. \n\nAs far as research interests, try to not aim for people with direct research interests matching completely. This is a personal preference, but I wanted the same thing when I first started applying and I am currently being advised by a faculty member who doesn't research the group of people I'm interested in, but he has skills I'm interested in, and he is very compassionate and encouraging. I've said all that to say, try to not get caught up in finding someone who's an exact perfect match. But do try to find a department with more than one professor that can support your research interests, and maybe even a few outside of the department that can support you, for courses outside of the department, and potential committee members. \n\nSo...yeah. God bless and hope you get amazing offers from all of your top choices with faculty members you want to work with.

Don't be hurt if they never reply - faculty are often extremely busy and extremely focused on the names and things they DO know, rather than newcomers and \"outsiders\" to the institution/department. Not all faculty are receptive to \"cold emails,\" and not all are the best at replying - do not take it personally and do not think that a lack of reply means a lack of admission. Like other users, I was admitted to a program where the faculty contact didn't reply (I actually took a class with them and they were/are hugely busy with administrative and research matters). I didn't contact any faculty at the program I now attend either!\n\nAs far as alignment with faculty/research areas \u2013 it's great you know your overall areas of interest! You will likely build a committee for your reading exams or dissertation, so you may have faculty from different specializations who have different vantage points. That's to say that not all AfAm specialists or DH researchers are alike - and when these interests are combined, they may not always combine in the same way. You can absolutely collaborate with different faculty in different capacities, and work with your committee on a project that could combine all of your interests. (Though you'll want to know the department climate before you do so ... academic feuds can be ridiculous.)", "author": "DenseSemicolon", "created": 1631854397, "upvotes": 1}, "hd63pno": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pprjz6/do_i_have_to_email_professors_who_i_am_interested/hd63pno/", "text": "Definitely not a hard requirement, but getting in touch with professors you\u2019d most like to work with could be helpful. However, this is NOT a guaranteed strategy as some professors may not have time to communicate with potential students when they have more pressing matters. Even if professors do meet with you, they may not have sway over admissions or want to stick their neck out for someone they don\u2019t know well.\n\nDuring my application cycle, I received a PhD offer after meeting with and showing genuine interest in working with a particular professor/ potential supervisor. (Not saying this was the only reason I received the offer, but I imagined it helped to have a professor on the committee willing to advocate for me.) Conversely, I was rejected from another institution (albeit a more prestigious one) after doing the same with another professor.\n\nRemember that the professors you\u2019re reaching out to could be potential colleagues, future mentors, or regulars at conferences you\u2019ll attend. Try your best not to sound like you\u2019re only reaching out to land a spot in the program as it may leave a bad impression. Make sure to be respectful as possible, keep things professional, and don\u2019t take ghosting to heart.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did when I reached out to professors:\n1. Kept my emails as short as possible\n2. Had a boiler plate introduction, but ensured the rest of my email was personalized\n3. Explained I was reaching out to find out more about the program and the professor\u2019s research\n4. Explained why I was interested in working with the professor\n5. Tried my best not to sound like I was entitled to the professor\u2019s time or a place in the department\n6.
