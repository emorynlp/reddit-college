Find a job in that industry to first see if it\u2019s a good fit that you want to continue with and to narrow your interests.\n\nIf after a few years of working you find that having a masters degree is going to help your career, go for it! An MPP, MPA, or MA in a relevant field seems like it might certainly be very helpful. Some employers will even pay for your masters degree! Anecdotally as well, I\u2019m in a related MA program right now. There\u2019s tons of mid-career students in both my program and the MPP program at my school.",

I didn't feel particularly educated and I wanted to delve deeper into some questions I had about my field, so I pursued a MS degree.

At least with a PhD program, I feel more confident that, while I might not know the answer to whatever question I might have, I will have the skillset to better able to come up with an answer on my own. It's one thing to aimlessly pontificate, it's another to contribute intelligently to a discussion about a field where two people have three opinions (politics). \n\nI am also first gen, so I also kind of figured that if I was the first in my family to go to college, why not also be the first in my family to get a PhD?",

Does your current program have advisors you can talk to about what going to grad school would mean for you career-wise? You also don't have to go directly into grad school. Taking a year or two to work and explore can help you to not only figure out if you want/need a graduate degree but also what exactly you want to be doing in one. You'll have a much clearer sense of what you want that way. From graduating undergrad in 2018, I didn't start a grad program until 2020 and I then switched programs this year (I got into my dream program, which really cinched the switch for me). If I had gone directly into grad school from undergrad, I would have been in a totally different field and I would not be as excited by what I was doing. Don't be afraid to take your time!",
