      "text": "Never seems a bit extreme.  I don\u2019t think it either gets you in the door or ends with the door slamming in your face.  It\u2019s just not surprising that it\u2019s the case and it\u2019s very common.  Most people go into psychology because they are interested in themselves and other people.  And it\u2019s fine if your own experiences or family experiences sparked your initial interest.   Concerns do arise if there is a sense that these challenges may compromise your ability to successfully complete your graduate studies or clinical training in a timely manner.  However, these things are typical starting places.  Tell them what you did after your initial was sparked.  What\u2019s maintained your interest? How have you engaged with psychology since that time? How have you expanded you\u2019re knowledge and experiences beyond your personal experiences? Unless you communicate these or other things it sort of leaves the assessors with the feeling of is that all?  If you go on and on about it, it\u2019s not been very long and the issue was not effectively dealt with it can backfire and end up raising concerns.",

      "text": "I think the key element is to avoid uncomfortable over sharing. For example, I would avoid something like, \u201cMy mother had schizophrenia and often screamed at us and left us alone while I was growing up. It was very scary and made me depressed, and now I want to help people with schizophrenia.\u201d\n\nYou could briefly say something broad like, \u201cI first became interested in clinical psychology when a loved one experienced some challenging mental health issues. Since then, my interest has evolved (in this way).\u201d \n\nAnd you want to base it on more than just your friend/family/self. There should be other elements to your motivation/goals",
