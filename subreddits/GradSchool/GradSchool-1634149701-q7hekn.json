  "text": "I am planning to apply for a few Student Affairs programs this Fall, but I am slightly concerned about my letters of rec. I was a fairly average student and although I participated somewhat often in class discussions, I never went out of my way to get to know professors further. Additionally, my undergrad degrees were in Criminology and Psychology; areas not related to the master\u2019s I\u2019m planning to pursue.\n\nHow should I reach out to previous professor\u2019s? Should I be concerned that they are not technically in the same field?",
