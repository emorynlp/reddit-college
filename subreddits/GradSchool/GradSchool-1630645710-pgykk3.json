There isn't any protagonists/antagonists or character development you need to follow, so feel free to read papers in a non-linear fashion.\n\nOften times I start off my reading from concepts within the paper that I already know, then work my way from there. It gives me an \"anchor\" that I can reliably go back to if I am lost.\n\nIf you cannot find an anchoring point, it probably means that the contents of the paper is beyond your current scope of knowledge. If so, you should go back to the introduction to look for preceding papers that you need to read to get started, read those instead.\n\nBe *generous with your annotations and underlining/circling/highlighting*. Skim through the paper to highlight and annotate any keywords or concepts that you want to include in your notes. Look up definitions of words and concepts, and annotate them directly on the paper. This helps you \"pre-digest\" the information, so it makes it easier when you re-read the paper and start preparing notes.\n\nAim to write notes after you pre-digested the paper, this will help you make the information available in an effective and organized format. Use summaries, flowcharts, and even doodles if you have to.\n\nThat being said, I also take several days to read a paper (making sure I leave enough breadcrumbs to follow between each reading session), because I need the time to rest and internalize the ideas/concepts.
