Once you have an overview and understand the different approaches to the solution, go back to those which fit you best and double-check all the detail to know you've really understood it.  \n\n\nthat way you are not 'reading' rather you are problem solving, and those papers are just a tool you are using.",

      "text": "Reading papers are more about extracting information than actually \"reading\" them like a novel. There isn't any protagonists/antagonists or character development you need to follow, so feel free to read papers in a non-linear fashion.\n\nOften times I start off my reading from concepts within the paper that I already know, then work my way from there. It gives me an \"anchor\" that I can reliably go back to if I am lost.\n\nIf you cannot find an anchoring point, it probably means that the contents of the paper is beyond your current scope of knowledge. If so, you should go back to the introduction to look for preceding papers that you need to read to get started, read those instead.\n\nBe *generous with your annotations and underlining/circling/highlighting*. Skim through the paper to highlight and annotate any keywords or concepts that you want to include in your notes. Look up definitions of words and concepts, and annotate them directly on the paper. This helps you \"pre-digest\" the information, so it makes it easier when you re-read the paper and start preparing notes.\n\nAim to write notes after you pre-digested the paper, this will help you make the information available in an effective and organized format. Use summaries, flowcharts, and even doodles if you have to.\n\nThat being said, I also take several days to read a paper (making sure I leave enough breadcrumbs to follow between each reading session), because I need the time to rest and internalize the ideas/concepts. So maybe try pacing your readings using the Pomodoro method (e.g. read 45 minutes, rest 15 minutes have some water and a snack, repeat).",

Oftentimes, a research article will be related to what we are interested in in some way, but not *every* way so much of things like the literature review can be skipped. Especially so if you're already mostly familiar with the popular concepts and theories. I skip whole sections labeled with certain keywords because I'm already familiar with the theories they're going to talk about and just continue to the experiment and the discussion. If I'm unclear on their interpretation, I will then go back and read sections of the literature review.",

Usually there\u2019s a sentence that skips all the bs and just goes, \u201cin this paper we describe X, Y, and Z\u201d or, \u201cIn this paper we did X, Y, Z.\u201d For me, this is usually FAR more helpful than even reading the abstract!\n\nFrom there, I usually skip to the conclusion and read that or most of it, and then you\u2019ve got the idea of kind of what they did and what they concluded from it.

I have this format that I use:\n\n- Motivation: <this is where you will write about the \"motivation\" behind the paper you are reading, this should be clear after reading through abstract + intro>\n\nIf you read through the motivation part, and it aligns with the content you are looking for, then move onto the next step, which is:\n\n- Objective: <What does this paper propose? new technique?>\n\nIf you are still interested, then now.\n\n- Key points: <What are the key points of the proposal technique?> \n\nSo this part may require a bit deeper reading. However, in my opinion, by this part, you should probably know what you are curious about how they implemented it. Does it require you to read the whole thing? Then go ahead, I'm not saying you shouldn't, but if you can just look at the figures, for instance, to figure out the key technique they apply to their work, this could be included in this section.\n\n- Limitations: Finally, you want to find the limitation of this work. This can be done by either looking at other papers that have cited this paper you are reading (because they will definitely have some comment regarding this work if they are citing it) or just thinking about it a bit, I suppose.\n\nI hope this is helpful, and good luck to you.",
