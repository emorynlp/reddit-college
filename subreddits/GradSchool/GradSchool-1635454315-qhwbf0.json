  "text": " \n\nI'm not sure if this is the right thread (sorry if not)\n\nI'm getting my master's degree in cs in like 4 months and I'm very confused about what I should be doing next, first of all, I live in morocco and I've studied the last 4 years in a private school of engineers but I don't really feel like I'm ready for the work world, especially with the last 2 years I just feel like I haven't benefited anything from the previous years and with the pandemic I had to study on my own online to pass my exams.\n\nThis is my final year I have 2 months left in school then I have to do my end of studies project and finally claim my diploma, the problem is I'm planning on leaving the country (I'm living in a VERY toxic environment that I can only escape by leaving the country) but since I have no experience it's gonna be impossible for me to directly find a job abroad, so I was thinking about taking another master abroad (I'm hesitating between Belgium (Antwerp to be specific) Canada and USA) then start working but I don't know what kind of master to choose because I don't have specific interests I generally like all the coding languages and I don't have any preferences, I've done some researches online and found that data science and artificial intelligence are quite interesting but I'm not sure that's why I want someone with decent experience to guide me.\n\nI already tried talking to some of my teachers and they all had the same advice, which is to stay here for a year or two to get some experience and then try to find a job abroad and move there but as I stated earlier my mental health is currently not it and if I stay longer it might get worse. Some of my teachers suggested taking a doctoral degree in cs instead of just adding a new master, also one of them told me that even if I take a master in Canada for example it's gonna be expensive and I won't be able to get a work permit by the end of my studies which will bring me back to the starting point.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I would appreciate all the advice I can get rn (I forgot to mention that I already took the IELTS exam and got an overall band of 7.5 \\[L7.5 R7.5 W6.5 S7.5)\n\nThank you!",
