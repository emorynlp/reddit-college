They did grant us some leniency with our assignments for a few weeks following the event, with the expectation that we would take the initiative to reach out to them if we needed an extension on a deadline. \n\nSomething that was tremendously helpful in giving us space to process our loss while staying on track academically was to hold a group counseling session with our school therapist.  I honestly felt apprehensive going into the session, but I noticed a major shift in the energy and outlook of my group as a whole, and feel that many of us turned a corner after that.

I think your feelings are normal, and I would definitely talk to someone about it, whether it is your therapist or a grief counselor, or both. I also think it's important to practice self care, whatever that looks like for you. Someone mentioned to be wary of advice suggesting that you throw yourself into your work, and I agree depending on who it's coming from. If it is helpful for *you* to take your mind off of things rather than watch Netflix and eat takeout, then I'd consider that part of self-care. If your PI is the one giving that advice, I'd look at it with some serious side eye. Work *can* be helpful for individuals experiencing a loss or some trauma, but it isn't always or for everyone, so I think the focus should be on your mental health, what you want to do, and what is best for you. \n\nI also very much agree with others suggesting that a serious look at the lab culture needs to take place. It's a huge red flag to me that you said your lab culture does not leave room for social relationships. Your PI's work is not that important, regardless what they think or what they say. You are human beings, not slaves or drones, and you have social needs as any human being does. If the lab work does not leave room for social relationships, then the lab work needs to change. I also feel like it's handicapping you and your labmates, because part of the educational experience in graduate school is networking. Unfortunately, it's not always what you know that helps secure a job, but who you know, so I think networking should be an integral part of any graduate education.\n\nIf your PI's work environment is one that gives you anxiety and depression, or contributes to it, that is a toxic environment. I know someone who was in a toxic lab and justified it for years before finally having a breakdown. They were diagnosed with PTSD. Any PI that contributes to a culture that gives their students the same mental disorder combat veterans get should be jailed, and blacklisted for all academic and research institutions for life. It's honestly not that hard to not abuse your students. I'd pay critical attention to how your labmate's suicide is addressed moving forward. Serious changes *should* be made moving forward and things should not just go back to normal in a week or two. This is a serious and traumatizing experience and needs to be treated as such, not just like a break from research or an inconvenience. It's good that he reached out via email, but the conspiratorial side of me wonders if he did that because email is official university communication and he reached out so there'd be a record. His actions moving forward would shed more light on whether this was genuine or something he felt like he had to do in case there was any questions.", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1614655098, "upvotes": 2}, "gpdibh2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lviokp/coping_with_the_suicide_of_a_labmate/gpdibh2/", "text": "You seem to be compassionate and empathetic which is why you're feeling this so intensely.

I can only relate to the labmate, where I felt really alone and isolated in my grindstone lab/department culture, and have seriously contemplated suicide. I don't think it's your fault, and I think a lot of it can be blamed on the culture of your lab. Sometimes, this kind of behaviour and culture was started from a few extremist students a while ago and just perpetuates for a long time, long past their graduation. Support and guidance for this kind of thing needs to come from the top-down, too, so the PI of the lab needs to also do more to foster a more open lab. If anything, I'd try to focus on yourself first to make sure you feel like you have enough social support so you wouldn't be next to suffer poor mental health, since it's apparent that your lab culture can cultivate it.

Luckily my lab mates were able to cover my next time point so I could go home and bawl. But that night, I felt the overwhelming need for some kind of control or action in my life, and because there was absolutely nothing I could do about my father's death, I decided to go back into lab and finish the last late night/early morning time points. Probably looked crazy from the outside, but I had already talked on the phone will all my (small) family, couldn't start planning any services (everything was closed), and I don't know how to describe it, other than that accomplishing anything that day felt important for my soul?
