  "text": "Greetings! I am a grad student with one semester left.  When it comes to writing papers, I feel like I am my worst self.  When the due date is approaching, I do not want to procrastinate, but I end up delaying my writing.  My mind is just messed up. I don't want to research because the reading and disseminating articles into a long paper frighten me.  Whenever I do type them now, I try to brainstorm everything in my head. I know that as a grad student I shouldn't be this way about them. I knew that papers would be a huge part of this experience. For my first semester and a half, I started getting better at the process but then Covid hit and made it worse. They moved my program to all online and I despise that. I only want to study or do homework in the library or a place like that.   When I'm in my own room, I often do not even pull out my laptop.  It's weird. Does anyone have advice forn me?",

      "text": "I have had this same problem for the last year, I can't say I've found a perfect solution, but I try to get out of my own head about it. My method is word vomiting onto a word document, just write out any garbage that comes to your head , and don't worry about how it reads or if it's coherent. It's much easier to work with having words on a page, and I've found that once I have something to work with, the motivation to continue starts building up!",

          "text": "\\+1 for word vomit.  Just throw it all out there, don't make it sound good.  Just start writing, even things like, \"Okay, need a background sentence here. Other research has found...\"  It's much easier to edit and go back to tweak things when you start to get a framework down.  Plus you can't edit a blank page.",
