  "text": "I am wondering if anyone is in the same boat as me.\n\nI'm enrolled in a master's in education program while working full-time. I decided to not take out any loans (I already have an MPA which I took out loans for) and I am able to use scholarship money for the first year of school. I can only manager and afford 1 class a semester. I'm aware it will take me a while to complete my degree, but I am okay with it (will obviously reassess if I'm not okay with it).\n\nMy scholarship doesn't renew for the next years unfortunately so I'm on the hunt for some scholarships to apply for.\n\nIs anyone else on a slow track with like one class a semester because you're limited by the small scholarship you have? What is your process like finding new scholarships and being able to afford school?",
