  "title:": "How to \"Slow Burn\" Instead of crunching constantly ; I'm so exhausted",
  "text": "I'm in a dual program to receive a M.A. in Economics and B.S. in economics simultaneously. That said, I managed my undergraduate coursework pretty diligently as a freshman and first semester as a sophomore, but after COVID hit I really developed some bad habits. I would procrastinate in undergrad and get away with it, because I can crank out 5 or 6 hours straight of decent quality work. \n\nNow I'm 9 weeks into this grad program and I feel like I've never been in worse position academically. I barley complete my work on time, have gotten C's on my first three midterms and am pretty sure I failed my fourth one yesterday. \n\nI just need something that works. I want to be able to sit down and work for 4 or 5 hours a day without pressure making me do so. Like, how do you design a space and time and schedule best to really dig deep even when you don't want to? I used to be self disciplined but now I just feel burnt out, partially from doing all these sprints caused by my procrastinating. \n\nWorse, I fell like the dumbest student in my cohort at this point because of my poor performance. I feel like the graduate director is going to ask me to step into his office for a \"private talk\" any day now. :-(",

      "text": "In my experience, if I don't get two weeks ahead of the syllabus by the second week of the semester I can't break the cycle of pain until I've turned in whatever final project I have 36 hours late and end the semester in shambles.\n\nGrad school is no joke, though. Undergrad was a cakewalk compared to my master's program. Just do your best and take it easy, try not to stress too much or the burn out will eat you up. \n\nI'm in my 3rd year now and have been experiencing severe burnout. Even though on paper it might look like I'm hanging on by a thread turning in assignments late or within minutes of deadlines every week, I set the intention that I won't let this semester deteriorate my health by overstressing myself between my full-time job and coursework like prior semesters and that I'm going to take the time to rest if I need it.",

      "text": "This is the hardest part of school in general. It is so much easier if you are able to work it like a 9-5 job, but unlike a 9-5 job, every force is working against you building this rhythm and routine.\n\nMy most useful advice is that you are not alone, this balance is hard for everyone (some more than others obviously, but that's ok). This is the only advice I am sure about.\n\nOther than that, some tips which you have probably heard, and may or may not help include.\n\n1. As much as possible try to schedule time to work. This can be very formal and rigid, or it can just mean that when you sit down to work, you decide what you are going to work on, and set an amount of time to dedicate before stopping (and then stop). Pomodoro method timers and such are a good alternative if you are the type who won't stop until you are done or if procrastinating has made it impossible to stop.\n\n\n2. Schedule time where you are not supposed to be working. For me, the biggest source of burnout is not lacking free time, but it is the feeling that free time isn't really free. If I spend 8 hours playing video games when I feel like I'm procrastinating it might as well not count as free time. On the other hand, if I tell myself that after 5 pm (or after 6, 8, 10 pm whatever time works for you) I will not do any work, this can help the free time feel more deserved.\n\nThese tips may or may not help, everyone has different strategies that work better for them, but more importantly, everyone struggles with problems like this, you are not alone, and this is difficult.",

      "text": "Have you looked at all into ADHD, especially inattentive type ADHD? I'm not one to suggest that everyone has it, but what you've described sounds like a pretty typical pattern for gifted students with ADHD. Doing well enough while the work load is manageable and there's external structure, but crashing when getting into grad school. Procrastination followed by manic last-minute dashes to complete work. Not boing able to sit down and focus without a looming deadline. \n\nIf it really is something that's just a recent change and prior to COVID you had no problems, then that's likely not it. But I thought I'd mention it just in case it could be helpful (because I wish someone had mentioned it to me when I was younger).",
