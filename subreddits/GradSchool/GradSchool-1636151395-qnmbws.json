  "text": "Before I get into the situation, here\u2019s some backstory on me: I\u2019m a graduate student part time while working a full time job (9-5). The graduate classes are all evening classes which makes attending a lot easier. \n\nSo my professor was having some family issues so he had a few online classes. Which is fine, made my life a lot easier because I didn\u2019t have to commute. But out of 12 classes he\u2019s missed 4, that\u2019s 1/3. He missed the entire first week. Then another class while he was in Cali taking care of his family but didn\u2019t have class because \u201cwifi wasn\u2019t good\u201d and then another this past Wednesday because he \u201cwasn\u2019t feeling good and fell asleep\u201d. This is the one that set me off. The Cali one I understand, family is important and sometimes you just have crappy wifi. So Wednesday, We were supposed to meet at 530 to go over some questions I had about the test this upcoming Monday. I looked for him for 1.5 hours, going to his office, the classroom, his lab, etc. I called my mom and we both agreed I should just go home. It was getting dark, I\u2019m a woman and in a city by myself and take the train. I sent him an email being like \u201csorry I missed class\u2026etc etc\u201d and he sent an apology email to the entire class a bit after saying he fell asleep and slept through class. So he\u2019s said \u201cwe can have the test Wednesday but we need to schedule a makeup lecture and review session\u201d he scheduled the makeup lecture for this upcoming Monday 12-130, and the review for after class. Now. I can\u2019t make that makeup lecture and this material is supposed to be on the exam. I don\u2019t know what to do. Out of all the emails I\u2019ve sent him this semester asking for help and suc he\u2019s responded to 2 of them. He never responded to my homework emails (we send him a pdf of the hw), I had to pester him to even get him to tell me he got one of them. The one he did respond to is where I explained I had to miss a class because of work. If the test is Wednesday and we\u2019re learning some of the material Monday there is literally no way I\u2019ll pass. Especially because he hasn\u2019t replied to rescheduling our meeting. It takes me a bit to understand the chemistry that\u2019s happening, no way can I do it in a day.  I\u2019ve lost all motivation for this test, is there anything I can do to drop the class and not have a withdrawal or something I can do to not totally bomb this test? \n\nTL;DR: professor cancelled numerous classes this semester. The most recent one he rescheduled 2 days before the test and is going over material that\u2019s on the test. No way I can make it because I have a job. The material is hard so there\u2019s also no way I\u2019ll understand it in a day. He doesn\u2019t respond to any of my emails asking questions about the material. Is there anything I can do to not fail?",

If he doesn\u2019t reply by tomorrow evening I think I\u2019m going to email my advisor and explain the situation. It\u2019s freaking ridiculous and stressful",

And your professor does not sound like they have done much to make up for missing class. If they are not even being responsive to email, like ever, that\u2019s not something you should be dealing with.",
