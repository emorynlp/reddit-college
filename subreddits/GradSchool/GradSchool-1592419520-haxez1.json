  "text": "UPDATE: I\u2019ve read through virtually all of the responses and I just want to thank you all for your support in such a hard time. I was scared the reddit community wasn\u2019t ready for a conversation like this and I\u2019m happy that there are people who are taking the time to realize just how stressful this endeavor is. \n\nI hope to creat a subreddit soon on this and talk about ways we can systemically improve. I\u2019ll be reading throughout the next few days. Thank you again. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nI\u2019m currently a doctoral student and I\u2019m on the verge of dropping out. I\u2019m a Black Male and I\u2019m having a hard time staying in my program given current events (and quite frankly even before them because I\u2019ve always been sensitive to the injustice)\n\nI\u2019m tired of having to do other people\u2019s work and getting ridiculed for it when I make one mistake. My coworkers make mistakes and my supervisors make no fuss about it. I do something and I\u2019ve been told this field isn\u2019t for me, that I\u2019m only a nice person and nothing more.\n\nThis might sound incoherent and I apologize but I\u2019m mad as all hell and fucking tired quite frankly. I don\u2019t think I have it in me to do this for another year. I don\u2019t even care what happens to me if I drop out.",

One thing I can say is that, while someone could reasonably say \"you do not belong here\", no one can say \"You are not cut out for this field\", as you know yourself better than anyone. If you are passionate about your field and if you are good at your field, you belong in that field, no question. Whether or not you belong in that study group, department, school, etc., is another thing. If you feel this is a toxic environment, you should leave for greener pastures the first opportunity you get. Don't feel the need to prove yourself to anyone ever again, just do your best.",

I\u2019m really lucky to find the greatest psychiatrist ever who literally saved my life. No luck with therapy though. \n\nMy diagnosis is depression and ptsd, My psychiatrist wants me to have a therapist who has experience dealing with trauma and violence. I\u2019ve tried South East Asian therapists. But honestly we have internalized so much stigma about mental health, even the professionals in this field (at least the ones I\u2019ve met) are not beyond that. I\u2019ve tried American therapists (all white), but all of them were too... American for me, to whom I failed to explain my context. \n\nI never noticed a black, male or female, or an Asian therapist/ psychologist/ counselor in my network. \n\nFor my TMS, I met this amazing guy who was black. Please note that I didn\u2019t get to meet or interact with a lot of American people because there is a huge Bengali community in our city, one of the biggest in the USA. And I live right in the middle of an ethnic enclave. Anyway so the guy who gave me TMS therapy, we just instantly connected. We started talking about tv shows, but ended up taking about so many things. I come from a persecuted minority community in a Muslim country. My life was never in danger like a black male in the USA, but he could very well comprehend what I was talking about when I blabbered about navigating the complexities of the life of a minority. It was so easy talking to him because he just knew what I was talking about, or at least he was polite enough to make me feel that he did. \n\nAfter that I specifically looked for a black therapist or counselor, but there simply isn\u2019t any anywhere near me.\n\nAbout PhD, lol my husband got one. Life of an international grad student is hard too, maybe the struggles are different from yours. Esp if you don\u2019t have a good supervisor, you\u2019re destined for lifelong trauma. The 5 years of his PhD was undoubtedly the hardest 5 years of his life. Esp the last 2 years were excruciating. Even one month before his defense he didn\u2019t know if he would make it. There were other people in his lab who didn\u2019t make it. And they were not any less deserving. Every single day in his grad school, he questioned his decision of going on. In his fourth year of PhD one day he asked me, will you still think I\u2019m any worthy of your love if I cannot get this PhD? Not jokingly, he asked it in full seriousness. \n\nYes finally he got that PhD that straight away landed him on his dream job and everything, and life is getting better for us. But he\u2019s just not the intimidatingly jubilant, confident, indomitably positive boy anymore who I had married. The degree came with a price. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone anything except for yourself. It\u2019s only for you to decide whether you want to go on or not. If you decide to push through, you will find a way to do it. I know people who needed 7, 8, or even 10 years to finish their PhD. They are doing well now. I know people who left even after passing the qual. They are doing well too. I guess I\u2019m trying to say is please never doubt that whether you can do it or not. Definitely you can do it. It\u2019s okay if you leave too. Your current situation is incredibly hard. Whatever decision you make in this circumstance is the right decision for you because nobody else is in your shoes. Good luck.",

I hear you and your feelings are valid. \n\nGrowing up Asian, the hardest thing about speaking up about mental health/depression was the stigma behind it. I was always taught to be quiet and that you\u2019re just \u201csad\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll get over it\u201d. I didn\u2019t realize that I needed the help until things got real bad. \n\nWhat made it even harder when I finally reached out for help was the lack of diversity and understanding about my culture amongst my doctors. I realized that representation really matters in the medical field. Having an Asian doctor, someone who understands my background and traditions made a difference in my treatment. \n\nAfrican Americans make up 13% of the US population, but only 4% of the medical field. There\u2019s so much disparity in healthcare. Studies actually show that representation matters. I know its hard right now, but you don\u2019t know how much of a difference you\u2019ll be making for your community.",

With that said, if you need to step back for your own mental health, maybe do it as a leave of absence so you can go back if you feel ready six months or a year from now. The other thing I'll add to try to normalize (and not minimize) your experience, is that \\*everyone\\* feels like seriously dropping out at least once in their PhD program (I absolutely came VERY close). But most people who finish are glad they did. But only you know your mental/physical health best and can make that decision! Feel free to DM me if you need any advice or just to vent.

As far as I know, I'm a third generation black veteran and several close family members have served. It took over 12 years to be diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder. I've had psychologists say everything from maybe I'm having personality conflicts, to maybe I'm too aggressive, to maybe I'm overthinking before I someone listened. In education, I've been in predominantly white institutions from elementary through my master's program. I was just accepting into a PhD program. I definitely understand the bias, tokenism, macro and microaggressions in education, business, corporate America, and military service.  I tried to find a PhD program at a HBCU just to see what it feels like to not have my blackness be a threat - experience stereotype threat. I've been fired for insubordination due to printing one personal email which was common practice in my office.   I believe it was retaliation for reporting discrimination in the workplace.  In sales, I had clients ready to list their houses with me over the phone, untill I showed up and they saw me. I've been belittled for being a single mother while pursuing a PhD, and a ton of other things. So what I'm trying to say is I HEAR YOU.  I wish my grandfather, my dad, and my son would have a black psychologist to go to - to talk and express their concerns and trauma they have experience.  Unfortunately, this has not been a possibility. WE NEED YOU, WE SUPPORT YOU, YOU GOT THIS!!!  The first therapist that listened to me was a black man, a MSW.  \n\nYOU ARE STRONG, YOU ARE SMART, YOU MATTER, YOU ARE HEARD, YOU ARE IMPORTANT, YOU CAN DO IT, YOU ALREADY ARE!!!\n\n(I hope this was clear and concise and your really feel supported. You can DM me, we support you!)",

It all depends on what your goals are and what you desire to do with your degree. \n\nBut it sounds like others have said you are feeling burnt out; under appreciated and mistreated.. dont let that be the reason you quit though- only quit if it is something you really don't want to do anymore.\n\nYou got this and you can do this!!",

Your dedication to the field you love is inspiration and dont let those assholes take that away from you. Your journey is unfortunately tough, but the role you play can and **will** positively impact the lives of many black children who come after you. When I was younger, I worked as a camp counselor, and let me tell you, it was then that I realized the beauty of representation. My presence brought a smile to the faces of the black children there, who, while not angry at their white peers, still experienced frustration at the lack of understanding they were subjected to. I, and the many other black counselors who came after, Showed them their true potential, the kind that this society seeks to beat outta them. Do **not** let them do that to you. You matter. You matter to me. You matter to them. and most importantly, you matter to yourself. Please keep pushing. If you ever need to talk, PM me, I'll be more than happy to listen. It is tough out there, but no one said you had the face the hardship alone. I'm with you, and I can already see the many smiling faces that'll come with your presence.

There's much more than staying in the current, unsustainable situation, and dropping everything completely.\n\nOn a spectrum from \"dropping out and never looking back\" to \"making small changes within my current setup\" there are many things you can do. I don't know what stage you're at in the PhD, but joining some groups/spending some time outside of academia can help you get perspective. It can be difficult, but putting in just enough work instead of trying to be perfect can also help. However, I recognize you're often held to a whole other standard, so that might not work. All I know is the standard we hold ourselves to can push us to unhealthy places.\n\nPlease put yourself first and take some time if you need to.

I've heard a lot of insensitive, racist things thrown around in my department as a grad student and over the years, it can really, really cut you to your core and make it hard to stay motivated and on track. I can't imagine the kinds of things you've had to deal with in your program. And now, I can't imagine the emotional stress and trauma that you're dealing with from all of this news.\n\nDo you have any diversity-focused graduate groups in your school that you can engage in and find support from? Do you think your supervisors would be receptive/supportive if you took a couple of weeks off to recuperate and take a moment to try to process what is going on? And I know since you're a psychologist, you're well versed in mental health services, but have you been able to take some time to talk through what you're going through with a mental health professional? I know obviously all these things won't fix the true problems that you have to deal with, but grad school + the world can be (is) a toxic, toxic place and maybe some short-timed breaks and extra external support can help you along the way.\n\nPersonally, I really struggled for about a year during my program because of the toxic environment that I experienced in my lab and I lost so much productivity. But after I started seeing a counselor, my mental health and motivation improved so much (and to be honest my anxiety and stress this year would probably be through the roof without her). So, seriously... I can't even begin to express how valuable mental health professionals are in general, and we especially need more black psychologists in the world to support black mental health.

However, your mental health is more important than that at this particular moment. I think that a leave of absence will give you the time needed to figure out if you would want to continue or not.\n\nAs a Black MSW student, I definitely understand the overall cultural insensitivity and bias of academia even in the \"helping\" or mental health professions. I've been lucky to have a close group of friends who are also BIPOC in my program that support each other. What keeps me going is that fact that I know once I have my credentials I can help support BIPOC students in academia once i'm done. \n\nI would also say, if you feel that you are being treated differently then start documenting everything (if you decide to stay). Anytime you do someone else's work or get feedback that is not constructive (that you believe was biased) keep track of it. Most large schools have a bias/grievance reporting system; use it. Work up the chain of command and don't take no for an answer.\n\nLastly, I would just like to say that you are not alone in this and protecting your mental health is important above all else right now. If you need to take a break (short or long-term) then you should because you can't be your best when the stressors in your life are unending. \n\nIf you need anything or just want to talk, feel free to PM me.",

I don't think the consequences for being passive aggressive behavior and microaggressions really touch them as students are replaceable while professors are more difficult to replace unless a PR nightmare costs the university too much. \n\nFaculty can get away with a lot of questionable and unreasonable behavior purely because of this and students like me typically have little power to deal with these situations from any position of power. \n\nTo sum it all, the answer is in your own statement, they are nicer but in a dissociative way because they're afraid of coming off aa racist and not because they realize a systematic disadvantage that a POC is encumbered with from the start.",

They will always test you, again and again. You just gotta make sure you stand up stronger. It's never easy, but it's always good to try.\n\nBeing a minority sucks, but at the same time, a fucking blessing. A blessing because we have something that the majority don't have, and that is we're doing this for our people. Don't mean to sound cliche, but that's the fundamental of being a minority.
