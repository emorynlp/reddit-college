      "text": "Depends how it\u2019s formatted! You could absolutely put a hyperlink with the URL embedded in the project name. It can be distinguished with the usual blue/underlined text that will be clickable when converted to PDF.\n\nAlternatively you could have the readable links included in a way that makes them look like a natural part of the formatting. For example, if the entry is like a citation, put it at the very end like you would a doi to a journal article. If your project is more of a summary/bullet point situation, list the URL underneath the entry on a separate line.\n\n50% of my job as an RA is formatting, editing, and assessing CVs in academia. Feel free to DM if you want me to take a look :)",
