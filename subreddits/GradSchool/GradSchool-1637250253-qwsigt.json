Grab it paragraph at a time and rewrite that paragraph to sound a bit more coherent, a bit more logical. Then as you move along the process move from hot to cold garbage, to compost, to a shitty garden, to a bouquet of flowers. \n\nAt least that's my writing process.",

      "text": "For reference, I have my MS thesis due in ~2 weeks and I've been struggling with writer's block as well. I have managed to get a decent amount of work done in the last week or so though. Here's some tips:\n\n1. Acknowledge that your thesis won't be perfect and that's okay. A completed thesis is a good thesis. These aren't published, and nobody will read them once submitted. \n\n2. Tell yourself you only need to write for 10 minutes. Chances are you'll get to that 10 minute mark and realize you can keep going. But if not, take a break! Nothing makes writer's block worse than staring at a blank page.\n\n3. Reward yourself after a successful writing session! I like to eat some candy if I finish a page or two... \n\n4. Identify a location that is conducive for writing. I cannot write at home, in lab, or even at the library. I can write in this tiny little office on campus though, so I only write there now. \n\nGood luck!",

What will you ever do with all that free time when it\u2019s over. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI agree that location is important\u2026 I tend to move around from one room to another until I can find my groove. Last semester, I was writing a research paper and ended up sitting on the floor on my fuzzy carpet because I just got into a writing frenzy, and couldn\u2019t stop. Maybe I\u2019ll go back and sit on that carpet in the hopes it\u2019ll help kick my writer\u2019s block.\n\nAnd that is also a good point - once it\u2019s submitted that\u2019s it. The committee and external examiners will review it, but then that\u2019s it. It won\u2019t get published or anything, and won\u2019t be in the universe for scholars to rip apart.",

      "text": "Make sure you're scheduling regular time to write, and stick to it. So procrastination does not become part of the problem. And don't interrupt your writing with playing on social media :)\n\nAre you sure you're at the stage of writing the draft? Sometimes people get stuck because they need to do more research, or they need to think things through more and take notes.\n\nDon't get trapped into thinking you have to follow an outline. Write whatever is easiest. Jump all over the place. Messy first drafts are fine. Once you have one, you can outline it and then reorganize it. And better develop your arguments.\n\nDon't try to edit while you go. For many people, editing can be a different type of thinking than initial draft generation. So it can interrupt the flow of being in the groove of generating text.\n\nIt helps me to have gestation time when I'm involved in a major writing project. So when I drive my car or go for a walk, I don't listen to music or podcasts. I think about my writing project. Then when I go to sit down, I already have ideas of what I want to do next.",

Then come back to it later and edit it into something better.\n\nDo not be a perfectionist procrastinator. The best project is a finished project.",
