  "text": "I'm in second semester of MA in School Counseling. I really enjoy the material, etc. But I am feeling burnt out. I am working fulltime as a teacher and don't really feel like I have a life. I am noticing signs of anxiety and depression and I am having a really hard time concentrating. I feel like all I do is work and then go home and do schooling. No mental break. Even when I schedule in 'me time' I am either thinking about work or school. I'm not sure what to do. I can't not work because the program is super expensive.",

      "text": "Sounds like you need to start doing something physical during your 'me time'. Have you tried taking a run, or hiking? It's been great for my anxiety and helps me bleed off energy that I would otherwise use to think about stuff. Keeps you in the moment and switches you off work totally. Also going out with friends can help with switching off.",
