  "text": "Hello! I am a soon to be graduate student, and I would LOVE to continue my education and apply for grad school. However, this requires at least 3 letters of recommendation from professors. A combination of issues arises: 1) I am extremely timid and have many anxiety and social issues, so I doubt not a single professor will remember my name nor my face 2) the past two years have been over zoom, and this furthered the issue of not connecting with teachers or being memorable.\nSo with this, I would be asking 3 professors that would definitely not remember me by name or face, and they would have to write a letter on a student they don\u2019t even remember or have any comments for. Is this normal? Is it annoying as a professor to receive this request from a student who you had no connections with??\n\n* I am a transfer junior and both years have been on zoom, and my UC required the letters to be from this specific school, meaning the teachers I did make connections with were at my community college and I can not ask them, sadly. So I feel like I have ZERO options on who to ask a letter of recommendation to.",

      "text": "Your more professor-oriented questions are probably more appropriate for r/AskProfessors or r/AskAcademia :)\n\nIn general, I think a lot of people are too dead-set on going straight from undergrad to grad school. There are benefits to taking some time in the workforce to get more experience (and more opportunities for recommendation letters!). My advice is to keep your options open. \n\nEven if you find three professors who don't know you well to write you letters, they won't be the strongest possible representation of your abilities. Collecting LORs isn't merely a matter of checking off a box for the application---depending on the program, they can be the most important tool for evaluating your potential in a grad program.",

          "text": "Thank you for referencing those subreddits for me! And I have definitely thought about getting more work experience, however since I am only 20 and have worked for the past 3 years as a pharmacy technician, I am a Literature Major (makes no sense, I know!) I\u2019ve tried searching for jobs but because I am still just a few months away from my BA, I fall just short of those requirements. Perhaps I\u2019ll give it some time once I have officially graduated like you recommended, thank you so much!!",
