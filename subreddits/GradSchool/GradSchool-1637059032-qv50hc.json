I remember when I originally started I didn\u2019t have one and was left with ~6,500 CAD / year in a relatively expensive city. I think stipends are a bit higher now but still. I suggest OP looks at cost of living in the area and if there are scholarships available (internally and externally).",

      "text": "Geoscience grad here! Yes, you need to pay tuition fees out of pocket, but they are a lot lower than in US institutions. At my university tuition for 1 year was about $4,000 CAD, which included a pretty good health care and dental care plan. In our department, all the PhD students made a minimum of $25,000 CAD a year, and that was not taxable. If you are an international student (higher tuition) then often you would make more so you would be on the same level as the domestic students. One way to make things easier is to get scholarships, which then boost your income (also untaxed). If you TA that also should increase your income, but that is subject to taxes because it counts as \"employment\" instead of a stipend. \n\nMost of the graduate students in my department lived in shared housing (rent on the order of $500-800 CAD a month). It would still be tight, and not everyone opted to have a car, but we could all make ends meet. Depending where you will be in Canada the costs will be different of course, but I hope this helps!",

      "text": "As with most things, the answer is \"it depends\". I am in a low cost of living city (Edmonton) and the base stipend is enough to live on, though \"comfortably\" could be debated. Our stipends increase every year, if we are not on scholarship (Physics, YMMV). As other commenters have mentioned, tuition is relatively low. Scholarships are not taxed, and while stipends usually *are* taxable, tuition credits will offset this to beneath your base deduction and so you won't need to pay tax.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with my income, though I am on a few major scholarships which increase my income slightly (though not as much as you might think, they *replace* your stipend). In a larger city like Vancouver or Toronto with an out of control real estate market, it might be a different story.",

      "text": "The hard answer is every university is different across Canada how they run their stipends and scholarships. When I was researching programs it seems like PhD funding is usually automatically required and usually set between 18-25k cad depending on the university or program. Some programs make TAing a requirement for stipend and some programs TAing is money on top. Tuition can vary greatly across the country from 4k-10k for Canadian students, international is always more but how more depends again on the university. Tuition is often not covered by the department so do not assume it will be taken care of. \n\nI personally would say on a stipend for a PhD you cannot live comfortably alone without additional scholarships, or sources of income like TAing or tutoring.",

OP should ask the department (or better yet, their potential supervisor), \"If I win a scholarship or do TAing, does that replace or add on to the stipend?\" Get the answer in writing, if possible. Even in one department, profs may handle these differently -- potentially due to the source of their funding.",

It will also depend on how competitive your CV is, as that will typically determine external funding (NSERC, CIHR, SSHRC). Also if you live in Vancouver or Toronto (or other expensive cities), it is unlikely you will be able to live super comfortably.",
