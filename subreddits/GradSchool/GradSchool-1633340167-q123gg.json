  "text": "MS Statistics grad student here, started my first semester in August. Program is in a US public university. To be honest I'm struggling here, I think I check the boxes for the usual imposter syndrome, \"grad school harder than undergrad,\" etc. I'd like to ask you all if curves are common, specifically for American graduate level statistics or mathematics programs. My dad has told me grad programs will pretty much only issue A's or B's, or C's if you fail, but his experience in grad school is from decades ago and I don't know how much to trust his info.\n\nWhat really worries me is that I can compute my current percentage grade based on the assignments we've gotten, and having just a little formal education in math I know that I cannot get above a 90% based on my scores and the weights of assignments. None of my course syllabus mention numerical cutoffs (e.g. A = 90-100).\n\nI'm just worried sick that I'll be kicked out of my program and realize that I'm not as good with statistics as I believe I am.",
