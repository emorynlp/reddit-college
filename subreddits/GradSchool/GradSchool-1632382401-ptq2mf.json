NEED HELP", "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm wondering how you even get that conversation started with a professor. This wouldn't be an official thesis proposal, as that will happen later this semester. I just wanted to get the ball rolling and see if they would be able to advise me on my topic. My field is international trade and I just started my 2nd year of a two-year master's program.\n\nI have a professor in mind (I have taken their class before and am currently taking another one) and I am thinking of sending them an email but I don't really know what to include in the email. I know this isn't an an ideal way of reaching out, but given the pandemic and how strict social distancing restrictions are where I am (our school hasn't been in-person since March 2020), I think emailing would be acceptable. I want to ask them if they are still taking advisees and introduce my topic idea (there is some overlap with their research interests). Do I need to figure out every aspect of the project right now before asking them? Is there anything else I need to mention in this initial email?\n\nI'd appreciate any tips because I have no idea what I'm doing.

I'd even title the email with something regarding that, \"Prospective MS student\" and start right away with your details.  Keep it short, sweet, and to the point.  Then, ask to zoom and discuss it further.  They should know you won't have all the details ironed out.", "author": "idk_witty_username", "created": 1632405589, "upvotes": 2}, "hdxxrqx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ptq2mf/how_to_ask_a_professor_to_potentially_be_your/hdxxrqx/", "text": "If I were you I'd just cold email them and see what happens. They are usually busy people so get straight to the point and don't write a long message.\n\nThey might say they are not taking students or tell you to wait until the official process starts, but I don't think this does any harm. Also I don't think you need everything figured out before starting the project, that's why we have advisors. But you should be able to explain why your topic overlaps with theirs or why they might find it interesting.", "author": "GoofyMaximus", "created": 1632386369, "upvotes": 3}}}
