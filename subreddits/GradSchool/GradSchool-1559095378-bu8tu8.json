If I do not submit in this timeframe, my candidature is cancelled and I will be unable to ever get my PhD. I have spent 6 years doing what should have been a 3 year course. I am nowhere near finished writing. I am going to fail.", "text": "[This is an update to a post I made two months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/b9ep8b/my_thesis_is_due_in_two_months_if_i_do_not_submit/)\n\nWell, it's now due next week and I'm pretty much done. It's been a rushed job, I still have the last of my conclusion to write, some editing to do, and all my formatting needs to be done, but it doesn't matter because for the first time in years I truly believe I will have something to submit on the day of my deadline. I honestly can't believe it. I have no idea how I pulled myself together and pulled this off but I managed. My primary supervisor has not read it nor will he, but I have had feedback from my secondary supervisors telling me that \"it's ok\" which is more than I ever could have dreamed two months ago. \n\nThe moral of this story I guess is it really doesn't need to be perfect. I was paralysed by everyone else being worried for me, telling me what I should be up to, telling me that they \"didn't know if they were going to finish either\" even though their thesis was by publication and they had 6 months to go. Their perfection made me believe I had to be that perfect to get it done. And it isn't perfect. But it is done. I can only hope I won't get major revisions but if I do, I'll worry about it when the time comes.\n\nThanks everyone who commented on my original post. I wrote that in a bathroom of an all-night cafe at 4am after staying up two nights prior. I was just crying reading all your responses because they were all so nice and supportive. I have gone back and read them more than once to motivate myself and remind me that panicking and quitting just because something won't be up to standard isn't the way to see something through.\n\nThank you all so much <3 \n\nWish me luck for the coming week!", "author": "PhDStruggle", "created": 1559095378, "retrieved": 1632845379, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 500, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ephkcqm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/bu8tu8/update_my_thesis_is_due_in_two_months_if_i_do_not/ephkcqm/", "text": "Congrats!

You might think you only need a day for it, but depending on the length and complexity of your document, it could easily be several days of work. What you need to do is meet with someone in the writing center of your university and have them go over it page by page. They will not only find mistakes in formatting that might cause the graduate school to put a hold on your dissertation, but they are wizards in fixing the mistakes and can do in seconds what would take you hours to figure out. At least that was my experience at my university. The point is, *do not put off formatting* to the last moment.

Everyone automatically thinks of the elite athletes breaking through the finish line and holding up the trophy, but that isn\u2019t the full picture. A world class finish time in an Ironman is around 8 hours, but the race actually lasts for an additional 8 hours and 50 minutes after that. There are people that stumble across the line with seconds to spare at 16 hours and 49 minutes. The last person across that line earns the right to call themselves an Ironman just as much as the person who won the race. It may not have been as pretty or as impressive as those who were racing to win, but you did it, you dug deep and refused to give up. It is just like the old joke, what do you the person who graduated at the bottom of their Med school class?
