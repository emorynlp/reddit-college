  "text": "Ran into a prof I\u2019m collaborating with in the hall last week and he asked me to do some data analysis and a write-up. Me, being in a rush (and an idiot), didn\u2019t write it down and now I\u2019ve forgotten what he asked for.  \n\nI saw him again today and he asked how it was coming along. I said I hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet, and he said he\u2019d like it by Wednesday.  \n\nI\u2019m totally lost here and don\u2019t want to straight-up say I forgot. Do you have any tips for bringing something like this up without looking like an idiot?",
