  "title:": "Canadian Grad Students: NSERC Questions",
  "text": "To the lovely Canadian grad students who might have a bit more insight than I: \n\nI'm applying for a masters in physics for Fall 2022 and I am looking at applying for the NSERC (I mean why not?).  I'm looking at the Canadian Common and I've got a few questions. \n\n1. Firstly, I feel like a lot of my undergraduate experience seems irrelevant like symposiums don't feel legit enough to put under presentations and minor scholarships don't seem to belong under recognitions. Am I correct in assuming that things like this don't have a place on my CCV and I should stick to bigger stuff like actual conference presentations and research experience? \n2. The user profile section: Should I even bother filling this out? It seems like it's meant for professors and distinguished researchers who have true research niches. My career has barely started and so my research specialization keywords would be extremely broad, like \"radioastronomy\". \n\nAny advice that you guys can give would be wildly appreciated. I feel a little lost in all the applications.",

      "text": "1. Don't leave out these things if you have room!!!!! Even if they weren't large conferences or big scholarships. Your application might be compared to someone's that included all these things. The CCV is annoying but there are so many different categories for precisely this reason. If you gave a talk at a symposium or got a minor scholarship, that is evidence that you have research potential - it's not bullshitting if you're honest. If there is limited space it's fine to only include the \"most impressive\" stuff. The only thing that definitely should be left out is awards and such from high school (I've heard of people doing this). As long as you aren't making things up or including the same CV items multiple times it's fine. \n2. Fill it out the best you can - I think 'radioastronomy' is probably fine -  the keywords help NSERC/the university know which field you're in so applications can be compared but I don't this section would hinder you.",
