How much longer do you have in your program? \n\nI\u2019m in my second year of my PhD, also in mental health. At least 3 year more to go for me. I printed out a list of things that I am working toward and put it just above my computer screen on the wall so I can look at it every day and be reminded of why I\u2019m making these sacrifices. I\u2019ve also found it adds some motivation to do just one thing more toward non-school goals some days and that\u2019s been helpful for balance. One of my goals is to go to Disney (because I\u2019ve never been and it\u2019s dang expensive) so sometimes I\u2019ll read or watch a video about special events at Disney and think about what time of year I might want to eventually go. That\u2019s usually fun, a bit of a mental break for self-care, and also helps me feel like I\u2019m moving 1% closer to that goal (even though it\u2019s probably at least 4 years off). \n\nBut I\u2019m not going to lie, I have absolutely had days where I was ready to give up. Grad school is tough even in the best of times, but right now it just feels like a special sort of hell. It does also give me a bit of purpose and security that I wouldn\u2019t have if I were back in the professional world - I can do all my teaching, research, practicum and course work from home, and I am a mighty cheap source of labor for the university so I feel a bit of confidence in the stability of my income (even though it\u2019s small, stability feels mighty nice right now).  So appreciating what grad life does allow me to do right now, coupled with focusing on the short time all of this is going to last and what I want to be doing after it\u2019s all over (plus a good therapist, cuddly pets, a mighty supportive and handsome partner, and a little too much wine) are what are getting me through this right now.", "author": "topsailsun", "created": 1602448403, "upvotes": 4}, "g8iud14": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/j99u4n/fuck/g8iud14/", "text": "My SO and I are also feeling stressed lately.
