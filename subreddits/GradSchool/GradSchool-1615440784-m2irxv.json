Only viable option for me is to transfer to business after my undergrad and work up the corporate ladder. Not a bad option, but I know I won't be passionate at all about my work. No hate on business, a typical 9-5 desk job is just not for me. \n\nSo, PhD is actually a very productive use of my time given my life goals and passions. Sure, I could probably make more money if I chose another career path but the program I'm in and the experiences I gain should make way for a six figure job or just under that straight out of graduation if I play my cards right. If I look at others at that age, I'll probably be making just as much as them in 5 years, but I'll hopefully be in a career I love with tons of upwards mobility because, well, I would have a PhD.\n\nA lot of people don't \"figure out\" their career goals so early on in life anyways. All those business and engineering grads that flaunt their entry level salaries often find that there's a lot more learning and discovering to do until they find themselves in a position they truly love. For example, tons of business grads end up doing an MBA somewhere down the line, which is an extra 2 years of school anyways. Or they find themselves wanting to switch fields from say consulting to finance. Very rarely do students straight out of undergrad find themselves on a career path they'll stick with their entire life. \n\nIn fact, statistics show that the average person changes career 5-7 times during their working life. I would wager that number is significantly lower for people that do graduate school or professional school, because time in these programs narrows down your career goals significantly. \n\nSo never feel bad that you're \"delaying\" the career you love by doing graduate school.

Grad school is a very, very expensive way (in time, if not in money) to figure out what you want in life. I would not have gone to grad school at all if I were still unsure of my path.\n\nObviously, plans change, but going into grad school without at least *some* plan of how to spin that degree into a career you want is just not something I would ever recommend.", "author": "aggressive-teaspoon", "created": 1615450411, "upvotes": 2}, "gqjqj73": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/m2irxv/do_you_ever_worry_that_grad_school_is_just_a_way/gqjqj73/", "text": "I\u2019m in my dream program right now and deep down I know I love what I do.

It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like my program I just hate this particular course.  \n\nAnd some (unwanted?) advice here: therapists come with their own set of judgment and views about the world. They don\u2019t own the truth, you do own you personal truth. They are here to help you sort out your shits, not telling you what you should think or do. I find her very judgmental to think that you don\u2019t like your program because of only one particular class, while in a fucking pandemic (I say this only from readily your post). I would personally get very angry at my therapist to suggest something like that implying that she knows me better than me. Asking if you really like your program is a thing, saying :\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0it sounds like you might not\u00a0\u00bb for my is crossing a line big way. I think it\u2019s the thing that infuriate me most in all your post. So just be careful and don\u2019t let people play with your mind, not even your therapist :) I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t meant it in a bad way but it can still damage you at the end if she repeatedly says things like that.", "author": "GrumpyCockatoo", "created": 1615448653, "upvotes": 70}, "gqjkay0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/m2irxv/do_you_ever_worry_that_grad_school_is_just_a_way/gqjkay0/", "text": "Not really.
