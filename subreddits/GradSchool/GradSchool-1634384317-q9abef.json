  "text": "I feel like everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong. I'm mid way through my first year as a maths PhD student and whilst my supervisors are the kindest and most supportive people around me I still feel lost.\n\nI recently returned to the office and it made me feel worse strangely, realising that I have to play the polotics game with them and try to make an entirely new batch of friends all whilst juggling the world's most uncooperative code.\n\nThat and I just feel like I've lost my spark and motivation-- you could say that the waters have been muddied.\n\nOn Monday I'm having a quick chat about this with my supervisor. How can I professionally say I'm feeling despondent?",

      "text": "Just tell it like it is. I think in academia there tends to be the belief that everyone needs to be very serious, academic, and professional at all times. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are times when you absolutely have to step up to the plate and be as professional as possible, but first and foremost, they are people like you and I, and they\u2019ll understand that you\u2019re just having a rough time of it. My supervisor would much rather I was up front and honest about everything than trying to struggle on. \n\nJust explain the problems you\u2019re having and what you think needs to happen. They\u2019ll either agree and help, or at least keep an eye on the situation, or suggest better alternatives to improve things for you. Maybe take a step back for a few days so you can make sense of everything. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "It will be helpful if you come to this meeting prepared to articulate what you're feeling overwhelmed about. Be as specific as you can about what's bothering you about the code and the work environment. If you've also got personal stuff going on that's contributing to your problem, it's okay to bring it up so your supervisor is aware, but be mindful of how much detail is appropriate to share.\n\nHopefully your supervisor will be able to suggest some solutions, or at least just sympathize. If you don't get the direction you need from your supervisor, a good next step would be to reach out to an advisor or other mentor who may have some insight.",
