  "text": "I have been out of school for 7 years and this is my first semester in grad school. \n\nI need to brush up on my writing skills. Does anyone have any book recommendations for help with graduate level writing? Or maybe a different resource I can use?\n\nI used my university\u2019s writing lab which helped but a paper I just got back earned a B+ . I want to improve. Thanks",

      "text": "The first thing to do would be to assess what your issues are with writing.\n\n Improperly assessing the assignment? Depth of content development? Insufficient research? Lack of understanding of disciplinary writing conventions? Organizational issues? Sentence level stylistic concerns? Grammar?\n\nIt would be good to go talk to your professor who gave you the B+ and figure that out if it's not clear from the feedback. Then you can figure out how to address it from there.\n\nDid the professer give you any general feedback as to the writing issues?",

Anyway, I\u2019ll speak with him",

And then you can work with the writing center with that text and feedback and go over the issues further.\n\nAlso, make sure you're leaving yourself much more time for editing and revising. Professors are often looking for final versions of papers that are essentially ready to publish.",

      "text": "Highly recommend \"They say, I say.\" It's really short, \\~500 pages iirc, with immediately applicable tips to essay writing. It gives short blunt examples of how to say something, then tells you to do it yourself. E.g. how to incorporate citations well and make it fit into your arguments without sounding disjointed.\n\nThis is the very first book I was assigned as an undergrad in English. It's been a literal gift over the years.",

It focuses less on the technical aspect of writing and more on the process, breaking it down into more reasonable chunks, etc. It really helped me feel better about knowing how to approach the daunting concept of The Thesis when I transitioned from natural (\"hard\") ag science to social ag science.",
