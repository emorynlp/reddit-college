  "text": "Call this strange, but I'm really interested in applying for an MFA at NYU to get into one of their second year fellowships. It would be a dream to have Jeffrey Eugenides as a professor, of course, but an equally large draw is the Goldwater Writing Workshop Fellowships and the Starworks Fellowships. Both have options to teach creative writing in hospitals, which means a lot to me because of how I started writing in the first place. I wrote a lot of fiction while recovering from surgery. The fiction that got me into Bread Loaf was something I started while living with undiagnosed Lyme disease. I know firsthand how much writing can create empowerment while living with chronic illness. A more formalized setting to empower fellow community members would be amazing. \n\nWhat are everyone's thoughts on the Goldwater Writing Workshop Fellowships and the Starworks Fellowships? Was it an enjoyable experience or were you disillusioned? Would you recommend it overall?",
