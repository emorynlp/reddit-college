  "text": "I was asked to made quite a few modification to a report where I gave my heart and soul to prepare which I did with no questions asked but then when I ran it by the supervisor again she again asked to make more modifications!\n\nIs it just me? Am I just too dumb to understand the hidden words? Or does it always happen? How do I cope up with it?",

My papers often go through thirty or forty drafts before first submission, and that\u2019s not uncommon. \n\nSeveral fiction authors have written about the craft and process of writing. Anne Lamott\u2019s Bird by Bird and Stephen Kings On Writing may give you some perspective. \n\nTL;DR: your expectations are incorrectly calibrated.",

I'm still calibrating my academic voice so I often have to go through lots of revisions with myself and then several more with my supervisor. I like to wait a week or so after finishing a piece of work before sending it to my supervisor for review, cause it guarantees I'll look at it and see more errors. (It can be a bit crushing to see all the red lines when they come from her.)",

      "text": "That has happened to me with a particular manuscript I was writing, as well as a report I did awhile back. It didn't bother me, because although some modifications were a bit nitpicky, there were legitimate reasons behind it. For example, changing the colors of graphs to accommodate readers who may be colorblind. Since nobody is perfect, the feedback was designed to make the overall product better, so I did not take it personally. For me, as long as someone explains the rationale behind whatever change they are suggesting, I can understand how it would improve the product. \n\nSometimes when you're really invested in a project, everything makes sense to you because you wrote or designed everything. Other people can't read your mind, so having someone less personally attached can help reveal things that may be confusing to people who don't have the same level of knowledge and experience with that subject. \n\nTry not to take it personally. It's not that you didn't work hard or that the work you did was not good enough, it just means you're not perfect like everyone else.",
