  "title:": "Emailing PhD students about their advisor",
  "text": "I\u2019m quite aware that it is a good idea to talk to PhD students who are advised by a certain prof so that you can know more about the lab culture and working style and etc.\n\nNow that there is the pandemic though, it has made it a bit tricker to do so. My uni don\u2019t have in-person lab rotations (at the moment) or lab visits, so the only way I\u2019d be able to connect with a grad student would be to email them (and maybe set up subsequent meet-ups online). \n\nSo:\n\n-\tIs it weird to email a random student to ask about their lab culture and about their advisor like this?\n-\tIf it\u2019s not weird, are there any good ways to approach this, i.e. how I should phrase my email? \n-\t(another question I thought of as an edit) should I ask the prof first if I could talk to one of their students about the lab?\n-\tShould I be worried about my potential advisor knowing that I\u2019ve been trying to ask around his lab about how he is?",

      "text": "It's not weird. I did a lot of emails/zoom calls with potential students even in pre-pandemic times. \n\nI would phrase it as \"Hello, my name is X and I am Interested in working with Dr. Y. I would like to ask you a few questions regarding your experience in their lab\". It's great if you can list \\~5-6 somewhat specific questions that thee grad student can respond to, even if you're going to meet over zoom, they can at least prepare some responses beforehand and you'll get more thorough answers. If your email just asks \"How do you like working with Dr. Y?\" you will get an equally short reply.\n\nIf you don't know which grad students are working in that lab, asking the prof could be a great way to get the names/contact info of current and past grads.\n\nIf the professor is a good one, they should encourage you to talk to their current students so you can get a feel for the group and see if it is a good fit for you. If they are upset about you talking to their grads, that is a major red flag. \n\nTalking to other graduate students as a great way to get more honest feedback about a particular lab and is a very common thing. You should not feel like you are doing anything wrong or going behind the professors back by talking to the grad students. You are doing your due diligence and that should be encouraged by faculty.",

      "text": "I don't think it's any less weird than cold-emailing professors asking if they are accepting grad students. I think most of us expect there to be a possibility that some potential student might reach out, especially if we have profiles on the department's website or our adviser's lab website. \n\nAs far as how to phrase it, I'd keep it short and let them know you are interested in applying to the program, and was wondering if they have time for a quick chat about the program. I wouldn't ask pointed questions in an email because, as others mentioned, if an adviser is an asshole people probably don't want that to be in writing. You're more likely to get bland responses in email than via a video call or in person, imo. \n\nWhich brings up another point: bland responses are a red flag. I love my adviser--he's knowledgeable, kind, and empathetic. I have no problem saying so to any potential student who may be interested in working with him. Another person I worked with I would probably say something like \"they take some getting used to\", or \"Professor Rudey McSnoot is really smart and devoted to their research\" which says little about what it's like working for them. \n\nDo try to keep in mind, though, that there can be a mismatch between personalities. I wouldn't be discouraged if one person had a bad experience, unless it was a truly awful one (e.g. bullying, illegal conduct, unethical behavior), but if multiple people have bad experiences then there's probably a common denominator there.",

They're really the ones that will give you an honest opinion of what culture is in the lab. Just remember people still working there will sugar coat their situation and people who have left may over state things. And I think all supervisors expect prospective students to speak to current students so don't worry about that. If they say their pi doesn't like them talking to you that's definitely a red flag.",
