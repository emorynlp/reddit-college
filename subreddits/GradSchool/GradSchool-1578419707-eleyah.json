I was shocked by the improvement in my quality of life and productivity as a grad student. (list of potential hobbies enclosed lol)", "text": "For my first three years of grad school, my schedule consisted of working 12-14 hour days, coming home, and vegging on the couch before going to bed. I was unhappy and not as productive as I would've liked, but I didn't have the time or energy to do anything else.\n\nLast year, my new years resolution was to force myself to do things. Starting out sucked all of my energy dry, but I forced myself to try one new \"thing\" per month. \n\nAfter a few months... my entire life was better. I was working less but being more productive, as I had more energy, was sleeping better, and was in general healthier. In the morning, I looked forward to coming to work, and in the evening, I looked forward to coming home and working on a project. \n\nIt was a shitty year for me (lost a few family members, including a parent, and had some academic setbacks), but I'm in a significantly better place than I was last year. \n\nNow, I know this post can come across as a bit r/wowthanksimcured, which is not my intention. It's just a success story of someone who has gotten out of the work-sleep-repeat pattern. \n\nFor those of you who might want to try some new things, my monthly new thing list was as follows:\n\nJanuary - snowboarding (love it, still do it!)\n\nFebruary - painting (didnt enjoy it)\n\nMarch - kickboxing (liked it, but too costly)\n\nApril - Journaling (not my thing)\n\nMay - knitting (loved it, still do it)\n\nJune - gardening (love it) \n\nJuly - piano lessons (dud)\n\nAugust - app development (still do it)\n\nSeptember - gym (still do it)\n\nOctober - rock climbing (nah)\n\nNovember - 3d animation (love it!)\n\nDecember - scrapbooking (fun)", "author": "DishsoapOnASponge", "created": 1578419707, "retrieved": 1632845176, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1020, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fhhphk7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/eleyah/i_tried_one_new_thing_every_month_last_year_to/fhhphk7/", "text": "I know this is late but, I wanted to let you know that your post has positively impacted someone's life.

They suggested scheduling something to look forward to during the week and not just the occasional weekend.  I have been doing this for awhile and will say it helps mentally.  Some little things I have done are\n\n* trying a new restaurant or bar\n* game night with friends\n* renting a movie I'm excited about\n* running on a new trail (I do endurance running)\n* meeting up with a friend to not talk about school or work-that is the key part!\n* photography\n* swimming\n* trying a new exercise class\n* watching a sunset\n* birding\n\nMany free or low cost options if you think about it and get creative.
