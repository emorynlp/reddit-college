  "text": "I am going to be applying to some PhD programs for clinical psychology in the upcoming months. I have several programs in mind, and they all look promising based on their websites. However, I want to know what others think about the programs. Is there a website or forum where people share their opinions on grad school programs? I\u2019ve looked around on GradCafe and RateMyProfessors. If anyone has any other suggestions let me know!",

      "text": "Usually you'll have opportunities to talk to current students and potentially alums during an interview weekend or after you've been admitted. I would also talk to your current professors & grad students/post docs you are doing research with, sometimes you can get a sense via word of mouth about the terrible programs/advisors.",
