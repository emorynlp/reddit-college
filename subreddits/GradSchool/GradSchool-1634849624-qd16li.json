  "text": "I'm in CS and considering grad school. I don't really want to just start an SWE job after graduation and do that for the rest of my life, because i think i would easily get bored of it. I like to do research and learn more academically, because I really enjoyed my undergrad but I don't think my undergrad classes have taught me enough into the details. \n\nI heard ppl say \"if you like money then don't go to grad school\", but I'm like I like both research \\*and\\* money lol. In the end, I hope I can still go into industry, either do some research or any phd required position.\n\nMy friend tells me that phd's actually make less money in the industry than college graduates. Is that true? I'm thinking if grad school is worth it in my case.",
