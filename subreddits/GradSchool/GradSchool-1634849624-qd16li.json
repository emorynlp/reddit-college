  "text": "I'm in CS and considering grad school. I don't really want to just start an SWE job after graduation and do that for the rest of my life, because i think i would easily get bored of it. I like to do research and learn more academically, because I really enjoyed my undergrad but I don't think my undergrad classes have taught me enough into the details. \n\nI heard ppl say \"if you like money then don't go to grad school\", but I'm like I like both research \\*and\\* money lol. In the end, I hope I can still go into industry, either do some research or any phd required position.\n\nMy friend tells me that phd's actually make less money in the industry than college graduates. Is that true? I'm thinking if grad school is worth it in my case.",

      "text": "The amount of money you can make depends on many factors, not just on your degree. For example, this recent survey on Data/AI shows some of the factors, including education level, which in this case clearly influences: [2021 Data/AI Salary Survey](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/2021-data-ai-salary-survey/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=awareness&utm_content=salary+survey) Other areas probably have different numbers.\n\nIf you enjoy doing research and want to do that in your career, go ahead and join a grad school. However, if you are unsure, why not get a job for a few years and then enter grad school later. Some people like this latter option because what you study in grad school (at least the classes) is usually the same as what you just saw during your undergrad.\n\nGood luck!",
