  "text": "Do I have to have a specific career interest?   \n\n\nI wanna go into a theoretical CS program. I'm enthusiastic about working in academia or industry, neutral on the idea of of working in a government lab. The only specific career interests I have are just to lead research on a team, maybe be a professor, or be some kind of niche researcher like an algorithms specialist. I'm unsure if I wanna work on a team of people trying to develop technology that solves specific problems in a particular field such as public health or biology or if I wanna work on more theoretical type problems that are mostly studied in purely academic settings. Am I supposed to have a more specific goal?",
