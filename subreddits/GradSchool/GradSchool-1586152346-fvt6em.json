My ex-advisor was a real jerk. My current advisor is the total opposite, everything my ex-advisor wasn't. Basically, in the future, I see myself striving to be as awesome as he.\n\nHe told me that he sees potential in me becoming a good scientist and in the top 1% of faculty in the future. Not only that, but he cares a lot. I got results ready for my first paper in December, and I finished writing the paper in January. However, today we are still making revisions in the writing; we are targeting submission at the end of this month (would've been earlier, had it not been for Corona and Zoom poisoning). Not only is he taking me through revisions, but he's making sure that I really learn how to write scientific papers in the process. As he says, \"tiny baby steps.\" He also wrote me a very nice recommendation letter for a scholarship and nominated me to mentor an undergrad researcher joining our group next semester.\n\nIn the bottom line, your advisor can really make or break a PhD. I really hope your advisors are also great mentors. If they aren't, I suggest either switching or finding someone to mentor/support you on the side (e.g. a close professor or senior friend).\n\nAs another guy on here once said, \"I have one crappy paper with a dumpster fire advisor and four awesome papers with an awesome advisor. It's the grad school experience.\"", "author": "Palerthanghosts", "created": 1586152346, "retrieved": 1632846459, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fmwwdy6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fvt6em/switching_advisors_is_literally_the_best_thing/fmwwdy6/", "text": "How do you go about this? Do you think switching in Year 2 is too late? I feel guilty because I was given an offer to the program I'm in conditionally on the fact that I progress. I took the offer having major doubts, but mainly because it was the school/program I wanted to attend and it would be funded. I havent progressed at all -- been paralyzed by fear of failure and just trying to get by decently in coursework to not look like an ass (coming in from a non STEM background into an engineering program). My advisor somewhat knew this but is also the kind of person that is just brilliant and says to just figure it out. I understand my funding was contingent on progressing in research, but I haven't. Now I'm faced to either switch projects/advisors or graduate this year.
