  "title:": "Switching advisors is literally the best thing that I've ever done in grad school.",
  "text": "I started the switch mid-September last year and have switched officially at the end of November. My ex-advisor was a real jerk. My current advisor is the total opposite, everything my ex-advisor wasn't. Basically, in the future, I see myself striving to be as awesome as he.\n\nHe told me that he sees potential in me becoming a good scientist and in the top 1% of faculty in the future. Not only that, but he cares a lot. I got results ready for my first paper in December, and I finished writing the paper in January. However, today we are still making revisions in the writing; we are targeting submission at the end of this month (would've been earlier, had it not been for Corona and Zoom poisoning). Not only is he taking me through revisions, but he's making sure that I really learn how to write scientific papers in the process. As he says, \"tiny baby steps.\" He also wrote me a very nice recommendation letter for a scholarship and nominated me to mentor an undergrad researcher joining our group next semester.\n\nIn the bottom line, your advisor can really make or break a PhD. I really hope your advisors are also great mentors. If they aren't, I suggest either switching or finding someone to mentor/support you on the side (e.g. a close professor or senior friend).\n\nAs another guy on here once said, \"I have one crappy paper with a dumpster fire advisor and four awesome papers with an awesome advisor. It's the grad school experience.\"",

      "text": "How do you go about this? Do you think switching in Year 2 is too late? I feel guilty because I was given an offer to the program I'm in conditionally on the fact that I progress. I took the offer having major doubts, but mainly because it was the school/program I wanted to attend and it would be funded. I havent progressed at all -- been paralyzed by fear of failure and just trying to get by decently in coursework to not look like an ass (coming in from a non STEM background into an engineering program). My advisor somewhat knew this but is also the kind of person that is just brilliant and says to just figure it out. I understand my funding was contingent on progressing in research, but I haven't. Now I'm faced to either switch projects/advisors or graduate this year. Howw did you go about finding someone or even a different dept?",

          "text": "I switched in Year 3, so it's not too late at all! Also, I'm graduating *on time* because of my new advisor; had I stayed with my old advisor, I would've either left the program or graduated many years late.\n\nI will say that my case is particularly unique because I have a friend who told me his experience and told me whom to switch to. I'd say talking to your peers is a good first step because personal experience is the most important factor. Second, make sure that your new advisor takes you in before leaving your old one. You don't want to be jobless. Once your new advisor takes you in, then it's time to tell the old advisor \"I appreciate these past two years; my research interests have taken a divergent path and I will be continuing my research under [new prof]. I already talked to him, and he accepted. It's nothing personal, and if you need me to do anything before we part ways I'm happy to.\"\n\nAlso, don't worry about not progressing. It's why it's called research. If research were fast, it wouldn't take ~5 years for a PhD. Having a good advisor can easily turn those 5 years into 2 or 3.",

An advisor that \"clicks\" with you, at a second- or third- tier school, sets you up for success much more than a mediocre advisor at a top tier school.

But in the end it didn't, and despite the terror, it was necessary and worth it for my success. This has improved my mental health, productivity, and quality of living in immeasurable ways. Before the switch I truly couldn't see a path forward nor a future for my research because of issues with my advisor. Having the right advisor(s) on your team is critical.",

          "text": "YES. So many red flags that I missed with my ex-advisor. When I first met my ex-advisor, he was awesome, but anyone is when trying to make an impression and/or recruit you, no? But once I started working for him, here were a few red flags even before he started abusing me:\n\n* He always had an \"air\" to him. He always gave an intimidating vibe, like \"I'm the boss and don't cross my line\" kind of vibe.\n   * Nothing wrong with that, as long as he's supportive, but he wasn't\n* He never actually guided me; he would talk about related vague stuff for me to potentially look into, but he never actually helped me\n* I always felt tense when talking to him; the air was always tense\n* He had only one other PhD student, and they had a very bad relationship\n   * On that note, he had another PhD student who left him\n* There were multiple stories from multiple people, but I wasn't yet sure if it were case-by-case or if he were just a butthole\n* He never talks about his personal life; it's always work, work, work, and he just isn't personable\n\nOh, how I should've listened......but at the time I was just focused on my courses and learning. NOW we get to the part where he started being abusive.\n\n* He always dismissed my ideas, and he would get mad at me for not having new ideas\n* Any time I asked him for help/guidance, he would accuse me of \"waiting to be told what to do next\"\n* He would scold and belittle me, as if it would make the results appear any faster\n   * Think about it: all the time he spent scolding and belittling me, he could've actually helped me...\n* His expectations were unrealistic...\n* His questioning method was incredibly Socratic, and I highly doubt it's done in good faith (he does it ALL THE TIME and without an apparent reason)\n* The straw that broke the camel's back: he said he'd no longer support me as a PhD student and that if I wanted to continue to be funded by him I'd have to convert to MS\n\nGREEN flags from my new advisor:\n\n* Even though I'm his subordinate, he treats me like a colleague/friend\n* When I told him about my ex-advisor he said \"Yeah, he's like that. He isn't a bad guy, but his grad students are not his priority.\"\n* I feel so relaxed whenever I meet with him; I know I can approach him for help in literally anything\n   * When I'm stuck, he provides actual specific suggestions\n* He has multiple PhD students who are all happy with him\n* He is open-minded and welcomes discussion and new ideas, rather than being dismissive\n* He sends the relevant literature\n* He told me exactly what kind of questions he'd ask in my prelim and defense\n   * He also gave a list of references that I can use in my papers\n      * Of course I'm still expected to read and understand that, but it saves a lot of time having to search for the literature myself\n* He talks about his personal life and is incredibly personable\n* Bonus: he uses the idioms/phrases that I use, even the colloquial ones",

Yes, it\u2019s taken me extra time to graduate (still not there, but writing my dissertation now!) but it was so worth it! I\u2019m glad it has worked out well for you! Yes, good advisors exist, and you don\u2019t have to suffer through an awful one.",
