  "text": "So I'm not the nicest person to myself on a good day. But grad school has somehow brought out the inner critic in me to awful levels. I am a straight A+ student and have zero confidence. Whenever I meet a prof or researcher I admire I can't stop thinking it went very badly. \n\nAnyone else get like this? I worked for six years prior to this and am used to handling feedback and criticism. But this is baaaad.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in the exact same place as you. I\u2019m a 1st year in literature for reference with only a BA from a commuter public school and community college. I call myself the fledgling, clueless scholar haha. Even with all my meetings with student mentors, ranting to my cohort (bless them) and meeting with professors, I feel SO OUT OF PLACE. My own \u201ccontributions\u201d to class are just blah and with seminar papers due soon I\u2019m just prepared to write crappy first term papers and move on. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve gained from talking about my problems on this platform and with my mentors:\n\nIt\u2019s ok to not be ok. It\u2019s ok to feel like you\u2019re dumb, unskilled, unwanted\u2026it\u2019s ok to be clueless. But stay passionate. Focus on YOUR GOALS. Why did you go to grad school? Why are you studying whatever subject you are studying? I haven\u2019t studied a single thing I want to yet, but out of the 10 weeks I\u2019ve been in my PhD program, I\u2019ve enjoyed a few weeks and learned some new things. \n\nYour professors will have no problem wanting to help you get where you need to go. Keep working with them. Tell them you are clueless. \n\nYou\u2019re going to do great! Forget the grades. Work hard. Talk to anyone who will listen. No one is alone in this, regardless of where you started. I hope this helps. \u2764\ufe0f",
