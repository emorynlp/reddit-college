  "text": "PhD student working out of the uni office. I've been told that IT needs to put a PC on my desk so I can't use the office until they do (not sure why- that's another story).\n\nThat was last Wednesday and I haven't heard anything since. Seeing as it'll be nearly full week of no contact, should I follow up next week at some point?\n\nIf so, how do I not sound rude?",

Just go with something like:\n\n\u2018Hi, \n\nI\u2019m just following up on the installation of a PC in my office and, as I haven\u2019t heard anything since (insert date), I wanted to check everything was okay. I look forward to hearing from you. \n\nMany thanks,\u2019\n\nSomething casual should suffice as you don\u2019t want to appear pushy right off the bat. Keep your supervisor informed so they know of any difficulties you may be facing in your work. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "\"Hi \\[person\\],\n\nI'm \\[introduction\\] and last week I was informed that someone was working on getting a PC in my office so I can use it. I was just wondering if you could give me an estimate about how long it might take to get a computer in my office. I know these things often take some time, but if possible I'd like to have at least a rough estimate so I can plan accordingly. \n\nThank you\"\n\nI think it's pretty straightforward and ime most people don't view follow up emails like that as rude unless you just say \"where's my computer?\". THey probably have a sequence of bureaucratic hurdles to go through so I've found that asking for a time estimate so you can plan seems to help reduce the perception that you're being insistent or pushy because needing to plan your time is a totally valid concern.",

      "text": "With IT I like to try to be as efficient as possible to minimize back-and-forth. That doesn\u2019t mean long emails, but I\u2019d be clear about what you need to lessen the chance that either of you will have follow up questions. Something like:\n\n>Hi Person,\n\n>We spoke last week about a PC installation in Office Number, and I just wanted to follow up to see how that\u2019s going. Is it possible to get an approximate date it will be installed? Thank you so much!\n\nThe exact wording doesn\u2019t really matter as long as you\u2019re kind, but I would be sure to mention the building/office that needs the computer, because they\u2019re probably working on several installations. I\u2019d also be specific that you want a timeline for installation. The length of time could vary a lot depending on whether they\u2019re ordering a computer or have something on hand. You need some idea of that so you can plan accordingly.",

So it can be a long process. In the meantime, I had to use my own PC and a virtual desktop but they are less powerful so it was annoying. I recommend talking with your supervisor about alternative until they install your stuff, if that's your issue as well of course",

How frequently you follow up of course depends on the urgency obviously. You can always just give a brief explanation as to why you're following up if you have to be more aggressive (ex. \"please note the deadline of X day for us to retain funding\").",
