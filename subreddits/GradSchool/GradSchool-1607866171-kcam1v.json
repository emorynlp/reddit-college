  "text": "My PhD program is across the country (USA). I moved near my university in august because I thought it would help my productiveness (it does). For the last month, I have been stressing out about my parents. My parents are in their late 60s and I realize I probably don\u2019t have as much time as I previously thought I did with them due to their poor health. I am 23 so there is a big age gap. \n\nIt has been wrecking me. I have decided to move back to my parents home for the next nine months (until my second year starts). I enjoy my PhD program. I love what I am studying but the idea of giving up time I could have spent with my parents is destroying me.",

      "text": "I'm really sorry :( I lost my dad my first year of college (he was only 55 but still) and it did quite a number on me. I know we all have to deal with it someday but I hope you don't have to deal with it too soon! \n\nI'm very lucky that my mom is now 56 and is in great health. Women on her side of my family usually live well into their 90s even considering most of them had diabetes and smoked and my mom is relatively fit and doesn't smoke and barely drinks, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't worry about it too. Her memory has started getting worse and it's still well within what's expected for women past menopausal age but it's still scary to think about it getting worse. \n\nBut I'm guessing since you have such a strong worry about your parents, you guys have a good relationship! They're probably very proud of you and want you to live your best life without being a burden on you (based on how my mom is haha). I'd say keeping in contact with them as much as possible, visiting often, all that stuff, is really great because you can stay close but not make them feel guilty about you making too many sacrifices for them.",

That\u2019s always a risk, but they got to live their life (travel, live in new places) and you should be able to do the same. I try to maintain good contact with them (call them all the time and visit them), but I can\u2019t stay in the same city and miss opportunities just for the possibility that they may die. It\u2019s scary and not fun, but also something you have to push through.",

      "text": "I do stress.  You will too.  \n\nMy grandmother and grandfather raised me along with my mother.  My grandfather passed away when I was 20 and for the last year of his life I was his primary caretaker.  Until I moved away for my PhD I was my grandmother's primary caregiver for most of a decade, though thankfully she did not need as much care as my grandfather.  \n\nThis year, which is the longest I had gone without seeing my mother and grandmother since I started my PhD.  Normally I would go out there for work at the university we work with on my project every few months, but this year thanksgiving was the first I was able to go out since Christmas of last year.  \n\nThis year saw my grandmother need a total hip replacement, and because of covid delays saw her degrade from walking with pain, to walking with a cane, to walking with a walker, to barely being able to move around the house with a walker before they finally lifted the ban on this \"nonessential\" surgery.  Later this year she had to have a pacemaker put in because she has a condition where her heart rate slows and it progressed to the point where it would slow so much she'd pass out and nearly stop breathing.  \n\nAs she ages and becomes more frail the stress increases.  My hope is once I graduate and am making more as a postdoc I will be able to buy a house that is suitable for her to come out and visit for a month or so once or twice a year.  Otherwise the plan is to keep going out and visiting as much as I can.  \n\nI don't mean to sound like a downer, but this is the reality I had to face when I decided on whether moving for my PhD is worth it or not.  Only you can decide if the stress of moving is both worth it and is something you can handle well enough that it won't interfere with your ability to finish your degree.",

I hate that the last time we talked was me whining about school. :/\n\nMy dad's still around. We talk regularly, but I'm still not in town with him. When I start my PhD, I'm going to have to move, which will be even harder this time because he's all I have left.

Is there a closer institution to home where you can transfer your PhD program? Is it just homesickness or a general anxiety about losing your mother? Do you want to stay where your mom is, or do you want to flourish elsewhere? - these are important personal questions that you need to at least address to yourself and I hope they would help guide you in your decision. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as black and white as you wished and there\u2019s no one good answer anyone here can give to you. \n\nAll the best, stranger!",

      "text": "I don't have a solution either, but I'm in the same boat (also in the US). I applied to mostly schools that were no more than a 10 hour drive from my parents' in case of any emergency. I had moved much further away for undergrad and being away from home (homesickness, cultural differences) took a toll on my mental health which along with my parents' ages, was another reason why I wanted to move closer for grad school. I ended up choosing a university that's about an hour away which proved invaluable when, ironically, I was the one who had a health emergency at the beginning of this year. \n\nI'll be finishing up my PhD in 2-3 years so I'll be facing the same dilemma again soon when searching for post-docs. COVID has reminded me not only of how short life is, but also how much my parents do rely on me. English isn't their first language so they often call me with questions about bills and other documents, and I've been ~~parenting~~ translating to my parents about COVID safety over the last few months. Oddly enough, I've been thinking about doing a post-doc outside of the US. Not sure if I'm just stir-crazy at the moment.\n\nI feel that academia expects that you just up and leave for opportunities that fit us best career-wise, regardless of location. However, from talking to more senior grad students and faculty, location is so important. If you're not happy living somewhere, it's just going to make the already difficult PhD/post-doc/academic journey harder.",

Though not entirely relevant to the question, I live with both my parents whilst finishing my PhD clinical epi and deal with a slightly different problem. For years I have been warning my parents that their actions an behaviours will have grave consequences. My mother is overweight and does not exercise. She just keeps consuming sugars and carbs and thinks nothing of it. I continually reminder her that she is not eating healthy and that it would be so good for her to eat better and exercise, even going as far as to prep and eat healthy meals with her.  My father had a stroke in 2015 if I remember correctly and does NOT eat healthy, he sneaks food and hides it. He is like a fish, if the food is there he just consumes it until it is gone without any sort of satiety. He isn\u2019t grossly overweight, but he is at risk for another CVD event for sure. The worst part is that I predicted both of their diseases well before they happened and no one did anything about it. \n\nAs someone who works with and constantly sees the burden of chronic disease on people, it is constantly on my mind. From the time I wake to the time I sleep. Living with them is hell. To add paraffin to the flame, I am assisting with the government\u2019s COVID response for surveillance and tracing and constantly am telling people why they got COVID and how they put everyone\u2019s lives at risk.

As another commenter said, they do prefer that I flourish far away rather than waste my talents close to home, but they would ideally prefer both. \n\nMy advice is to worry less about the amount of time you are apart and focus on the time you have together. Try to keep up, and try to let some invitations for drama or fights go. If you haven\u2019t already, try to forgive your parents for not being the gods you thought they were as a child, and try to renegotiate your relationship with them as an adult. \n\nThe flip side is to think of your present environment as home. If you keep pining for home as where you grew up, life will be even harder and you subconsciously won\u2019t try as hard to integrate in your current environment. You live there now - make it home. It will help with the homesickness too. \n\nWhat has worked for me is: regular video calls (we do sundays); and some attempt to make our short stints together meaningful and pleasant. When I visit, I spend a lot of time with them rather than with my (vastly diminished) circle of childhood friends. I try to slip in to the normal warp and weft of life there rather than make a song and dance about my presence, because I think we all appreciate the quieter, quotidian moments of family life. It\u2019s usually an excuse for an extended family get together too, which is nice.",

In the years since we moved to do grad school, there have been multiple family crises -- health and other kinds. It is extremely challenging not to worry about them from afar, and we are occasionally burdened with the thought that the PhD is not worth the years we are giving up being with family.\n\nOur answer has been to treat vacation time and trips home as sacred. We never miss going home for the big holidays (except for this year...), and we even try to make smaller trips for occasions like birthdays. I know there are folks in academia who believe absolute sacrifice is necessary to survive, that there are advisors or departments that would make life hard for people who would put family and personal life over work -- so not trying to be prescriptive here. We're still in grad school -- we don't know if we've \"made it,\" and I can't say how it will affect our careers in the long run, but the prospect of deferring all participation in family life for the PhD?
