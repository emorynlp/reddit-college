I've been working full time for five years now, and I'm hoping to increase my knowledge base, add 2 years to my experience level, and become a more valuable asset in the meantime.\n\nI'll be doing it in addition to the <40hrs a week I typically work, so It would have to be a 2 year program most likely. One issue is that my undergrad is in IT, so i'm missing alot of possible prerequisites like calculus 3.\n\nGreat/terrible experiences with online programs welcome, I currently don't know anyone with a recent masters in CS so a starting point would be great!", "author": "Hypern1ke", "created": 1631046087, "retrieved": 1632844732, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbzvfg6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjv3yo/cs_online_masters_degree_recommendations_needed/hbzvfg6/", "text": "Check out Old Dominion University.
