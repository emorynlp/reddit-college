  "text": "I\u2019m really stressed out and I know they don\u2019t owe me anything, but I just feel helpless and I hate that feeling. I\u2019ve done everything I could from my end to fill out those applications, and I\u2019m really passionate about psychology and want to pursue grad school and now i\u2019m in a major risk of having 4 out of 7 program applications being deemed as incomplete because of something that\u2019s completely out of my hand\u2026",

All I want to know is why? Just at least tell me you\u2019re busy, communicate, anything\u2026",

              "text": "Honestly, from my experience with professors, if the deadline is December 1 then it\u2019s currently super early for them to do anything. Most of mine submitted references the week-of (honestly more like the day become) the deadline. It sounds like you might be acting a little overbearing with your professor, which only serves to put them off.\n\nI understand your eagerness to apply, but you need to allow space for this very busy person who is doing you a favor. If your applications were due tomorrow then I\u2019d understand your rush, but you have a whole month. Give them time before you check in again.",
