Of course, the former's opinion is more reliable, but the latter knows what I did in my studies in much more detail.\n\nThanks in advance for all your input.", "author": "big-lion", "created": 1630553347, "retrieved": 1632845146, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hbjlhyv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pg9qpr/asking_for_a_letter_the_professor_or_the_phd/hbjlhyv/", "text": "You want the professor, but the PhD student could write the letter for them and then let the professor check it and sign it, if they want that.

A letter of rec from a grad student means nothing. The reason why, is that the grad student doesn't have near as much to compare you to. The PI has seen a lot more people work in labs, and make their way through various levels of study. They will be able to more accurately say where your skills lie, versus someone who is still learning themselves. While it may feel like the PhD student knows your work ethic/skills better, and that's surely true, the PI knows which of those skills make sense to mention in a letter. Also, as everyone else has mentioned, the signature just carries more weight. You don't want the thought going through reviewers' minds to be \"why *couldn't* this person get the PIs letter?\".", "author": "ORGrown", "created": 1630596999, "upvotes": 2}, "hbal371": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pg9qpr/asking_for_a_letter_the_professor_or_the_phd/hbal371/", "text": "PhD student will write the letter, professor will read through it and maybe change a couple of things.
