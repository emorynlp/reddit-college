  "title:": "How to say I love learning without being clich\u00e9?",
  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m working on writing my SoP for chemistry PhD programs, and I\u2019m struggling a bit. I want to say that what motivates me to pursue a PhD is my love of learning. I have the most fun when I\u2019m doing extensive research, and learning any new information excites me. Being able to spend four years learning anything and everything about a topic and going down every rabbit hole imaginable sounds like a dream. Just as an example, I had to write a review article on single atom catalysts for a course I took, and it was so much fun. I read through and picked apart dozens of journal articles and spent days trying to understand everything that I possibly could. I felt like a detective! It was so much fun! I want all the knowledge!! I love knowing things!! Especially chemistry things!!\n\nAnyways, the problem I\u2019m running into is that I don\u2019t know how to express this without it sounding super cheesy or clich\u00e9. Pretty much all the advice I\u2019ve read is \u201cdon\u2019t say you\u2019re motivated by your love of learning!! That\u2019s too clich\u00e9!!\u201d. But I don\u2019t know what else motivates me! I love learning and chemistry is really freaking cool! It explains why things are the way they are and that\u2019s pretty neat!\n\nSo yeah any advice would be very helpful, thank you all!!!",

      "text": "Reminds me of this post (but yours is less ridiculous): [https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qh0v78/is\\_hedonism\\_a\\_bad\\_motivation\\_to\\_list\\_in\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qh0v78/is_hedonism_a_bad_motivation_to_list_in_a/)\n\nMy advice would be similar to what I told that guy (and apparently what onlines articles say): saying that you love to learn, look forward to spending four years investigating some niche research, or love picking apart dozens of articles etc. is a weak personal statement because the baseline expectation is that this *should be true for every single PhD student*. It's not that these aren't great skills, it's that they do nothing to make you stand out and quite frankly \"talk is cheap\", you saying that *the idea* of doing these things doesn't give anyone confidence that you *actually will*. I'm a bit jaded because I run an undergraduate research program and review hundreds of applications and they literally **all look like this.**\n\nIn my opinion, a stronger statement of purpose should focus on how your knowledge, past experiences, and specific skills will help you with the actual process of *performing research*.",

          "text": "Thank you for the advice!!!!!! Also thank you for linking that post!! \n\nI\u2019ve written the rest of my SoP, in which I do focus largely on my knowledge, past experiences, and skills help me with performing research and make me a good candidate for a PhD program, with concrete examples and professors that align with my research interests. My original post is mainly concerning my intro paragraph, where I\u2019m supposed to give an idea of who I am and my background, along with what motivates me/inspires me, while still connecting that to going to grad school for chemistry. I\u2019m just having a hard time communicating all that in a way that is not super boring or generic. Which is a little difficult, because I feel like I\u2019m not a very interesting person compared to others. I just really love chemistry and I really love research.",

It seems like I need to do some reflection and come up with what motivates me and inspires me besides what I mentioned. Do you have any advice for what motivations are interesting without being chronically over done?",

      "text": "I'd say talk less (if at all) about your motivation and more about your precise research interests. Being able to show the admissions committee that you know your subject and see yourself as a researcher is much more important imo.\n\n\rMy SoP (humanities) started with this sentence: \n\n\"My primary areas of interest are X, Y, and Z.\"\n\nAnd then I had two large paragraphs explaining in more depth what kinds of questions I was interested in in those areas, and topics I had taken classes on or written term papers on. My writing sample was in area X so I also talked about what I was arguing in that paper in the paragraph concerning X.\n\nThen I had a shorter final boilerplate paragraph that went like this:\n\n\r\"I am drawn to the PhD program in A at the University of B because of the outstandingly large number of excellent researchers in the Department of A whose work coincides with my areas of interest. I am convinced that continuing my research career at the University of B would allow me to excel as a scholar, and I would be honored to join and contribute to such an outstanding community.\"\n\nThat's all I said about motivation specifcally, all the rest should have been clear from the other discussions about questions I wanted to explore further in the topic-specifc paragraphs. I did very well in admissions and even though the sciences may have different requirements, I'd say that talking in an informed way about your research interests will make you sound more serious and mature than vague platitudes like a love of learning. A good SoP should make it clear that you are motivated, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to discuss your motivation directly, as a stand alone topic.",

          "text": "Thank you!!! This is very helpful!!! I would prefer to leave it out, but the prompt for a couple of schools specifically tells you to describe your motivations/inspirations for pursuing chemistry and for pursuing a graduate degree. This is mainly for the intro paragraph, the rest of the paragraphs mostly go through what you said. So I\u2019m just a little stuck with this last part \ud83d\ude05 thank you again for the advice, your examples are super helpful",
