There is a stipend, and that's great! But it means I have to work part time to make everything work instead of full time. Constantly though the professors and university somehow don't realize that bills are a thing. I had a prof for my orals that was HORRIFIED by my working the summer before them. I didn't know what to say but I wish I could have pointed out that unless he wants to pay my bills, yeah of course I'm working! Do they just not get that the stipends that stay the same for decades don't pay the way anymore? I'm not in a super expensive location thankfully but its still a major city.\n\nOr today, I met with one of my advisors because I'm going to be TAing a class next semester. Only problem is, my part-time gig is teaching a few classes at a local private school. Morning was going to be set aside for TAing and working on my thesis, afternoons for supplementing the stipend. But apparently they changed the time of the class I was going to TA and didn't even think it was necessary to inform the TAs about the change, certainly not asking us if it was possible for us. This is the last requirement except for my thesis, so I need to TA a course. But I also need to be able to actually have some sort of income beyond the paltry stipend (the extra stipend for TAing is something but also not much).\n\nI suppose this ties into the general disregard for life to be affordable based on work, and its a pain. They think they can just throw us around for jack shit and its just not ok. If they want to run my life, pay me enough! In the meantime, I'll chug along with my research and my part-time work so I can live a decent life.
