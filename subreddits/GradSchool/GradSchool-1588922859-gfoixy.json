I defended it over Zoom last month and it passed with minor revisions.\n\nBut with the pandemic, I never walked, and I never again saw my committee in person once everything was set in place. Then I moved to my parent's home to start looking for a job, and to be honest I was in a bit of a low place since I didn't get into any of the Ph.D. programs I applied to and the economy is trash for job hunting. Everything was just kind of over and I didn't really know how to process it.\n\nBut in the mail today I received a new copy of a book I had used heavily in my thesis as a congratulations for passing and earning my degree. It was a gift from my advisor.\n\nIt was just that one symbol of acknowledgment that everything I had done was real and worth it and I deserved my degree, despite the uncertain future. I broke down into tears for almost 15 minutes. It was extremely cathartic.\n\nSorry for the ramble and my halfway pity party. I needed to get this off my chest and no one I know would understand.\n\nBut if it helps anyone in a similar position, you absolutely have earned your degree.", "author": "Rories1", "created": 1588922859, "retrieved": 1632953832, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 409, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fpxbkat": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gfoixy/i_couldnt_believe_that_i_had_done_it/fpxbkat/", "text": "Congratulations!

It seems to be a cruel joke that we have the most educated generation in history, with a wealth of knowledge ready to be utilized to improve humanity, and yet we are unwilling to pay the paltry living sums or create the jobs necessary to employ them. Instead the wealth is concentrated in the hands of the luxury consumer elite and as profit for industries which frankly should be nationalized at this point since they are unable to function properly.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t blame yourself. These machinations are far greater than you or I. Secure your material needs and do as much good in the world as you can. Whatever lofty ideals and goals you have, try to achieve them, but do not reflect on life as wasted if you fail.\n\nI dunno. You\u2019re a historian.
