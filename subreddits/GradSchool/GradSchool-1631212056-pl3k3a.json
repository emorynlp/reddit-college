      "text": "A withdraw on your transcripts is the tiniest of tiny red flags. Grad school admissions committees are made up of humans who understand that applicants are humans who have lives outside of their studies. And a W is just a sign of that.\n\nWith that being said, there are a couple scenarios where withdraws may have a sizable impact on your application. One is if you have a whole bunch of Ws. 1 W is a sign of life outside your studies, 47 Ws is a sign of a habit which could very well stop you from doing well in any graduate program. The second scenario is if they have two or more ***VERY*** similarly qualified applicants. I don't mean you and someone else have the same educational background and GPA; I mean you have arguably the same application portfolios (same schools, same degrees, same references, same GPA, same publications). While this second scenario is worth mentioning, it is extremely unlikely to happen and thus I would recommend that thinking about it is a waste of time.",

It's not like you didn't finish the course.\n\nIf the course is directly related to what you want to do, the grade you received may be a larger factor than the grade you received in a random course. But unless you received a C or lower, I wouldn't worry about it.",
