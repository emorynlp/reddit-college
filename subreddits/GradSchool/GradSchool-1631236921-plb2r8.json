  "text": "I am struggling finding the jargon to use descriptively to figure out what graduate degree program would best suit my interests. Ideally I\u2019d like to help develop a climate-forward curriculum to be implemented in schools at young ages. I do not mean teaching kids earth science in kindergarten, but more soft skills that, if taught to children early, will make them more environmentally responsible adults. \n\nSome examples could be recycling (actual recycling not what they teach now), the importance of growing plants, not cutting down the rain forest, using your legs or bike to get around, eating less meat etc. kind of indoctrination but for the good of the planet.\n\nAnyway, what graduate program would I look for?\n\nThanks!",

They do specific work in \"informal\" education as well, so like children's museums, outdoor ed, etc. and its a great school for anything sustainability focused, lots of overlap with parks, forestry, climate science programs as well. Had a guy in my class last spring who was finishing up his degree with them and loved it, he worked with children's museums making science content (online for covid and in person).",
