  "text": "Hi r/GradSchool,\n\nNext winter (Jan-Feb) I'll be writing my thesis. I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel!\n\nAnd I wish for a change of scenery. I was thinking I could write my thesis somewhere warm and comfortable. \n\nHas anyone traveled abroad while writing? Any recommendations, or traps to avoid?\n\nI don't know where I want to go, but I was thinking about some place not too touristy, since I still need to be productive. \n\nThoughts?",

Working in a cafe might be fun once in a while, but I guess that after a few days, it might be annoying. \n\nSince it would only be about writing, I know I can't write for eight hours in a day, so I'm not too worried about taking afternoons off to explore",

I personally would recommend Southern Europe (warm, things to do but not too distracting unless you are in the middle of some place like Rome, Barcelona, or Athens, and fairly affordable for the most part)",
