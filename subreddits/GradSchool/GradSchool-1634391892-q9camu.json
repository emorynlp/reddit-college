  "text": "Hi r/GradSchool,\n\nNext winter (Jan-Feb) I'll be writing my thesis. I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel!\n\nAnd I wish for a change of scenery. I was thinking I could write my thesis somewhere warm and comfortable. \n\nHas anyone traveled abroad while writing? Any recommendations, or traps to avoid?\n\nI don't know where I want to go, but I was thinking about some place not too touristy, since I still need to be productive. \n\nThoughts?",

          "text": "Definitely. \n\nI was thinking about renting a cheap office space like WeWork, so I should have everything I need on the technical side. Working in a cafe might be fun once in a while, but I guess that after a few days, it might be annoying. \n\nSince it would only be about writing, I know I can't write for eight hours in a day, so I'm not too worried about taking afternoons off to explore",
