  "text": "Hi everyone! I know there's a lot of people going through the grad school application process right now and I wanted to share some advice because I'm in my final year of my counselling psychology program.\n\nThe decision to attend graduate school can have a huge impact on your life and career and it's important to weigh the pros and cons before taking the next step. For me, I went to grad school because getting a master's degree was the path to becoming a clinical counsellor. I know it was the right choice for me because this is what I'm really passionate about and what I want to do with my life!\n\nOn the other hand, you may not be sure about what you want to do in life or feel pressured to attend because of your family. You may also think it is the only way to advance in your career or find a new job, but this might not be the case. Grad school can be physically and emotionally draining and cost you a lot of time and money.\n\nIt's important to really understand your reasons for wanting to attend grad school, know what your goals are, and know how grad school will help you reach those goals. Your confidence in your decision will be evident in your grad school applications and help you convince the admissions committee why they should accept you into their program. Most importantly, you will be making the decision that is right for *you* and *your life*.\n\nIf you're trying to weigh the pros and cons of grad school, I made a short video about this topic. I hope this will help you make an informed decision about attending grad school! (: [https://youtu.be/ledrtaOw4LI](https://youtu.be/ledrtaOw4LI)",
