  "text": "I am not slovenly person, but I don't pay attention much to my fashion in grad school as long as I wear long suitpants, clean shoes, and clean shirts that don't reveal other than lower arms. My advisor just pulled me aside and told me that he saw me wearing same particular combination of shirts and pants from this monday to Wednesday, and he said if I keep doing this it would look bad on myself and him as well.\n\nKinda odd criticism IMO...anyone got the similar comments?\n\nedit: Ok, I forgot to mention that I have been wearing this particular clothes for MONTHS because it's perfect to look casual yet mildly professional, while not being too cold or hot. maybe he got fed up with it but still i dind't expect it lol.\n\nAlso, he is from Honduras, if it matters.\n\nEdit 2: yall are way too invested into this lol.

      "text": "I think what's happening is that either your advisor thinks you're wearing the same clothes straight through three days, or he thinks other people will think that. If this were a fashion critique, it would be obnoxious and inappropriate. But I think it's something else: he doesn't want anyone to think that you're living in the lab and not going home to change clothes, eat, sleep, etc. That *would* reflect poorly on both of you--it would look like either he is overworking you or you were managing your time badly. \n\nI still think it's an obnoxious way to address the issue, but there could be something to this besides fashion.",

I've had two advisors and neither has suggested that we overwork ourselves (they always acknowledge the importance of rest, family, health, etc), and the vast majority of my colleagues seem to be in similar situations to me in this regard.\n\nI think people are starting to learn that it's bad for both life and science if people are overworked and exhausted all the time. There will always be difficult bosses, but I think that particular aspect of the culture is improving. Or maybe I'm just in a really nice department, who knows.",

It's weird that he pays such close attention to your attire, and it's weird that he didn't bother to ensure his perception was even based in reality. Many people have different pairs of the same item in slightly different colors. Like how many different variation of jeans are there really? I probably look like I wear the same pair of jeans all the time because I like dark wash jeans and they all pretty much look the same. You'd really only notice if you were looking at the pockets, in which case I'd seriously question why someone was inspecting my ass so hard. \n\nIf he is not willing to personally pay for new clothing, then he should keep his opinion to himself. As long as your clothes are clean and not stinky, excessively wrinkled or unkempt, he really shouldn't be criticizing your clothes, particularly so given that he probably makes multiple times your salary.",

Not because your advisor said something, but because your clothes will last longer since you won't need to wash them as frequently and it could be cheaper in the long run if you pay for laundry. If you're paying $3 every 3 days to run a load and can push it to once a week (assuming you just wear normal casual clothes on the weekend), two extra outfits would pay themselves back in a couple months depending on how much you spend.

The skills that you have obtained and are developing are in no way tied to what you wear. You could come dressed in a modest potato sack every day and it wouldn\u2019t affect how you work!
