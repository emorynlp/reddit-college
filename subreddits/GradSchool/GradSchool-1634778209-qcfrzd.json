  "title:": "Should I\u2026 over 40, thinking of an MS in Bio (online non thesis).",
  "text": "I\u2019m a high school teacher (science) with a BS in zoology. I\u2019ve always thought I\u2019d go to grad school but the teen I was made some mediocre choices so I got a non- traditional teaching cert- an MAT without the M. \n\nBeen teaching for over twenty years and as I approach retirement I am thinking teaching at a Community college for enjoyment and helping people move their careers forward. For this I\u2019d need a Masters degree or 18 credit hours in the discipline. \n\nI am looking at online MS-bio programs. \n\nI\u2019d like to see what anyone\u2019s experience with online MS programs and/or teaching at community college and if this old dog should try to learn some new tricks.",

      "text": "Yes. It sounds like a reasonable investment. You might make a few more bucks from your current teaching job as well and will get to have a nice retirement career (won't pay too much as adjuncts are kind of exploited) that is better than being a Wal-Mart Greeter.",
