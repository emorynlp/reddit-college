I used to get my stomach in knots trying to write a \"good\" first draft. This amazing old researcher, going on 90 and just flat out one of the most delightful, brilliant people I've ever met, dispelled that anxiety. I'd turn in *garbage* and he wold give me a big smile and say, \"This is perfect!\". Then a couple days or a week later, he would call me and say \"Hey I've been thinking about your Aim 2, what if...\" and always just threw down some tiny 3 or 4 word change that made everything click. So, even though I don't think I can convey the wonderful wisdom he said these points with, I wanted to share the ones I wrote down that have helped me the most. \n\n* \tGive yourself adequate time\n\n* \tWrite clearly and simply\n\n* \tWrite for your reviewers, not yourself\n\n* \tNonetheless, you are writing for yourself because whose idea and whose career is it?\n\n* \t**Every first draft is perfect because its only job is to exist**\n\n* \tYour manuscript will never be perfect. Good enough gets published. \n\n* \tWrite regularly to avoid binge writing. Do the easy stuff first - get your biosketch out of the way!\n\nHappy writing!", "author": "Weaselpanties", "created": 1583708154, "retrieved": 1632953867, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 392, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fk1uvfo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ffksqr/my_favorite_writing_tips_from_one_of_my_favorite/fk1uvfo/", "text": "I have so much trouble with that with drafts.
