  "text": "I\u2019m in the PhD application cycle for clinical psychology. Just wanted to get an idea about if a PI replies. I\u2019ve contacted several to see if they are accepting students along with of course writing my credentials and why I\u2019m interested in their lab specifically along with my goals.   \n\nIs it a good sign if they reply? What exactly is the mindset of those who actually DO reply to potential PhD students who inquire.",

      "text": "Definitely a good sign as it typically means they are actively recruiting a student! Most PIs receive a number of these emails during the application season, so typically their response will be relatively concise - \"yes I am taking a student this coming year, am looking forward to reviewing your application\". \n\nIn most cases, it simply puts on you on a general radar with a number of other students. I would not necessarily make too much out of it, and in the past I have simply replied thanking them for their response and for their time and consideration. Some professors will not accept any students that apply but did not send an email prior to showcase their interest - so you are definitely on the right track! \n\nIn one situation, a professor was actively very interested in my application and we have several correspondence between us (though she ended up with a family medical emergency and did not take a student that year and I ended up accepting an offer from another clinical program).",

      "text": "It\u2019s not necessarily a good sign or not; it depends on their answer. If they\u2019re definitive in their response in that they\u2019re not taking students, well, there\u2019s your answer. A lot of PIs will be less clear though. By the time a prospective student would join the lab officially it would be 1.5-2 years later (note: this might be heavily field dependent). A lot can change within that time period regarding a labs\u2019 funding. So a lot of PIs will keep their answer open ended.",
