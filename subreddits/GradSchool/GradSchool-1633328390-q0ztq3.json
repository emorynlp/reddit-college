  "title:": "LOR issues- Prof. did not say no but seems skeptical.",
  "text": "I have asked LOR from my final year project guide and she said yes. But the catch is when I went to meet her personally she seemed very skeptical. She said that she will be giving LoRs to lot of alumnis and the university might view it as a flag if she gave a lot of LoRs. But she did not even say no. She said to go ahead and add her name.\n\nI cannot just understand if this is a polite way of rejecting. I don't know if the admissions committee will see this as a negative if I do not have an lor from project guide. \n\nI am totally out of my mind. This the last stage of applications and I really don't know if I can keep myself sane till the end.\n\nSorry for the rant but seriously any suggestions will be welcome!",

She would tell you if she really couldn't do it. As you said, having a letter from your project supervisor is very important.",
