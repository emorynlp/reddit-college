I'm starting my MSW in a couple of weeks, but I feel practically zero excitement. I've been aware that I haven't been looking forward to it for some time, but thought as I got closer to the start date my confidence in my decision would fall into place. I was very wrong. I feel confusion and anxiety to the point that I looked into seeking a deferral, but was told my school (which is in the top 3 for this field) isn't offering any this year due to record-high applications.\n\nWhat I keep returning to is this: I'm currently in the second draft of writing a novel. As I've invested more time into this project, I've really come to believe in it strongly. I've also been lucky enough to work on it full time for the past year. Finishing this novel is a priority for me. I'm so scared I won't have time once I start graduate school. \n\nI've also realized that I'm not passionate about social work per se. I've always been involved in and passionate about community activism/community work, and my goal as a licensed indepedent clinical social worker sounds fulfilling and like the best option for a more \"traditional\" professional career. Still, am I looking forward to the work it will take to get me there? No. Thinking about it makes me feel defeated before I've even begun. I've realized as I've gotten older and devoted more time to my mental health that my passion and joy comes from more creative/artistic projects, like the novel I'm working on. I just don't know how to bank on a career coming out of these projects, let alone any level of financial security.\n\nI guess I need advice as to whether this will get better. Should I attend the first quarter and see if I like it? Should my mountain of reservations indicate to me that I'd be better off not wasting my time? Has anyone else postponed graduate school to focus on other projects, and if so, did you regret it? In grad school, how much time and energy do you have to devote to other things?", "author": "noelparker22", "created": 1631509598, "retrieved": 1632844606, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcof11d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pn8wxx/feeling_so_much_dread_about_starting_my_msw/hcof11d/", "text": "It's a ton of work, so if you're not excited about the MSW or the field of social work. I don't see why you'd put yourself through all that. You've already found what so many are searching for (work that inspires and excites you), why put that on the back burner for something that fills you with dread? It's easy to get sucked into the fear trap created by capitalism, but it's possible to resist if you stay focused on your values and priorities. Good luck and I can't wait to read the book!!", "author": "MindfulnessHunter", "created": 1631532022, "upvotes": 2}, "hco0i1r": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pn8wxx/feeling_so_much_dread_about_starting_my_msw/hco0i1r/", "text": "...\nDid an alternate version of myself write this? \nIs there anyway in which beginning your msw will benefit your novel, or benefit your writing in such a way that it will make your novel, help your writing in general? \nAs a fellow writer and msw student, I believe I understand your post pretty well...but I could be mistaken. I was 5 years into a lengthy fantasy novel when I got accepted to my msw program, and I haven't really worked on it since...but I have written a number of shorter creative non-fiction pieces based on things that got stirred up in my msw classes that are currently hovering around 90k words which could be worked into something novel-length in a genre I had not previously been interested in writing in. \nI think you might find it easier to earn some type of income with an msw than solely as a writer, and there appear to be some overlaps between the two areas, such as advocacy and spreading awareness about sw issues. \nI don't have a lot of time to devote to fully creative writing, but I think the two will help each other once I graduate and can delve more into writing. I have been writing shorter, \"flash\" pieces based on things that the msw program has stirred up within me and it has been helpful, both in my development as a writer and working on my own issues. It might be a creative avenue for helping clients explore and express themselves in healthy ways that they had not previously been explored.", "author": "baubel", "created": 1631519345, "upvotes": 2}}}
