  "text": "**TLDR: I was wondering if anyone had advice for dealing with an advisor who procrastinates and leaves everything for the last minute?**\n\n**Background:** I start working on things early and I also have everything finished at least 24 hours before a deadline. My advisor leaves everything for the last minute and it really is impactful to me. For example, I have a proposal defense soon and need a finished written proposal done by the 16th. I sent my advisor several drafts starting 2 months ago. My advisor is just now starting to look at it and give me feedback (today is the 6th). Also, I am not able to do the \"preliminary findings\" section yet because my advisor wanted to \"finalize the figures and statistics\" themself, but they still haven't gotten those findings to me despite me asking for them several times over the last several months. I'm not the only one in the lab that this happens to. My other lab mates have been shamed and called out by their committee members or paper collaborators for not meeting deadlines but it isn't their fault, it's the advisor who is always late thus making me and my lab mates late.\n\n**Some things I already do:** 1) I give them a draft super early so that they can plan it into their schedule around all the other students they manage. 2) I tell them the deadline for things is actually sooner than it really is. 3) send them reminder emails 4) try to meet every week (advisor is super busy and often has made no progress between meetings on things we were supposed to have finished).\n\nI really need some advice. What more can I do to help them meet deadlines? How do I help myself through this situation? I know I can't change what is out of my control, but what is in my control? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "It's very frustrating to be in your position. It sounds like you're doing many of the things that can usually 'encourage' a procrastinator to stay on track.\n\n>2) I tell them the deadline for things is actually sooner than it really is. 3) send them reminder emails 4) try to meet every week (advisor is super busy and often has made no progress between meetings on things we were supposed to have finished)\n\nAbout the only thought I would add is to look at *combining* these things.\n\nFor point number 4, you want to frame your meeting as \"*Can we meet on Thursday to discuss your feedback on the draft I gave you last week?*\" or even \"*Let's set a meeting to discuss last week's draft. What time works for you?*\" You don't get the same effect if you're just saying \"*Let's meet on Thursday*\" or \"*Let's have a meeting to discuss the status of my proposal*.\"\n\nRemember, you don't want to let them mentally tick off \"had a weekly meeting with Student\" or \"updated Student on the status of their proposal\" and think they're done. The meeting is to discuss progress or completion of *their* work and *their* responsibilities. If *their* work isn't done when they said it would be, get them to set delivery dates. Remind them of meeting agenda items that are *their* responsibility a day or two ahead of the meetings, if necessary. Don't let them off the hook.",
