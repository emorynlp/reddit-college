  "title:": "Why are so many federal student-loan servicing companies not renewing their contracts with the DOE?",
  "text": "I noticed that yet another student-loan servicing company has chosen to not renew their contract with the Department of Education.  That's a total of four companies this year, including Navient, FedLoan Servicing, and two smaller student-loan servicers.  It seems odd that there are plenty of news stories that report on **what's** happening, but no reporting on **why** it's happening.  As someone with plenty of student loans, I'm curious as to why the precipitous exit from this industry.  Any ideas?",

          "text": "It's not the forgiveness that's giving them fits it's that they are very bad at it.  They've consistently given people who should qualify bad information or wrong information.  Public service forgiveness is case in point. Less than 1% of people who've applied have gotten it.  The lawsuits against Navient basically boil down to them misleading people, steering them to the wrong payment plans, steering people into forbearance or deferment instead of ibrs, and denying people who should qualify for forgiveness on technicalities.  Keep in mind that a lot of these programs weren't even on the books until the mid 2000's.  The first wave of people qualifying for forgiveness has been in the last few years.  More are coming every year.  Pretty soon, the first wave in ibrs will also start to qualify.    The servicers not just Navient, but all of them are losing money because they can't keep up with the changes in regulation, the losses they've taken from the relief in the last two years, the volume of defaults, and the loss of the money they get from servicing loans that are getting forgiven.  Defaults are increasing.  The programs made it very easy to get loans so the universities raised tuition and fees almost 1000% over that period of time.  The whole system is well intentioned but very, very broken.  These companies are bailing out before they get dragged down by it.",

              "text": "Great answer.  I did a little more research and found this article:  [https://thecollegeinvestor.com/36556/how-much-do-federal-student-loan-servicers-make/](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/36556/how-much-do-federal-student-loan-servicers-make/)\n\nAccording to the article, student loan servicers are paid on a unit cost basis.  However, a while back they were paid on a percentage basis.  You'll notice in Table #1 that a loan in deferment only gets them paid $16.20/year instead of the standard $34.20/year when it's in repayment.  When you consider the large volume of loans they service, it makes sense that they're losing a significant amount of money due to the pandemic-related deferment.  Also, servicing defaulted loans pays less than loans in repayment or deferment.  Perhaps, too, the volume of loans will decrease dramatically if $50k of student debt is forgiven, lowering their income stream.\n\nTaking all this into account, plus the recent lawsuits, it's easier to see why they are not renewing their contracts.",
