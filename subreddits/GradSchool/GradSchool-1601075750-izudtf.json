  "text": "My paper got recently rejected from a top conference. The work I submitted is probably the best work I have done in my Ph.D. The good thing is I didn't feel a single emotion about rejection. Previously, I would literally go in depression mode and curse myself to oblivion for being useless. \n\nWell, when you know that you are almost done, and have a job lined up. You stop worrying about acceptances. \n\nThank you for listening my TED talk.",

So I had to learn and do everything on my own and that\u2019s y it took a lot of time from my daily schedule. I have this paper a higher priority than my studies as I think that I\u2019m learning more through research than normal school courses. And after months of work it gets rejected and my advisor didn\u2019t even call me to discuss or talk about it. He just texted me saying that I should find another conference to submit. I actually think that my research is novel and it would be a great addition to the field. The reviewer comments were also bs and it\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even read the paper. One of the reviewers said \u201cthis is an interesting paper for XYZ field\u201d and the retarded thing is that the paper IS for that XYZ field. ... idk how these reviewers are selected. I recently submitted a conference paper and it got accepted and the funny thing is that the journal paper is an extension of that conference  paper. This rejection really hit me hard as I was previously working on other papers and now I just don\u2019t feel like doing anything.",

I completely understand your frustration, ours got a reviewer who didn't seem to understand it at all (to be fair its a complicated subfield and can get very confusing very fast). \n\nIf it was a submission for a talk for a conference, don't feel bad at all! My PI also got rejected for a conference talk in the spring. Talks are so competitive, posters are less competitive but they may be more so now since everything is online. I was advised not to even submit a poster proposal to a conference for next month just because my advisor thinks I would get grilled way to hard about the intracacies of that field (which takes years to learn and there is definitely not time in undergrad to do that). \n\nIt is absolutely frustrating, but you should take that work ethic and put it into other things (if you're a senior, put it into the GRFP especially since you already have some feedback). Your work may not always be appreciated but it doesn't mean you should give up, everyone gets rejected sometimes for what feel like bogus reasons, even PIs who have been in the field for 30 years! \n\nStart reaching out to people who could be better mentors and try to find someone who is invested in you, there will be someone even if it feels like you're in free fall for awhile.",

                          "text": "I apologize if you aren't in the US, because I realized after I suggested that you might not be. The GRFP is a program from the national science foundation that provides a stipend of $34000/year for 3 years and up to $12000 tuition scholarship for exceptional graduate students in the united states. \nhttps://nsfgrfp.org/ <-- this should have all the information you need to apply if you're in the US. I suspect other countries have similar programs, but ysk this one is highly competitive with only 13% of applicants being awarded the fellowship. What it will essentially do is give you your own funding when applying to graduate school (if you email a potential PI and they're concerned about supporting you with a stipend, they don't need to worry if you get it). I would recommend applying for this the same year you apply for graduate school because you can't defer the funding and even though its due in October, they don't announce winners until April. Additionally, you can apply as many times as you want before entering a graduate program but once you are in a grad program you can only apply once, and it has to be before you've completed two years. \n\nI'm currently applying for it, but the expectations of a 2nd year grad student tend to be higher than for a senior undergraduate.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoezGhbtcpg3BvNdag2F5dTQM-Xl2EELUgAfG1eUg0s/edit#gid=0 <-- a compilation of proposals with information about what year they submitted and whether they were funded or not\n\nEDIT: No matter where you are, you should search for fellowship programs in your country/area and see if you fit the qualifications and put your energy into applying for those. You can do this!",

Yes, I will admit learning to emotionally detach from work helps sometimes with things such as procrastination or constructive criticism, but it is healthy and natural to experience negative emotions after a rejection. You lost an investment of time, effort and passion. That should make anyone upset! Learning how to do with emotions is important for all careers and life, but it's important that we feel them.\n\nAt first, I thought not having emotions was a good trait for researchers (i.e. trying to make research less biased etc.). Now I see that training researchers to be robots is unhealthy. I would also argue that apathy towards rejections like these is also a sign of depression. It was for me, and was one of the red flags that got me to see a psychologist.",

Gradually I've learned to detach my identity from my work productivity, and to see that sometimes rejections are about someone else's bad mood or bad fit with a journal/conference. Sometimes rejections are about legitimate weaknesses in the work, but I think (hope) we can learn to still learn to see those as critiques of our work and not US.\n\nAcademia IS hella traumatic tho, and publish-or-perish means rejections make me panic even if I don't take them personally.",
