  "text": "I struggled a lot during my bachelor's research, mainly because I was passionate about coding.\n\nI landed a full time SWE right after graduation and was doing very well. But after a year or two, I found none of companies in my country neither had the level of ambitious projects nor was able to go into the salary range I was looking for. I soon realize I need to get out of the country.\n\nI came to North America for M.Sc in CS and I am finding it very difficult to adjust. Is there anyone who were in my shoe and somehow survived? \n\nI badly need some advices as I am becoming very depressed day by day.",
