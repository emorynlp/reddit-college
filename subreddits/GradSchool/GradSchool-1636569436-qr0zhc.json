  "title:": "Applying to Masters in Computer Science while having deficiency in few courses",
  "text": " I am planning to do a major switch from physics to Computer science and thus applying for MCS at Arizona State University as an International student.\n\nI have 3+ years of work as a software developer.\n\nThe application form expects that I indicate whether I have done the following courses.\n\n1. Calculus\n2. Data structures and algorithms\n3. Compilers\n4. Operating systems\n5. Programming Languages\n\nOf these 5, I have only done the first 2 as part of my undergraduate degree in college.\n\nI do not have an official course in my degree certificate for the 3,4,and 5 above.\n\nWith this, is it worth applying for the MCS program for me if I am guaranteed to be rejected?\n\nOr is there a chance that University can allow me to complete the deficiency courses?",
