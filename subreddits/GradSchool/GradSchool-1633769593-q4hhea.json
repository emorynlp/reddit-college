  "text": "I first went to grad school back in 2015. I went overseas and found life pretty chill. No stress. Everyone was talking about a work life balance like it was a hard thing to achieve. I was able to have a romantic relationship, friends, gym time, and a part time job. No problem. Graduated with honors and dove head first into a PhD.\n\nFast forward to 2019 and even into 2020 and the present. I am still not stressed. I had 2 jobs, while taking classes. Now, I have 2 jobs, do my research, and my advisors, and still manage to watch a lot of Netflix. \n\nThe undergrads seem to struggle with it too. I never had that issue and I finished 4 years in 2. I was really nuts then, but my grades never really suffered. I tell them my experiences and they are shocked. One later told me he felt like he wasn't doing enough. I had to explain why I did what I did and that I actually don't recommend it. It worked for me, but just barely. \n\nI am not bragging, but confused. Everyone seems to be struggling and I am just like, meh. What am I missing? Is it because I am an older student? I have always been busy, even in high school. Is it that I am just more practiced? My adviser isn't worried, but the school's admin was freaking when I took on a second paying job. I actually have 2 more volunteer jobs that they don't know about. In fairness, the volunteer jobs never exceed 3 hours a week. The only thing I am missing is gym time. I blame my Netflix addiction.\n\nAll of this questioning has led to me waiting for the other shoe to drop. Did anyone else just not struggle with grad school? Am I the odd duck out? I am not in Harvard or MIT, but surely the school wouldn't make that much of a difference. My school is tough. As a science based school, our degrees are mostly labs. \n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "Do you have a structured time management, like daily to do list and stuff? If yes, then you're probably just really good at managing your time. If not then I think it's because you have your self-esteem in check (especially since you said you've been busy since high school). Most of us struggle not because we can't manage our time but due to crippling perfectionism, self-doubt and anxiety. \n\nAlso, idk about your sleep habit but if you can function well with little sleep then that's a bonus too.",
