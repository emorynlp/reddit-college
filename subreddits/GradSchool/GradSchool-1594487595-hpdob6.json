Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.\n\nThe Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.\n\nThe four steps are as follows:\n\n1. Write the concept down\n\n2. Explain it using simple language\n\n3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain\n\n4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further\n\nI have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I\u2019ve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE). I definitely recommend giving this a shot with something new that you are learning. As always, figure out what works best for you!", "author": "BladeV-Cash", "created": 1594487595, "retrieved": 1632953783, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 446, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fxsjlmu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hpdob6/the_feynman_technique_showed_me_how_to_learn/fxsjlmu/", "text": "So good science", "author": "cientificoenojado", "created": 1594523534, "upvotes": 1}, "fxs65kq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hpdob6/the_feynman_technique_showed_me_how_to_learn/fxs65kq/", "text": "That is what we did in seminary but the term Feynman technique was never used. \n\nWe were taught that if we could not explain something in simple terms in such a way a child could understand then that meant we didn\u2019t understand & learn the material ourselves. \n\nParroting information learned by rote is not the same as *explaining* information we *learned*.", "author": null, "created": 1594517569, "upvotes": 1}, "fxs5l67": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hpdob6/the_feynman_technique_showed_me_how_to_learn/fxs5l67/", "text": "Scott Young made a fantastic video on the \"Feynman technique\" a few years ago:\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNqSLPaZLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNqSLPaZLc)", "author": "tl_throw", "created": 1594517229, "upvotes": 2}, "fxrzpc2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hpdob6/the_feynman_technique_showed_me_how_to_learn/fxrzpc2/", "text": "I teach my classes along these same principles.
