  "title:": "The Feynman Technique showed me how to learn things more effectively and simplify them",
  "text": " I\u2019ve had a hard time learning new things. Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.\n\nThe Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.\n\nThe four steps are as follows:\n\n1. Write the concept down\n\n2. Explain it using simple language\n\n3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain\n\n4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further\n\nI have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I\u2019ve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE). I definitely recommend giving this a shot with something new that you are learning. As always, figure out what works best for you!",

When we write psych evaluations/reports intended for clients, we have to be able to explain all psych terms and evaluation results so an 8th grader would understand it. My professors are very big into the 'if you can't explain it to a middle schooler, you don't understand it' which has really changed the way I view the idea of 'expertise'.",
