  "title:": "::VENT:: Previous advisor and postdoc driving me crazy re: manuscripts",
  "text": "For context, I graduated last year from my MS and had what my advisor called publication ready chapters for my thesis. My ex advisor initially told me it was ready to submit, then randomly came back with edits like 6 months after no communication, and has continued to waffle between \"it's great, lets submit it\" and sudden new complaints since then. I have given them more than 20 drafts -after- they said it was ready to go, ranging from tiny nit-picky edits on wording they preferred to large rewrites of entire sections. \n\n Now his post doc, my coauthor, has come back with requests to completely retool every figure in the draft. This person has seen these figures hundreds of times and was part of the design process two years ago. Now they are requesting complete reworks after I have archived the scripts I used to make them and moved on to writing up a manuscript for the PhD I'm currently working on.\n\nI also don't agree with a lot of their suggestions, but I also don't want to be combative to my superiors. I want to just say fuck it at this point and pivot towards focusing on my current work, but I know that's unproductive. It's just frustrating that I have put so much effort into getting drafts turned around quickly and now they're coming in after flaking on me for so long and sending me little frustrating edits every couple weeks after they say it's good to go. \n\nI just want to be done with this, I no longer care about this work, and this process has become really demoralizing.",

      "text": "I think if you are first author, your voice counts for something because it's your thesis. If you are now in a PhD program and are not working with these people anymore, they are not your superiors, they're your coauthors, so I don't think it's necessary to be excessively deferential if their suggestions don't make sense. You can push back diplomatically. No manuscript is ever perfect, and your peer reviewers will also have suggestions to make once it's submitted. \n\nI'm not sure what the disciplinary norms are in your field, but in mine if a co-author wants to re-do figures there should be a good reason for it other than personal preference, especially when they are not first author. More senior researchers tend to have more experience, which is why their judgement is often deferred to, but if the figures convey your findings clearly and concisely then imo there should be a good reason for wanting to re-do them. If a journal you are targeting requires a specific format, color scheme, or whatever, that would be a good reason. If he just thinks it would look better, then I'd suggest that he take the lead on generating alternative figures and the three of you can make a decision on which is better. If he's a co-author, he should also be doing some work on it too rather than just suggesting more work for you to do. \n\nIf you're still looking to publish this, the next time your former adviser considers the draft submission worthy, send them an email confirming that and just submit it. If either of them come back with edits two weeks later, oh well.",
