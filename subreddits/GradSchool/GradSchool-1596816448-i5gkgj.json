I moved far from home/family to pursue a PhD last year and I was living alone. I\u2019m in my late 20s, fairly introverted, and I thought I could benefit from my own space to breathe at this point in my life. Grad school turned out to be waaaay more isolating than I had anticipated, and in hindsight I spent much of my first year with my head barely above water emotionally. I had few, consistent social contacts and constantly felt a low-grade loneliness that, under times of stress, went downhill into full blown existential crisis. I was completely alone for 9 weeks at the tail end of my semester, and my mental health was decimated by it. I intended to stay on campus and work in the summer, but I was laid off and so able to travel home to stay with my family. My parents loved me and took care of me at my lowest. I re-evaluated my life and made vital changes to my living situation. I made renewed commitments to my physical and mental health. I leaned on people and disclosed my feelings to my stunningly supportive supervisor. I sought help, had a moment to connect with myself again, and spent time outside and in nature with my beautiful pets. Being totally rocked by COVID mentally and emotionally was not cool by any means, but it was the circumstances I need to take a hard look at the way I was living and decide that things had to change.
