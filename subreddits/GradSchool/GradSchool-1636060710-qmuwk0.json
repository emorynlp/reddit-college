  "text": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if any of you may be able to share some advice on my current situation. Thank you for any and all help!\n\nI have completed 1 year of my PhD in math at IU. However, I am currently on a leave of absence because my mother passed away right before the semester. During this time I have moved back home/UMich where I did undergrad, as my fiancee is in her first year of medical school there. Further, my family lives about 45 minutes from here.\n\nWith the death of my mom, I don't really want to be in another state away from my support system just so I can study math. Further, with the two-body problem I am in, I don't want to live apart from my soon-to-be wife. IU isn't personally feasible at the moment, but I don't want to let that stop me from studying mathematics. Because of this, I am hoping that I may be able to transfer to UMich for a math PhD, or potentially a CS PhD (while not a direct continuation of what I've been doing, there are some really interesting things in the CS dept that my math background has me prepared for).\n\nI think this is somewhat reasonable, insofar as its worth it to send in an application. UMich has a more competitive dept, so I think that will hurt my application but it is worth a shot. My preference is largely math, but the CS PhD is technically a separate app., so I hope that increases my chances of being able to continue into a research career. The two subjects are closely enough related that this tradeoff between topics is minor.\n\nIn terms of my app, I had a 3.65 in undergrad and currently have a 4.0 in grad school. Professionally, things have gone great at IU and I even have a couple semesters of teaching experience now.  I have 3 (potentially 4) letters of rec from my first year of grad school, and 1 from undergrad at UMich. even though I am technically coming from a lower ranked dept, I think this is my best shot to showcase to UMich that I am qualified. \n\nIf the application does not work out, I am likely to get a software engineering job for the time being and hope to return to academia at some point in the future when it aligns more with my personal life. Although, I recognize that gets more infeasible the longer I wait.\n\nMy questions are the following:\n\n1. Do you think this is a realistic goal?\n2. How may I best structure my statement of purpose and personal statement to highlight what I've achieved in grad school, along with showing that my reasons for wanting to leave IU are entirely personal?\n\nIf you have any other words of advice, I'd love to hear it. \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "I can\u2019t speak to how either departments will handle this, but make a personal contact with someone in your prospective departments at UMich and discuss which program would accept/fund you first. I think you should be honest in your personal statement, but don\u2019t overload too much on the details. Explain the situation and then make sure you mostly talk about your qualities and qualifications that would make you a great part of the team. Good luck!",
