With COVID, imposter syndrome, and my minimal research experience, this year has been a confusing mess with little opportunity to learn/build up my skills. I was brought into a lab on a research assistanceship to complete a funded grant. My advisors stress learning through trial and error, but in practicality they have provided little room for failure/growth and expect a lot of independent progress with little guidance. With how much time had passed, I felt like I could never speak up and ask for help. The times I had, my advisors told me to \"be more independent\" and to figure it out on my own. \n\nThroughout this year, the post-doc in my lab has been a saving grace. He runs the show and has been extremely supportive and open to teaching me even the most \"basic\" concepts. He was extremely gracious and has taken it upon himself to now have weekly/daily meetings with me to 1) acually go through what we are doing and 2) plan out what I'm supposed to be doing. He even revealed the same happened to him when he was a first-year PhD and that I will have to carry on the tradition. \n\nPart of me is relieved and part of me is completely ashamed. Like I could finally admit that I needed some serious help, but it has taken almost a year to get to that point. I feel as though I have let myself and the project down by just being so lost and unsure - almost like this year has been a complete waste. I have spent so much time wanting to drop out, too. Plus, it is so embarrassing for someone to see right through you.\n\n I'm trying to see the positives of the situation - I'm finally getting the help I need and I will hopefully feel less miserable. Failure is part of learning, and maybe now I can start moving forward. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Or any advice about how to handle these feelings?", "author": "_mockingjay_", "created": 1622668667, "retrieved": 1632845266, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 626, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h0jmk8b": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nqwmir/cried_in_front_of_my_postdoc/h0jmk8b/", "text": "Aw *hugs*", "author": "ThatCarpetTowel05", "created": 1622795408, "upvotes": 1}, "h0ixz1d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nqwmir/cried_in_front_of_my_postdoc/h0ixz1d/", "text": "You\u2019re so lucky that you\u2019re able to find someone that is willing to help you!  \n\nI wish I had this tbh - right now it\u2019s just me , my PI and my lab mate.

The vast majority of first-year graduate students do not know what they are doing in the laboratory, and your advisors' responses to your mistakes are completely unreasonable.

As an undergraduate, I worked under an advisor that really made me question my ability to do research. He liked shouting at his students, too.
