  "text": "Im trying to get my boyfriend a Christmas present, but he doesn\u2019t know what he wants. He would prefer something that would be useful for him during grad school, but we don\u2019t have many ideas. What do you guys think would be a great gift? (Price limit ~ $250)\n\nIf context is needed, he is in a STEM PhD program (engineering) and in his second year. Most of his work is wet lab stuff.",

Or even a card for the campus bookstore or coffee/food places on campus, especially if his wet lab experiments have a weird schedule sometimes. On the subject of edible stuff, I also like relaxing drink supplies like chai mix, hot chocolate packets, or tea/coffee supplies if that\u2019s his thing \ud83d\ude0a If gift cards feel too impersonal, maybe adding in some things for his office desk or WFH space? Some people in my lab have framed pictures with their partners (okay, maybe this one would be more appropriate for an anniversary gift) or different fun office supplies (fun pens for lab notebooks, aesthetically pleasing magazine holders or bookends for holding books and papers, cool mugs for pens and markers, a nice paper planner or desk calendar, real or fake plants) Does he have a lunchbag and backpack that he likes? Does he have everything he needs to be comfortable commuting into the lab in your climate (nice coat or raincoat or other layers, nice hat/gloves/scarf, or nice desk fan for warmer places). Does he TA or go to conferences and want nicer clothing pieces to dress up for that?",

A bud doesn\u2019t talk to his family much and his dad sends him a case of his favorite hot sauce from home for his birthday, and puts a note on each one. My bud just asked for a bottle, and his dad turned it up to 11. Seriously changed their family dynamic after a big fight over some pricey gifts that just added stress.",
