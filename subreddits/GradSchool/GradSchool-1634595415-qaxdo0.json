  "text": "Im a junior in undergrad and planning to apply to ML phd program. This semester idk if i should take a math class pass/fail instead of letter grade.\n\nPros for pass/fail:\n\n1. I got a more chill workload and can have more time work on my research. \n\n2. Lowkey struggling in the class and probably gonna end up bring my GPA down, or i have to work extra hard to save my grade. But if i take it pass/fail, it won\u2019t affect my GPA.\n\n3. It\u2019s not required for me.\n\nCons:\n\n1. It\u2019s a challenging class, theoretical linear algebra. So im thinking it looks good on the transcript?\n\n2. It\u2019s also related to ML, so idk if taking it pass/fail would raise some eyebrows.\n\n(Though I took the easier application linear algebra before (letter graded) and did pretty well in that.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general, is it a bad thing to have pass/fail graded on your transcript?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice? Thanks!",

      "text": "P/F is fine as long as you don't do more than 1 or 2 classes. But since this is linear algebra, a CORE subject for ML, I recommend you don't take it P/F. This is the class you want to work extra hard in. P/F some less important class.",
