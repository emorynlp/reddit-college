  "text": "Hi all, \n\nCurrently I\u2019m looking at masters programs in my area and there are a couple but I wanted to know how feasible it is to commute to another city? There are programs about 1.5 hours away from where I live that are a lot better.\n\nHow far have you commuted for classes? How do-able was it? Any tips or recs? \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "I honestly think this is do-able if you make a point to take all your classes say, 2 or 3 days a week, then schedule all your meetings during those days. Those days will be crazy, but you can really reduce your commute time. \n\nIf you are doing research, try to take computational approaches you can do from home (if feasible). I think you can make it work, especially if the programs are better. 1.5 hours is not horrible.",

          "text": "This is helpful. I\u2019m applying for three PhD programs that are all out of city but I\u2019d relocate for. And 4 masters programs that I wouldn\u2019t relocate for. I don\u2019t mind the commute, and most of my research interests are within the realms of tech, games, and AI. So I\u2019d assume there is a fair amount of wiggle room for online research and collaboration. I don\u2019t mind the drive either. Especially if it\u2019s 2-3 days a week. Thank you for your insight!",

The drive is fine with some good music and podcasts and it\u2019s a good time to think. However, I do get really tired on my drive home from school. I am also worried about the winter months coming up. It\u2019s also can be expensive, I fill up my tank twice a week. Thankfully I have my mom helping me with gas money though. I hope you find the right program that works best for you!",
