I got here and immediately face-planted when I realized I didn't connect with my advisor and I just.... sucked at all of my relationships, new and pre-existing. \n\nI have to have some stuff prepped for next Monday when an old student of my advisors is going to come and teach me to do this thing, but I can't get one important element to work. I feel like a failure. \n\nI wish I never came to grad school sometimes. I wish I never quit the arts 6 years ago and decided to enter the sciences. I feel farther from my goals, what even were they...? I just wish someone would fire me sometimes because man I really suck at this and everything just keeps falling apart.", "author": "TypeOfPlant", "created": 1630618958, "retrieved": 1632845086, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "comments": {"hbhwjhw": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgrctj/days_like_these_make_me_really_want_to_quit/hbhwjhw/", "text": "It's the Friday fuck-its!

If grad school was easy everyone would do it.  But it sucks.\n\nFriendships and relationships have been born and buried by grad school.
