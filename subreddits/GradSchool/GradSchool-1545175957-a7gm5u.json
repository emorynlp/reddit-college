Got through my masters (in physics) last semester and realized that I no longer cared enough about research to continue on with a PhD that wouldnt serve my career goals. Additionally,  grad school was taking a heavy toll on my mental health and it was better for me to walk away. \n\nSo instead of continuing on hating everything I had a discussion with my advisor that I was going to work for one more semester to wrap up my current work and find a job. Luckily I was able to find a job as an engineer and will be starting that job in January! So for the next month I will be working on moving, and exploring my new home, and just generally enjoying life.\n\nRemember, you are never trapped in grad school, you can always walk away. Every single interview proved to me that you dont need a PhD to succeed and can have a fulfilling successful life without one. So if you dont absolutely feel you need a PhD, I strongly recommend taking a hard look at why youre in graduate school.\n\nGood luck to all of you, and happy holidays", "author": "UnfairResearcher", "created": 1545175957, "retrieved": 1632953363, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 526, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"eco8s7p": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/a7gm5u/today_was_my_last_day_i_have_successfully_dropped/eco8s7p/", "text": "Congratulations dude!
