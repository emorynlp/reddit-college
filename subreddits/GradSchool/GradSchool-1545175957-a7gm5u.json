  "title:": "Today was my last day, I have successfully dropped out of grad school",
  "text": "Its been a long time coming but I'm finally free. Got through my masters (in physics) last semester and realized that I no longer cared enough about research to continue on with a PhD that wouldnt serve my career goals. Additionally,  grad school was taking a heavy toll on my mental health and it was better for me to walk away. \n\nSo instead of continuing on hating everything I had a discussion with my advisor that I was going to work for one more semester to wrap up my current work and find a job. Luckily I was able to find a job as an engineer and will be starting that job in January! So for the next month I will be working on moving, and exploring my new home, and just generally enjoying life.\n\nRemember, you are never trapped in grad school, you can always walk away. Every single interview proved to me that you dont need a PhD to succeed and can have a fulfilling successful life without one. So if you dont absolutely feel you need a PhD, I strongly recommend taking a hard look at why youre in graduate school.\n\nGood luck to all of you, and happy holidays",

I have good career prospects (which luckily paid off). I dont need a PhD to advance my own career goals since I dont want to be a professor.\"\n\nIn the end, I knew emotionally I had to leave almost immediately after I began thinking about it but made sure to do my due diligence to confirm I would be okay and that it was what I really wanted.",

I found that I didnt actually care about the research any longer, only a dozen or so people would read the papers I contributed to and it wouldnt make much of a difference. Additionally, the effect on my mental health was becoming noticeable where I couldnt gather the energy to do things I enjoyed outside of work. I was effectively a zombie\n\nIn the end, I just didnt care about grad school and could manage to care about it. And I will say, going to the my university's psychiatric services was extremely helpful.\n\nLet me know if you have other questions!",

You're right, grad school isn't everything.\n\nI'm in the field of geology, and for our discipline, it seems like having a PhD could make you less hirable (over-qualified) in the industry. As geologists, we often work with engineers, and it seems like prospects in the industry with a PhD are sometimes similar. I think you made a good move of staying with your masters and going into the industry with it.\n\nGood luck with moving forward, with your new job, and home.\n\nEnjoy the holidays to the fullest now :)\n\n&#x200B;",
