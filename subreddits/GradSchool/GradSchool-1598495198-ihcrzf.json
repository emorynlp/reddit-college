  "text": "Just want to be a grumpy little goblin. Please feel free to share your grumpiness as well. \nOnline classes fucking suck. They just do, and everyone knows they do. I am incredibly relieved that I'm able to take online class, and I'm not forced to risk my health to go to class. Still. Staring at zoom for ten hours a day is awful. Fighting with technology every day is awful.\nAnd worst of all is professors trying to make the best of it. I know they are just trying to teach effectively and make this 1% less miserable. In theory, I really respect and appreciate that. But fuck I hate online teaching pedagogy!!! \nNo, I don't want to work in small groups once a week. I don't want to do more discussion board posts. I certainly don't want to comment on all my peer's posts. These activities don't actually build community. They don't actually prevent zoom fatigue. I miss last semester when everyone just leaned into how much everything sucked. Now everything sucks and I have three times the busy work in an attempt to somehow make me feel better. \nI can't imagine doing this for the rest of the semester, let alone potentially doing it in the spring. \nI love my work, and I love my research, but goddamn this is miserable.",

I am low income, live in a studio apartment, and the only place I have to work is my bed because I don't have other furniture. I don't feel comfortable sharing my screen in synchronous lectures for that reason.\n\nIt's also really annoying because so many people have different audio qualities, and the constant feedback, background noise and changes in volume give me a headache and make it hard to concentrate. I will frequently mute my computer when other people talk for this reason. \n\nI have a lot of sympathy for faculty who are scrambling to throw together courses last minute because of administrative tomfoolery, or who may be a bit older and unfamiliar with technology. Online education isn't a simple translation of in-person class to digital format. It's a whole different experience and skillset, and I don't think administration understands that.",

I\u2019m a first year who took \u201ctime off\u201d and so, in addition to feeling a little out of practice and learning how to grad student, I have to deal with online classes and the world feeling like it\u2019s ending. I like to think maybe I\u2019d feel less bitter if it wasn\u2019t my first year back in the field. \n\nI can\u2019t keep up with notes because professors have everything pre-written and speed through the material because they don\u2019t have to write it down. Notes help me stay engaged and process, but I can\u2019t do that now unless I take 4 hours to rewatch lectures. There\u2019s a lag with the audio and the document camera (which also stutters!) so my professor\u2019s pointing to \u201cthis, that, and this\u201d is impossible to follow. I\u2019m struggling to focus in class because they are back-to-back for 4.5 hours on top of the speeding through it. Sometimes my internet is shit so I miss things. \n\nI\u2019m glad I can take them online. I like not commuting, dressing more comfortably, and being able to get a snack whenever. There\u2019s a sense of \u201cshit is crazy and we\u2019re all in this together\u201d in my cohort which is comforting. I like having recorded lectures. \n\nThat felt nice to get off my chest.

There is so much forced group work in one of my courses, and we get no say in who we work with.\n\nFor me the thing that sucks is how little some of my professors are willing to take feedback. I think everyone hates the format of one of my classes, and it's my teachers first time trying any online teaching so all of these techniques are new to him too, but every time we express concern he just stresses that this is new to all of us and it will get better as we get used to being online. The issue here isn't that we're online, its the methods he's specifically using. I feel like I'm learning nothing in class and doing all of the heavy lifting outside, which would be fine if class wasn't so frustrating that I want to pull my hair out. I LOVE the material its on but dread going to class. Which is obviously a terrible sign.",

      "text": "I am in a field where being in-person is particularly important in order to best practice our developing skill set ((counseling)), and so I tend to agree that online classes are far from ideal. I often find myself zoning out, doing other things on the computer like typing emails or finishing tasks for my internship, when I know I wouldn't be doing those things if I were in-person. I really hate the awkwardness of discussions on Zoom (\"I was think-\"  \"In my opinion-\"  \"Ooops, sorry, go ahead!\") and have noticed that I'm always anxious for class to be over and I get impatient towards the end. It's just draining.\n\nThat said, I *do* appreciate the fact that I don't have to commute to campus this term. My program is 'cameras on at all times' so I don't lounge in bed during class, but it's nice to wear yoga pants and hop on one minute before the course starts, rather than having to leave my apartment an hour early and fight the crowds via public transportation. I suspect I will be especially thankful for this once the colder, snowier months hit.",

However, this online format has been anything but convenient for me. \n\nHow do you deal with eye strains from staring a computer screen for hours at a time to attend your classes, attend the class that you are a TA for, attend your own TA classes for your students, attend mandatory meetings that happen throughout the week, read all your material online, write your papers, and do everything else like emails grading and stuff?\n\nIt's a genuine question--I hope it didn't come off as calling you out or anything bc I understand the online format is actually very conveniemt in many ways. I think the problem is partially bc we are moving from an originally in-persom format to a virtual format, and the school is trying to maintain a cultural norm by making everything feel as IP as possible. But that makes everything extremely stressful because to make it feel as IP as possible, we are being asked to do extra work. I feel that it's having major backlash, especially in my particular case. \n\nI've never been glued to my laptop/phone an a day to day basis so I only use them when necessary or on the breeze so this is all very new--and painful--for me, especially when it's every day, 5 days a week.

      "text": "I think the major problem is that a lot of faculty try to recreate the traditional face-to-face experience rather than accepting that online education is an alternate modality and should be treated as such. \n\nI'm a professor now. I'm trying to draw inspiration from YouTubers and streamers and imagine myself as a content creator more than anything else these days. I loathe discussion board posts, Zoom breakout groups seem like digital prison, I don't understand why everyone wants to meet synchronously exactly the same number of times per week as an IRL course. It's like putting old wine in new bottles, rather than creating something new. \n\nHere's a sample of what I'm trying to create. Not perfect, but I feel like I'm going in a more productive direction that starring into the abyss of Zoom.\n\n[https://youtu.be/u6R5W4lixpQ](https://youtu.be/u6R5W4lixpQ)",

In my personal experience, focusing on the things I ~can~ control and the benefits of staying home helps me temper the creeping depression. For example, I enjoy that I can get a LOT more research and self-care done in the day because I don\u2019t have to commute, plan my lunches (& dinners, lol) at the office, or have awkward gaps between classes. I\u2019m also really enjoying the reprieve from the insanely annoying drama and gossip that goes on in my department. At least 50% of students in my program occupy their offices on any given day for hours at a time, and end up distracting each other with banal gossip, and it drives me fucking nuts because we all share offices, so it\u2019s hardly ever a quiet environment and I really don\u2019t care to know what is going on in their personal lives. So yea, happy about not having to deal with them. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t also really sad about the isolation, and that I\u2019m literally counting the weeks until we do get to potentially go back. Especially not happy about being a TA, where I\u2019m lucky if a quarter of my students show up to section. \n\nAll in all though, this is a temporary situation, and while it\u2019s a totally valid response to be upset about having to do this, I do also think that focusing on elements you can control that make you feel better, and trying to emphasize positive thoughts for the sake of your mental health, will be beneficial (sorry for my unsolicited advice \ud83d\ude05)",
