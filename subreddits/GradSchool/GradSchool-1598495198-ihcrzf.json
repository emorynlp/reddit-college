Fighting with technology every day is awful.\nAnd worst of all is professors trying to make the best of it. I know they are just trying to teach effectively and make this 1% less miserable.

I certainly don't want to comment on all my peer's posts. These activities don't actually build community. They don't actually prevent zoom fatigue. I miss last semester when everyone just leaned into how much everything sucked. Now everything sucks and I have three times the busy work in an attempt to somehow make me feel better. \nI can't imagine doing this for the rest of the semester, let alone potentially doing it in the spring. \nI love my work, and I love my research, but goddamn this is miserable.", "author": null, "created": 1598495198, "retrieved": 1632845388, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 495, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gfxiz9x": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ihcrzf/online_classes_suck/gfxiz9x/", "text": "I feel like I don't learn as much with online classes.
