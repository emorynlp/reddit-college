  "title:": "Master thesis defense with a committee that hates my life",
  "text": "Hi, I am doing my masters in a european country. The defense committee are 5 people including my supervisor who I did not go along with. He literally told me they will do their best to make me look like I don't know anything. My topic is related to computational fluid dynamics which covers thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics and numerics. I am trying my best to revise the basics. However, I feel like I may end up forgetting some fundamental law. I am scared to death I worked hard for this thesis.\n\nAny tips?",

And unfortunately all too common in academia. \n\nUnfortunately, there's not much to say other than study hard and do your best. If you don't know an answer, just say, \"I am not completely confident in the answer to that question, but here's what I would assume...\"",

At a defense, the committee is supposed to test you and push you to the edge of your knowledge. That doesn't have to be a negative, adversarial process - it's expected that you'll get to a point where you don't know things, and they want to see how you approach not only what you already know, but how you would figure out the answer to something you don't know yet.",

              "text": "Yeah, this thought crossed my mind, but considering OP phrased his post's title as, \"... committee that hates my life\" as well as mentioning, \"The defense committee are 5 people including my supervisor who I did not go along with\" I assumed that there was more to the story than a committee trying to push a trainee's boundaries.\n\nWho knows why OP has such a bad relationship with 5 faculty members. Maybe it's OP's fault, maybe it's not, but either way it's pretty obscene that people's personal opinions can have such a huge effect on their graduation.",
