  "title:": "Advice for maintaining a healthy relationship with SO during PhD (USA)",
  "text": "I'm currently wrapping up my MS and am going to be applying to PhD's this coming cycle. For people who are/were in PhD's while also in a healthy relationship with your SO, how did it affect your relationship? What obstacles did you face? Do you have any advice for someone who wants to go down this path while still respecting and prioritizing the needs of my partner? \n\nFor reference, my partner and I are fully committed to relocating together if I get accepted and they will have good job prospects in any location after they get a state license for their practice.",

If those things do not benefit you, seriously consider declining. Maybe that will upset them, but you are not responsible for other's feelings.",

      "text": "It has up's and down's.  Time that should be spent with them, gets spent on research sometimes.  But I think it's that much more difficult if you maintain clear boundaries on your work and home life.  Try to treat it as a job, keeping nights and weekends free if you can.  Appreciate, and vocalize it, things that they do for you and try to still do things for them.  Primarily, I think that you don't let grad school be too much of an excuse to not do things.  I see examples on here of people saying, I don't cook or clean because theres no time.  That's excuses and bullshit for their partner.",
