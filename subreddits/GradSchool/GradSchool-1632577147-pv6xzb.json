Any advice?", "text": "Some backstory: I'm 36, and I've not done any school since finishing my BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2007, a program from which I graduated with a 3.7 GPA (and I would not say it was an easy program at all; it was definitely a challenge). I am now just 3 weeks in on a Masters Program in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota.\n\nYesterday we had a short quiz in my Theory of Statistics class and I only got 1 of 3 questions right (I simply fumbled on the math on the second, but I genuinely could not solve the third). These quizzes are only 5% of our grade, and the lowest score is dropped, so it's very likely that if I improve, this quiz will have 0 impact on my grade.\n\nWhy I'm suddenly freaking out: I actually studied pretty thoroughly for this quiz, despite it not even being a big deal, and yet this still happened to me. So this has now unlocked a number of fears that I've been trying to ignore / hold back:\n\n- I'm too old for this / I lost my mojo / I can no longer handle the rigors of academia \n- Even if it wasn't about age, I have finally met my match, a level of difficulty beyond what I'm capable of\n- More specifically, if I can't handle a short quiz, I definitely can't handle a full length exam\n\nI looked up my professor also on ratemyprofessor.com, as well as anything anyone said about him here on reddit, and I kinda confirmed what I felt about him when I saw others say what I felt: that he can explain the basics but doesn't equip you to handle more complex calculations at all, not with his lecturing or his homework, and his testing expects you to be able to handle complex stuff. This both helps and doesn't help, like it helps to know I'm not alone in my feelings and that my struggles may not be my fault, but still I'm going to be expected to pass this course anyway, despite these problems.\n\nI have two other classes and I *love* them both and am, more importantly, doing well in them. Plus neither has a timed exam, a tremendous relief for me. My point being, grad school as a whole is not the problem, it is simply this one class. \n\nI don't recall test anxiety being a problem during undergrad, but 15 years later, a lot of my mental resolve has been weakened by a lot of struggles throughout my adult life. I panicked during my quiz, for sure. So this seems to be a new problem I never had before.\n\nI just feel really demoralized by this all, and the worst part is that I not only have to keep going, I likely have to go even harder, now that I've discovered that what I was doing wasn't enough. But then also, I'm not sure what else I CAN do... I read the book, did review problems I could check in the back of the book, took good notes and understood everything I was taught, did my homework obviously, but I somehow just couldn't synthesize it all in the complex way I was required to when this quiz came along. And how do I fix that? I don't know the answer, and that terrifies me.\n\nI can't seem to shake this. I went to a baseball game with my friends last night and I just felt like shit all night. Even after sleeping like a rock, I wake up now and still feel as dreadful as I did the moment I found out I bombed that quiz. I don't really know what to do now.\n\nHelp!", "author": "IYELLALLTHETIME", "created": 1632577147, "retrieved": 1632952036, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"heaij1t": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pv6xzb/failed_a_quiz_now_having_a_bit_of_a_mental/heaij1t/", "text": "Talk with your prof or a TA.

Sure, study groups helped, but they were not essential.\n\nThat changed in grad school.
