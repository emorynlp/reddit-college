To make things worse, I was supposed to defend in May and there are still so many things that I have to finish before defending. I already reached out to my advisor to ask him if I could defend in the summer, which he agreed to, but now I'm beginning to panic because of my daily unwillingness to even look at my work. I was also working on a fellowship proposal for a postdoc, but I can't even bring myself to work on that as well. If there's going to be an economic depression, I don't even know why I'm trying to secure a research position when I should just find any job that can support me.\n\nI feel like I spent so much time not living and enjoying the world, and I can't imagine myself continuing down this path forever now. I just want to find a job where I can stay close to my family and see their happy faces when all of this is over.\n\nI don't even know what the point of this post is.  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for sharing their optimism and commiserating with me. I realized after typing this all out that I've been letting myself fall in a depressive state and just reading coronavirus subreddits all day (not healthy...). Trying to remind myself that my research is relevant to the current and post-corona world, even if I can't see it now, and I also installed a website tracker to limit my reddit time to 15 minutes a day. Barely went on reddit yesterday, just read a few updates on the current situation somewhere else, and I actually felt like reading some papers. Good luck to you all and stay safe.", "author": "saltedcheesetea", "created": 1584900283, "retrieved": 1632953877, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 384, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fl9lbzr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fn3zoj/struggling_to_see_the_point_of_my_research/fl9lbzr/", "text": "I dont understand that bit about the post-doc.
