Don't be afraid to just reach out and ask people what they like to do and that y'all should meet up for coffee/drinks or study together! I've got faith in you! Good luck this semester :)",

      "text": "I settled in fairly quickly, but it was difficult because my boyfriend was about 3 hours away.  We saw each other about once a month.  (This was many years ago). I probably moved into my place a few weeks before the start of school and reconnected with a couple folks I already knew because we went to the same undergrad. \n\nOur graduate group had several orientation-type activities - a party, barbecue, and weekend getaway. All of these things were very helpful. If you don\u2019t have any activities like that, maybe reach out to the other new students in your department and suggest a casual get together?  \n\nRegarding your spouse- definitely schedule daily FaceTime and start planning for visits a month in advance so you have that to look forward to. \n\nMaybe consider traveling home by train so you can do work while traveling and then maybe you can justify more visits. Also, of course, take advantage of being able to work remotely so you can spend more time at home with family. Possibly arrange your class schedule so you can have longer weekends to spend at home (cram all of your classes into the middle of the week). Good luck- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better when you get busy with classes!",

I'd say it took me about a semester to start finding my groove, but what helped me immensely was finding my own favorite places around town to study and unwind. I know a pandemic must make that harder, but cafes, bars, parks, events, and eventually people who I saw regularly at these places made it all feel like home (moreso than the place I moved from). An extended solo trip is a good way to think about it - you're on a very educational and sometimes very stressful holiday haha\nWe also took that opportunity to sort of re-date each other. Real-life mailed letters, late night texts about thier thoughts, etc. Helped us get to know each other as we grew separately and helped us feel connected. That time was excellent for our future (now, post-school) relationship tbh. \n\nMy advice for the next few weeks is to go explore and decide where you want to take your spouse when they visit or find your own special place that you declare a no-stress zone for future use. \n\nIt sucks sometimes, but it doesn't have to all the time.",
