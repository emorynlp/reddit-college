Don't be afraid to just reach out and ask people what they like to do and that y'all should meet up for coffee/drinks or study together! I've got faith in you!

We saw each other about once a month.  (This was many years ago). I probably moved into my place a few weeks before the start of school and reconnected with a couple folks I already knew because we went to the same undergrad. \n\nOur graduate group had several orientation-type activities - a party, barbecue, and weekend getaway. All of these things were very helpful. If you don\u2019t have any activities like that, maybe reach out to the other new students in your department and suggest a casual get together?  \n\nRegarding your spouse- definitely schedule daily FaceTime and start planning for visits a month in advance so you have that to look forward to. \n\nMaybe consider traveling home by train so you can do work while traveling and then maybe you can justify more visits. Also, of course, take advantage of being able to work remotely so you can spend more time at home with family. Possibly arrange your class schedule so you can have longer weekends to spend at home (cram all of your classes into the middle of the week).
