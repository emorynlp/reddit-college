  "text": "Hi. I graduated from a British university with a BA in Literature. I'd like to pursue a master's degree in the field of Media Studies in the Netherlands. Even though I've researched the universities I'm interested in and their curricula, I haven't been able to find information about the experience itself. Has anyone with an undergraduate degree in the humanities done a master's in the Netherlands? I'm not sure quite what to expect in terms of adjusting to a different educational system. The only thing I've been able to find is that most of the degrees in question include courses in social scientific research methods, which is a field I have no knowledge in. Fortunately, most universities I've looked at offer either an intensive course in the subject or a pre-master.",

Not that you'd be guaranteed an answer there of course, but I think your chances are better than here.\n\n>I'm not sure quite what to expect in terms of adjusting to a different educational system. \n\nIt is difficult to answer this question without knowing exactly what you are referring to. There are similarities and differences between any educational systems. Are there any specific differences you are worried about?",

I came here because it's the only other sub I could find. \n I was just wondering if people find it easy to djust to master's degree in a Dutch university. Perhaps also if having very limited knowledge of Media Studies can be a hindrance, if you get admitted. But that's very specific.",
