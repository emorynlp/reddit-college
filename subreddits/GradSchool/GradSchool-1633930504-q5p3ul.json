  "title:": "Dropping out of grad school (first semester)",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have been extremely unhappy with my grad program that I started late August. This is my first semester, but I have a strong sense that I do not want to be here and I am wholly unmotivated to continue completing my work. I\u2019ve talked to my parents, and they\u2019d support me dropping out to instead pursue getting a job. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if dropping out looks exceptionally bad? It\u2019s not because the classes are hard. I know that I 100% could get fine grades in the classes if I tried at them. I just want to be out of school for the first time in 16 years, go and do something else for a while. If i feel the need to come back and get a Masters, then I\u2019d do that. However, it\u2019s not what I want to do right now.",

I think if you're really sure about it, it's better to just leave instead of torturing yourself by staying!",

You've already paid your tuition.\n\nThen you'll always have those credits should you change your mind later. And you'll be able to tell employers that you completed the semester, and then decided you would rather go to work.\n\nPlus, you can take advantage of your institutions career center to start applying for jobs for January.\n\nSo treat the rest of the semester like a job that you need to finish before you take your next one.",

          "text": "It\u2019s a valid question, and one i\u2019m probably going to have to answer a few times while withdrawing\u2026\n\nSince spring semester, junior year of college, it was a one track mind. I sat down with my advisor, he instantly suggested grad school and that I do an honors project with him. I never even questioned it. It\u2019s a STEM field. of course i\u2019ll go get a masters to give myself better opportunities. My brother is in med school and both my parents went to grad school, so it was a no brainer. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until i got here that I really understood how much i didn\u2019t want this. I want a job, sure. But i need a break from school at least. i didn\u2019t understand this so absolutely in college, and i don\u2019t think i really could\u2019ve. This is the first time i really feel like i\u2019m diverging from a pre set track, as cliche as that sounds. I think i needed to experience this first to get to my decision. I just feel bad about having possibly taken a spot from someone who would\u2019ve presumably been more dedicated, and letting down people who gave me this opportunity\u2026 But at this point, it\u2019s too late. And of course I can\u2019t stay in grad school due to that guilt.",
