      "text": "No one can say for sure.  Your GRE is slightly above average and your GPA is above 3.0 (if I got the conversion to a 4.0 correct) with some research experience. \n\nAre you doing a thesis masters or coursework? If it's research based then have to contacted any professors at these institutions? That can go a long way in making sure that you are accepted.",
