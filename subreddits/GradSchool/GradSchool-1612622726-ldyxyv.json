It can be stressful but it also makes it so much better to understand each other's stress because we are both in the same boat. Setting time where you both study together is a great way to spend time but get work done. Pre pandemic we would go to a tea house and do our homework together, when the weather was nice we'd have a homework picnic. You can still spend quality time together even if you both are reading different books for class. It also helps because we proof read each other's work and it's a mutual helping. If you can, getting classes on the same days helps alot to maximize time outside of class and work together. My husband and i go to different schools but this helps alot with not feeling like we're missing out on too much time together.

The stressful part was that he left for his internship about a year after we started dating, thus a three year long distance (3 hrs, so not bad) relationship.

In my case, the relationship was not solid. It never was. It was emotionally abusive but I went years without being able to recognize it, being so young (19yo) when I got into the relationship. Entering grad school and being surrounded by mostly respectful peers who valued my thoughts and feelings was actually very helpful as I learned how to raise standards for myself.

We have been together for about 5 years and if anything it has made our relationship stronger. We moved across the country for my grad program (his is online with an in person internship that can be completed anywhere) so that was added stress but it has been great! We understand eachother in a way we never have before. We also are good at keeping eachother on task during the day. My advice is just be honest about your feelings and communicate as much as possible! Grad school brings insane amounts of stress and can be so isolating so you will be thankful you have someone so close that understands.", "author": "spicybigred", "created": 1612628426, "upvotes": 2}, "gm8pnqq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ldyxyv/my_bf_and_i_are_going_to_be_in_grad_school_at_the/gm8pnqq/", "text": "I'm in my second master's program and my wife is in a PhD program while both of us work full time as high school teachers. We have been in school simultaneously and worked full time since we met as undergrads 6 years ago and it has been great. We both get it and encourage each other. On top of that we are moving this summer and career changing out of the hell that is teaching into something new so that will be more stress but it only makes your bond stronger if you lean on each other and are in it together for the Long haul. Don't withdraw inward and remember to set limits and let things go and enjoy life together too.

A few things you should keep in mind:\n\n1. Sort out issues with home chores (cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc) ahead of time, and have them sorted out in an equal way which both of you agree is equal. Have plans for how to deal with these if the person who is responsible for those chores is ultra-busy one week or month (e.g. have a plan for ordering food for delivery, or have a certain amount of clutter that both of you can tolerate, or have a way to swap responsibilities).\n2. Both of you need to figure out how to be comfortable saying no to department or cohort-related social events. Grad students will organize things ALL THE TIME, and at some point it can carve a chunk out of your relationship time, which can cause resentment. This is even worse when your relationship time becomes entirely encompassed by chores or the more difficult aspects of supporting a partner, and the grad school friends are FUN and COOL and have PARTIES with DANCING and whatever. This is a perfect recipe for FOMO if you stay home and a perfect recipe for jealousy (or worse) if you go out, and you're going to be facing the possibility of doing this pretty much 3-4 times a week. Having friends in your cohort is a good thing, but figure out how to balance cohort events with your relationship. Bring your partner and make sure your cohort understands that they are part of the package, or avoid events where your partner's presence is not wanted. Organize smaller events with people you like from your cohort where your partner is an expected and wanted part of the group (board game nights, dinner at a restaurant, pickup soccer or frisbee games in the quad, whatever).\n3. Figure out if your housing situation is organized in a way which will support both of you needing space to work. If you both need your own space and that's not possible with how your place is set up, either figure out how to achieve that, or consider moving somewhere that will have that extra space.\n4. Make time in your schedule to still have date nights from time to time.", "author": "tchomptchomp", "created": 1612627879, "upvotes": 100}, "gm8p9ac": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ldyxyv/my_bf_and_i_are_going_to_be_in_grad_school_at_the/gm8p9ac/", "text": "Yes!

We were together three years before both entering grad school at the same time, and we are now very close to graduating. It\u2019s actually amazing. Yes you\u2019re stressed and busy all the time, but your partner knows exactly what you\u2019re going through and understands the intricacies and weird grad school things that other people don\u2019t. My partner and I are in the same field as well, which we love since we can talk about our projects and bounce ideas off each other. The other side of that is that we sometimes have trouble turning our school side of us off lol. I loved having someone to come home to and commiserate with, as well as having someone to motivate me and cheer me on when I was frustrated and wanted to quit. I think it\u2019s better having someone in the same boat as you who can help you make the best of things, although I understand things would likely be different if we had children (both financially and time management wise). \n\nAdvice wise, you have to have good communication and be willing to compromise on things. Make sure you\u2019re on the same page with finances, as living on measly grad school stipends can add even more pressure. Make sure you take time to be together. It\u2019s very easy to get sucked into the work 24/7 mindset and try to be the most productive you can be, and that will destroy not only you but your relationship as well. Good luck!
