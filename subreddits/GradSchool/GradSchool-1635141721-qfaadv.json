  "text": "During undergrad, I would basically teach myself all of the lecture material after class. Didn't matter what class or subject it was, that's always what worked best for me, and I always scored well on tests and got good grades so I never thought it was a problem. I just couldn't pay attention during lecture, mostly because I found it really difficult to both conceptualize the information and get all of the notes down at the same time. I know that sounds weird, but basically I'm a great note-taker but I have no actual idea what I'm writing down while I'm doing it. \n\nHowever, this is not working for me now that I'm in my Masters program, mostly because both of my professors this semester cold-call and every time they call on me I freeze up and have to tell them that I don't know the answer. This doesn't seem to be a problem for literally anyone else in my cohort, and it's really starting to mess with me mentally. I would love to just ignore this single problem and focus on my success in other areas, but we don't have any graded material back yet for me to reassure myself with and at least 20% of our grade is based on class participation and discussion anyways. It's going to be really hard for me to succeed if I can't even process a question I'm asked on the spot, let alone relate it to anything we've talked about in lecture. \n\nI guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever dealt with something like this before, and how they handled it? Is it an anxiety-over-public-speaking thing, or something else? Because at this point I'm ready to call it quits. Basically I've convinced myself that I'm not actually smart at all and that these next three semesters are going to be a nightmare for me if I decide to stick with it. Which I really want to stick with it, but I think I'm probably too dumb to be here.",

          "text": "Not really. We have readings, but for one class they\u2019re very basic and we don\u2019t draw from them much, and the other class mostly discusses stuff that hasn\u2019t been published yet. Neither professor posts the lecture powerpoints either. We kind of just go into each class blind lol",

              "text": "Have you tried asking for slides to be shared with you beforehand? In my experience, professors are usually pretty accommodating when it comes to being better prepared for  class. Even if you've already asked and they've said no, I would recommend speaking to your professors anyway and explaining to them that it takes you a longer to process, but you are still engaged. Hopefully this conversation can lead to a solution where your participation is graded differently than so that they don't cold call on you amd instead wait for you yo volunteer, so that your participation grade doesn't suffer.\n\nYou can also look into getting accommodations. I'm currently a grad student instructor/TA and plenty of my students have accommodations that allow for modified participation grading. Good luck and hang in there!",

                  "text": "One of my professors lectures a lot on his own personal research that hasn\u2019t been published yet, so he\u2019s been adamant about not posting the slides anywhere, which I understand so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be asking him again. \n\nAlso, the graduate studies director told us at orientation that accommodations could be made, but grad students shouldn\u2019t need them so they\u2019ve never worked with someone who had them before. I thought it was odd and it made me wary to even look into it, but I think I might start now knowing that other programs have students that use them. \n\nThanks for the tips!!",
