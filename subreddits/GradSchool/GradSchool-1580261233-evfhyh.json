While we, as graduate students, know personally and professionally the toll that a career in research takes on the mental health of young professionals, this situation seemed all too familiar yet shocking for me.\n\nI briefly met him a year ago at a conference. This PhD student was extremely intelligent, had acquired his own funding (F31), had awesome publications (2 co-authors, 1 first author), and had a great lab environment. His mentor is/was very supportive of his progress, way more than mine. He was a month or two away from defending and his paper came out just today (from a journal that my submitted manuscript was rejected). For all that work and effort, it feels so empty to be wasted and I have nothing but deep sympathy for this lab and his family going through this situation.\n\nTo the downtrodden of /r/gradschool, I just want to say that if you're feeling down and out, your situation and feelings are completely valid. Try to seek out help from therapists, family, friends, or whatever you find solace and validation in. If you need to quit and leave grad school due to extreme mental health challenges, I and all other graduate students are with you. Nothing is worth taking your life.\n\nEdit: Posting for clarity (as done in the comments below):\n\nThe National Grad Crisis Line\n\n1.877.GRAD.HLP\u00a0(1.877.472.3457)\n\n[http://gradresources.org/crisis/](http://gradresources.org/crisis/)", "author": "manofthehippo", "created": 1580261233, "retrieved": 1632845315, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 565, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ffye57x": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/evfhyh/recent_suicide_of_a_phd_student/ffye57x/", "text": "I just popped onto reddit because I needed someone to reassure me that people with mental illness can, in fact, succeed in grad school.

I have bipolar disorder and the last five months have been some of the worst of my life. The stress of my prelims launched me into a mania that lasted all the way through winter break. I'm a different person when I'm like that, and certainly not a person who is working on her dissertation. \n\nNow the pendulum has swung. I am so low right now that I'm reading fucking Camus to talk myself out of suicide. I have a kinda important meeting with my committee on Friday and I have no new writing for them. I haven't changed clothes since...I'm guessing it's been five or six days? I can't go more than five minutes without breaking down.
