Would love to look at the cultural relevance at a later point.)", "author": "jongsey", "created": 1632062436, "retrieved": 1632844145, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdh5s49": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pr96ig/using_a_translator/hdh5s49/", "text": "In my experience,  thesis using a lot of foreign language source learn the languages themselves.
