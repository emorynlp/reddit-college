{"sid": "ht95w9", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ht95w9/title_ix_violation_at_uni/", "title:": "Title IX Violation at Uni", "text": "Hi all,\n\nLast year, I reported being inappropriately touched by a postdoc. I was forced to talk to my institutions Title IX office after coming forward, trying to get out of the lab I was in. It was reported to the PI on three occasions. The lab tech was also inappropriately touched. Several people saw this. Yale did not attempt to substantiate those claims. He also made inappropriate comments to a female undergrad that had been there previously. This was a pattern. First, when I told the PI about that, she laughed and said she, \"didn't get involved in personal matters\". The second time, we were standing in the lab, and I even asked the technician as well in front of her if she liked it when he came up and grabbed her from behind while she said 'no' and 'stop' repeatedly and tried to squirm away. She said she didn't like it. PI did nothing. Third try, I reframed it as a hinderance to my data. PI said she had NEVER HEARD OF THESE ALLEGATIONS BEFORE (lie) and only when her data could be affected did she do anything. When I reported this, I was made to stay out of the lab for two months-not the handsy post doc. Institution admitted that they knew I was touched, and said \"steps were taken to prevent a recurrence\". Nothing changed. We still had overlapping schedules. He's still there. When I opened the title IX report today, I was shocked to see that Yale said the claim was unsubstantiated. There were emails sent to other PIs questioning the conduct and relaying PIs response, consistently. Others who knew who the office said they wouldn't contact. This directly conflicts with what the investigators told me. I was told by two different investigators that they COULD substantiate my claims. That they had done something to prevent future incidents. Tonight, I opened their title IX report. I found mine easily.\n\nThey lied in their report. They didn't take it seriously. They have a national reputation for not taking harassment seriously, and it's spot-on.\n\nMy former PI said it sounded more like assault. I went nuclear and put it all on Twitter. No ragrets. Not even a single letter.\n\nIt's with the OCR and NIH, so I'm protected by federal whistleblowing laws.\n\nToday, the OCR attorney called my attorney just now and he was in the room when Yale admitted I was touched by this postdoc. They openly falsified their title IX report. They played themselves. This is it-they're sunk.\n\nI'd like this to get some more traction. If you can, I'd appreciate any retweets I could get.
