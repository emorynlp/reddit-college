I have little to no confidence in my research project and now I have little to no confidence in my writing and critical thinking abilities. I don\u2019t really know what I want out of this post but I just needed to vent somewhere where people would maybe understand.",

      "text": "My impression is that most academics are trained to be critical and look for flaws in arguments rather than strengths, and that this affects how they give feedback. They tend to just focus on the stuff that needs improvement and more or less ignore what's good. Since you're passing you're probably doing just fine!",

      "text": "Fellow grad student having a bad day here. My advisor called my manuscript outline \"a mess\". One thing I don't understand is that we've been writing this outline for almost a semester and it ping-ponged with her more than a dozen times. I feel like it's half her fault at this point if it's that much of a mess. She just wants more and more details for even the smallest thing and then complains about it being too long. TBH it's not even an outline anymore, but rather a whole manuscript with sentences separated and bullet-pointed. I'm very confused at this point and am starting to think maybe I'm just a lousy researcher who has no right to be in research.",
