When I had my interview with my potential adviser, I brought it up and mentioned that it would be a deal breaker for me because this university was located in one of the highest cost of living areas in the country. Later, I got a call from the dean of the department telling me they were really interested in having me attend, so I brought it up again and she mentioned that they don't give scholarships or tuition remission to first years but I could apply in my second year. When I brought up that I would be coming from out of state she said something to the effect of \"oh, well that's the good thing about \\[university\\], our tuition is $30,000 regardless whether you are in state or out of state because we're a private university\". They just felt so out of touch that, cost aside, it really turned me off. \n\nI turned down another university because my potential adviser told me that many of his students work retail jobs to help pay for college. I wasn't prepared to travel 1000 miles just to work in retail. Yes, the career opportunities from those programs might have been nice, but I realized that I would start at least tens of thousands of dollars in the hole PLUS the cost of housing.
