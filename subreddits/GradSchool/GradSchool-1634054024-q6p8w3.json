  "text": "Which one is better for job prospects? CS Masters require CS pre-reqs which I will complete. I\u2019m almost done with an IT degree so I thought maybe I should apply for a Masters in CS.",

Employers won\u2019t care what your bachelor\u2019s is (and it\u2019s so similar anyway), the skills you learn in grad school makes your undergrad degree basically irrelevant. Your undergrad degree shows that you can learn what others teach you, a masters degree shows that you can teach yourself and apply it to a real-world problem.",
