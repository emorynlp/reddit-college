When I told him I was struggling he said I should focus on my family first and only work on my degree if I had energy left, but that if I didn't that was ok and that the world was bigger than the lab and my degree. He also encouraged me to take breaks and not try to seem busy for the sake of it because it was a stressful time for everyone. I've been an absolutely abysmal student, but he checks in on me every month (outside of emails) just to see if I'm doing ok and sometimes messages me with gentle encouragement, but never putting pressure on me to perform. \n\nHe doesn't take on new students if no one shows interest because he firmly believes in working with people who want to be there because they really love the research. He stays far away from any academic or departmental drama if he can (weird for a prof considered to be top in the world in his area of expertise) and he is always cheerful and ready to help. He has a lovely way of 'reprimanding' in that he focuses on finding a solution, not placing blame. \n\nHe also disappears for periods of time to live his life in the outdoors (annoying when you need him, but he responds to my emails even if he ignores everyone else so I don't care and secretly admire his gumption). He has no ego and is always willing to learn, even if it means learning from someone 'lower' than him in the academic totem pole because admitting you don't know is the only way you can properly learn something new.  \n\nHe's got plenty of flaws and is perfectly confident in all his abilities, so it's not like he's an annoyingly perfect person who puts themselves down.

I've had lots of good research and community experiences echoing what many people have already said, but I have to say my experience TAing, lecturing, and mentoring has been the absolute best part of these last five years.\n\ntl;dr: My experiences as a graduate instructor have boosted my self-confidence invaluably, and I am genuinely grateful for the relationships I've been able to form with my students and the joy those interactions give me.\n\nFor one thing, teaching has made me so much more confident in my own knowledge and general competence. Taking myself out of environments where everyone around me is necessarily an expert in what they do and entering into a classroom where students are eager (or at least willing, lol) to learn something new has helped combat imposter syndrome sooo much. When I'm working with students, actively trying to make subject matter I care about accessible and interesting, I realize how much material I've actually learned in this program. I realize how much more capable I am of thinking about bigger picture problems. Turns out I am really good at recognizing misunderstandings and sorting them out, which makes me better able to discuss these same topics with my grad student colleagues and faculty. I see that while I still have a ton of work to do improving my own writing, I really have improved a ton and I can pass that on. \n\nMore than the confidence boost though, I seriously just love interacting with undergrads. At best, they demonstrably learn and develop critical reasoning skills and may even be inspired to continue their studies in more advanced coursework, an honors thesis, or graduate school. At worst, they are disengaged and/or disrespectful, which is admittedly not super fun, but tbh it can make for some pretty humorous anecdotes venting with my cohort at a bar night. I also find that those students just aren't the norm the way I had expected. I'm kind of on the older side for a phd student, my students are 10-15 years younger than me, and damn undergrads today are NUTS. Like in a good way. They are so much more ambitious, driven, and ready to change the world than I was or any of my very amazing and talented peers were. There are seriously some really cool \"kids\" who are very mature and generally awesome. It is super satisfying to form relationships of real mutual respect with these students, and even better when I have the chance to see how they're excelling later on when they want to ask for a letter of rec or get some advice on applying to grad school or whatever. \n\nI think it's a sad reality that the expected attitude in so much of academia is to view teaching as an unfortunate obligation in order to be allowed to do your \"real job\" as a researcher. Screw that. I understand why a lot of people feel that way but there are those of use who really, really don't. Go into teaching with an open mind. Yes a lot of people hate it, but there are way many of us who value that experience more than it may seem. There are dozens of us, dozens!
