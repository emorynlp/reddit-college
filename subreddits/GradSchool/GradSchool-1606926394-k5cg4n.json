  "text": "I almost lost my dissertation to a can of La Croix when I bricked my computer last night... but I remembered I\u2019d set my computer to automatically store all my files in the cloud! So here\u2019s your reminder: if you haven\u2019t uploaded your recent files to the cloud/external drives/etc, take a second to do it and prepare for any seltzer accidents. Still have to get a whole new computer though :(",

Plus it works offline, as well, it just wont back up till you're reconnected. I keep all my files in there and clear them from my laptop to save space regularly.",

Chances are your school already has a Microsoft Outlook/Google Drive deal and both of these can do backup/sync. Sync is also really convenient for those working on multiple computers (like a laptop+desktop).\n\nIf you're a linux person who can't use that kind of stuff, I recommend Nextcloud which comes in a Docker container to make deployment simple. All you need is an old desktop or a Pi with a hard drive.",

They had to rebuild a wall before they could reinstall in the line, so everybody in my building who had my carrier had no internet for 2 weeks. I was working at home because of the rona, so this was not a fun 2 weeks. \n\nI think I am going to pay for encrypted auto back up with backblaze instead. A small price to pay for security, privacy and consistency.\n\nAnd every night, in my prayers I will continue to ask God to protect my computer (and my car, but that is another story) from the slings and arrows of my lack of hand-eye coordination and clumsy nature.
