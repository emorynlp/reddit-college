  "title:": "How long do you wait to send a reminder to a professor after not getting a response?",
  "text": "I have a professor that is notorious for not checking and responding to emails. I have a better chance of contacting them through text message or FB messenger (we were friends before I entered the program). Typically I have worked around this, but this semester it has really pushed on my timeline for meeting university deadlines for my dissertation despite my efforts. At this point, I really can't afford to wait his usual 7 to 10 business day turn around time. However, some things have to be responded to in email format due to my university's policies, and this is one of those things.\n\nWhat would you say is an appropriate timeframe to wait and send a reminder through another source that I have sent them an email that is time sensitive?",

      "text": "For not very time sensitive things, I would wait a week as you said. For the time sensitive stuff with hard deadlines, I always adopted a 7 days out, 3 days out, day of reminder system. \n\nI think for things like what you've said that have to be sent by email, I would send the email and then send a text/FB message saying that you sent them an email about X and its a bit time sensitive so you wanted to make sure they saw it. \n\nOne other thing I've found helpful in dealing with my busy professors and email is asking them to send a response confirming that they've received the email. Here's the logic: \n\n- **Scenario A:**\nProfessor receives an email and glances through it quickly, sees that it asks him to do something, or write a response that might take a few minutes or longer. Figures he'll comes back to it at some point. Forgets.\n\n- **Scenario B:**\nProfessor receives an email, glances through it, sees that it asks him to confirm receipt (which'll only take 30 secs or so). While he's doing that, he'll probably take a bit of a closer look at what the email actually said and it's more likely to stick in his head. Plus, the response acts psychologically as a commitment -- he's confirmed and is more likely to follow through. You receive confirmation and you're no longer panicking if it just got stuck in his inbox. \n\nIts something I try not to overuse -- I'll only do it for the important/time sensitive stuff. But I've found it very effective overall.",

      "text": "Out of curiosity, have you mentioned it to him? Or has he brought it up? Only asking because I know from personal experience that alot of Professors tend to appreciate/encourage follow up emails because they tend to be balancing so many different tasks at once that those emails can get lost in the pile. For really time sensitive stuff I wouldn't feel bad about following up even the day after if you need to",
