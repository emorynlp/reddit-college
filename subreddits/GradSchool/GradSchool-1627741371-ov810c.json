In response to my presentation, he made a lot of comments and questions and eventually started sharing some anecdotes of his experience in research.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was. Maybe the fact that his statements always started with \u201cI\u201d which indicated that he is someone with minimal self-awareness. But then he started talking about the research process. Coming up with a hypothesis, the joy of finding an original thought, the struggles of writing and the relief that comes after the first sentence. It hit home. It\u2019s like he took me by the hand and showed me all these cool toys in the playground. He encouraged me to keep going.\n\n\nThen, silence. Before I could acknowledge this pep talk, my own supervisor chimed in. To my surprise, he admitted that this was probably the first time I was receiving encouragement in my grad journey and apologized/messily thanked the professor on my behalf. He admitted that he only gives me negative, often harsh feedback. \n\n\nBefore any of us could respond to that, he shared his own anecdote of his equally harsh supervisor. The way he spoke about it, though he chuckled nervously, it\u2019s clear that his own grad school experience was inhumane and traumatizing. \n\n\nI felt sad for him, but something clicked within me: hurt people hurt people.", "author": "duascoisas", "created": 1627741371, "retrieved": 1632954338, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 321, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h7cz803": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ov810c/im_in_my_final_year_of_a_masters_degree_and_today/h7cz803/", "text": "I can relate, but when I finally asked for some encouragement in my last few months, she told me \u201cIve always known you can do it so I never needed to tell you that, you just need to believe it yourself and get it done.

I didn't get much encouragement until I was defending my thesis. I made a statement regarding the fact I didn't have positive results and after my committee discussed amongst themselves and called everyone back in, my two committee members (not my advisor) said I did a really great job in spite of things going wrong and that I should be proud of myself because I did what I set out to do and what I was supposed to do. It was so nice but man I wish I had gotten that way beforehand. My advisor was not bad but she was absent or very minimally involved and just didn't want me to be one of her other students who took years to graduate. I did it in  just over 2 years. Anyway, I'm glad you heard it when you did and hope you keep getting encouraged. Grad school is hard and we all need a little something to keep going sometimes!
