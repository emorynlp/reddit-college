  "text": " Hi! I wanted to ask what program is better given my interests and current experience. I have my background in Applied Math and have done research on math modeling in biology topics such as prostate cancer and antigen-antibody interactions. I am currently at UCSF as a research specialist researching antibiotic resistance using enzymology (crystallography, kinetics, cloning) and computational methods. I want to use both for research in genetic disorders (cancer, diabetes, respiratory). Please help!",
