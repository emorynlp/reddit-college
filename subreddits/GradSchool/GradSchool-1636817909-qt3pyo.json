  "title:": "How to ask my Professor if there is an open position for my PhD?",
  "text": "I am currently doing my Masters in an european country, so the normal course is Bachelors -> Masters -> PhD. I am very happy with my current lab and project, and also like the way my professor is teaching the PhD students (demanding but also understanding). So it came into my mind, that I maybe want to stay here for my PhD too. \n\nI have told my supervisor about my idea and she encourages me to tell my professor in advance, so he can tell me any open positions or help me with funding. I know that this a good idea, but I am afraid asking him. Especially because I do not know how to ask without beeing to demanding or unprofessional. Maybe it is also because I don't want to screw it up and loose one of the best working environments and projects I was working on. Additionally I do not feel like I am good enough to ask him about a position (Although my grades are saying the opposite). \n\nSorry for bothering you all with this, but because I am a first generation academic, I have nobody close enough to ask those questions. \n\nDo you think it is appropriate to ask him? Or should I wait until he offers me staying? Do you have any tips how to start this conversation? Should I shedule an extra meeting for that?",

They usually know as one of the first (if their relationship with professor and in the group is good) and they could bring you up as potential candidate if they are willing to do so.",

However I am not taking classes anymore, because I started writing my thesis already. So no chance to future impressing with good grades. :/ The other lab members know about my wish to stay for some months now (and would like me to stay too). To this day there was no such opportunity for me or my collegues to talk with my professor about my future. So I was thinking about taking the initiative myself. I was thinking about asking him about it after one of our lab meetings we have weekly. But I always feel to anxious to ask, and then loose the opportunity...",

Better to get a no and feel bad about it, than never ask and wonder for the rest of your life what the answer could have been and regretting not asking it.",

After about 2 months, I've already asked the PI about his expectations from me if I were to apply for a PhD in his group. Now I feel like I set myself up by fixing his expectations. If I can't reach them, I'll not be taken in for sure. I feel like maybe there could've been some leeway in the expectations if they weren't discussed at all. He is expecting me to take a course that's mandatory for PhD students to take and excel at it. Idk if I can do that as that's the toughest course this department has to offer.",
