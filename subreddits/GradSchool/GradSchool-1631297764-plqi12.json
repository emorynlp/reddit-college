I've read all the advice I could find. I think my presentation is good, I'm fairly good at exuding confidence I don't have, and I know what I want to say. I've been practicing every day, giving the full presentation out-loud in my apartment.\n\nNo matter how many times I practice, I end up tongue tied. I'll start a sentence wrong and then have to finish it or I won't explain something the way I wanted to. Then my options are to finish a very awkward sentence or pause, think it through, and start that sentence over. Neither of which are good when doing a presentation.\n\nI have problems with talking too fast, slurring my words, or stuttering so a lot of my concentration goes to saying words slowly and clearly. I just got braces a month ago which makes me have to concentrate even harder on speaking clearly. It makes it a lot easier for me to forget what I was saying or mess up, and I can't help when I mess a word up to start panicking and feeling embarrassed. If I mess up a word it distracts me, causes me to lose my train of thought, and then my mind goes blank and I have trouble recovering.\n\nWhen practice isn't helping anymore, what can I do to present well next week? I'm very nervous but I know I will feel better about presentations if I do a good job on this one. I'm just super scared of freezing up, stumbling over words, or saying things very awkwardly. I stutter when I'm nervous, which does not help.", "author": "FirstAvocado", "created": 1631297764, "retrieved": 1632844660, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"hcf8fbt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plqi12/getting_tonguetied_during_presentation_even/hcf8fbt/", "text": "I also get really nervous giving presentations, which manifests for me as a really shaky voice and moving my hands a lot (all the nervous energy goes there). The one thing I started doing which helped me a lot was to take a deep breath in the middle of the presentation. So when I feel myself tripping up or hear my voice shaking I try to finish the sentence and take a deep breath before starting the next one. Honestly it has really really helped - just getting that air in calms your body down and can slow down that \"fight-or-flight\" adrenaline response that always kicks in for me when I have to present. \n\nAnd honestly if you do mess up the sentence, it's completely fine to start it again. I've heard so many presenters do that, everyone trips up on words or makes a mistake sometimes. It's 100% okay to stop, rewind a bit, and say it again for clarification. \n\nBest of luck with your presentation next week!", "author": "lemongarlicpasta", "created": 1631358878, "upvotes": 1}, "hce46ev": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plqi12/getting_tonguetied_during_presentation_even/hce46ev/", "text": "Hi! I used to teach people how to give presentations, and my best advice is to NOT FREAK OUT when you stumble on a word. Even the best presenters have brain farts or get tongue tied, and the best thing to do is to acknowledge it, maybe make a joke and move on. I\u2019ve literally said \u201cwhoops, sorry, had a small stroke there\u201d or \u201csorry folks, I\u2019m buffering\u201d Be honest and self-aware. You know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re prepared, and you\u2019re ready.
