  "text": "I am defending my PhD dissertation on Thursday, and I\u2019m a bit scared. I know they wouldn\u2019t let me if they didn\u2019t think I was going to pass, but still, I\u2019m doing an interdisciplinary thesis and this department has never had one that\u2019s interdisciplinary before, so I\u2019m worried that they\u2019ll categorically fail me because they\u2019re not accepting of the validity of the other field. I\u2019ve practiced my talk a few times on my own, once for friends, and tomorrow I do it again for my co-chairs. And I\u2019ve already revised the entire dissertation organization once since officially submitting it since the committee members told my chair to tell me that they didn\u2019t like that I wrote it too much like the other field and not enough like their field. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude30\n\nAnyone got encouraging words, or things you wished you knew beforehand? Advice from people doing interdisciplinary theses, or controversial topics, would be especially welcome.",
