My advisor eventually made peace with it since my overall productivity was good (better overall, actually, with the periodic intense breaks).  It really helped to take a week or two at a time to focus on other activities -- going to plays and concerts, whacking out at parties, camping, raising hell, and (let's face it, you're in your 20s) getting laid.  That kept me sane through a standard 2\u03c0-year applied-physics degree.  If I were a robot I could've cut out the shenanigans and gotten out in 4 years -- but in retrospect it was all time well spent.  Although I did get way too wrapped up in my dissertation during the final push (which lasted about 5 months), that binge-and-break habit helped me preserve a self-identity outside the work.  That was important after getting out also (although binge-and-break doesn't work as well in the outside world).  If you let it, a life of research can totally subsume everything, and postdoc burnout is a real thing.  So remembering that you are also the guy/gal who likes <this> and <that> and once managed to <crazy thing>, and making some time to be that person, is really important.

In one of Brenee Brown's books she says that the stronger sense of self you have, the less any failure will affect your self-worth.

The kicker is that it's a negative feedback - adding more pressure on yourself makes it harder to focus, manage time, and find a groove. Recently, with the help of therapy and after a couple pretty low points, I have really been emphasizing to myself that I am not my work. In fact, working on myself, my balance, and personal wellbeing are by far a priority in my life from a broader perspective. Getting a little buddhist - my inner peace is worth way more than a degree. It's going to take a lot more work to detach from the productivity-linked self worth, but I am trying hard to stop negative self talk and projecting that negativity and judgment onto others (!). These are kind of logical things, and I apologize if they are low hanging fruit and not what you are looking for, but really buying into them in an honest way has helped me relieve the productivity pressure and opened the reverse positive feedback loop. All of the sudden, productivity seems to come easier. In the case of your experiment, setbacks (and failure) are central to the process, these are crazy times, and from a broader perspective it is not worth your inner peace.", "author": "Chairman-Mau", "created": 1599232273, "upvotes": 19}, "g3zqqsr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/imgcqm/in_need_of_a_reminder_that_you_are_not_only_your/g3zqqsr/", "text": "You've basically got the answer already, you are identifying too much with your work.
