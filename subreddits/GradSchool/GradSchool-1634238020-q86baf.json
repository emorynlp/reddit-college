  "text": "I am currently working as a High School Science teacher in Texas. I am thinking about going to get my master in a harder life science such as Microbiology and Immunology but I am not quite sure if I can do that and still work as a teacher. I want to further my knowledge academically and potentially do research in the future however, I cannot afford to quit my job and go back to school. \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",
