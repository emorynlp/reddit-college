So, similarly to hedging language, sometimes it\u2019s actually most appropriate to not specify things with exact confidence and specificity, precisely because you may not really possess that level of knowledge. I tell my students, for instance, that it\u2019s fine to hedge and use passive voice in a research paper with unclear results that need tentative exploration\u2014but not so much perhaps in, say, a personal narrative requiring one to speak confidently about actions.",
