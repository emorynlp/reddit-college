I\u2019m glad action was finally taken against his academic advisor, because his behavior was despicable. Really heavy reminder to all of us to find support when and where we need it, and that our identity and worth and even future isn\u2019t written by our failures or even successes in academia.", "author": "errorFohOhFoh", "created": 1612882336, "retrieved": 1632845891, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 367, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gniaen7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lg4x2l/follow_up_investigations_released_from_2019_phd/gniaen7/", "text": "This story is just so sad.

I missed this story when it came out last year, so I\u2019m glad it\u2019s being shared now because what happened to Huixiang is horrible. As grad students ourselves, we need to continue to talk about this to protect ourselves, try our hardest to change the culture for future students, and to honor the memory of the ones who were abused. \n\nI\u2019d love for stories like Huixiang\u2019s to spark a conversation outside of academia to demand change. I doubt anyone in the general public knows how bad the culture is (unless they went to grad school and did research, I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s a problem is coursework-based grad programs). If this conversation ever leaves academic circles, this isn\u2019t just a \u201cquit your job if it\u2019s that bad\u201d solution. The student-advisor relationship is a weirdly intimate one that can be abused so easily. I personally feel as if it\u2019s not the normal boss-worker relationship because it has a personal/emotional component to it. Plus quitting is not an option for most, since their legal status depends on their enrollment.", "author": "happytransformer", "created": 1612917399, "upvotes": 8}, "gmracs8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lg4x2l/follow_up_investigations_released_from_2019_phd/gmracs8/", "text": "Honestly, I feel like the professor should be held criminally liable for this student's death since his corruption, dishonesty, and incompetence directly contributed to this students death. The family of Huixiang deserve some kind of justice.

I hadn't known about this tragedy. Truly awful what happened to Huixiang.\n\nI was in a similar situation where 3 days before the paper submission deadline I found out from the ablation study that the entire idea which our paper was based on turned out to be flawed. I was fortunate enough that my team members and the supervisor were encouraging and supportive, and I was able to focus on doing 'good science'. We ended up retracting the paper submission but never have I felt more relieved. I was in constant stress before that. What I can share from my experience is that your integrity and the fact that you are doing 'good science' are more important than a cheap academic success at the expense of potentially bringing the field down (by not following proper tools of science and reporting false ideas that are not backed up by evidence).  \n\n\nps. do ablation study!", "author": "justanother142", "created": 1612896764, "upvotes": 27}, "gmpsebt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lg4x2l/follow_up_investigations_released_from_2019_phd/gmpsebt/", "text": "Thank you for posting this - I hadn\u2019t heard about this at the time and what this student went through was just plain wrong.

They have international partners as well. \n\nUltimately the culture within and outside labs has to change. So many PIs only chase power and prestige.
