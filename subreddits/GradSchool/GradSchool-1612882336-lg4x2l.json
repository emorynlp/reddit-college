  "text": "Yesterday ACM released the findings of the ISCA'19 misconduct investigation. TL;DR: \"There was clear and convincing evidence\" for all allegations brought by Huixiang's suicide. https://www.sigarch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JIC-Public-Announcement-Feb-8-2021.pdf \n\nThe original story here: https://medium.com/@huixiangvoice/the-hidden-story-behind-the-suicide-phd-candidate-huixiang-chen-236cd39f79d3\n\nThis is all incredibly sad, and I wish Huixiang could have seen he was worth so much more than his research. I\u2019m glad action was finally taken against his academic advisor, because his behavior was despicable. Really heavy reminder to all of us to find support when and where we need it, and that our identity and worth and even future isn\u2019t written by our failures or even successes in academia.",

His life is worth more than a degree and some people's wrongdoing, but the resource as a student is limited, not to mention being an international student.\n\nHope haven is a better place, and the bad guys get what they deserve eventually.",

      "text": "Thank you for sharing. I missed this story when it came out last year, so I\u2019m glad it\u2019s being shared now because what happened to Huixiang is horrible. As grad students ourselves, we need to continue to talk about this to protect ourselves, try our hardest to change the culture for future students, and to honor the memory of the ones who were abused. \n\nI\u2019d love for stories like Huixiang\u2019s to spark a conversation outside of academia to demand change. I doubt anyone in the general public knows how bad the culture is (unless they went to grad school and did research, I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s a problem is coursework-based grad programs). If this conversation ever leaves academic circles, this isn\u2019t just a \u201cquit your job if it\u2019s that bad\u201d solution. The student-advisor relationship is a weirdly intimate one that can be abused so easily. I personally feel as if it\u2019s not the normal boss-worker relationship because it has a personal/emotional component to it. Plus quitting is not an option for most, since their legal status depends on their enrollment.",

      "text": "Honestly, I feel like the professor should be held criminally liable for this student's death since his corruption, dishonesty, and incompetence directly contributed to this students death. The family of Huixiang deserve some kind of justice. Someone posted an article awhile back of another graduate student who committed suicide a year or so ago, and the only consequence that adviser faced was being placed on  leave for a year (during which he took a prestigious position overseas) and ended up returning to the university. I don't know that he faced any real consequences either. \n\nThese people belong in prison, not academia.",

Truly awful what happened to Huixiang.\n\nI was in a similar situation where 3 days before the paper submission deadline I found out from the ablation study that the entire idea which our paper was based on turned out to be flawed. I was fortunate enough that my team members and the supervisor were encouraging and supportive, and I was able to focus on doing 'good science'. We ended up retracting the paper submission but never have I felt more relieved. I was in constant stress before that. What I can share from my experience is that your integrity and the fact that you are doing 'good science' are more important than a cheap academic success at the expense of potentially bringing the field down (by not following proper tools of science and reporting false ideas that are not backed up by evidence).  \n\n\nps. do ablation study!",

I am glad his story is being heard.\n\nHas anyone heard of the Academic Parity movement? I am listening to a seminar from one of the co-founders and he happened to put the information on his last slide. I was curious so I googled. Here is their URL: paritymovement.org. \n\nTheir website states: \u201cThe Academic Parity Movement is a non-profit organization born out of a need for justice, and the protection of students\u2019, postdocs\u2019, and early career academics\u2019 (including junior faculties) most basic human rights within academic institutions.\u201d \n\nYou can report an incident, but I\u2019m not sure how useful it will be since you can\u2019t report anonymously... still seems like a step in the right direction though. They have international partners as well. \n\nUltimately the culture within and outside labs has to change. So many PIs only chase power and prestige. The journals are too interested in maintaining their brand and selective image. And of course everyone who needs visas to keep doing research is uniquely susceptible to this kind of bullying.",

The worst punishment I\u2019ve seen is a professor get a 5 year suspension from taking new students after almost every student in their lab quit over the course of a month.",

It appears to be founded by one professor and one activist. The involvement of PIs does make me uneasy. But again, we need people inside the institutions to take action as well. \n\nI hadn\u2019t considered what protections Title IX could offer to grad students. Thanks for raising this point! I\u2019ll have to research more. Yes, sadly a lot of people are afraid to speak up which I don\u2019t blame them for. \n\nThere are PIs like that in my school too. We even have a grad student union, but I feel that the union is more involved with conditions for TAs rather than PIs mistreating their students.  I\u2019m glad the professor at your school got punished, although I\u2019m sure it might not be much consolation to the students he/she mistreated.",

His PI was really reluctant to retract what had already been published, which turned him off. \n\nSo he started working in industry instead, but from the stories he\u2019s told me, it\u2019s been pretty tough as well mostly due to expectations from the higher ups. Of course, his experience is just one of many. It did give me pause before considering either academia or industry though!",
