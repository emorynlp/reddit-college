{"sid": "pi2408", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pi2408/feeling_lost/", "title:": "Feeling lost", "text": "Hello all,\n\nI recently graduated with a BA in Psych. Currently I\u2019m working two jobs conducting UX and academic research. I had a lot of trouble (mostly medical) during my first two years and although my major gpa is decent (3.4) my overall is 2.87. This has made me feel like I have no hope of getting into a PhD program to the point of not even reaching out to potential faculty with whom my research aligns with. \n\nAlthough I have no publications or awards, I have strong research experience in both industry and academia. I just feel so scared with regards to pursuing a PhD, and I definitely cannot afford a masters (don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d get into one). I\u2019m feeling really lost as I look at programs, has anyone been in a similar boat? I\u2019d love to talk to some of you. Thank you.", "author": "SlothTheScientist", "created": 1630798410, "retrieved": 1632953137, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hbpy91a": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pi2408/feeling_lost/hbpy91a/", "text": "You can get into a decent masters program.

My GPA was a little higher, but it was nothing special. I don't think you'd be seriously limited, and I think many PI's would respect your work ethic- you get your PhD in the lab, not in class. \n\nThe best thing you can do is make yourself known by potential PI's. I know a few people in a similar boat as yours; when they focused on getting into 1 place, they were disappointed, but when they were open to 10 or so programs, they did find a program... Grad school is a huge crapshoot for applications. \n\nReach out to PI's. Read their work, come with questions, and show interest. I have never met a PI who didnt want to talk about their work. Do that so they remember your name. Again, the work you do in lab is not dependent upon getting a good grade in a class, anyway", "author": "philliesdude1", "created": 1630808461, "upvotes": 0}, "hbms9lx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pi2408/feeling_lost/hbms9lx/", "text": "This is great and well worded.
