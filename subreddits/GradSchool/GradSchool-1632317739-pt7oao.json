Every meeting ends with the \u201cemail if you have questions or updates\u201d and whenever I do I get nothing in return. It\u2019s starting to kill my productivity because some of the issues I\u2019m encountering with the code could be quickly resolved if they replied to me or offered feedback.\n\nWhat can I do to combat this? It\u2019s starting to upset me because I can\u2019t progress properly until they offer feedback. I\u2019d appreciate it if they told me they can\u2019t reply, rather than ignoring me for weeks on end.", "author": "Nuclear_Fermion", "created": 1632317739, "retrieved": 1632844052, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hdzciy7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pt7oao/my_supervisors_inattentiveness_kills_my/hdzciy7/", "text": "I just want to add, in case none of the suggestions given below work, you can still succeed (however painfully)!!! My advisor was notorious for being scatterbrained. In addition to this personality trait, he also ceased exhibiting interest in his students when they stopped being the \"shiny new toy.\" He was exceedingly interested in his passionate new students who were on fire for a topic and with whom he was conducting research, but would slowly stop communicating and advising them the longer he had known them (regardless of the status of their research initiatives in which he was involved). Although he was my advisor, he did not actively advise my Master's program, thesis research, additional graduate research projects, or anything else. I tried all of the suggestions mentioned by the other posters and then some, but none of them worked. I think these suggestions assume that the advisor actually has an interest in being reached, which is usually a valid assumption. However, in my experience, some advisors have no desire to be reached or involved and, when an advisor does not want to be reached, they'll make sure you can't reach them. Sometimes they make sure no one else can either. Through this experience, I learned to take responsibility for everything, and I mean *everything*, myself. Naturally, this means I messed up sometimes and made poor choices. BUT I learned a lot, finished my thesis, and *graduated.

It not only killed my productivity but also my passion for the project. It got to the point where I wasn't interested in any part of the topic and soon switched.

If anyone checking in from your dept. asks why you aren't progressing, you can cite you advisor's inability to answer an email.
