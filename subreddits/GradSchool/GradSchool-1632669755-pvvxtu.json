Even if you don't have good outdoor space, there are plants you can grow in windowsills or under fairly inexpensive grow lights. It's mostly not much effort and I find it relaxing to just look at my plants every day and notice how they're developing. Growing from seed gives you more options than what you can find at a garden center, and can be especially rewarding if you're willing to be patient and put in just a little more effort up front.", "author": "LowCream", "created": 1632740340, "upvotes": 1}, "hefy4bj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvvxtu/hobbies/hefy4bj/", "text": "This is corny but I have always attempted to have one hobby that is good for my body and one that is good for my soul. When I can manage my time well enough to do both it's very helpful for staying balanced but it can be hard to stick to when working long hours. So my advice is to make sure you're giving yourself time to do whatever hobby you choose or, if you're like me, it'll just end up being one more thing you feel guilty about putting on the back burner. It might sound like a bummer to schedule free time but it's actually been nice. My hobbies right now are rowing and music and on rowing days i have something to motivate me out of bed because i know I'll get an hour of putting my mind on autopilot before I have to do anything else and on music days I have a scheduled time to stop working and unwind doing something that really de-stresses me.", "author": "static_sea", "created": 1632722658, "upvotes": 2}, "hefrx2t": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvvxtu/hobbies/hefrx2t/", "text": "The Sims.

I knit while I watch lectures, gardening gives me an excuse to go out and touch living plants for like five minutes when I\u2019m frustrated or burnt out. Another hand-busying thing I do is whittle.

It's super soothing because it's simultaneously repetitive and creative, something you can continuously see yourself get better at with time in a pretty linear way-- something that is key for a grad school hobby-- and you can do it while sitting on the couch binge watching TV, listening to podcasts, etc. It's also both an \"active\" activity, while also being something you can kind of turn your brain off for, too. It's also challenging without being hard and the results are very satisfying, both visually and in an \"I made this!\" kinda way, without it requiring lots of training or machinery. AND it has a community of folks with lots of easily accessible videos, resources, never ending amounts of patterns (or you could learn to make your own, if you wanted, and post these on Etsy to make $$) that you can engage with as much or as little as you want.
