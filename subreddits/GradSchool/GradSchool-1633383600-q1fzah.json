  "text": "Hello folks! I\u2019m a first year PhD student of Sociology here in the United States. I have one co-authored book chapter from Springer and one journal article is on way with my supervisor. I hope I\u2019ll have at least another journal article during my PhD program. My question is, what is the chance of mine of being a faculty member of sociology or criminal justice in any university after completing my doctoral program? Is it too hard to start with a tenure-track? Thanks.",
