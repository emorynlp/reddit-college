  "text": "Working from home has been the most horrible, depressing experience of my life. We're not supposed to go back into the lab unless we really need to, and as I'm just writing, I'm not necessary personnel. It takes me 5x as long to do stuff at home than at the lab, I'm lonely, I feel isolated, and so STUPID all the time. I wake up at noon, stare at my data for 8 hours until I cry, then go to sleep for 10 hours and do it all again. I hate myself because I sit down and I just tell myself \"just do the work, it's not that hard\" but I make zero progress. I've tried setting small goals, setting schedules, giving myself a dedicated work space, but I'm six weeks in and I'm not even anywhere close to having my paper done, and my advisor expected this to take like three weeks. Every time I go to the grocery store I pray that I get in a car accident so I have an excuse to not do this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I wanna give a big thank you to everyone who responded to this post! I was in a really dark place last night, but reading through all your replies makes me realize that I'm not the only one feeling this way, which is SO comforting. I also realized that maybe my \"small goals\" were still too lofty- so today I challenged myself to write only ONE paragraph, that's all. And I did it, and kept writing! ",

I had a overwhelming but productive start this year, and everything\u2014my plans and motivation were replaced by insecurity and depression. I was told to work from home because I require public transportation to get to my university. My supervisor is unsure when it would be possible and safe for me to go back into the lab... due to the possibility of a second wave. I love grinding in lab and office. I associate my home as a place where I can relax and rest. This was a difficult transition. I sit in front of my computer trying to adsorb information from the journals I was sent to keep busy.  I feel lost, unmotivated to continue my project at home and bitter. My emotions are up and down as I try to push through to be positive and look forward to the future. We will get through these hard times, you got this and so do I.",

You can do your research a year or two from now, or not at all. Your life is yours to enjoy, and I know you can find something else that brings you more joy. \n\nAlso, i highly highly recommend getting to a gym if you can. Exercise has kept my husband and I sane in these crazy, isolated times. The rush of endorphins makes a huge difference, and you can set goals for yourself that your body can acheive suprisingly quickly like running 3 miles in x time or dealifting x lbs. Plus, it's a way to be around people again, even if we're not really talking to them.",

Also nice to look back and see you did something, even if it's \"wrote email to labmate to ask X question.\" It's something. Anything.\nThe \"how we feel\" is a covid tracking app (doesn't track you, you just report in, Harvard is using the info for a study) I've found the days it asks for a gratitude helpful. Also has a cool mood visualization that I REALLY want as a seperate app just for me... Assigns colors to elements of mood, you pick the level of how much you feel each thing so far in the day, and boom... Swirly art. Weirdly satisfying.\n\nAnyone wants to chat with a bioinformatics PhD student who's working on various RNAseq as well as planning live cell fluorescent microscopy experiments, lmk... Week 16 of isolation and I really miss meeting new people. No conferences this semester was a huge bummer... virtual doesn't quite appeal to me (yet).

I just took my qualifying exam (proposal + presentation) and I had to do what was supposed to be a public presentation with just my committee. Why? Panic attacks every time I tried to speak in front of a \"group.\" Best guess is I'm just so stressed and de-socialized that I cannot handle the de-personalization of Zoom presenting / having that be my only human interaction for most of a week. It's getting to me for sure*\nIs this like me? Nope. But I stuck to my Qual deadline because what FINALLY kicked in for me and I have been lacking for almost 16 months (due to depression preCOVID, see *) was the adrenaline of a due date. Did I trust it would show up? Nope. My self has let me down about this before. But it did. Finally. Work.\nSo you're not alone. This situation is awful and sure, it could be worse, but it is this and this sucks. But you COULD have good days. You COULD even have a good hour... And sometimes those multiple just as easily as the bad ones do.\nI managed to pass my Qual (with conditions, like a public presentation when school is in session again)... my exhausted ass curled up in a ball for a day and now it's 3 days latter and I'm having the snap out of it, GTFO the couch argument with myself again. However, I know I can... I know even if writing is scribbling bs in my journal and reading is a crap novel, it's using some of the skills I can't let go by the wayside. It is imperfect, but it got me back into it to do my Qual and it'll get me back out of this minislump.\n\nJust keep doing SOMETHING\n\nand know you aren't alone. I sure as shit feel alone, but reading your post helped me a bit too. I know my reply is rambling and self indulgent. But I wanted to make it clear you don't need to be a productivity super hero to somehow piecemeal some shit together into something that resembles a paper, then go from there. You can be miserable, falling asleep every other page reading a journal article, and feel like you can't even. But somehow, don't lose hope that you just... Just... Might. Gotta say it feels sweeter having gotten what was not what I thought was hands down the best thing ever done because I knew I did it despite wanting to quit every five minutes. \n\n*Note: do have a therapist, and a new psych, because I also have been through pretty much every stress inducing event one can in the past few years: moving, divorce, starting DVM/MPH program, leaving and finishing MPH, starting PhD, fighting with slumlord, sexual harassment, death of close loved one, this current shit...",

This paper isn't your whole life, it isn't you, and if you've taken on way too much for this point in time or you're considering actual *death* as a way to get out of it, now is the time to step back a bit. \n\nDo **you** need to be the one to write the first draft of every single section? Do **you** need to be the one making all of the figures? If you have coauthors then these are tasks that they can pick up.  \n\nHell, you can even choose to step back entirely from this and take a second author position or just put the thing on hold indefinitely. Maybe someone else will publish in that time, maybe you won't get this paper, but you are fantasizing about *dying* over this. You don't need an excuse to not want to do it. *You* are the person in control of your own contribution, and you can choose to abandon this work entirely if you want to.\n\nAnd I'm not just proposing this for kicks - I've done it before. I abandoned writing a first-author paper because it was so unbelievably painful and I think it would have killed me, in which case I never would have gotten that first-author paper anyway. You have to prioritise your long-term success, which is going to rest pretty heavily on your health and wellbeing, not a single paper that you hate.",

I am also weeks behind my supervisor's schedule, and their almost \\*daily\\* email was not helping. (Although they shifted their attention from my project to another one so I'm temporarily off the hook).\n\nI've been slowly pulling myself up by my bootstraps after realizing it was the **guilt** that makes everything worse. It was guilt that was fueling this vicious cycle.\n\nIt might be a little counter intuitive, but I have found forgiveness a lot more productive. Didn't do anything for the day? That's OK, we will try again. \n\nSchedule in me time and personal development time, because you don't owe it to your supervisor. You've always wanted to learn a new language (human/programming)? Go do it. You've always wanted to read that book? Schedule in the time to read it. \n\nI am slowly recovering from this quarantine syndrome, I still sometimes slip, but guess what, that's OK.

Maybe you'll think something like this would help. \n\n1) If you can--talk to your PI about this. You can go into as much or as little detail as you'd like. But talk to your PI and tell them you need a week off. No email, no phone; just a week to recharge.\n\n2) Before you take that time off, get your ducks in a row. Get everything ready to get to work the moment you get back. Clean your apartment; do laundry; organize your notes; come up with a game plan of short term, mid, and long term goals that you need to hit and figure out the steps to take to hit them. Get all of that in place, then leave. Relax and don't check email, phone in, anything like that. Just do what you need to do to relax. For me it was always backpacking and fishing. Maybe for you it's a week of reading some good books or a DIY yoga retreat. Do whatever you want to do as long as you'll be relaxed.\n\nThis always helped me. I know it's stressful to think about taking time off when you're stressed about your productivity, but sometimes you just need to take a step back. The worst that can happen is you defend a week later.",

          "text": "I am also Team take some time off. Grad school has a way of making everything seem like an emergency, seem like the most important thing in the world, seem like life or death of this doesn't get done by this time.\n\nRepeat after me: deadlines are social constructs.\n\nThis pandemic has been a collective traumatic experience. When you are experiencing trauma it can suck up a lot of brain power and literally make it difficult to think. (google it if you don't believe me).To expect that you would perform at the pre-pandemic level during a collective traumatic experience is just the kind of academic bullshit that makes the academy so toxic.  \n\nSo, in addition to the 2 up there, I am going to add.\n\n3. Talk to that therapist about perspective. You have clothes to wear. You have food to eat. You have a place to live, and none of that changes if you don't put pages down every single day. \n\n4. Reimagine your schedule. \n\n4a.Schedule some think time, take a walk outside. Writing requires thinking. Your brain needs calm and rest and physical excersise in order to function properly.\n\n4b. Schedule some friend time. Every Monday, I walk \"with\" a friend. During the height of quarentine, we took separate walks on the phone. After some of the restrictions were lifted, we started meeting up at the park for socially distant but in person walks. On Wednesdays I have zoom happy hour with my girls. Then on one of the weekend days I try to get together either outside or over the phone with somebody else. I am naturally anti-social and introverted, but, even folks like me need a little bit of outside contact, need to know that there are folks out there who they matter to you know?\n\n4c. Chunk your writing schedule. 8 hours is a long time to write. I love writing so much that I literally have a degree in it, and I couldn't stare at the computer screen that long. Our brains aren't designed to do the same thing for a super long time.  So for me, a heavy writing day schedule might look like:\n\n1 hour breakfast and morning walk\n30 minutes, review of last session, goal setting for this one\n2 hours drafting\n15 mins break\n1 hour revision\n1 hour lunch\n2 hours data analysis\n30 mins break\n1 hour read something important related to the research\n30 minutes review today's session with an eye towards the next one.\nEnd of work day\n\nIt is ok to take the morning off, and just do the afternoon. It is ok to take the afternoon off and just do the day. It is ok to take the whole day or week off. off. It is ok to just not work mornings or afternoons, to work mon-thursday and have a long weekend every week.\n\nThese folks will have you thinking that if you don't do X by Y date, the earth will stop spinning, the stars will fall from the sky directly onto your building and set it on fire to show the world your shame.  And it just isn't true.\n\n During the summer I tend to travel each month. So, I have blocked off vacation days every month where I am not working. I don't have to leave to go on vacation. I kick back, is drinks in my kitchen and sip them in the zero gravity chair on the balcony.\n\nAt the end of the day, it will all be ok. And remember there are folks who love and support you, even strangers on the internet have your back. \ud83d\udc99",

I didnt know this student very well but they were open to helping me. I also spoke with a counselor - i was depressed too and in a bad relationship. Getting out of the bad relationship helped with my mental health a bit, but finally finishing was a weight that was lifted that felt amazing - you'll get there! Step 1 - ask for help. Its the brave thing to do so don't feel like it should be easy. It's hard.",

              "text": "I feel you! The cost of therapy was enough of a barrier to prevent me from taking the step for years, even though the whole time I knew I needed it. But once I did take that step, I didn't go back (after a period of trial and error). I often tell myself, I'll regularly spend $50-75 on a night out with drinks, so a therapy session is worth two of those. I'd much rather give up a couple nights of something I do pretty often to be able to do something that provides real value and would be much better for me than literally anything else I could do with that money. First, look into whether your school will cover at least part of the costs. Then take some time to browse local therapists in your area. Don't overthink it too much, but accept that you might see 1-3 before you find one that you really click with, and the expense becomes completely negligible in comparison to what you get back.\n\nAt this point, seeing a therapist might be a matter of survival for you, and needs to be treated as such.",
