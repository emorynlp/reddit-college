  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm a senior in my undergrad career, looking to graduate in December. I was looking for some advice from people who have done their undergrad and grad at the same school and whether or not you think that was good in hindsight. \n\nI likely have the opportunity to stay where I am and have guaranteed funding in the Spring, but I also wonder if going somewhere else and expanding my knowledge with different people would be more beneficial. I would be waiting to start grad in the Fall if I went elsewhere due to lack of funding and acceptance in the spring. \n\nThanks for any input or advice!",

We didn\u2019t have a graduate program in the exact same field but we had a closely aligned MS program.\n\nHe always told me that unless I would only receive full funding at my current university that I should go elsewhere. Obviously this isn\u2019t considering outside factors such as jobs/significant others/etc. The reasoning he always gave me was that it expanded your life experience outside of living in the same town for 4-8+ years, but also allowed you to vastly expand your connections. You have connections with most of the faculty at your current school. Going to another school gives you an entire new faculty to make connections with. When you finish grad school and move to get into your career those connections will be invaluable.\n\nAgain though, $$$ and not being in debt for the rest of your life > easier time finding a job.

Making more connections is definitely a top priority, and I grew up as a military kid so I 100% need to live in a new place soon, but like you said, funding tops all. I have a GRA offer already lined up and the group I'd be working with works with many professional and research organizations, so I'm hoping that will make up for it if I stay here.",

I know a few people who had mentors with connections at national labs and they were able to tie an internship there into their research and thesis, so they were able to get that experience and those connections as well.\n\nAlso, fellow military kid. Totally get that need to move soon lol. I wonder if it\u2019ll ever go away \ud83d\ude02",

      "text": "I started my PhD right after my undergrad at the same institution, so I can give my quick $0.02 on this!\n\n- What matters most imo is research fit, so if you have a faculty member in mind you want to work w/ alr (and that you get along well with/whose research interests align with yours), I think that's a very strong reason for you to stay at your current school! Otherwise, I'd continue to scout out potential decent PI fits while you're researching other schools.\n\n- Also, I recommend hitting up the current grad students in your school's department and asking them what the culture there is like (if you don't know alr). Students are gonna be a lot more honest with you than the faculty will ever be, and if there's any red flags to note, (hopefully) they'll disclose that to you early on!\n\n- While I won't deny the advantages of branching out and making new connections at a different institution, I'm really glad I was able to stay in the same city that I've been living in for all my undergrad simply bc the familiarity gave me a sense of security. YMMV here, but starting my PhD during fall 2020 was ...an experience, to say the least, and being familiar in my immediate surroundings was immensely comforting and one less thing I had to worry about. \n\n- It might also be worth keeping in mind that you won't be able to teach at the same institution right after you get your PhD (so they aren't accused of hiring candidates based off of favoritism). If that's something you're interested in, your best bet may be to look elsewhere instead.\n\nThat's all I can really think of atm, but if you have any other questions feel free to DM me!",

Different schools have different approaches to teaching, so changing it up gets you exposure to how other people do things.\n\nThat advice definitely still holds if you're considering going internationally, since the cultural differences alone would bring a lot of new ways of thinking.\n\nHowever, what I was told was that it's not as important (though still a consideration) because the internet has homogenized academia a lot.\n\nAlso, I'm looking to get my grad degree and jump into industry so it's not as important for me to go and get that broad experience with other schools.\n\n(So I was told, at least.)",

I already have a repertoire with my professors, and already know the intricacies of the administration.\n\nThat said, many of my profs have said that if I pursue a PhD, I MUST attend another university. Evidently if one wants to stay in academia for their career, going to the same school over and over for advanced education limits your training and research skills (at least for history), and people generally just consider it gauche (again, at least for history, and at least according to my professors)\n\nETA: You should definitely follow the funding! If your UG school is already offering you funding for spring, I say go for it. You can always expand your research skills later if you\u2019re pursuing a doctorate",

      "text": "Is the grad degree in a research oriented field, and are you interested in working in academia? If your answer to both is yes then I can see why you would be concerned. In general though, I think the most important thing is still research fit, or in other words, whether the environment and resources available to you in this program will help you succeed professionally. If there are indeed people there you could learn a great deal from/want to work with, and the environment (culture, funding, etc.) is also good, then I don't really think you need to turn down the program just simply on the basis that it's the same institution you did your undergrad in. The reality is just that for many people, the program that has the best research fit and best chance of promoting their intellectual success happens to be other places other than their undergrad institution.  \nIf you're not in research or if you're not interested in academia for your future career, then I think it hardly matters. And if you're attending a highly ranked university I don't think it would matter in any scenario.",

      "text": "In general, you shouldn't do any more than 2 degrees at the same university. Bachelor's and master's, bachelor's and PhD, master's and PhD etc is okay.\n\nIf you do 3 degrees at the same university (bachelor's, master's and PhD for example), that is a sign of lack of academic diversity which is detrimental. If you want to go into academia one day, this would hurt you.\n\nSo in general, staying at the same university is okay assuming this is your 2nd degree there and not the third one. Since you are undergrad, I assume that that's your first degree and this will be your 2nd degree, so you'll be just fine! The notion you're talking about of wanting to expand and meet new people is usually with regards to your 3rd degree. 2 at the same place is fine. Bonus points if your institution gives you full funding! That's what happened to me and I couldn't say no, and for PhD application season I wasn't any less competitive than people who did each of their degrees at different places.",
