  "title:": "I don't like grad school and don't know what to do with my life",
  "text": "I started grad school a few weeks ago and am already questioning whether or not I want to continue.  I'm not sure if it's the academic environment, or the degree itself that I don't like.  For years, I thought this was the path for me.  I put in so much effort into my grad school applications and was so happy when I got accepted.  I didn't realize how intense it would be.  I have been feeling very overwhelmed with my workload, so I cut back to part time to see if I feel any different.  Nope, I still don't like it.  I struggle with depression and anxiety which has gotten worse with school.  I chose to study in a helping profession because I want to help people.  I don't know if I want to go into debt for something I'm not sure about and something that's causing me tons of anxiety, yet I have no idea what I want to do with my life.  I am almost 36 and have no idea where my life is going.  I feel lost.  The school seems to be trying to persuade me to stay.  Even though I have already expressed my reluctance to continue, they keep telling me it's normal.  I think it comes down to not enjoying the material.  My dilemma is whether I should take a leave of absence now (before I get into student loan debt) or keep going and see if I feel differently in a few months.  My gut is telling me this isn't the program for me, yet I'm scared of missing out on an opportunity towards a successful career.  I'm just not sure what my next steps are.  I do know I prefer online studying that allows some flexibility, but my state doesn't offer any in my field of interest.  II didn't go to class today to think things through.  I feel very lost and worthless.",

      "text": "Sorry you feel like that, please speak to a mental health professional on campus, or your department graduate co-ordinator or PI. If you have to quit, do so early. There is no shame in quitting. The publish or perish culture has turned academia into a predatory institution that preys on students' creativity, dreams and hard work. Hope you feel better soon.",

You sound like a really kind and empathetic person from this brief post. Grad school is so hard! You\u2019ve done so well to get accepted. Please have faith. I believe in you!
