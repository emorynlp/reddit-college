  "text": "So, long story short, I am a full time research staffer who has formed a nice friendship with a graduate student in my lab, but last week we went for drinks and realized we may be a little more than friends. We haven\u2019t actually done anything, we\u2019re the same age and really not in any sort of position of authority over one another, but it\u2019s still a sticky situation. In reality, I think we\u2019ll just continue to foster a little crush but not make any moves. It had me thinking, I\u2019m sure this sort of situation isn\u2019t too uncommon within labs or cohorts, so has anyone here dealt with something similar?",

      "text": "The question is essentially, \u201cCan I date my coworker?\u201d\n\nThe answer is it depends. If you guys started dating, you would have to be VERY careful to keep work at work and home at home. This can be especially difficult if you guys are working closely every day. \n\nIt\u2019s about boundaries. Have them. Work on them. Establish them. But other than that, if you are getting your work done and it\u2019s not interfering with the workplace i don\u2019t see a problem.",

      "text": "It can happen and I\u2019ve seen it a lot at my school across a few departments. Most ended up being fine. Boundaries were made and most chose not to disclose their relationships to the lab members. They didn\u2019t change their work habits and 100% of the time everyone else was clueless until graduation or some big announcement like engagement or pregnancy.  PI\u2019s were usually last to know lol.  The only time I saw this kind of relationship end badly was when there was a breakup and one or both started being super immature and petty.",
