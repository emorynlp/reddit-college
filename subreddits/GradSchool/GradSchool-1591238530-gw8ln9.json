Well then, at 12:10 a severe thunderstorm rolls in, drops a tree in our yard and kills the power. At 12:45, I gave up hope and called my advisor to let her know. \n\nWe pushed the defense back an hour in case the power came back on but it didn\u2019t seem like it was happening any time soon. Couldn\u2019t go to a library or coffee shop due to Covid and power being out in multiple counties. My mom is a dental hygienist and got permission from her boss to go to his (closed) office to defend. On the way, we see that an office my mom used to work at had power and the doctor was there, so my mom runs in to see if we could do it there, since it was much closer than the other office. \n\nLong story short, I defended my Communication masters thesis in a dental exam room, an hour later than scheduled, but I passed!! And I\u2019m sure I gave my committee quite a story to tell. My committee was very complimentary and it really meant a lot. I have a great team behind me. \n\nAlso the power didn\u2019t come on until 10pm, so it was good we went!", "author": "snakesareracist", "created": 1591238530, "retrieved": 1632845196, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 829, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fswyk3h": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gw8ln9/completed_my_defense_in_a_very_strange_location/fswyk3h/", "text": "Not as dramatic, but my home Wi-Fi was up and down at unpredictable intervals.
