  "text": "I\u2019m in the second year of my PhD and I feel like the respect I\u2019ve had for my advisor is gone. I\u2019m exhausted of always being around his arrogance and how little it seems like he cares about not only me, but some of the other students who are working in his lab. I feel like this has caused me to lose some focus in my research and school. I like what I\u2019m doing and only have a year and a half left so I\u2019m committed to finishing this. I am curious if anyone else has dealt with this before and what you have done to help yourself out.",
