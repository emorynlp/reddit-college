  "text": "I'm in my second semester (notoriously the semester that weeds people out) of my occupational therapy doctorate (professional doctorate, not PHD, so many young, inexperienced classmates). We engage in so much group work that we are really starting to get an idea of everyone's work ethic. \n\nMy question is, what is a productive way to handle peers that chronically take the backseat during group work? I'm talking beyond just struggling with the material. I am totally willing to offer a hand to those who are struggling, but I am frustrated with my peers who keep getting away with just not contributing. I am not willing to let my grades suffer so I find myself picking up the slack often, even in practical applications.\n\nIs this something to be addressed or should I just suck it up and continue to earn my grade? I know my professors are somewhat aware of these students but we haven't discussed how to handle this dynamic at this level.\n\nI appreciate honest answers :)",

      "text": "I think it depends on what the project is, but when I have to do group projects I've found it helpful to get together to agree on specific tasks and deadlines and check in closer to the deadline to see how everything is going and if they \"need help\". If they haven't done it by the agreed upon deadline, I usually check in with the other members and would let the slacker know that if they don't contribute we don't feel comfortable putting their name on it since that would be plagiarism.\n\nFor presentations, I usually just stick the person's name on the slide they contributed to, or have different people present different sections. If someone didn't do their section, the rest of us would do it and leave their name off the presentation.\n\nUnfortunately, we often have to pick up the slack of people who don't contribute, whether that is in graduate school, as a professor, or elsewhere, because deadlines are deadlines. However, I have no issue giving a heads up to whoever is grading the assignment that Lazy McSnorehead didn't contribute so the rest of us left them off the assignment.\n\nEdited to add: Some people have *radically* different work schedules, so sometimes it can seem like a person is not doing anything when they just haven't had time to get to it yet. I have definitely been in positions where I've had to do something but wasn't able to get to it until the weekend, so this is why I like to check in to see if people need help. I always communicate with project members and won't commit to something like a deadline unless I'm confident I'm able to make it, but others don't always do that. Some may very well wait until the last minute, so this is why communication is important.",
