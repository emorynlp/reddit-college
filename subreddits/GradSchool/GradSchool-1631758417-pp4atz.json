The funeral happened during the first week of school. I'm (so far) managing to get through all the work but have been experiencing bouts of nausea, which I think are related to the grief/anxiety/stress of burying my grandpa and starting grad school concurrently. Is it worth letting my professors know, even if I'm not looking for academic concessions? Since I'm not actually asking for anything, it feels weird? I don't want to give the perception to the professors that I'm looking for pity, if that makes sense.\n\nThanks in advance for the advice.", "author": "intelligentsiastic", "created": 1631758417, "retrieved": 1632952553, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hd4u3zk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pp4atz/should_i_inform_my_professors_about_a_death_in/hd4u3zk/", "text": "Yes you should.

My uncle died suddenly last September and I'm not a very outwardly emotional person. I didn't tell anyone other than the admin that manages the TAs to let me take a sick day to attend the funeral. I honestly should have. It would've helped me greatly if I knew that I could ask them for help while I struggled through their class while still grieving and processing. I was also a TA who had multiple students notify me of deaths in their family.  What I tried is to allow them to go through the class at what they could do, and give as much time as possible for them to complete assignments. Having to bury a loved one and attend coursework is very stressful, and it negatively affects your health and may reflect on your grades.\n\nIf the nausea and stress gets too much for you to handle your classes, please let your professors know. They know their class and can better assist you while you process your grief and stress.", "author": "datdestructor", "created": 1631785157, "upvotes": 3}, "hd1sjpo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pp4atz/should_i_inform_my_professors_about_a_death_in/hd1sjpo/", "text": "Let them know. Grief is a weird thing and comes when you least expect it. You may be \"ok\" now, but may unexpectedly need time off or just an extra day to hand in that paper or you may need nothing at all. I used to sit on a committee where students with academic issues were reviewed. I would say 90% of the time, the academic issue was due to some external \"life issue\" and not that the student just didn't \"get\" the material. The committee usually wanted to know if the student had reached out for help prior to it escalating to the committee. I was a non-voting member, but I always wanted students to know that there were resources available to them (ie. therapy, grief counseling, leave of absence, etc.) even if they didn't feel like they needed it in that exact moment. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.
