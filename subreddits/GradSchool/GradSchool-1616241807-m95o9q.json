I also try to work out early in the morning before heading to the lab.\n\nJust curious how everyone else does it.", "author": "Seankala", "created": 1616241807, "retrieved": 1632954462, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 281, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"grnrmpg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/m95o9q/for_those_of_you_who_work_out_regularly_how_do/grnrmpg/", "text": "Just my experience but:\n\nUntil the pandemic changed my routine, I regularly did about 3hrs of powerlifting a day 5-6 days a week following the Hybrid Performance Method. The most important thing I did was make my fitness a major priority in my life. I would work pretty hard to either A) get out of the office before 5pm or B) plan around days where I needed to work late and either go early or take that day as a rest day. Depending on the nature of the social event sometimes it was also early enough that I could be at the gym by 6pm, although that was not typically ideal. For me I'm best in the gym between about 4pm-5pm. So what I did was make sure I got into the office early enough to get all my work done and then as soon as I'd finished my reading or writing for the day, I would head over to the gym. I kept a gym bag, my lifting belt and shoes, and everything else I needed in my car so it was just a short walk over to the campus weight room. \n\nKeeping that schedule was a \\*major\\* factor in my fitness success (and thus why the pandemic has totally torpedoed everything I was doing). My other 'key' to success was to realize that I was never going to be a competitive lifter, or a body builder, or the hottest guy there. And thats a hard mindset to break. But once I realized that I was the only measure of my own success, I accepted that having lazy days, taking extra time off, missing my lifts, and falling off the program wasnt the end of the world. I progressed pretty well in the two years before pandemic, so for me as long as I was satisfied I didnt get caught up every time I faltered. I recognized that very often my school/life stress would creep into my gym performance and I accepted that. Again I also managed my program periodization around this. My schedule had me shoot for a personal record (a max weight lift attempt) every 6 weeks, and that week the physical stress would often overwhelm my ability to do work. So with a little planning I was often able to place those high strain periods in between major assignments and due dates. I even eventually used the long-term glow from my 'heavy days' as fuel to get through finals and my comps exams. \n\nBut sometimes its really hard. Its hard to get on schedule, to stay on schedule, and to keep work and recreation separate. Its really hard to turn down beers with the cohort to go to the gym and I sacrificed a lot of socialization to do it. Sometimes I pushed my workouts too hard and fucked up some stuff because I simply was too burnt out to do my work. And sometimes I canceled workouts to get shit done and stay on top of my work. But ultimately with fitness, there is always an excuse that will get in the way, always a damn good reason not to go and work out. If you arnt willing to \\*carve time out\\* you wont do it. For a long time I didnt. And then one day I realized I'd probably burn out if I didnt become more active and do that for myself.

It doesn't really matter what/how you workout if you don't do it regularly.\n\nFind a program that you fancy (personally, I do body weight workouts that run between 20-45 mins a session), and force yourself to follow it. The first 10-14 days or so will be super tough, as you'll give yourself a bunch of excuses not to do it, but if you can tough it out and get over that initial hump, then every day after you'll almost feel weird if you don't. Once you get to the point where you don't think, you just do, then your mind is freed up to do other things, and you'll notice it doesn't really inconvenience your schedule anymore.\n\nSome tips that I find helpful: working out for hours a day might work for some, but if you're just tryna stay healthy/keep fit, a good circuit that runs at most an hour should be more than enough.

Weekends, involved a very early morning Saturday workout and studying for 12+ hours with walking breaks outside cold or not. I also worked out at home!
