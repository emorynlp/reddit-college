  "text": "I'm a third year PhD and very happy where I'm at. I don't often take it for granted, but today found out we average 800 applications a year for our program, which on average only accepts 20 people.  I was just acutely more appreciative of my circumstances. Independent of what gets rejected from what journal, or who doesn't like your model, or even what you get done this week, it's a nice reminder that you accomplished a lot just by being here. Also, as someone for whom the third time was the charm, not getting in is not an indication of value.",

I was just a  known entity and good enough that it was easier to give me the position than shuffling through applicants to find someone better.",
