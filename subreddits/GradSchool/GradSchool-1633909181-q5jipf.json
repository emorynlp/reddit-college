  "text": "I'm a first semester master's student and, while I'm doing alright in my classes, my mental health has been progressively getting worse and worse to where doing any work and focusing feels very hard. Most of my issues, in large part, stem from having met literally no one in grad school and having no idea where to start (my campus is in a bit of an isolated spot and by a hospital, we don't have much nearby), but that's besides the point. I'm worried that if I continue to slip I might just fail my classes this semester and completely screw myself over in the future. I'm also worried about taking any kind of break because the data I'm working with and my advisor are on very tight schedules so it's possible I'd have to be dropped from the projects if I took a break. I'm really confused what to do and wonder if you guys have any advice or wisdom to offer?",

      "text": "3rd sem masters student here - go talk to a professional.  Seriously.  There is no shame.  If you're struggling in math you go to tutoring, and if you're struggling with mental health go to a therapist.  In undergrad I was on scholarship probation and I had to talk to my scholarship advisor - looking back that was therapy lite.  I made game plans, took easier classes and brought my grades up.  This time around I have an actual therapist, and a game plan - just talking about my problems makes all the difference.  Also to note, your therapist is going to have a phd - they're going to understand quite literally what you're going through.",
