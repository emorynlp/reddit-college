Yes a lot. I had to stay up all night on weekend to fix problems in the codes and write up reports then make the slides for presentation. Turned out we were still the lowest scored group. \nI got a B+ for the course in the end.\n\nAll I leaned was to look for the best group while I could. \n\nGood luck!",

I didn't specifically say what i wanted to speak about, just that it was about the group and the subpar grade we got on the presentation because they didn't know what the fuck they were talking about during it and it was obvious. But then she comes back with \"oh well your whole team should be part of this meeting!\" I mean wtf. So I told her I would try to work it out between them and me.\n\n>D) Scorched Earth: prepare for any and all presentations on your own, but don't actually tell them or act like you're giving them until the day of when they stand up there and say \"oh we didn't do it.\" Then you might look awesome, but possibly at the cost of department politics.\n\nI have started to work on the full paper. They've given me no choice. It's due on Friday and what they wrote is obvious BS-ing. I posted some on google docs but yeah i\n\nI have never had this experience in grad school--I attended a program before this and had a great experience working in teams. I am so pissed right now because due to a series of very unfortunate events involving me getting covid, having to wait to see the doctor(S!), etc., I am sitting at a high C.
