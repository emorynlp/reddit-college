I passed! The closed door exam was brutal, but I made it through!\n\nI handed in my thesis three weeks ago and I'm defending tomorrow at 9am. I have two young children at home right now, so I haven't been able to study at all. I still need to change a few slides and I need to read through my thesis before I go to sleep tonight. I'm worried that I won't pass, and everyone around me telling me that I shouldn't be worried is not helping. I have a tough committee of 6 experts in my field and I really wanted to read their latest papers before my defense. Is there anything I can do at this point? I have to watch my kids all day, they don't go to bed until 9/10. I can pull an all nighter, but then I may be a zombie tomorrow. Any last minute advice?
