  "text": "Every now and then I see people here that are in dire need of reference managers without knowing they exist. It's been the same in my MA classes too, I'd been using them since undergrad days, but for some of my cohort, I introduced them. So I guess, at least in some disciplines, these software are a bit nice at least in grad school.\n\nA reference manager does a few things:\n\n- Organises your papers and books, and their relevant files (PDF, epub, .zip, code, etc.)\n- Organises relevant metadata\n- Helps you cite these in your papers and theses\n- Generates the bibliography automatically\n- Imports references from web, with associated PDF if possible\n- Allows you to edit, search (metadata & PDFs), sort, organise etc. these references\n- Import PDFs from your file system and for most of them, find their related metadata automatically\n- Work with Microsoft Ofice or LibreOffice to easily add citations (IDK if it works with Pages on Apple)\n- Can export to bibtex / biblatex (see [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) extension too) to use it with LaTeX\n- ...\n\nMy goto recommendation is https://www.zotero.org/ because Zotero is totally free and open source, and is not tied to any disgusting companies like Elsevier or some shady data analytics company. I also haven't tried others myself, so that's another reason not to recommend for me.\n\nGo to the website, download the app and download the extension for your browser and for your office suite of choice, Microsoft or LibreOffice. Or, if you want another one, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software and find the best fit for you. You'll thank yourself later.\n\nAnother piece of software I wish to plug that is made by the same folk as Zotero AFAICT is Tropy, which is a manager for research photos: <https://tropy.org/>. I don't have much use for this myself, more useful to historians, archeologists, etc. probably. I wanted to mention it nevertheless tho as it's somewhat obscure.\n\nEdit: If you have any questions regarding Zotero, I have been using it for a few years, so feel free to ask, I might be helpful. I didn't text other stuff, so I wouldn't know, but chances are someone reading the thread would.",

          "text": "So in Zotero every item is essentially bunch of \"metadata\" plus some associated files. Metadata is information like title, authors, editors, publication year, place, journal etc. You can have metadata alone as an item in Zotero, or you can associate it with some file. E.g., if you added a journal article without a PDF, it'd appear in Zotero as an item, with all it's associated metadata. You can then assign to this a PDF file as well.\n\nWhen writing your work, you can then use this database through your word processor (or other authoring tools) to add citations from the database. Zotero will then automatically append to a location you select the sufficient bibliography, generated based on the metadata you add.\n\nSorry if that's just word soup, but this 7 minute video is a nice demo of the basic workflow with Zotero: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqFiCj1XV-E",

This is especially great for git and collaboration as you can add references as you go and even your coworkers can open and edit it as usual.  \n\nWhat I also think is cool is, that you can have a your tex files automatically scanned for citations of references. So you can just look up in your Jabref at what parts of your document exactly you cited a certain article and the like.  \nAlso, you can work with your whole database while writing and just export the ones you actually cited as a separate file at the end.  \n\nA feature I discovered recently is that it can read PDF annotations. I marked some text in a PDF I linked with an entry and the marked text showed up in Jabref! So you don't even have to open the PDF to reread the parts you thought are important. (Little caveat here, if the PDF text isn't properly set up, e.g. scanned documents with automatic text recognition or math formulas, it will not work. But that's a problem with the PDF, not Jabref).",

Thanks for sharing! I've looked into JabRef before but opted for Zotero because JabRef IIRC is a Java app (had a junk computer back then that'd choke on it) and it was a bit unwieldy for me when I tried it. Some of those features you can get through ZotFile and Better BibTeX, but the cited one I guess I'll need to write a script for it in my case (I have one big \"All\" collection and a couple others like \"software\", \"gender\", \"statistics\" that aren't my main focus but distinct enough topics to mark as a distinct subset).\n\nIn any case it's just great that we have _multiple_ great open source reference managers! They don't need to compete like sharks' babies in a sharks womb, and we get to pick and choose the best for each of us. And because they're FOSS, they're \"buy it for life\" apps.",

I'm in New Zealand and they even have the New Zealand Law Style Guide, which other reference managers didn't have when I needed it.\n\n2) So easy for collaborating, you just create groups for each project and share them using Zotero online. Endnote is a nightmare for that!!!!! Can not stress that enough. \n\n3) All your references are always synced if you set up the free online account, so nothing gets lost if something happens to your device, nothing gets corrupted etc. You can download zotero, log in and and open up your database on any computer in the space of like 2 mins.\n\nI don't use it for pdfs, but after years of using it for my own research and paid work as a research assistant I do now pay $20 per annum for extra storage for all those references.\n\nThanks for the tip on Trophy, never heard of it but will come in useful, starting an arts-informed project at the moment.",

E.g. Adobe is opened and what I use to highlight when I click a Zotero entry bc that's my .pdf viewer. \n\nThey have more space available, for a price, but also link to dropbox, I think. Also, all their files are saved under a single directory, so, you can always back it up to an external drive. I believe the library size is unlimited though?

It does come with the ability to use another folder as your sync directory, like Dropbox or something, freeing you from any online storage restrictions (eg I use my work network drive for unlimited storage). Also the open source nature lends itself to lots of plugins; those are a nice perk as well. Plus, portable installs!\n\nSorry again if you thought the fuck off was meant for you.

They can very easily fail at dealing with many small files, create duplicates, mess up changes, etc.\n\nA simple way to do online backups separately from sync is [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/). It's open source and it'll back up an encrypted, deduplicated archive of your files to wherever you choose. I have my most important stuff backed up for free on the 15G free space on Drive. I also have local backups using [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/). Duplicati is automatic, but limited to more important stuff. Borg is for all my files, and I run it once manually every day or so.",

      "text": "I have a question about Zotero that makes using it very confusing for me. It seems like it duplicates all of my PDFs in its own directory. I'd rather have all my PDFs in one place rather than different versions floating around, and I want to be able to annotate my PDFs on my computer and on a tablet. However Zotero seems to save all of the PDF files in a coded way that makes them impossible to find unless I open them with Zotero, which doesn't work on my tablet. What can I do about this? I really don't want to have separate PDFs, one that's annotated and one that's in Zotero, since it uses twice the storage space and is harder to manage. But I really want to be able to highlight and take notes directly on documents and have these notes be accessible through Zotero as well. Am I missing something? Any workarounds?",

It can be set up so that once a new document is added (or on demand) it gets renamed to a human-readable format (of your choosing) and moved to a preset directory of your choosing. This way you can easily edit with whatever software you want and can store your files in a Dropbox or similar folder to access and edit on your other devices.\nThe only tricky bit is if you want to use Zotero on multiple devices, because your reference information will sync with Zotero\u2019s service but not the files.",

By using the Zotero browser extension, you can save the .pdf directly to where Zotero would put it vs dragging it in from another folder and having Zotero duplicate it. Finding the physical file is then just a right click away. At this point, I really only download papers from Sci-hub separately from the Zotero extension.\n\nThis doesn't work so well for textbooks or other documents. I'm also going to be having a look at Zotfile, mentioned in the other reply",
