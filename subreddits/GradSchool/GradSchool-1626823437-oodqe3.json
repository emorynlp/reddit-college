It's been the same in my MA classes too, I'd been using them since undergrad days, but for some of my cohort, I introduced them. So I guess, at least in some disciplines, these software are a bit nice at least in grad school.\n\nA reference manager does a few things:\n\n- Organises your papers and books, and their relevant files (PDF, epub, .zip, code, etc.)\n- Organises relevant metadata\n- Helps you cite these in your papers and theses\n- Generates the bibliography automatically\n- Imports references from web, with associated PDF if possible\n- Allows you to edit, search (metadata & PDFs), sort, organise etc. these references\n- Import PDFs from your file system and for most of them, find their related metadata automatically\n- Work with Microsoft Ofice or LibreOffice to easily add citations (IDK if it works with Pages on Apple)\n- Can export to bibtex / biblatex (see [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) extension too) to use it with LaTeX\n- ...\n\nMy goto recommendation is https://www.zotero.org/ because Zotero is totally free and open source, and is not tied to any disgusting companies like Elsevier or some shady data analytics company. I also haven't tried others myself, so that's another reason not to recommend for me.\n\nGo to the website, download the app and download the extension for your browser and for your office suite of choice, Microsoft or LibreOffice. Or, if you want another one, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software and find the best fit for you. You'll thank yourself later.\n\nAnother piece of software I wish to plug that is made by the same folk as Zotero AFAICT is Tropy, which is a manager for research photos: <https://tropy.org/>. I don't have much use for this myself, more useful to historians, archeologists, etc. probably. I wanted to mention it nevertheless tho as it's somewhat obscure.\n\nEdit: If you have any questions regarding Zotero, I have been using it for a few years, so feel free to ask, I might be helpful.

This is especially great for git and collaboration as you can add references as you go and even your coworkers can open and edit it as usual.  \n\nWhat I also think is cool is, that you can have a your tex files automatically scanned for citations of references. So you can just look up in your Jabref at what parts of your document exactly you cited a certain article and the like.  \nAlso, you can work with your whole database while writing and just export the ones you actually cited as a separate file at the end.  \n\nA feature I discovered recently is that it can read PDF annotations. I marked some text in a PDF I linked with an entry and the marked text showed up in Jabref! So you don't even have to open the PDF to reread the parts you thought are important. (Little caveat here, if the PDF text isn't properly set up, e.g. scanned documents with automatic text recognition or math formulas, it will not work.
