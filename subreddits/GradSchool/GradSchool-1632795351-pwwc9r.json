I\u2019m looking to go to grad school to get my masters in healthcare administration! I\u2019m so excited!! But I was wondering.. \n\nIs there any particular accreditation or experiences or curriculum? I have my eyes on a few programs but I don\u2019t know what would look better.

Is one accreditation better than the other?", "author": "Dreamfinder_figjk", "created": 1632795351, "retrieved": 1632951983, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
