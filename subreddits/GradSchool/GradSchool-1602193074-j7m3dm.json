You are not that guy, proven by just posting the question. \n\nSo consider these scenarios. Choose one that fits you best:\n\n>> You are writing to please a complete A-hole, or A-hole committee. If so, you are writing for an Audience of One.  You need their approval to pass --> launch career. So be practical--> pull THEIR journal articles and see how they constructed their arguments. Writers learn to write by literally copying other writers. (do not read \"plaigarize,\")\n\nEgomaniacs love to be mirrored. If their research is on the tse-tse fly and yours is on orangutangs, (forgive example) take their paper and your research  and (as a draft) literally drop \"orangutang\" in for \"tse-tse fly,\" obviously changing other details. \n\nThe point is, these guys stand between you and the Rest of Life. So you have to Maguyver your way through the hoops. Do not make this your Opus - you have years ahead to do that. \n\n-->> If your committee/ primary are not A-holes and you have a legit shot at getting support for your original thesis, then take your favorite academic's papers and do as above, structure accordingly.

(I already know what I want to do for my thesis, so over the years I have been collecting information amd getting to know my topic and wrote an essay on the topic in undergrad. I already feel dumb about it when I see expert opinions on the subject.) I get crazy imposter syndrome. I still sit back and have no idea how I completed my BA and how I got reasonably good grades (A- avg). I am doing a post grad transitional certificate into another dept at the moment. which consists of 6 3rd year undergrad papers and I STILL get crazy imposter syndrome even though right now I am an A+ student in both of my papers this sem. I ALWAYS sit there and wonder how the F this is happening. I can'y do stats but right now I am on an A+ avg in stats with two assignments left for the sem. Like I feel like any moment now the lecturers will realise I am struggling too much and I am just winging it and they will fail me. I get Archaeologists coming to me now occasionally for advice on the topic area I will be doing for my MA thesis when I get there and i'm like what nooo, surely you know more than me... I did my BA in Sociology and Philosophy and I did two 2nd year Anthropology/Archaeology papers during my undergrad with spare points and got A's for both (weird as heck) and so now I am jumping into the Anthro/Archaeo dept to do PG in Anthro and Archaeo. and I have This cert to do then Hons then MA. But Somehow people still think I write good and they like my ideas and stuff. To me in my head I am still that kid from a shitty upbringing who was in foster care a lot and I left school at 16 and only came back as an adult because I like learning. I never actually expected this far. BA was my big goal and it took me many years due to bad health (so I only do 1-2 papers a sem), I have had to repeat whole years due to my health (I have never failed a paper during my BA, I have just had lots of medical withdraws which dont go onto my academic transcript). But when I asked Anthro dept if they would let me do a PG cert into Anthro, they really really wanted me. It really surprised me. I thought taking a long time to do my BA would count against me. They even shortened the cert for me to 6 papers (everyone else has to do at least 8) because of my good grades in the two 2nd year papers I did with no 1st year Anthro experience. and here I am. I still don't know why they picked me and decided I could do this. I still don't know how I am doing this. I study non-stop and study 7 days a week between sort of 6-14hrs a day and I am very worried it won't be enough to get me through all 6 papers. So my anxiety is always through the roof, but here I am! Many of them in the dept love the undergrad essay I did that I want to turn into an MA thesis. They love the approach I want to take with it and they enjoy discussing the subject with me. I am as stumped as you are bro. But keep up the good work eh.
