  "text": "I wonder if this is a subtype of imposter syndrome or something else.\n\nWhat I imagine is somebody reading my thesis with an increasingly quizzical expression until finally they look up and say, \"You really think you're onto something here? Well, it's not profound at all. It's just a lot of mad rambling. You're taking lots of individually obvious things, smashing them together, and exaggerating the urgency of what you're supposedly pointing out. It's fanciful and ridiculous. Maybe you actually think you're expressing worries, but god it just sounds so phony. The whole thing is just one big, convoluted, virtue-signalling, pseudo-intellectual monument to your own arrogance. It's the opposite of valuable work. If it gets accepted, it will only be because they want to graduate you to get you the hell on with your life and away from where they'll ever have to bother with this again.\"\n\nThe people in my program are all way too nice to say anything remotely like that, but I worry that that's what they'll think.\n\nHow common is this particular insecurity?\n\n----\n\nEdit: Flairing this as \"Health & Work/Life Balance\" because I think that covers insecurity, mental health, imposter syndrome, etc. but feel free to change it.",

      "text": "Top of mind: Approach to academic writing is full if conflict: we want to emulate other profs, we want to please our Primary, everything is riding on this because its our future; financial worries currently; plus (fill in blank) any other BatshitCrazyThing threatening our existence that day. \n\nPoint: One would be mentally unwell if they didnt have this internal angst. (Esp. today 10/9/20)\n\nPlus face it, some academics are egomaniacal bullsh*tters for 35 years, causing students to throw selves off cliff. You are not that guy, proven by just posting the question. \n\nSo consider these scenarios. Choose one that fits you best:\n\n>> You are writing to please a complete A-hole, or A-hole committee. If so, you are writing for an Audience of One.  You need their approval to pass --> launch career. So be practical--> pull THEIR journal articles and see how they constructed their arguments. Writers learn to write by literally copying other writers. (do not read \"plaigarize,\")\n\nEgomaniacs love to be mirrored. If their research is on the tse-tse fly and yours is on orangutangs, (forgive example) take their paper and your research  and (as a draft) literally drop \"orangutang\" in for \"tse-tse fly,\" obviously changing other details. \n\nThe point is, these guys stand between you and the Rest of Life. So you have to Maguyver your way through the hoops. Do not make this your Opus - you have years ahead to do that. \n\n-->> If your committee/ primary are not A-holes and you have a legit shot at getting support for your original thesis, then take your favorite academic's papers and do as above, structure accordingly. For me, I have to map it out visually (Venn Diagram, etc)  and then write it. \n\nKEY POINT-  **Many academics cannot write a document that makes sense. You can be better.** I got this from University of Chicago writing center, link below. It's over an hour but *if you are having trouble writing thesis, FIND TIME TO LISTEN.* \n\nHe's very lively, and he's got the writing solution, hands down. \n \nhttps://youtu.be/vtIzMaLkCaM",

      "text": "I am not even up to my MA yet and I feel that way! (I already know what I want to do for my thesis, so over the years I have been collecting information amd getting to know my topic and wrote an essay on the topic in undergrad. I already feel dumb about it when I see expert opinions on the subject.) I get crazy imposter syndrome. I still sit back and have no idea how I completed my BA and how I got reasonably good grades (A- avg). I am doing a post grad transitional certificate into another dept at the moment. which consists of 6 3rd year undergrad papers and I STILL get crazy imposter syndrome even though right now I am an A+ student in both of my papers this sem. I ALWAYS sit there and wonder how the F this is happening. I can'y do stats but right now I am on an A+ avg in stats with two assignments left for the sem. Like I feel like any moment now the lecturers will realise I am struggling too much and I am just winging it and they will fail me. I get Archaeologists coming to me now occasionally for advice on the topic area I will be doing for my MA thesis when I get there and i'm like what nooo, surely you know more than me... I did my BA in Sociology and Philosophy and I did two 2nd year Anthropology/Archaeology papers during my undergrad with spare points and got A's for both (weird as heck) and so now I am jumping into the Anthro/Archaeo dept to do PG in Anthro and Archaeo. and I have This cert to do then Hons then MA. But Somehow people still think I write good and they like my ideas and stuff. To me in my head I am still that kid from a shitty upbringing who was in foster care a lot and I left school at 16 and only came back as an adult because I like learning. I never actually expected this far. BA was my big goal and it took me many years due to bad health (so I only do 1-2 papers a sem), I have had to repeat whole years due to my health (I have never failed a paper during my BA, I have just had lots of medical withdraws which dont go onto my academic transcript). But when I asked Anthro dept if they would let me do a PG cert into Anthro, they really really wanted me. It really surprised me. I thought taking a long time to do my BA would count against me. They even shortened the cert for me to 6 papers (everyone else has to do at least 8) because of my good grades in the two 2nd year papers I did with no 1st year Anthro experience. and here I am. I still don't know why they picked me and decided I could do this. I still don't know how I am doing this. I study non-stop and study 7 days a week between sort of 6-14hrs a day and I am very worried it won't be enough to get me through all 6 papers. So my anxiety is always through the roof, but here I am! Many of them in the dept love the undergrad essay I did that I want to turn into an MA thesis. They love the approach I want to take with it and they enjoy discussing the subject with me. I am as stumped as you are bro. But keep up the good work eh. Go hard. and as we say in New Zealand Kia Kaha! (stay strong). You got this. If I somehow got this, then so do you!",

          "text": "I feel like we, meaning society as a whole, are pressured into thinking that everything should be taken at face value. Intentional coordination and subtext do not exist. It is a strange mindset to force on people who naturally get by every single day by coordinating their actions to reach specific goals. Of course structures larger than us must coordinate in this way too? This should not be surprising or panned as a whacky \"conspiracy theory\". \n\nI got the tinfoil hat feeling just from typing that.",

I'm honored that ppl trusted me to read and edit for them bc it's such an important document. \n\nAre there mistakes that I helped correct? Absolutely, that was my job. But it was mostly grammar and chopping run-ons into shorter pieces. For the majority, I learned so much from reading these. The literature reviews were essential to understanding the experimental chapters and final discussions on future directions of the work.\n\nIt's lot of work and I've seen the utter exhaustion that people can feel afterwards but I hope you will be proud of the final product. Good luck!",

          "text": "I think what didn't help is that I was close with several of my professors. Extremely nice, supportive people. But I became close enough that they sometimes confided in me when they felt like some students in other years weren't doing well with their thesis. For example, one professor felt that a student's topic wasn't promising and that another student wasn't doing a good job exploring their position from more than one perspective. Another professor confided me after he retired that he was so happy to not have to deal with students or read student papers anymore. Things like that. Things I'd be mortified about if it was about my thesis or me.\n\nLike, I'm happy that to be close enough that they felt like they could confide those things to me. At the time, it made me as though they were treating me as a peer, which gave me confidence. But now, I just wonder if they might be disappointed when they see my thesis and end up saying/thinking those kind of things about my thesis or me.\n\nI used to feel so much more confident. I finished my credits early! I got to work at NASA as part of my thesis! But toward the end of that, I got _super_ sick and ended up needing to go back home so my parents could take care of me during 5 years of treatment. The professors have all been supportive, but the last time they saw me or my work, I was a promising grad student in their eyes. But I've had this long nightmare since then. I've had to retrain my brain to read! How can my writing _not_ shock and disappoint them? How can they _not_ compare what I submit to what they remember? They know about my medical situation, but how can they _not_ expect my thesis to be \"5 years of work\" good?\n\nWhen I think about my _topic,_ I feel like it's important and that I can be proud of it. But when I think of it as a _thesis,_ I think about how much worse my writing and thinking must be after so many years of just mentally and physically atrophying in a bed. Ugh.\n\nNot sure why I'm venting so many details to you, but there it is. Maybe it's just good to write it all out. In any case, thank you for reading.",

It\u2019s unkind that they told you about your fellow students, it\u2019s unkind that they treated you like their personal diaries, and it\u2019s unkind for them to be so selfish and not realize the degree of cruelty their actions have.\n\nIt is never okay for a professor to discuss one student\u2019s work with another behind their back. That\u2019s not only unprofessional but a breach in trust. Your fears and concerns are 100% valid. I wouldn\u2019t trust your professors at all.\n\nThat being said, I have faith in your work. You have passion, you have experience, and you have done the work! Getting sick, having an illness, and recovering from it to return to this work is a gigantic feat in itself! If they hold that against you, they\u2019re shitty people imo. You have put so much into this and your every emotion is valid. I just hope you realize as you work, that you are capable and that your work is good. You\u2019re stronger and smarter than you think.",
