This is the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/6fahhf/starting\\_a\\_phd\\_thousands\\_of\\_miles\\_away\\_from\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/6fahhf/starting_a_phd_thousands_of_miles_away_from_your/)\n\nIn case someone else is in the same situation I was, I will let you know how it turned out. \n\nOne day in July 2017 or so, I felt I couldn't handle it anymore and I emailed my advisor from the E.R. while I was waiting to see what was going to happen with my mom, whom we had had to rush to the hospital for complications with her symptoms. I had read all the rules and was pretty sure, as you can see in my comments on the original thread, that deferring was not an option. However, my advisor told me I was going to defer my admission, and dealt with the Department and almost everything else for me. The Graduate School was incredibly nice to me, and told me not to worry; they would just send me an official letter I had to sign, and in the next round of admissions they would send me a new admissions package. My mom was very upset I didn't go off to school, but I got to spend her last six months of life with her. She passed away in December 2017.\n\nThe University delivered, and I'm currently in my second month of my PhD program. I didn't even have problems when I applied for my brand new visa even though I had to have the previous one cancelled. \n\nI'm now in the process of getting a therapist to deal with my grief. I'm not going to lie, studying while mourning your mother in a place where you don't really know anyone (I'm single again, because life really likes to challenge you during the hardest times) isn't easy. Insomnia is way too common. It is difficult to focus, and I know I'm always behind in my readings. But I have hope it will get better. \n\nThank you everyone for your support a year ago, it really helped me. I hope my story helps someone else, too.", "author": "dahliazuli", "created": 1538716497, "retrieved": 1632953969, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 341, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"e78se5d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/9ljgmj/update_starting_a_phd_thousands_of_miles_away/e78se5d/", "text": "I'm sorry for your loss and just how difficult things have been. It's very heartening to hear that your advisor was willing to fight for you so you could defer for a year.  \n\nI'm dealing with a similar decision...my mom is all I have left in my family. (I'm an only child and it's been a very very bad decade and my small family is now mostly deceased). She's already had cancer ten years ago, and now she's just getting older and needing more help since she's prone to falling...meanwhile, I'm now 35, killed my career by being a caregiver for the past decade, so that I now need to go back to school to retrain, and wanting to go away to school. But how can I do that when I'm all she has??
