I\u2019m currently half way through my first rotation and I am worried that I am not doing enough or not making a good impression. I talked to a peer mentoring pod yesterday and everyone including the mentor talked about how they are/were in lab whenever they didn\u2019t have class including weekends. One guy said he is averaging 30 hours a week in lab on top of a 12 credit course load. The peer mentor even mentioned that he got 4 hours of sleep a night the first year because he was so busy. \n\nMy rotation is the complete opposite. I\u2019m in lab 3 days a week, occasional days as needed. I usually get in around 10 and finish up around 4.  I\u2019m maybe getting in 15 hours a week. Is this too little? I\u2019m getting everything done they ask me to. I\u2019ve been getting good feedback so far, but I really don\u2019t want to come off as lazy or uninterested. I am also just unsure in general what makes a good rotation student and how to convince a PI to let you join. \n\nI don\u2019t think I want to join this lab, so I\u2019m not super worried, but my next rotation is by far the one I am looking forward to the most. How do I make a good impression, and demonstrate that I am hardworking and engaged in the research? \n\nThanks!", "author": "UpYour_ButtHole", "created": 1632314082, "retrieved": 1632844066, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdwh523": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pt6ler/how_many_hours_should_i_be_spending_in_lab/hdwh523/", "text": "You don't want them thinking that you are unintersted or not able to take initiative to develop a rotation project.
