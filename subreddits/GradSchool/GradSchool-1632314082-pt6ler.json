  "title:": "How many hours should I be spending in lab rotations in the first year?",
  "text": "Hi y\u2019all,\n\nI just started my PhD in a biomedical sciences program (cell bio). I\u2019m currently half way through my first rotation and I am worried that I am not doing enough or not making a good impression. I talked to a peer mentoring pod yesterday and everyone including the mentor talked about how they are/were in lab whenever they didn\u2019t have class including weekends. One guy said he is averaging 30 hours a week in lab on top of a 12 credit course load. The peer mentor even mentioned that he got 4 hours of sleep a night the first year because he was so busy. \n\nMy rotation is the complete opposite. I\u2019m in lab 3 days a week, occasional days as needed. I usually get in around 10 and finish up around 4.  I\u2019m maybe getting in 15 hours a week. Is this too little? I\u2019m getting everything done they ask me to. I\u2019ve been getting good feedback so far, but I really don\u2019t want to come off as lazy or uninterested. I am also just unsure in general what makes a good rotation student and how to convince a PI to let you join. \n\nI don\u2019t think I want to join this lab, so I\u2019m not super worried, but my next rotation is by far the one I am looking forward to the most. How do I make a good impression, and demonstrate that I am hardworking and engaged in the research? \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I would at least go 5 days a week. The rotation is a test run for you to see if you like the lab, but is it is also for the PI to see if you are a good fit for the lab. If you don't at least show up to lab everyday, then it might appear like you are not interested in the work.\n\nMy advice for the first year is focus on the rotation much more than the classes. No one looks at grades at this stage, and it is all about doing research and getting papers",

      "text": "I generally wouldn\u2019t expect a rotation student to do more than 20 hours until maybe two months in (and that\u2019s if they pick things up). Otherwise there is not that much to do while learning. The rest of your time should be dedicated to reading, teaching, and coursework. But as others indicated, this is up to the PI. They might expect 40 hours in the lab on top of the rest of your stuff.",

It was also an umbrella program where students could rotate in 10+ departments before choosing their permanent labs. From there, department-specific coursework could be taken. So we only took ethics classes, research basics, journal clubs, etc while rotating.",
