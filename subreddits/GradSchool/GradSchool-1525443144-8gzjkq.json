  "text": "I had my master's defense yesterday. Everything was ready, I felt prepared...and one of my committee members didn't show up. Not only was he not in the room, he was several hours away because he forgot my defense was yesterday!\n\nFortunately, my advisor talked to the department chair, and I gave my defense to the two of them, and could do so on the condition that this morning I'd meet with the one who was missing and convince him I knew what I was talking about.\n\nBut now it's done! I passed, and just have edits left.",

      "text": "Program I used to work in had a prof who was terrible about that! So I advised his students to email him reminders 2 weeks our, 1 weeks out, 3 days out, every day until the defense then again the morning of. And also send his wife a reminder b/c she was the one who managed to keep him on schedule. This is the same professor who looked me right in the eye and agreed to a meeting with a seminar visitor the following day...then the following day the seminar visitor can't find him and turns out the professor fucked off to Mexico for vacation hours after we talked.\n\nOne of my committee member deliberately skipped my Master's defense b/c she was an crazy person who didn't turn in any edits to my thesis until 1 week prior to my defense, after having it for 2 months. And her edits boiled down to, \"Change everything and write something different in my esoteric field you have never cared about as opposed to your advisor's.\" I called my advisor freaked out; he said to ignore her and just come to the defense and it would be fine. She never showed for my defense b/c she was mad I refused to change stuff. My advisor just shrugged and held the exam with the other committee member, then walked me down to the absent professor's office, he stood over her to coerce her into signing my paperwork. She had the temerity to try to examine me in her office but my advisor shut her right down \\(love that man\\).",

The advice I've always gotten, and the advice I continue to give, is to always send a reminder.\n\nIf I hadn't sent a reminder to my committee, I'd never have known that one of my committee members was sick and wouldn't be in attendance. He told me to continue with the defense and we'd talk in person the following week.\n\nThis seemed sketchy, so I contacted the Dean of Graduate Studies who then informed me that this arrangement was not allowed. Every committee member had to be present unless it was arranged beforehand for one to attend remotely. Since this was the day before, we were able to work out a Skype option.\n\nIf I hadn't sent that reminder, it would have been too late to get permission from the Graduate Studies office to have them attend via Skype and the entire defense would have to have been rescheduled, which is even more annoying because the original defense date was dictated by the committee member who ended up being sick.\n\nAdditionally, my original defense date was scheduled for the first week of the semester, which meant I didn't have to pay the typical fees for that semester. With a rescheduled defense date later in the semester, that exemption would not have applied.",
