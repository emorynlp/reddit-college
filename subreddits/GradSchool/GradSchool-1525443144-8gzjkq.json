So I advised his students to email him reminders 2 weeks our, 1 weeks out, 3 days out, every day until the defense then again the morning of. And also send his wife a reminder b/c she was the one who managed to keep him on schedule. This is the same professor who looked me right in the eye and agreed to a meeting with a seminar visitor the following day...then the following day the seminar visitor can't find him and turns out the professor fucked off to Mexico for vacation hours after we talked.\n\nOne of my committee member deliberately skipped my Master's defense b/c she was an crazy person who didn't turn in any edits to my thesis until 1 week prior to my defense, after having it for 2 months. And her edits boiled down to, \"Change everything and write something different in my esoteric field you have never cared about as opposed to your advisor's.\" I called my advisor freaked out; he said to ignore her and just come to the defense and it would be fine. She never showed for my defense b/c she was mad I refused to change stuff. My advisor just shrugged and held the exam with the other committee member, then walked me down to the absent professor's office, he stood over her to coerce her into signing my paperwork. She had the temerity to try to examine me in her office but my advisor shut her right down \\(love that man\\).", "author": "gambitgrl", "created": 1525455222, "upvotes": 81}, "dyfzlnb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/8gzjkq/my_committee_member_didnt_come_to_my_defense/dyfzlnb/", "text": "Did you not send him a reminder the day before?", "author": "organiker", "created": 1525448997, "upvotes": 17}, "dyftwdt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/8gzjkq/my_committee_member_didnt_come_to_my_defense/dyftwdt/", "text": "Wow.
