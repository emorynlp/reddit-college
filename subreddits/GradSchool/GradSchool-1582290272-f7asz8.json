I lost my funding in my first year and had to find a new lab in a week. My new PI threatened to let me go on at least three occasions, including going behind my back to the DGS at one point. All because my progress was slow in a brand new field. But after all that trauma, all those dark moments, IT IS FINALLY DONE. I honestly can't even believe it yet and I'm paranoid that they're going to take it away, but it happened at long last. So for those of you who are in tough spots, it is possible to finish. You can do it!!", "author": "t1tan5", "created": 1582290272, "retrieved": 1632845291, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 604, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ficzw4n": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f7asz8/i_successfully_defended_my_dissertation/ficzw4n/", "text": "Congrats!
