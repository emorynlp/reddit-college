  "text": "Is there anyone in this community who has transitioned from a non-CS to a CS background? My bachelor's degree is in Mechanical but I am very much drawn towards CS in general. Kindly give some inputs if you have gone through a similar process. I have 1 year of professional experience in Data Science and Machine Learning. Do you have any collection of universities to list that are lenient on this?",

      "text": "I'm not under the impression (from an adjacent field) that a CS degree specifically is required for admissions to most reputable MS in CS programs, at least in the US. Rather, the usual expectation is that you have completed coursework roughly equivalent to the first two years of a CS undergrad degree (stuff like data structures, algorithms, systems, calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math). \n\nIt's likely that you've taken a good chunk of the relevant courses already. If there are gaps, these courses are widely available at community colleges and public universities, where you can usually take courses as a non-degree student.",
