Which I just learned was an essay published in the Chicago Tribune. Neat. \n\nAnyway, I think the advice that matters most, when you boil everything here down, is that comparing yourself with others is a waste of time. Focus on doing the best at what you're doing. Improving on your score alone. Doing better than you did the day before. Admire other's successes, but don't covet them. Enjoy your own achievements.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll let you know when I figure out how to actually accomplish this way of thinking. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "author": "Th3S1l3nc3", "created": 1550003808, "upvotes": 17}, "egbxn6d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/apvq6v/how_do_you_deal_with_feeling_that_youre_not_going/egbxn6d/", "text": "I remind myself why I wanted to  pursue a graduate degree (in speech language pathology) and all the lives I will impact even if I don\u2019t get fancy or flashy recognition.
