  "text": "**TL;DR:** Is it better to have 70k student loan debt and be happy with your career/the place you spend most of your time or is it better to work jobs that make you depressed and uninspired while still 30k debt?\n\nI'm 28. I've done a lot of career exploration and soul searching. I know that the field I want to go into/the life I want to have is not possible unless I have a master's degree (or potentially higher). I want to be a therapist, so there's really no way around it. If I avoid doing this, I'm going to be stuck in jobs of the same caliber that I have now (40-50k/year, uninspiring office/HR-type positions). I really don't want that and it doesn't sound like a life worth living because it causes me to feel so depressed.\n\nI'll be finishing my B.S. in psychology in May with about 30k in student loans, all federal. I don't love this, but I'm not overwhelmed by the monthly payments that this loan amount will result in. I'd be taking out loans in the same fashion for my masters. I plan to apply for a fellowship which I'm pretty sure I qualify for, that could potentially be 10-15k toward school and training, but of course there is no guarantee that I'd get it. The program itself costs 40k total, meaning I'd end up with 70k debt in the worst case scenario. This obviously sounds like a horrible idea to the vast majority of people, and I'd agree, but... what else am I supposed to do?\n\nPositives: I already have a house and a car that would be paid off by the time my loans enter repayment, so I don't really have to worry how this will impact me in regard to DTI ratio. My credit is at 750ish right now so I feel like I have a good baseline.\n\nNegatives: I have a full-time job in an unrelated field that I need to keep, and the program is primarily online, there's not opportunities for teaching assistant positions or anything like that. I don't have extra income to pay out of pocket for grad school and I can't do it part time.\n\nHow bad will my loan payments be if I end up with 70k debt? Is this really a life ruining situation?",

      "text": "I was in a somewhat similar situation as you and opted for the masters degree.\n\nI think it all comes down to what your expected income is after graduate school. If your expected income after a master's degree is going to be $50k, then $70k in debt very likely is a bad idea. If your likely income after a master's jumps up to say $120k a year, then $70k in debt to get there is a probably a very smart investment. The rule of thumb I've always heard is your total student debt should not exceed your expected annual income for your first year out of grad school. There's certainly exceptions to that, but it's a good starting point.\n\nFor me, I think the debt of grad school vs the expected increase in earning potential is probably a wash, i.e., my earning potential increases at about the same rate as my debt, so it really just came down to what field I'd rather be in, and that education and research is just really fun and gratifying to me.",

Like, the range is huge, between $40k-100k+, averaging $86k first year.  I'm assuming that has to do with the fact that you graduate with a limited license and it takes about 2 more years to get the required supervision/hours to get full licensure as a psychologist, which is another reason people have suggested the Psy.D.\n\nMy guess is I'd most likely be making around the same amount yearly as my total debt would be because of what I want to specialize in. I'm going to have to ask around and find people who are in the specific concentration I'm interested in and ask them some uncomfortable questions.",

You will likely make no more than 55k until you get independently licensed or land a really great job.\n\nAlso, do not get a Psy.D by any means, unless you\u2019re independently wealthy.

I don\u2019t know how it is specifically for therapists, but first you need to see how many people with the master\u2019s degree actually end up employed in that profession. If it\u2019s really your dream and there\u2019s not more than 50% likelihood you\u2019ll have to end up doing something else career-wise once you\u2019re done, it\u2019s worth taking the leap and hustling to make it happen IMO. \n\nWishing you the best with your education!",

It sounds too good to be true, so of course I'm also skeptical, but they were not paid to provide that testimony, so... eh? The statistics do look promising.",

      "text": "*Is it better to have 70k student loan debt and be happy with your career/the place you spend most of your time or is it better to work jobs that make you depressed and uninspired while still 30k debt?*\n\nThis is a false dichotomy.\n\nYou can do the math for what taking on $70K of loans is like - [finaid.org](https://finaid.org) has calculators for you. At the standard rates for federal loans - 6.8% interest, 10 years repayment, no fees - you're looking at something around $820/month or thereabouts. If you up the repayment period to 25 years, your per-month expectation goes down to about $490/month, but then your total payments will be more than twice what you borrowed. There are income-based repayment plans, but you continue to accrue interest on the unpaid principal under those.\n\nPublic loan forgiveness can possibly help, but as many are discovering now, there's no guarantee you'll get it even if you are theoretically eligible (especially as politics change over the years). Plus you'd still have to pay those loans for 10 years before the forgiveness. Therapists make solid middle-class salaries, but not enough where $500/month wouldn't be noticeable or make a difference in the standard of living you'll have.\n\nIt could be life-ruining. (Standard repayment likely wouldn't be affordable at all, so Im talking about income-based or an extended repayment plan.) More likely, it won't *ruin* your life but will severely constrain the financial choices you can make through a good chunk of your adult earning years.\n\nWith that said, though, I know plenty of people who have gone way more than $70K in debt to get the jobs/degrees they wanted and are doing quite fine, even when their salaries are right around the average for therapists. Most of them regret it, but most are still generally living middle-class lives.\n\n\\*\n\nI am very skeptical, though, that having the life you want to have is not possible unless you go $70K into debt for a master's degree. Why do you think the only option for you is an \"HR-type position\"? Most people don't work in jobs directly related to their major.\n\nWhy have you decided to become a therapist, and that being a therapist is the only fulfilling that there is? Exploring your reasons can help you identify potential alternative careers for your Plan B.\n\nThe other thing is that there's way more to life than what you do to earn money, and it's troubling to think that life would stop being worth living if you are not able to do exactly what you think you want to do at 28. I'm doing something completely different from what I imagined for myself at age 28 and I love my job.",
