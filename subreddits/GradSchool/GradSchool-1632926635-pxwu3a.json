I'm curious, what sort of things would cause you to leave a program. Hospitalization? Nervous breakdown?\n\nUpdate: Currently sitting in the ER, didn't trust myself to just sit in my room with some of the stuff I have in there.

At some point during the summer between second and third year, communication broke down between my PI and I spiraled into a depressive episode that lasted until the following spring.

I figured it out while we were addressing reviewer comments, causing my PI to flip out. She ended up trying to convince me I wasn\u2019t passionate about the field and force me out of the program entirely, but some part of me knew that she was wrong. So, I went on compassionate leave to 1) get my shit together and 2) take any decisions about my future out of her hands.

Mental health stuff is rough even before you add in the stress of grad school.\n\n\nEveryone is different, so my answer may not be yours. I expected my mental health to get worse, and it *definitely* has lol. So I'm left with several questions for myself. Can ongoing treatment keep me *safe?* Do I have support here? Will I see improvement once I get over the bump of that first semester? Am I still in touch -- or if not, can I get *back* in touch -- with what I'm doing here, and how this gets me to that goal? \n\n\nI've been thinking on that a lot, since my mental health is pretty bad and we had someone drop my program. There's a level of \"this is awful\" I can tolerate if the environment is one where I can work through those feelings.

I know the process is isolating, hard, taxing, *meant* to be a challenge, yet I have come to realize also that anything *meant* to be a challenge is made challenging in ways that hamper progress, & for reasons that defy logic. As an educator, I try so hard, (which lately, given that I just withdrew from my PhD program, admittedly isn\u2019t working all that well) to support my students as a means of supporting the work they need to do to succeed in the course. I have not experienced this as a student at the graduate level. As an educator, I use community as a course theme, as a means of introducing students to its often undervalued importance, & to help ensure we\u2019re fostering one in our class. There is no such effort at the graduate level. \n\nTo have support during challenging times, when engaging difficult tasks, often equates to taking some of the weight off of those working to confront challenges. To intentionally withhold support, or act in ways that suggest someone has failed to realize it\u2019s needed, is to make the weight carried that much heavier. Eventually, I just started suffocating under the weight of it all. Since no one on my committee, in my department, in my college, in official roles at the university, had done anything to suggest there was an importance in the project, I came to accept that finishing it wasn\u2019t important after all. \n\nAnother thing that helped me finally confront this issue was asking myself to honestly answer some questions, such as: Considering my own observations & experiences of higher levels of higher education, did I really need or want to become part of that? If I can teach with a masters degree, & since I don\u2019t want to ever risk replicating the shit-show I had to trudge through for *years*, must I keep suffering through this?

It got pretty bad, and I did get to a point where I was pushing through, hanging by a thread, and then having a breakdown at the end of every other Zoom meeting. That was when I took a medical leave of absence (best decision ever) to focus on mental and physical health, and it made me realize my life is not worth this degree. I didn't love my work, and my goals changed. I no longer wanted to work in academia, so the PhD wouldn't have been a means to an end. I couldn't justify subjecting myself to the struggle again and saying \"it'll get better in a few years\" because I knew it wouldn't be for anything concrete at the end. So do you absolutely need this degree to pursue what you want? Is there a way to return if you decide to leave now? \n\nI don't mean to influence your decision in any way.
