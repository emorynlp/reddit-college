  "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo I was looking for some resources for PhD students for mental well being etc. Didn't find anything for the students based in the USA or Asia(will appreciate it if people could add them in the comments, if they know if something).\n\nBut I found a website: phdsuccess.eu \n\nThe website is based in the Europe and is specifically for the European graduate students. I'm not sure if people from other countries can join, but it looks promising and I wonder why I hadn't heard of it until now!!! It's exactly the kind of help I was looking for. \n\nAnyway, I hope this post helps some of you who are looking for mental health resources or will do so in the future. \n\nGood Luck!!",
