I am at the end of my 5th year. I submitted a review in April without my adviser's approval and its been accepted without revisions. The Dean and other professors are working with me to put together a dissertation on negative results from my attempted experiments. I think the level of mismanagement I've been under is forcing their hand to get me out.  \n\n\nIn addition I've been allowed to add a chapter on my teaching methods. I have a copyright on some of my materials and wanted to publish when I first came here. Unfortunately every professor rejected working with me. I got published through another university and have been working with other institutions to move these projects forward. The Dean was flabbergasted at the work I've done with my teaching and that faculty have given me no guidance on turning this into a PhD.   \n\n\nMy lab is shutting down and the Dean will be personally funding me to move to another city, live with my girlfriend, and finish writing.  \n\n\nAnd the best part. After meeting with the Dean my adviser has been attempting to meet with me to discuss the situation. He's only on campus from 11-2 so I've been taking long lunch and going to the library to avoid him. The Dean has told him all communication is to include him, and these E-mails have been to me directly. I've replied cc-ing both the Dean and the School of Graduate Studies. His replies have all been to me directly. Everyone has seen this. He has done it multiple times over the past two weeks even after the Dean E-mailed the both of us telling him to stop.  \n\n\nMy adviser is now considered to be directly defying the Dean and acting contrary to how he's agreed to move forward. The Dean has said he doesn't think my adviser understands what the problem is, how serious it is, and why he can no longer participate in my graduate committee. He's been told to end all communication with me and is being called in to review his behavior for a third time this year.  \n\n\nIt means a lot to me to be told that this situation is not my fault and that me working harder is not the solution. I'm trying to dig myself out of the despair that I've fallen into as a result of this program. The Dean and the other faculty that are working with me are very positive and are making me want to get back into my field. I believe when I move and am living with someone who loves me I'll be able to put something together and defend in the Fall.", "author": "hdorsettcase", "created": 1563564782, "retrieved": 1632845807, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 412, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"eubwl4c": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/cfc1i4/update_my_adviser_has_been_removed_as_chair_and/eubwl4c/", "text": "Good on you for being persistent and refusing to lie down.
