  "text": "I'm starting grad school (urban planning) in less than a month and I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not *that* ambitious of a person. As I am preparing, I see the people in my program practically killing themselves just to cram experience into their resume or get access to that connection of a connection of a connection. And while I understand why someone would need to do this for financial reasons or maybe even personal interest, I am just really perplexed at how many unpaid hours of work people are doing for practically no reward in return. I also see this in grad school forums and on Reddit - it seems like so many grad students are obsessed with productivity and ambition, even when it doesn't benefit them.\n\nI seriously admire people who are ambitious in this way. I always thought I was that person, but as years go by I *clearly* am not. I'm really interested in and passionate about what I will be studying, I'm a hard worker that produces good work, and I've done a good job at staying on track in life, but I just can't relate to the amount of work and dedication that seems to be expected out of people in grad school. It's a very weird culture that I guess I'm not used to yet.\n\nCan anyone else relate?",

All through undergrad and my first year or so of grad school, I was the one that was practically killing myself - I was so focused on being the best of the best that if I was not the highest achieving member of my cohort I was mentally unable to handle it. After having made significant progress on my thesis and spending time working in the field outside of school, as well as getting treatment for mental illness/undiagnosed ADHD, school has become simply a means to an end for me. At this point, I love the work I do, the ideas I get to immerse myself in, and the connection between theory and practice in planning as a discipline, but it's merely one part of my life - along with my relationships with my partner and family, my hobbies and interests, traveling, and my friends. As a side note, if you ever want to talk planning, or have any questions about what to expect from planning school, I am happy to discuss with you! Good luck, don't sweat, and enjoy it!",

If you can graduate and keep the workload at a decent level of management then do it. Don't stress about it!\n\nSource: Worked myself silly for straight A's the first few semesters, talked to a ton of people about this same issue, and got the same response from everyone that I highly respect.

      "text": "Hey, I'm at the tail end of a PhD in planning, and I can relate...I would say I'm maybe only the #6 person in the world in order of wanting me to finish, after my advisor, department chair, wife, and parents.\n\nI would say it depends on what you want to do. If you want a TT faculty job in this field, the reality is you probably do need to be laser-focused on putting together a good dissertation and networking. It's the nature of the job market. Back when I thought I wanted that, I applied to 30+ positions and did not even get to the screening interview stage, even though multiple profs in my department (which is \\~top 5 in as much that is a thing in Planning) have said I'm \"one of the best that has ever come through the program\".\n\nIf you want an industry/nonprofit/government job, then yeah, just be you, learn whatever skills seem interesting. But still make sure you're on track to finish, or you'll end up like me in year 7+ (this is a moot point if you're in a masters program). Also probably still need to network, if only just to get a good view of the opportunities that might be out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT to add context. Regarding my job search remarks, the point is that I am probably more like you. I was less ambitious, didn't really focus on publishing a coherent body of work, and kind of just pursued things that were interesting to me. This included teaching a few different classes, doing research on a few disparate topics, taking a couple of interesting internships, all at a pace that allowed me to also maintain a good social life, get married, do lots of recreational travel and so on. I'm happy, but, not marketable for academia. So just be aware.",

I used to do this all the time and always thought I was doing something wrong since they were studying more than I was, always trying to be busy, etc.  Then I realized I was getting the same grades as there were and had essentially the same CV.  \nJust because someone appears to be working hard doesn't mean they are working efficiently.  Remember that old SAT question, \" if person A takes 5 hours and person B takes 8 hours?\" It's basically the same thing as that.  Why spend 8 hours on a 5 hour job?",

      "text": "Don't admire them, it's \"hustle culture\", it's toxic and it's harmful to themselves and others. It's not entirely their fault, systemic issues are to be blamed first and foremost, but hustle culture, both inside and outside academia, is something to avoid, and if you find yourself within it, something to save yourself from. (I don't want to sound harsh to individuals that find themselves in positions where they *have* to hustle, I understand that it's not always an option to work at healthy doses. I am however critical of those who try to push hustle culture as cool or proper work or desirable. That's nonsense.)\n\nI am personally here because I am curious and I want to do science. I want to be a scientist and a philospher (in the sense that every science is a child of philosophy and every scientist needs to be aware of philosophy as a history and as a method). It's been my dream since childhood, or more like it's felt like the most natural place to be for me, or for me to be me. Of course there's some disillusionment as I meet the realities of academia...\n\nOther than what research they do, I don't care what others do, achieve, acquire, conquer, or whatever. Or how \"smart\" or \"gifted\" they are, which are concepts I don't believe in (I've been the \"gifted kid\", it's bs). So long as I'm in a relaxed, laid back, but honest institution, and in company of honest, ethical and cheerful colleagues, I'm happy, so that's what I'm shooting for as a grad student. I have no interest in competing or building a shiny CV, which IMHO is a distraction from the beauty of science.\n\nMaybe sounds silly and epicurean, but that's what it is for me. So yeah, I really really relate, tho I'm lucky to be in a fairly cozy and humane small department that doesn't hustle.",

I will add that my mental health issues (anxiety and depression) make that level of ambition seem improbable. I entered my program presenting a version of myself that didn't really exist anymore.. the 18-year-old eager and green undergrad who wanted to be a super-successful professor with a PhD before 30 and a house before 32... By the time I got into the program in Sept of 2020 (yes, I started grad school in the middle of the pandemic.. big mistake) I was not the same person I was when I submitted my application in January of 2020.\n\nI know I'm disappointing my advisor because I am not living up to the student I presented myself as when we first met... I feel guilty about that... I also feel weird that I'm not accomplishing as much as some of my peers (even though I know we're all on our own timeline blah blah blah)... I feel bad that I'm not contributing as much to my university/community as much I would have hoped...  It's really fucked with my psyche.... I wonder how much of it is because of COVID... anyway you're far from alone. You'll know deep in your heart if its right and worth it for you. Maybe you won't but will persist with the degree anyway... That's what I'm doing lol",

Besides super busy weeks of my RAship and a few weeks of the year over my time in my program (mid-terms, finals, qualifying exams, submitting a grant, etc), I can honestly say I work anywhere from 10-30 hours a week a given week, no more. But that's calculating time of genuine work, not \"I'm sitting at my computer for 8 hours a day and only working for 2\" kind of work. I see other people in my program complain/humble brag about how they're working 50+ hours but a lot of times it feels like they bring it on themselves and want to be viewed in a certain light for doing that. Me, I like having 3 day weekends almost every week, going out on the weekends, and traveling, and my work is not my life in anyway. And yet I've never had a complaint from anyone I work with! I think it's all about setting boundaries and knowing what you want your life to look like now, and in the future after graduating.",

I think the word you\u2019re looking for to describe yourself is knowing how to set a boundary. I see all of these classmates doing internships and working 50 hours a week and I chose to just enter the workforce and move my way up.

It\u2019s also very difficult for me to equate hard work = success as my program is very much about \u201cwho you know\u201d and networking.

If it's not for financial reasons, I also don't understand this kind of behavior. I think it's really fucked up, encourages burnout, and sets unrealistic expectations for current and future grad students.\n\nThe reason it happens is 1/ because under capitalism we're only valuable insofar as we can produce labor, even if we're not compensated (which, like you said, free labor is absurd, and while connections are great, but they don't pay the bills!) and 2/ because academia is an absolute cesspit. Profs encourage this because they benefit from us working ourselves into the ground, even as they know that it's for literally nothing given that there are little to no TT jobs on the other end. It's the whole \"if I suffered, so do you\" thing, combined with the fact that academia is really garbage at accommodating the current economic, labor, and social conditions of our world.\n\nHonestly, I hate it, and I think it makes us worse scholars and researchers. It's why I won't be getting a PhD in my field after my MA. I also don't think that it's even \"ambition,\" it's just fucked.\n\nedit: thank u for the award, kind stranger!! proud that my first award is for talking about the evils of capitalism \ud83e\udd29",

      "text": "I wouldn't really tie ambition and productivity together as one. I know what you mean about productivity, I also have many friends doing the same PhD program as I and some in my own lab that have such a powerful push to be productive: some work 12 hr days everyday and then come to the lab virtually every weekend, others are constantly reading papers in their free time at home, and others are going around looking for conferences that would benefit them the most in terms of knowledge, feedback, and networking. I don't do that, I binge work, sometimes 15 hrs in one day, others 6 hrs or even less, and I rarely come on weekends. I come home and I choose to not do anything science related (except of course when I'm just dying of curiosity to know the results of an experiment so I analyze at home). \n\nI've had one person accuse me of lacking ambition actually, and their reasoning was that I was not working hard enough to rise above and beyond everyone and eventually get a tenure track position. I found that hilarious, it's like saying an astronaut is not ambitious because they didn't try to become a president of their country. It's just a different career path, ambition is how far you want to reach in a given path of your choosing. If your career goal does not entail working to the same degree or in the same way as your colleagues, that does not mean you're not ambitious. My career goals lie in the industry, I don't even want to join academia, and for the industry, they look mostly at your skill bank, and not so much on how many nature papers you first authored (sorry if the reference is out of your field, I guess this is turning into a rant haha). \n\nBesides all that, in my experience, hard work plays a generally permissive role in success, it's not exactly linearly related to it. That is, more work =/= more success, but too little work = no success. In the life sciences for instance, honestly... An overwhelming proportion of the propensity to succeed has to do with luck in terms of getting the right research question, getting the high impact result (which is obviously out of your hands), and being in a good (and often rich) lab. So the way I see it.. I'm just gonna work hard enough to succeed in an excellent manner, but I'm not going to sacrifice my social life and physical and mental health for getting no guarantee of \"immense success and fame\" in the future.\n\nOne of the best pieces of advice I heard in grad school is that you should always resist the urge to compare yourself to others. Live your life by your own standards that you set for yourself, it doesn't matter how other people set their standards. At the end of the day, we each live in our own world, our own perception that cannot even possibly overlap with another perception, heck it can't even be communicated, so other people's opinions aren't even logically relevant. If you're satisfied with how your progress is, then it's all good. If your PI isn't, then maybe reconsider your standards, and if you think the expectations of your PI aren't realistic or fair or suitable to you, then reconsider your PI.",

I feel like we often say (often subtely) that people who go to grad school and end up in industry \"failed\" but honestly they probably have more $ and life balance! It's ok to do either if it fits you but we need to stop seeing it as a one solution fits all...people want and get different things from grad school and that's perfect.",

My PI knows that everyone has their own way of doing things, so if I or somebody else puts in more hours, he won\u2019t expect that from everyone. It\u2019s also unfair to expect them to put in less hours if they\u2019re really passionate about something. Just do you! Don\u2019t compare yourself with others..",
