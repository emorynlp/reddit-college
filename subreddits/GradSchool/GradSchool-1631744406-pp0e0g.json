I'm a current first semester senior slated to graduate in May 2022, and i'm looking to get into Clinical Psychology PhD programs.\n\nI have extensive research experience, and one of the main projects I have been working on alongside a faculty advisor with, is in the process of data collection atm. The plan is to write up a manuscript and publish prior to graduation, which at the rate we have been working at is very doable.\n\nThis project was essentially my honors thesis, but for whatever reason my advisor and I neglected to formally submit it as such in when first starting the project. Now, the deadlines for an official honors thesis have passed and my only option to have it officially recognized as an \"honors\" thesis would to submit a proposal next semester, and push my graduation back until Dec 2022.\n\nSo my question is, is there any significant value in doing this and having the project formally recognized as an honors thesis, as opposed to an independent project? The end goal is the same, which is to write up a manuscript and publish, so would the honors recognition have any real benefit in the eyes of a graduate school acceptance committee?\n\nOne reason why I'm hesitant to delay my graduation for this, is since I am currently in the process of applying to grad programs for the Fall/Winter 22 admissions cycle. If I were to graduate Dec 22, i'd presumably have to push back applying as well.\n\nAny thought would be much appreciated!", "author": "dmesaaa", "created": 1631744406, "retrieved": 1632844485, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {}}
