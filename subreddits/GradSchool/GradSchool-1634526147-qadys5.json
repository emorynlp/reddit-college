I had similar beliefs that I was \"more productive at night\" but I realized it simply wasn't true and I was always tired from not sleeping enough. Waking up at the same time everyday forces you into a routine where you feel more motivated during the day. You also will have way more time. Once I tried spacing out my work and doing a little everyday I realized how it was so much better for my health. It helped with my anxiety and since I wasn't pulling all nighters the depression was better. It's definitely easier said than done but it's proven to be effective.",

For some reason I don't fully understand, during night I can keep bad thoughts away\n\nMy sleep schedule and daytime routine were decent lately, but I started being less and less productive because of the increasing pressure. One night I kept working and around 2-3am I finally felt calm again: I ended up doing a lot of work and caught up with my work plan. By working at night the following days too, I could proceed at a good pace. Obviously, it's very unhealthy\n\nTonight I have been very productive again. I am sure I would have been more productive if I had worked the same anount of time during the day, but that just doesn't work right now",

I have that and I was an honor role student my whole life until the later half of college. You may feel fine but you may surprise yourself once medicated. Just see the psychiatrist because they'll be able to figure it out.\n\nI was very similar. My siblings also have ADHD and I am nothing like them. They were C students I've always been on the honor role. I can sit still for hours and there were activities that I could do all day no issue. Turns out that those activities (for me it was aquarium scaping, video games, music and reading) are what they call \"hyper focuses\" in innatentive type ADHD. Its something that stimulates your brain just right so you can focus like a normal person.\n\n I don't know if you're familiar with what the DSM is, but basically it's the diagnostic tool psychiatrists as a whole use to diagnose and also define disorders. In 2012 they actually removed ADD because neurologists had proved that it was indistinguishable from ADHD in terms of treatment and neurology. So in the \"old days\" I, and possibly you, would have been diagnosed with ADD instead. Now ADHD is a spectrum disorder with one extreme being hyperactive. The usual thought of an ADHD person, angsty, hyper, annoying ect. Then on the other extreme major innatentive, or what used to be ADD. This one is harder because it feels like you're normal. You can do some things just enough to seem functional because all the symptoms go on in your head. This leads to things like anxiety, insomnia and such.\n\nOnce I got medicated that's when I realized it. My attention span my whole life had only been about 40 minutes. Long enough to seem functional. What happens after 40 minutes is I get really anxious. I go to a lecture that's 75 minutes and I would be anxious for half. Now I'm not. I can actually focus on whatever I want for 5 or 6 hours instead of just my hyper focuses. \n\nAnyway I can't diagnose you lol. But if you describe all these issues to a psychiatrist and ask if you have anxiety, depression, or adhd they'll help you out. It's a process to get diagnosed and a longer process to find meds that work. Seriously if you don't feel a world of difference after 2 weeks on a med just go back and explain that and they'll try something else until they find what's great for you. But once you find the right stuff it's like a magic bullet. The world changed shape it seemed to me.",

      "text": "It might help to try to identify what about late nights makes it easier to focus. Is it that you aren't getting emails or texts that you're expected to respond to at night? Is it literal quiet? Do you drink coffee or tea during the day that contributes to your anxiety then? (This was a big one for me. I'm very sensitive to caffeine and cutting back on it helped my anxiety) Do you have too many meetings/seminars/classes during the day so that you don't have uninterrupted focus time?\n\nSome of those are more fixable than others. If you find it distracting to get messages while you're working (even non-urgent ones), I suggest physically removing your phone from your workspace and not having your email (or Slack or any other chat apps) open while working. Set a timer to check both of those things periodically, and other than that, give yourself permission to let go of worrying about them. \n\nAnd of course, if the option is available to you, talking to a counselor and/or psychiatrist doesn't hurt. Grad school exacerbates mental health problems for many, many people, and getting professional help might make a big difference.",

          "text": "I certainly get a lot of stress from answering emails during the day. Some of the worst distractions come from within: the sense of danger from deadlines, the little panic over the thousand little things that have to be done, scary thoughts about non-academic stuff,\nthey all pop up in my mind and freeze me.\n\nAt night, thoughts of this kind do not form as often and are generally easier to dispel. And there are no emails at night! \n\nYes, I'll probably look for a (new) therapist anyway",

While I felt similarly most of my phd, the last year it became pretty much impossible for me to keep normal hours due to the anxiety/pressure being overwhelming while the sun was out (COVID/having to work solely from home really contributed). I agonized about it to no end with my therapist, but eventually she basically told me to lean into it. It wasn't pretty, my sleep schedule was weird AF, but it got the job done.",

During the day, I feel like the time I spend working on assignments is ''not productive enough'' (i.e. I could be doing laundry, mopping the floors, doing groceries or running errands). So I tend to do those tasks during the day, and then pull all-nighters (when I know no one can disturb me and break my focus). My sleep hygiene is absolute trash (I work as an emergency dispatcher on top of it), but it works for me.",
