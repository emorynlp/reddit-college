I started research in July, classes in Aug and by October told my PI that the project wasn't a good fit. I finished out the semester with her and applied for spring assistantships. \n\nI went back home (as I decided I would do when I told my PI I was quitting the project) for spring semester bc my Dad was having surgery. I decided I'd either have a remote assistantship or take a leave of absence. I didn't get an assistantship so I took a leave of absence. I was still undecided if I would go back bc it was 1000 miles away from home and I had been miserable... But it was covid, my PI was a nice person but a terrible boss, and I didn't really like my project. Theoretically, those things would be different when (if) I went back and I had finally made some friends just before I left. The program itself was awesome and super interdisciplinary (and the university super highly ranked, which I feel like I should care about, with academia being what it is).\n\nJust as I decided I'd take a yearlong LoA and go back, I got a full-time w benefits job at my home state's flagship university satellite research campus. (sorry, that was word salad) I worked w these people in undergrad, so I know I like everybody, and now I get to get a master's part-time, paid for by the university, while getting extension experience.\n\nIt kinda sucked, basically dropping out, but my situation ended up being for the best. Yours will, too! I think it's great you figured it out so quickly and were honest with yourself. Best of luck in the next cycle! Honestly, if you now know pretty specifically what you want, I don't think anybody will think you leaving is your fault.
