  "text": "I am trying to go day by day, but I feel constantly tired and there are days in which I also feel anxious. \n\nIt's a paradox since my internship is related to mental health care. But... well I was supposed to do an internship now, and even when the pandemic is here my classes won't stop. So here I am. \n\nJust wonder how \"typical\" is this? I all ready to go to therapy.",
