Except now that I have free time, everything is shut down and there's nothing really to do. This is a great accomplishment but with this shit economy, I'm over it already. There was no commencement, classes ended and besides a zoom call for said community service award, it just ended and that's it. I felt good for a day but it's over. I actually feel that this was not worth it at all considering the stress, sacrifices and financial burden.

Spoiler:\n\n* >!There's a point where the main character runs into exactly the same situation you did - he hits a peak, then it's over...and nothing.!<\n\nWe're going to do a bit of a deep-dive into productivity here, because if you want to solve this problem, then you need to understand the game you're playing in a very clear way.  I can write about this easily because I'm a few years down the road & have been through all of this garbage myself lol.  Let's start out with this:\n\n>I actually feel that this was not worth it at all considering the stress, sacrifices and financial burden. \n\nThe reality is that the life we experience as human beings is vastly different than the life we THINK we experience.  You exist in the real-time stream of individual moments.  What this means is that your day consists of a few key elements, including:\n\n* How much sleep you got last night\n* How recently you ate food & how hydrated you are\n* How much global stress & pressure you feel from all of the various situations in your life\n* What you're currently working on\n\nHaving a consistent normal is important because if you win a football game with a touchdown & experience that high, you can't keep it up forever.  Likewise, if something really bad happens to you, you also can't keep that up forever.  Your body eventually winds down & puts you back at your baseline operational state.\n\nHow you experience this baseline depends on your choices, mostly physical (sleep, diet, exercise), but also mental (how you manage your commitments).  Being content is a decent baseline to start out with...from there, how you choose to inject good & great into your day is totally 100% up to you on a consistent basis.  Peak experiences are fun, but if you want to feel good & do good things every day, that requires consistent effort, and it's worth it if you want to care on a daily basis!\n\nI graduated a number of years ago under different circumstances, but all I got was a printed diploma in the mail...I didn't even get to walk across the stage.  I remember opening it up, looking at it, and saying \"meh\" after all those years of hard work.  The thing is, again, peak experiences don't last.  What I eventually came to realize is that we have that baseline, and it's our responsibility to make each day good, and there are ways to do that.\n\nOne of the ways I keep things feeling good is by using what I call a \"motivation cradle\".  Just like a hammock that has a top & a bottom mounting point, if we want to live in the cradle of motivation & feel enthusiastic about stuff, we need two things:\n\n1. A hot project we're involved in right now\n2. A hot project to look forward to\n\nAs a student, for your years in school, it's simple:\n\n1. You're actively engaged in your school work\n2. You have graduation to look forward to\n\nWhen graduation hits, the game changes, and it's up to you define your next motivation cradle.  I do this with a pretty simple planning method consisting of half a dozen lists in Google Docs:\n\n1. Bucket list\n2. 5-year plan\n3. Current responsibilities\n4. Motivation cradle (current + next hot project)\n5. Today\n6. Right now (next assignment & interruptions)\n\nA bucket list is for the fun stuff that you'd love to do eventually, but a 5-year plan is a detailed path forward of things you are actively working towards.  Previously, it was graduation.  Now, it's going to be things like career goals, personal & family goals, hobby goals, continuing education, and so on.  It's really hard not to just coast in life without a highly-detailed 5-year plan!\n\nYour current responsibilities are everything you're on the hook for now. If you're done with school, then that's going to mean things like food, rent, insurance, a car payment, finding a job, going to your job, etc.  The Motivation Cradle is a key aspect of this it's so easy to coast in life, and unless you carve out some awesome things to do for yourself, ain't no one gonna do it for ya!  Go & ask anyone what their current hot project & upcoming project is, and then compare how they feel about life to what their answers (or lack thereof) is.\n\npart 1/3", "author": "kaidomac", "created": 1611542617, "upvotes": 17}, "gknwyo3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/l4b9ff/graduated_with_a_masters_and_dont_even_care/gknwyo3/", "text": "That is how I felt when I got my Bachelor's in May.
