My field is international environmental policy so it isn\u2019t like I would need to work in the US after my degree and I also really appreciate the work-life balance here in the Netherlands. However, I constantly hear that the US is the best place to be to get your PhD which makes me unsure of what my next move should be. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be much appreciated!", "author": "raviolu", "created": 1631555760, "retrieved": 1632952651, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcpxi4w": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnkoci/thoughts_on_getting_a_phd_outside_of_the_us/hcpxi4w/", "text": "The perspective of \"US is best\" is more for foreign students who want to end up in the states, if you really want to work for a FAANG or if you want to be faculty in the US. The last 2 points are not because foreign PhDs aren't as good, but rather simply because so much of landing a competitive job is so dependent upon connections, and it's simply easier to build a relevant network when doing your PhD where you want to work. If you want to stay in Europe, then get a European PhD. You can always post-doc in the US if it becomes necessary.", "author": "downsideleft", "created": 1631557097, "upvotes": 5}}}
