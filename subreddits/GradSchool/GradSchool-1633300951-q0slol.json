  "text": "I've recently moved to a different country for grad school. There aren't any clubs for grad students here and the existing clubs have an undergrads only policy, strange I know. \nEveryone in class either seems to already have a close group of friends or too busy to hang out. My roommates aren't really interested in socializing either. \nAny suggestions?",

After a few weeks someone always suggested grabbing a drink or getting the group together for work plus dinner somewhere.  Stuff like that.  I\u2019m pretty shy at first so I was glad to have the invitation, but now I think I\u2019d initiate it willingly.",
