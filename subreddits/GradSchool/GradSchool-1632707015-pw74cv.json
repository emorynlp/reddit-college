Do I need a blazer? Am I fine with just a simple button-up?

If so I would say a suit and tie. Look you are interacting with peers and your seniors who will eventually be hiring you. Science, biotech is pretty big on formality during presentations....Want to work for a big pharma? small pharma...you want to look professional. Doc Martins? I look at shoes when meet someone...that's not gonna go over well. Dressing up shows you care about your work and respect the people you are meeting.\n\nIf it's just a poster you can get away with business casual but most dress it up a bit with a sport coat at least.\n\nWow, I've read some of the posts on here. .....simply wow. I'd be willing to PM with you. Wow....I'm simply stunned. \n\nRemember, you are meeting people who are gonna hire you eventually. Executives and group leaders are older. Your name is going out there someday on a resume....remember that.\n\nDoc martins? you can get some dress shoes at Khols for 35 bucks dude.", "author": "rthomas10", "created": 1632749611, "upvotes": -3}, "hegdok2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw74cv/what_to_wear_at_a_conference_first_inperson_one/hegdok2/", "text": "I second looking at pictures online. I usually check Facebook, LinkedIn, or the conference\u2019s website for what people wore previously and then match that in my own style.

I was/am on the underdress extreme side though.

If not, my advice is always to bring stuff that can be mixed and matched to fit the overall vibe of the other attendees once you get there. \n\nSo, if I'm guessing correctly that you present female (my apologies if not; just let me know!), you can use a dress shirt and those dress pants as your \"base\" outfit, and pack things like a blazer, cardigan, or scarf to switch things up as needed. That said, I think a blazer is overkill unless you are an invited speaker in one of the major sessions. I personally like to pack two different pairs of slacks, one black and one grey or khaki, because slacks are easy to pack (esp. compared to most tops) and switching in or out black slacks seems to be a really easy way to dress up or down an outfit. \n\nFor bags, a generic school backpack is pretty common at conferences, even with people wearing full suits. Depending on the hotel situation, you might expect to be lugging around your laptop and/or a tablet all day and be picking up random swag, so anything one-shoulder can get really annoying and tiring. A laptop bag that can be carried cross-body is another decent option.", "author": "aggressive-teaspoon", "created": 1632716614, "upvotes": 2}, "hefo2k1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw74cv/what_to_wear_at_a_conference_first_inperson_one/hefo2k1/", "text": "Depends on your field.
