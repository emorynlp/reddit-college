  "title:": "Low GPA after first year of grad school because online/pandemic school wasn\u2019t very good for me. Should I continue to graduate or am I fucked?",
  "text": "I have a low B average after my first year of grad school studying computational linguistics, which was completely online and I hated it. I am pursuing a masters because I wanted to work in a specific field and pursue a PHD later, but now both of those things seem unachievable. Am I correct or just being overt negative? I had a far higher GPA in undergrad. People are saying that people will be lenient on grades during the pandemic, but I don\u2019t have enough faith in humans to believe that.",

      "text": "If your Master's is a 'research' / dissertation-based one, I think you owe it to yourself and your advisor(s) to sit down and dive into this further. They don't want an abandoned/failed student attached to their names, nor do you want to go through another year or two and get nothing in the end.\n\nIf you can get your degree with a B average and can use that degree to get a job in the field, then reset your sights, work a few years, and then go back and go for that PhD path once you have (possibly) seen a more interesting problem to solve.\n\nJust my $0.02 worth",

      "text": "I wouldn't worry too much. PhD programs are interested in your potential as a researcher. GPA might be some kind of tie breaker criteria. But ultimately, you are in a PhD program to create new knowledge, not to regurgitate what others tell you. In fact, my advisor says if I get all A's in my doctoral program I am doing something wrong. However: Because you are applying as a masters student, you *are* expected to have publications. So if your research is suffering as well, that's something to talk about with your advisors.",
