Most of what I can find online about this practice is for science related papers--so I hope I can get some pointers here.\n\nHow common is it in lit (humanities) to present a paper at a conference and then go on to publish a revision of that in a journal?\n\nThis happens in the sciences, obviously, but I've yet to hear any word of English scholars doing this. I'm sure they do (it just makes sense!) but it doesn't seem obviously done, from who I've talked to and what I've seen--anyway, all this to say, is this common practice for our field? Is it less common but still done?\n\nThanks!", "author": "marsalien4", "created": 1630638153, "retrieved": 1632845116, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbg49xh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgwp4k/question_about_conference_presentation_and/hbg49xh/", "text": "In our field conferences should function to help us work out our ideas and many presentations are the beginning stages of an article, book chapter, or other project. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think it gets wonky. The way we write a conference presentation and a journal article are two different genres (or should be bc one is a speech). I find this unproductive and tedious, but taking your somewhat unrefined arguments to a conference does effectively mimic a seminar, and should serve as an opportunity to field questions from an audience to help you refine (or defend) those arguments and choices. \n\nMost conferences have affiliated journals, so it\u2019s common to be approached by someone from that journal who wants to publish your revised talk. \n\nI think the value of conferences comes from their themes that help generate a common discourse across a diverse field. And it helps us put our work into current trends which then aligns our ideas with what journals are currently seeking. Ultimately, yes, you should totally try to publish your conference ideas in an article.", "author": "ResponsibilityOk617", "created": 1630677586, "upvotes": 2}}}
