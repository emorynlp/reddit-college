Between [gudetamagoodegg.github.io](https://gudetamagoodegg.github.io) and [cs.institution.edu/gudetamagoodegg](https://cs.institution.edu/gudetamagoodegg), does one look better/more professional/more appealing to employers (I'm in TCS and hoping to stay in academia, if that makes a difference)? I know it's easy to set one site to redirect to the other, so maybe it doesn't even matter that much, but I always like to overthink minor decisions :')",

      "text": "Realizing I'm in a different field from yours, but who have had several media and government folks reach to me, I'm gonna be the odd one out here and say you should at least have a photo, bio, and regularly updated shortened CV hosted on your official university page. Folks who are looking for expertise won't really know you enough to google your name to reach your website (and you know your website won't hit the first page of search results as a newcomer), but they will know your department as a place to start. So they're gonna look through the department directory and see who's there and who specializes in the specific topic. If all you have is a photoless profile with a email address and a link to your website, you're not going to get their attention. But if you fill it out with a quick bio and description of your thesis or links to publications, that helps a lot for someone browsing around who may not know what exactly they're looking for. There's also the added sense of security and credentials when sharing the URL to a page that has the university domain attached to it.\n\nObviously at some point you'll graduate and need a separate website, but that should be treated as complementary to, not a replacement for, your official university profile.",

          "text": "I'm a prof, not a grad student, but I'm going to second (third?) the idea of buying your own domain. In most cases you can redirect from the departmental/university web page that was meant for your web page... so if someone clicks on [www.UnivName.edu/yourlastname](https://www.UnivName.edu/yourlast) it seamlessly will go to your own page over which you will have complete control. To all but the most observant it even will look as if your page is on the U server.\n\nIMO there are several good reasons to do this. One is that someday you will not be affiliated with that U. and they will take down your page. You may want to have a copy or keep it going. Having your own domain means you need never even to think about the timing, etc.\n\nNext, At two of the U's at which I've taught, either my U or my department has tried to impose 'discipline' (i.e., uniformity) on all U web pages (in the name of \"branding\"). For some it may have eased things because everyone was to fill out an online form listing positions, interests, accomplishments, courses taught, etc. But it was extremely limiting. While traffic to my web page was (and is) redirected to my own domain, I am not limited to what the department thinks people should know about me. \n\nOn my personal domain page I include things like links to my publications and my Op-Eds, my lab, my current research, my blog, and even links to my current and former PhD students (so that interested persons can contact them to see if I am OK to work with, helpful, a good supervisor, etc.. And YES, I got their permission before posting their email addresses, but none so far have refused).\n\nI'm old, but my CV and grant applications, etc., always list my web page as [www.MyUniversity.edu/mylastname](https://www.MyUniversity.edu/mylastname) even though it redirects. I think in essence, that if the U will redirect to your personal URL, NOBODY, not a potential employer or granting agency or other interested person will question your association with the U. (I say this because no place at which I've been would redirect for those not affiliated.\n\nAnyway, my two cents. Hope it helps",
