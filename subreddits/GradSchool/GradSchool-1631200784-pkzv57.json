Folks who are looking for expertise won't really know you enough to google your name to reach your website (and you know your website won't hit the first page of search results as a newcomer), but they will know your department as a place to start. So they're gonna look through the department directory and see who's there and who specializes in the specific topic. If all you have is a photoless profile with a email address and a link to your website, you're not going to get their attention. But if you fill it out with a quick bio and description of your thesis or links to publications, that helps a lot for someone browsing around who may not know what exactly they're looking for.
