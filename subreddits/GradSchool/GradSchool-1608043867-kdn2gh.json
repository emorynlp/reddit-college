It felt amazing to be surrounded by non-academics, and talk minimally about science (which almost entirely rules my life nowadays.) We spent most of the weekend hiking and sightseeing, which was really fun. \n\nWhen they left, I just kind of bawled my eyes out because I felt... like... fulfilled? (Or generally, that happy, warm & fuzzy feeling you get from spending time with good people, doing things you enjoy.) \n\nAfter feeling drained for the past 11 months of 2020, I actually feel recharged. \n\nSo, in case you needed to be reminded today: take time for yourself now and then, my people. Your research is worth getting lost in, but not losing yourself over (or your health).", "author": "BiologyPhDHopeful", "created": 1608043867, "retrieved": 1632953862, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 399, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gfzw8o7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kdn2gh/friendly_reminder_to_take_care_of_yourself_today/gfzw8o7/", "text": "Well glad someone gets time off.
