I will write a paper in both courses, but one will be a traditional thesis paper and one will not (shorter, a bit narrower in scope). Due to COVID restrictions at my university, I am limited to secondary data analysis regardless of what course I take.\n\nMy question: how important is the traditional thesis when applying for PhD programs? Can a substantial background in research \"make up\" for not completing a thesis?\n\nI am not totally sure I will want to go for a higher degree, but I haven't entirely ruled it out, either. I would really benefit from being able to take another therapeutic elective instead of the second research semester, and I have pretty substantial research experience for this point in my life  (graduated college in 2018 with 4 years of research experience, worked in data management/database development for 3 years after graduating in a relevant lab, have co-authored 4 papers and presented 5 posters). If I were to apply for a PhD, it would almost certainly be in either Social Psych, Clinical Psych, or Social Work.", "author": "heymohstache", "created": 1630996717, "retrieved": 1632952801, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbxxykn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjhm1f/how_important_is_the_masters_thesis/hbxxykn/", "text": "I had an option of doing a \"capstone\" project or thesis.  The project was essentially the same, but without the traditional thesis formatting and length.  It resulted in a presentation, and a smaller publication, I think it was a letters of neurosci or something.  Did not affect me getting into a well rated Ph.D. the least bit.  Research experience means way more, being able to talk about the research you did.  You can always discuss how you would've expanded the analysis or use it as pilot study data or something.  You're experience, you'll be fine either way and anyone that would make a stink about it wouldn't be someone you want to work with.", "author": "idk_witty_username", "created": 1631029170, "upvotes": 2}, "hbxwi9h": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjhm1f/how_important_is_the_masters_thesis/hbxwi9h/", "text": "I can't speak to the fields you mentioned, but I'm in a lab with some folks who are doing a direct PhD and they had some UG research experience, but no publications or MS.
