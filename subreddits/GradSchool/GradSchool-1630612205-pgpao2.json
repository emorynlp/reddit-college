This month's topic was something I knew literally nothing about and the paper I was assigned was super long and a chaotic, poorly organized mess. Long story short my presentation was god awful and now I'm certain everyone thinks I'm an idiot. I hope this paranoia is normal.",

      "text": "Yeah for sure, though \"anxious as hell\" is a super uncomfortable place to be. Don't be afraid to ask questions if the source of your anxiety is uncertainty about administrative or program stuff. If it's more of an existential sort of anxiety related to the feeling of cluelessness you have as a student, that's also normal, and is best dealt with (IMO) by embracing the cluelessness as part of the process. We're all there with you, don't worry.",

When someone presents something you think \"Wow it seems like everyone understood all of that but I didn't!\"  Realistically everyone felt that way but noone expressed it.\n\nIt's normal.  You're there for a reason and you want to accomplish that mission.  Also, you made it into the program.  That's validation that you have the skillsets to enter and now all you need to do is just grow.",

Do your best, get your work done, and things will get better. \n\nI will say that anxiety is a constant aspect of the academic experience. You won\u2019t always feel like you do now, but the anxiety will take different forms. It\u2019s best to learn how to handle it early-on to avoid a breakdown later. \n\nGood luck! You\u2019ll be okay.",
