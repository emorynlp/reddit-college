I got a lot of support on that post as well as others I made here during my time in grad school, and I wanted to post an update for y'all. Maybe it can help somebody else see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nRecap: I finished a PhD in computational biology after 5 years of hell and an astoundingly shitty PI who dropped off the face of the earth for my last year and half, never read my thesis, and still had the gall to show up to my defense and act like he had any part in it. My mental health was trashed and I moved back home to live with my parents because my doctors didn't feel it was safe for me to live alone. I was pretty damn miserable and regretting just about everything about my life and decisions.\n\nThat \"shitty programming job\" I mentioned in my last post has turned into a great, stable position. I've grown into the job and even though I'm still \"just\" a software engineer, I feel valued and appreciated at work. (What a refreshing change!) It's an easy job for me, but it pays pretty well and it is fulfilling to do even an easy job well. \n\nI got my mental health under control (getting care has been a struggle in the rural area where I live, but I persisted and learned to advocate for myself). I'm still on medication, probably always will be, but I've been able to dial back the doses and handle the ups and downs more resiliently. I rescued a dog which was probably honestly the biggest contributor to my mental health improving. I was able to finally move out of my parents' house and I'm actually a homeowner now myself. Just a couple miles down the road from my parents :) I could not have done any of this without their support.\n\nThe one thing I miss about grad school is teaching. I really did love to teach. I did look into teaching high school but they required me to go get another degree which is, um, NOT HAPPENING. So that is a shame. I do some tutoring for coworkers' kids on the side and really enjoy that.\n\nI'm still in contact with one person from my grad school days. He said people talk about me like I died. One professor (not my PI) called me \"the girl who got a doctorate to work at McDonald's.\" Which, honestly, fuck that guy and fuck white tower hoity-toity academia. My compatriots from grad school are all still stuck in endless post-docs, making pennies. But it's \"prestigious\" so that's ok. Academics need to wake up and realize there aren't enough jobs for all of the students they're training up, and quit straight-up shaming people for choosing a different path. Sorry. Rant over.\n\nI emailed my PI twice, once about six months after graduating, one about a year after. Just asking if he can review my papers so I could get them submitted, just in case I ever decided to try to get back on the academic path. Never heard back. Never got published. Guess that door is closed. I have gotten a couple of citations on my thesis for a pretty useful statistical result I developed, so that's rad. I'll take it.\n\nI don't know if this post will help anybody who is struggling like I was. I hope it will. I still wish I had dropped out earlier. I could have saved a lot of heartache. Like I said in the original post, I didn't need encouragement to keep going, I needed permission to drop out. I wish instead of all the fake \"rah rah rah! you can do it! you go girl!\", somebody would have actually sat me down and helped me talk through my options realistically. I shouldn't have needed that -- I should have been strong enough to see it for myself, and to give myself permission to fail in a small way so that I could succeed in a big way. But I did need that. And maybe you do too, or you know somebody who does. There is life after academia. I promise.\n\nTake care friends <3", "author": null, "created": 1613056694, "retrieved": 1632845195, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 834, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"grpvfdy": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lhmt7d/update_to_it_wasnt_worth_it_2_years_later/grpvfdy/", "text": "It's so great to see this update OP, good for you!

I earned an MS about 30 years ago in geology.  At that time in my industry, a PhD was considered a drawback, although over the last 10-15 years it\u2019s become, not a positive, but much more common, and generally about the same for entry level jobs.  At one point in an industry downturn, I spent a couple of years in a PhD program I chose not to finish, and I really don\u2019t regret that.\n\nMine is a practical science.  There is an entire subset of people in academia who do seem to think that leaving academia is unfortunate\u2014but there\u2019s a much larger group outside academia who love their work, love the (mostly) reasonable hours, (mostly) reasonable people, and decent wages.  This is the real world, and once you get out of the very narrow POV of academia, it can be liberating and empowering to be able to contribute to the world in a useful way and be rewarded for it.\n\nI think OP is just discovering that fact.  There\u2019s a great big world out there, and education is a great thing, but it\u2019s meant to be used, not diddled around with for kudos from a small group of so-called experts in academe.  In many, many cases, science advances through industry, often proprietary, and the universities/acadamia are years behind, they just don\u2019t know it.  The attitudes many of you run into become laughable out in the bigger world.  Sure, a paper is nice, but it\u2019s completely possible to publish as an industry expert if that\u2019s what you want to do, and it can be groundbreaking work that academia envies because of budgets and support.  \n\nEspecially in any field such as computational biology, or any kind of software/engineering research, it\u2019s very possible to thrive and love what you do.  Academia is a stepping stone, not even remotely the be-all and end-all.  Those of us out in the real world often think of academics as totally removed from reality. Not all of them, but a large proportion. Someone\u2019s gotta do it, but it\u2019s a means to an end, not the end itself.\n\nSo for all of you suffering through awful, snobbish PIs and advisors, there\u2019s a whole great world out there and it\u2019s very different.  Industries of all kinds would love to have you, and help you be successful.  It\u2019s not selling out, it\u2019s doing something useful for the world.  And for those of you lucky enough to have academic mentors who actually mentor you, all the better.\n\nCongrats OP.
