  "title:": "Update to It Wasn't Worth It: 2 years later",
  "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8audav/it_wasnt_worth_it/\n\nI posted 2 years ago about my grad school experience and how, well, absolutely terrible it was. I got a lot of support on that post as well as others I made here during my time in grad school, and I wanted to post an update for y'all. Maybe it can help somebody else see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nRecap: I finished a PhD in computational biology after 5 years of hell and an astoundingly shitty PI who dropped off the face of the earth for my last year and half, never read my thesis, and still had the gall to show up to my defense and act like he had any part in it. My mental health was trashed and I moved back home to live with my parents because my doctors didn't feel it was safe for me to live alone. I was pretty damn miserable and regretting just about everything about my life and decisions.\n\nThat \"shitty programming job\" I mentioned in my last post has turned into a great, stable position. I've grown into the job and even though I'm still \"just\" a software engineer, I feel valued and appreciated at work. (What a refreshing change!) It's an easy job for me, but it pays pretty well and it is fulfilling to do even an easy job well. \n\nI got my mental health under control (getting care has been a struggle in the rural area where I live, but I persisted and learned to advocate for myself). I'm still on medication, probably always will be, but I've been able to dial back the doses and handle the ups and downs more resiliently. I rescued a dog which was probably honestly the biggest contributor to my mental health improving. I was able to finally move out of my parents' house and I'm actually a homeowner now myself. Just a couple miles down the road from my parents :) I could not have done any of this without their support.\n\nThe one thing I miss about grad school is teaching. I really did love to teach. I did look into teaching high school but they required me to go get another degree which is, um, NOT HAPPENING. So that is a shame. I do some tutoring for coworkers' kids on the side and really enjoy that.\n\nI'm still in contact with one person from my grad school days. He said people talk about me like I died. One professor (not my PI) called me \"the girl who got a doctorate to work at McDonald's.\" Which, honestly, fuck that guy and fuck white tower hoity-toity academia. My compatriots from grad school are all still stuck in endless post-docs, making pennies. But it's \"prestigious\" so that's ok. Academics need to wake up and realize there aren't enough jobs for all of the students they're training up, and quit straight-up shaming people for choosing a different path. Sorry. Rant over.\n\nI emailed my PI twice, once about six months after graduating, one about a year after. Just asking if he can review my papers so I could get them submitted, just in case I ever decided to try to get back on the academic path. Never heard back. Never got published. Guess that door is closed. I have gotten a couple of citations on my thesis for a pretty useful statistical result I developed, so that's rad. I'll take it.\n\nI don't know if this post will help anybody who is struggling like I was. I hope it will. I still wish I had dropped out earlier. I could have saved a lot of heartache. Like I said in the original post, I didn't need encouragement to keep going, I needed permission to drop out. I wish instead of all the fake \"rah rah rah! you can do it! you go girl!\", somebody would have actually sat me down and helped me talk through my options realistically. I shouldn't have needed that -- I should have been strong enough to see it for myself, and to give myself permission to fail in a small way so that I could succeed in a big way. But I did need that. And maybe you do too, or you know somebody who does. There is life after academia. I promise.\n\nTake care friends <3",

I don't know if you're still checking this post anymore but if you are, do you have any advice on picking a PI when you're coming to grad school? Were there any red flags in hindsight that you wish you had seen earlier? Not to victim-blame, I know there's no way you could have anticipated ALL THIS, but if you have any advice for students who are passionate about getting a PhD and want to know how to pick a supportive advisor please let us know.

      "text": "Here\u2019s a very different perspective. I earned an MS about 30 years ago in geology.  At that time in my industry, a PhD was considered a drawback, although over the last 10-15 years it\u2019s become, not a positive, but much more common, and generally about the same for entry level jobs.  At one point in an industry downturn, I spent a couple of years in a PhD program I chose not to finish, and I really don\u2019t regret that.\n\nMine is a practical science.  There is an entire subset of people in academia who do seem to think that leaving academia is unfortunate\u2014but there\u2019s a much larger group outside academia who love their work, love the (mostly) reasonable hours, (mostly) reasonable people, and decent wages.  This is the real world, and once you get out of the very narrow POV of academia, it can be liberating and empowering to be able to contribute to the world in a useful way and be rewarded for it.\n\nI think OP is just discovering that fact.  There\u2019s a great big world out there, and education is a great thing, but it\u2019s meant to be used, not diddled around with for kudos from a small group of so-called experts in academe.  In many, many cases, science advances through industry, often proprietary, and the universities/acadamia are years behind, they just don\u2019t know it.  The attitudes many of you run into become laughable out in the bigger world.  Sure, a paper is nice, but it\u2019s completely possible to publish as an industry expert if that\u2019s what you want to do, and it can be groundbreaking work that academia envies because of budgets and support.  \n\nEspecially in any field such as computational biology, or any kind of software/engineering research, it\u2019s very possible to thrive and love what you do.  Academia is a stepping stone, not even remotely the be-all and end-all.  Those of us out in the real world often think of academics as totally removed from reality. Not all of them, but a large proportion. Someone\u2019s gotta do it, but it\u2019s a means to an end, not the end itself.\n\nSo for all of you suffering through awful, snobbish PIs and advisors, there\u2019s a whole great world out there and it\u2019s very different.  Industries of all kinds would love to have you, and help you be successful.  It\u2019s not selling out, it\u2019s doing something useful for the world.  And for those of you lucky enough to have academic mentors who actually mentor you, all the better.\n\nCongrats OP.  You\u2019re doing great, and you have a terrific future in front of you.",

I know my mental is going to get even worse because I have no motivation to do well in any of my classes this semester but know that I need to at least do okay in case I ever want to come back.\n\nThank you for this.

But to my surprise, I ended up with a career that very much involves teaching... but not college students!  I teach CEOs.  They don't know how to connect to my field, or how to implement it into their products, and somebody's gotta teach them.  The good news is: (1) the pay is fantastic, and (2) the CEOs are insanely attentive (they know their time is valuable, and they don't waste it).\n\nMy path isn't for everyone.  I carved it myself, and not everyone is interested in that type of entrepreneurship.  But I just wanted to suggest, if you really like teaching, there's many untraditional methods to accomplish this goal!  Think creatively.  Don't limit yourself to traditional career paths.\n\nPS- And whenever anyone starts cracking jokes that I'm not doing research or I \"sold out\" to industry, I just start dropping numbers about my budgets and how much and what type of research those budgets allow us to accomplish.  At least in my field, academia is failing at its own game.",

      "text": "Wow. It took me seven years, but I had pretty much the same experience as yours. My advisor took a sabbatical my second year and then proceeded to have a mental breakdown and completely check out of reality. I was left teaching, managing a team of undergraduates and doing research that was technologically very novel (meaning I could have used some help, unlike his previous grad students who basically incrementally tweaked his old work). \n\nEvery morning, I woke up feeling like I might as well die. I enjoyed the teaching, but I was reduced to a ball of anxiety and depression and everybody around me kept saying \"oh you're doing great, you shouldn't worry\". It was awful. I pulled through and finished with zero support and got a job in tech that pays more than any of the TT faculty who are starting now. It is a million times less stressful and I get to work at a human pace on projects that use my expertise, though not my entire skillset.  In my department not a single person congratulated me on my job (which I started a few months before defending.). Everyone made a pity face and said \"what a shame, you'd be such a great professor\".  Just like you, they talk about me as if I'm dead.\n\nI am SO resentful but I'm six months out (though I did take on some extra teaching, so I'm not completely out) and finally returning back to my old self. The stress, negativity and catastrophisizing were not part of my personality, but responses to a protracted negative experience that took up my entire life. We tell people to go to therapy when they get depressed in grad school, but we should send grad programs and advisors to workshops on how to not destroy people and their minds.",

It sounds like you have a bunch of great things going for you right now: a new happy place to live, a lovable furry friend, a good relationship with your parents, and income during a pandemic. That is more than many people right now, and those professors seem small minded to think academics are the be all and end all after receiving a degree. Some people literally just go back to school for personal development. I often wonder if my degree was \u2018worth it\u2019 and it probably wasn\u2019t financially and job-market-wise either but it meant a lot to me personally to compete such a big goal of mine and can only open more doors down the road I think. I hope your able to find a teaching outlet if you want! Thanks for updating the sub!",

I wish instead of all the fake \"rah rah rah! you can do it! you go girl!\", somebody would have actually sat me down and helped me talk through my options realistically. I shouldn't have needed that -- I should have been strong enough to see it for myself, and to give myself permission to fail in a small way so that I could succeed in a big way. But I did need that. \n\n\nMy 2 cents as a non-American PhD student. I hate this uniquely American approach to life, like the ending of the famous Eminem song \"You can do anything you set your mind to, man\". No sometimes, you need to change your mind rather than hustling to do what's in there. Thank you for sharing this, stranger. I hope life treats you better after all of this.",

It's possible to earn a PhD, snag a TT position, compound expertise in a subfield of a discipline, and still lack wisdom.  Existing within a culture that shares one's shortsighted purview does not make one less shortsighted.  It simply highlights another person who verifies beliefs by gazing toward the dogmas of those around him or her.\n\nIn this job market, supporting oneself and finding pathways to joy are commendable.  OP's former department is irrelevant, both the petulant professors and the PhDs now adjuncting for minimum wage and no health insurance.",

The reason these states require more education is because most college professors aren't trained to teach folks who don't necessarily want to be there and don't necessarily want to learn. That isn't all high school students, but enough of a percentage that you would likely have some in almost every class. \n\nI would say, instead consider picking up a night/weekend class at the local community college. The students who come to night school are generally highly motivated. A community college job like that is uber-flexible and is really rewarding.   Honestly, teaching community college was one of the best jobs I have ever had (fyi: substitute teaching k-12 was one of the worst). \n\nAnd no parents and no standardized test.

(I remember hearing you can teach with a master's too, so maybe this is only California?) Bottom line, \n* **There's a program that will pay your tuition if you teach at Aspire charter in the day and take classes at night.** I interviewed for this but it seems like so much work that I wouldn't be able to freelance, meaning I'd need loans for living expenses. Also they reimburse you for every year you work at Aspire, but charter schools pay significantly less (though Aspire is one of the best). But I'm not convinced it's a better deal than just getting a second BA... Maybe it's faster because you do your apprenticeship at the same time?\n* **There's a program to get an alternative credential only to be a specialist** (eg drama, dance, PE, marketing, any elective). With a specialist degree you are credentialed to teach any specialist class, not just your specialty. So if user my cooking expertise to get a specialist credential I don't have to take a test to use it to teach PE.. A masters isn't required. I think it still costs over a thousand dollars but is very fast to get, but few specialist job openings because these jobs are usually given to full time teachers who already work in the school. \n* Anyone with a BA can become a substitute teacher. However it isn't stable income. \n\nThere may be other alternative credentialing programs in California or it maybe that for some reason the credentialing department wants to discourage their use. I'd love to find out otherwise because I don't want to take out student loans to get a second BA, but becoming a teacher is a more reliable job than I'd get from a PhD.",
