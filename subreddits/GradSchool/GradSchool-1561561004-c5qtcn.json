I submitted a 15 page grievance letter. I met with the dean of my school about two weeks ago and had a long discussion about where I am in the program and what I want to do about my grievance. Basically they pushed that I should withdraw the grievance on the condition they investigate the situation and help me graduate. The main reason being my adviser is retiring so any action against him is kinda moot.   \n\n\nYesterday I got an E-mail updating the situation. The dean has interview members of my committee and the department. He is in agreement that my adviser should be removed as chair of my committee and I should end direct communication with him. The dean is going to be a replacement chair for now. I'm going to run experiments for another two months or so then start to write. They're putting together a task force of a couple of professors to help me put together a dissertation, even if its nothing but negative results.   \n\n\nSo I'm now on track to graduate with no results and no publications. I've spend more time working the politics of my department than I have doing experiments. It's very clear that not just my adviser, but the department itself is broken and the chair of the department is working hard not to fix it, but sweep everything under the rug. I thought that getting School of Graduate Studies involved would change things, but I didn't realize how easily faculty can ignore someone from another school. Getting the dean involved and filing a formal grievance really opened things up.", "author": "hdorsettcase", "created": 1561561004, "retrieved": 1632846349, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 308, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"es532pj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/c5qtcn/update_submitted_a_formal_grievance_against_my/es532pj/", "text": "This is very interesting to me. I am not in the same situation but similar issues. My placement coordinator I feel for one reason or another trying to negatively impact my progress in my program through various interactions or had with her. It all became very obvious when right before my annual review she reached out to a placement I did over a year ago and told them to submit a formal rating of my overall progress, when they had already submitted a formal evaluation about the various different areas. She never did this with other students, she did this knowing I was going through a rough time during that placement (friend committed suicide). She did this knowing it would impact the annual review committees opinion of my progress with an overall rating rather then not, knowing that placements have a right to not give them. Anyways all that to say it impacted my annual review and I was going to put a formal appeal and explain things, I got scared and didn\u2019t.   I regret it now because I truly believe I have a strong case, and how inappropriate it was for her to do that and various other things that has severely impacted my progress in my program. I always am afraid to speak out or even complain because of retaliation, these people have so much power over us and I always get afraid that rubbing them the wrong way will only further aggravate them and make your situation much worse by putting a target on yourself as \u201cthat student\u201d. But maybe I\u2019m wrong and I should just do what I feel is right. I don\u2019t know I have such a hard time with this and feel so indecisive I always get close to passing that threshold but then pull back. Submitting a formal complaint and then I pulled back cause I got scared and then the formal appeal and then I pulled back cause of fear.", "author": "AmberAaliyah", "created": 1561600493, "upvotes": 1}, "es4reff": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/c5qtcn/update_submitted_a_formal_grievance_against_my/es4reff/", "text": "The university has a duty of care to support you when there is a breach of workplace conduct.

I, too, had a difficult advisor. She said I didn't have what it took to finish my PhD two weeks before I was set to defend. I also feel like I spent A LOT more time trying to prove to her that I was worthy of being her student than I actually felt supported by her.   \n\n\nI would definitely try to establish collaborations with other people in your department, or even in your field, in case you want to stay in academia. I only had one publication when I graduated last year; shocker, right? I actually did have what it took to graduate with my PhD. I also got a pretty sweet post-doc, and after a year, have secured a tenure-track position. Oh, and my pubs have multiplied. It seems like not having to constantly worry about being enough frees up mental space to actually be productive. I'll have 5 manuscripts under review by the end of the summer (4 currently under review, 1 more that I'm working on that is close to done).

Ultimately I think one of the most important things I learned in graduate school was dealing with issues like what you describe. When you start interviewing for jobs, you will be asked about working with people you have conflict with, dealing with political issues in the office, stuff like that. You should have a great answer prepared based on this, describing how you behaved in a very professional manner and followed the appropriate steps and got a generally positive result for everyone involved (sort of). To me, it would demonstrate that you could be a reliable person in whatever role you've applied for and respond professionally in high-stress, potentially emotional, situations.\n\nSo, in a sense, congratulations on dealing with an unprofessional department in a very professional way. Good luck with the rest of your studies.", "author": "rzr101", "created": 1561575471, "upvotes": 3}, "es3st1p": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/c5qtcn/update_submitted_a_formal_grievance_against_my/es3st1p/", "text": "I am really sorry that you've had to deal with this. I think that's the most important thing and I'm glad you mentioned it. No matter what *you should not have to deal with this shit*. Being a graduate student is hard. You work hard, you sometimes socialize less, you get paid jack shit. The absolute last thing you need is this. So I really cannot say it enough. I am sorry you have to deal with this. \n\nI myself am in a somewhat similar situation, so I feel this hard. My advisor has been manipulative and verbally abusive in the past. Fortunately I had meetings with a committee member and our graduate program coordinator, and we talked with the dean as well. So I have fallback plans in place and I am on track for what I need to do. For me it's only a 2 year program and I'm closer to the end than the beginning, but I often will be overcome with stressful thoughts about how I'm going to get work done and I remember that *my advisor went on sabbatical right after taking me on as a student and didn't tell me and disappeared with few exceptions for a fucking year*. Not to mention he has been an ass on more than one occasion. \n\nIt's always easy to justify bad behaviors or tell yourself \"this is just how grad school is\" but it's important to step up for yourself and you did it. The fact that we are perservering in the face of this proves we wer cut out for it and will be better professionals than our advisors ever were.\n\n\nAs an append: graduating under someone like this is an accomplishment regardless. If you have good relationships with your committee members and other faculty, letters of recommendation will explain this situation and a lack of tangible results or product will be very understandable.", "author": "JDaddyFly", "created": 1561569873, "upvotes": 19}, "es3rar9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/c5qtcn/update_submitted_a_formal_grievance_against_my/es3rar9/", "text": "I\u2019m so sorry.
