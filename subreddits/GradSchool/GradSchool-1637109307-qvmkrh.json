  "text": "Hello everyone! I was hoping to get some advice or personal experience regarding a future in neuroscience research/academia/business etc. \nCurrently, I\u2019m nearing the end of my MS program and had always planned to pursue a PhD in neuroscience. But, this last semester made me genuinely doubt if this is a future I want. While I\u2019m still a student and don\u2019t expect a high paying job in research/academia, I struggled to find any jobs related to my experiences. And even then after apply and feeling confident in interviews, I still haven\u2019t found been offered a position to start my future in the field. When I first began research, it was all I could ever see myself do now I feel like I do what I need to just because. I know I still love research and neuroscience, but I used to love it more. Am I just realizing this degree isn\u2019t for me or does everyone at some point question if their degree is worth the sacrifices they make? \nAnd if you felt how I feel now, what did you do? Are you happy or just content? \n*Not a post on imposter syndrome, just asking for anecdotal experiences in the professional fields of neuroscience*",

What did you expect from a masters?\n\nIt\u2019s very hard for internet strangers to tell you what **you** want",

          "text": "Thank you for your response! There\u2019s definitely burnout and discontent with my program. But I definitely am not asking for strangers to tell me what I should do, more so just looking for a reality check on what awaits after graduation. And while I specifically asked about neuroscience I\u2019m sure any research intensive program could relate.",

              "text": "If you were hoping to do a PhD then why were you looking for jobs? A masters in neuro doesn\u2019t provide really any value for the job market. It\u2019s equivalent to 2 years of research experience so you might as well have found a tech position for the same amount of time and made money instead of pay tuition. I know because I\u2019ve hired for research tech positions and we were explicitly told this by HR although we could overrule that since it was just guidance",

                  "text": "My BS degree was in industrial psychology, which didn\u2019t provide enough of an emphasis in neurobiology to prepare for a technician position. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t realize research was a direction I could go in until my senior year. I spoke to several departments directors at graduate schools I was interested in and was told I would have a better chance at acceptance in an MS program. And that going through this path would give me the foundation I would need for a PhD. I was looking for jobs because I personally have doubts about a life in academia and wanted perspective from being in a professional industry. And as you mentioned, the tuition is expensive. I have held several paid research assistant/specialist positions in the past, but at least in my area it is more financially profitable to work as a waitress/bartender. Which is ultimately where these doubts come from. I started my academic journey into research because I am passionate about the research and yet sacrificing a day of research means I am able to pay a bill early or add money to my savings.",

                      "text": "One unfortunate truth of academia is that it incredibly favors the privileged, financially or otherwise. You can be passionate about research but that has to be tempered by the reality that it\u2019s long hours for little pay. Most graduate students make only around $30k and are putting in 40-60 hour weeks for 5-7 years so they\u2019re either making a bit above minimum wage to below it. If your money is so tight that that\u2019s a problem for you, academia might not be for you. However, you can still totally work in research but it won\u2019t be independent work or leading a research group.\n\nPersonally, I worked for four years before my PhD saving up, paying loans, and putting away a nest egg that will be sufficient to retire on. I live comfortably on my $35k stipend in a big city but I live with roommates, have no debt, have no car, don\u2019t travel, and have no dependents. It might sound terrible to some but the research makes it worth it.",
