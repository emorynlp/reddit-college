  "title:": "Getting into an MBA without much work experience",
  "text": "I graduated in Finance from a non target school and I've been struggling to get hired. I have little job experience just a small internship and some projects during school. I wanted to apply to an MBA at a top school but I'm seeing their statistics and it says most applicants have about 5 years of experience.\n\nI was hoping the MBA would help me land a job but it looks like I won't even be accepted. Is it possible to get into an MBA program without work experience?",

      "text": "Even if admitted into a top MBA program (which is ridiculously unlikely without work experience but not impossible), you\u2019re only making your situation worse.\n\nHaving the MBA with too little experience will make finding work as hard or even harder than it is for you now. You\u2019re recruiting for much more advanced roles with the MBA - and so all of the jobs will require 5-8 years of experience anyways.",
