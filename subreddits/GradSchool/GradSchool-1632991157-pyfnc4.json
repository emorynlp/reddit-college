  "title:": "Need suggestion for 1 section of my Personal statement",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently writing a personal statement for a professional grad school program. To be specific, it\u2019s for a Masters in Science in counseling. The programs I\u2019m applying for will give me the educational requirements to become a marriage and family therapist (MFT) in the state of California. Most of the personal statement objectives ask for life experiences etc.However, I find myself stumbling upon this question:\n\nDiscuss your long-term professional goals and how you believe this program will prepare you for them \n\nFYI, my paper has to be 3,000 words. That\u2019s about 6 pages single spaced. This questions isn\u2019t my entire paper but it at least needs to be a page or so. Im not sure what to write. I have ideas but would love to hear anybody\u2019s feedback or examples of what they wrote for the same or similar programs (MSW, MFT etc.). Thank you in advance.",

          "text": "I mean I know what kind of jobs or demographic I want to work with but I\u2019m not sure how to write it out and how detailed I should be. \n\nI currently work as a behavioral therapist so I want to keep working with children but it a different context (psychotherapy). I have a lot experience with play therapy so I want to continue what I do but to treat mental Heath disorders in children.  I want to prepare me self for the MFT exam so I can licensed in CA as a marriage and family therapist so I can open my own private agency that specializes in counseling for children. \n\nAre they looking for something along those lines?  But in much greater detail. I\u2019m sorry I have a learning disability so sometimes I can overthink a simple question.",
