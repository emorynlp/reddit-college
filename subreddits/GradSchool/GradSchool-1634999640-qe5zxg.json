  "text": "I miss college, but I'm not 100% ready to commit again. When I first started my 4 year I eased in with just a class or two before deciding to go all in. \n\nI know grad school is no joke, but is it possible to ease into it? Maybe start with just a class to see how I like it? Or is that unreasonable because of the different culture in grad school ?",

The only problem that comes to mind is that if you are receiving financial aid, it can sometimes be an issue to be studying part-time rather than full-time.",

      "text": "For Master's programs, this is almost certainly possible. Some form of part-time classes has become pretty standard.\n\nFor PhDs, it is a lot more iffy and really depends on the specific university, group, and project. It was comparatively rare to see part-time PhD students, but not unheard of. In my case though, all of them where doing research in their day job that was directly related. So for example, they'd work for 3 days/week at a large chemical company, and 2 days/week at a university. However their project was then always a cooperation between the company and the university.",

The main concern would be that there may be a max number of years you can spend on a masters or PhD even if part-time and unfunded (at my school in my program it's 5 years as a masters and 10 years for a PhD, and that includes gap years if people take no classes.) If doing a thesis based masters you'd need to clearly communicate planning on starting part time with your advisor. Culturally it wouldn't be weird at my school at least, it's not uncommon to work while going to grad school and people are at much more varied stages of life compared to undergrad.",

I\u2019m only saying this because, again, depending on what you want to do, taking classes might not be a representative simulation of grad school.",
