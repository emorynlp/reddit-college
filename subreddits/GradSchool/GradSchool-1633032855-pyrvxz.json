  "text": "Practically done with my PhD. Almost there! In the mean time I am applying for industry jobs.\n\nI am an expert in a subject super cool in academia, super duper cool in pop science, but with not much use for industry.\n\nI am trying to upskill myself for some jobs I am interested into. I expect I am going to study for a few months. I am so stressed, as I did not manage to save money during my PhD. Time is very tight.\n\nEven with the skills, most of the jobs will not interview me due to my lack of qualifications. Believe me. I applied even to some basic ones. Nothing.\n\nI am super sure that if one of the jobs I like made me an offer I would do with high probability very well. I know myself. \\[My unique data point: I did once an internship with no background or qualifications in a completely unrelated area, and got a job offer. (other data point similar situation and they were very pleased)\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing at this pace, I predict that for my case it would take probably four or five months to get a job. Too long time!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, my understanding is that there is a secret market for jobs, where you would not have to do an interview. How the heck do you find these?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, just needed to decompress a bit.",

      "text": "I can't speak from experience on this matter, but I was recently told by a career counselor that one way you can access the hidden job market is by getting in touch with an alum in your field who has the type of job you want, basically get to know them and ask them about the industry. If you can establish a good working relationship with this person, they can be an \"in\" for you when companies start thinking about hiring.",
