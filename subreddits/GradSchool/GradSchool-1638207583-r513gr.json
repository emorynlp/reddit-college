  "text": "I think higher ed is such horseshit. It is crunch time rn in my program and I have 3 papers and one project on one class, one huge project in another, and 2 huge projects in my third class, all due in the next two weeks. On top of that I\u2019m required to go to class as in 2 of my 3 classes participation is 40% of my grade. For both of those two classes I have to read a book a week. If I don\u2019t at least power skim the texts, and I\u2019m not prepared to participate, my dickhead professor will give me a 0 for the day (same one for both classes, also my advisor).\n\nI\u2019m losing my fucking mind. How can anyone assign this much work and sleep at night thinking they are doing a good job. \u201cIt\u2019s grad school, it\u2019s supposed to be hard.\u201d Yeah well this is beyond hard, this is stupid. Oh you\u2019re not able to multitask inhuman amounts of work and attend 3 classes a week? Better apply for a job at Starbucks you fucking loser.\n\nFuck grad school. Fuck higher ed. I\u2019m studying to be a teacher in a state where an MA is required and we have a teacher shortage. Wonder why. $50k a year salary at the end of this shit tunnel. \n\nI\u2019m gonna do it because i have to and I want to be a teacher, but the higher ed system is an ego driven nightmare that completely ignores the human condition, and is in serious need of reform. \n\nSorry for the incoherent rant.",
