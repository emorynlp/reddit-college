  "text": "**Background:**\n\nI just started my first semester of a Physics M.S./Ph.D. program this August. I completed my B.S. in Physics in the spring and wanted to keep the momentum going forward. I also have a job with NASA's Pathways program (I get to have seasonal employment so long as I am in education). \n\nI have recently been falling behind in classes and I just had my first of 3 midterms and ended up losing points by second-guessing myself. I can feel myself slipping. Idk what to do because if I drop out then I lose my job at NASA which is the whole reason I went to Grad School. I am having serious doubts that I will be able to do well this semester and I am wondering if I can pass the following semesters without losing my sanity. \n\nI don't know what to do.",

The the difference is core at my uni for phd and ms is that ms only requires QM1 whereas phd requires QM 1&2, and you have to take an addition 12-16 hours(I think) of electives that are not research/dissertation hours to get the ms lumped in.. but still also have to meet the minimum research hours for PhD\u2026 if planned ahead it can be easily done \n\nBut yeah most just say, PhD program \u2026 generally the only time I hear ms/PhD is when it\u2019s a mandatory stepping stone",

There is little hope or aid, you simply have to persevere. The next semester will be similar, but after that the pressure will begin to let off. The second year will not be as bad as the first. I had to late drop a course I was on path to fail and ended up making it through, so adjust as you can, but keep going.",
