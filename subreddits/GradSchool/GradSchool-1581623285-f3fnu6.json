My advisor gave some really good ideas for innovative experiments, but creativity is something I've always struggled with.  Senior grad students and postdocs also seem to think of alternative strategies to some of my approaches.  I felt downtrodden because I'm not at that stage of really innovative thinking in my approaches and hypotheses yet, as a 2nd year PhD student, and of course the imposter syndrome started creeping in.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking this way, remind yourself that your advisor has years of experience thinking of innovative approaches to science.  The senior graduate students and postdocs have more experience in this.  At least, it made me feel better that creativity is a skill that takes practice and my lab peers, advisor included, have more experience in this area than I do.", "author": "trashpandalikespizza", "created": 1581623285, "retrieved": 1632953381, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 519, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fhmg3jj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f3fnu6/younger_grad_students_reminder_to_not_compare/fhmg3jj/", "text": "It's ok; with experience in a domain comes creativity.\n\nAlso, some people are better building off of ideas than coming up with completely novel ideas.
