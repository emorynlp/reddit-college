  "text": "Why do I feel guilty about taking mini weekend getaways to travel and enjoy life outside of my Ph.D. program? My advisor just says \u201cOkay.\u201d whenever I let them know but it feels weird every time I announce that I\u2019m going out of town. Anyone else feel like this?",

          "text": "Not the OP, but for me the issue is that sometimes I need to run experiments over the weekend but it\u2019s very unpredictable (share equipment with another group, and equipment needs to be run continuously.)   So it needs to be communicated in advance even when I\u2019m not going to be \u2018missing work\u2019 because otherwise I\u2019m going to be potentially leaving everyone in a lurch the week before when we\u2019re scheduling the experiments for the next week.\n\nIt\u2019s not the sort of thing I can say \u2018well, I\u2019ll just work extra hard and schedule well and finish my experiment early for this weekend\u2019 because equipment time is the limiting factor, and other people\u2019s experiments sometimes run long or finish early.",

I only announce it if I'm missing work and 99% of the time I can make time during the week. \n\nIf it's just the culture in your lab to work too much, it can be really difficult to reject it, but your health and mental wellbeing is not only more important than your work, it also directly affects the quality of your work. You shouldn't feel bad at all about staying sane and enjoying life.",
