  "text": "I\u2019m completing my master\u2019s degree right now (late due to covid) and will finish my stats class this December. I don\u2019t have any other stats on my transcripts and my math grades as an undergrad weren\u2019t awesome. I\u2019m not submitting GRE scores because I\u2019m basically busy and poor and they aren\u2019t required. Stats is required by all of my programs. \n\nI\u2019m worried this this combo may sink me. I\u2019ve mentioned that I am conducting this analysis as my current project in my essays. Should I contact the programs and offer to send updated transcripts when I\u2019m done maybe?",
