  "title:": "Salary for a PhD in Shanghai (High Energy Physics)",
  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am currently applying to PhD programs, and going abroad is one of my - if not the - major criteria. In particular, I really want to live in China for a while, and found an interesting proposition in Shanghai (high energy physics, collaboration with American and Swiss universities). And yes I know what it entails to live in East Asia, learn an ideogram based language and leave your cocoon of Western ideas  and way of life.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is the pay. I suppose that I should be able to get a scholarship because I graduated from a difficult master of the first French university (according to international standards, the national ones are really different). However, it seems like the average salary lies around CNY 4k ($620), 6k if I'm lucky. But Shanghai doesn't seem that cheap to live in, and I'm concerned about spending three years really underpaid. Especially considering the very high salaries common in Northern Europe where I could go. Excluding rent I can live with 1k CNY / month in Paris but that's me being ascetic. I am not trying to gather a fortune, simply live comfortably,  explore the country and not leave poorer than I came. \n\nCan anyone who has worked in China give me their perspective? I'm mostly concerned about the monetary issue, but any other aspect is welcomed.\n\nI know that this question has been asked around a few times, but some of the answers are starting to get quite old and China is moving fast.",
