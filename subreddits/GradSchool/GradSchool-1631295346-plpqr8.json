  "title:": "When to get recommendation letters?",
  "text": "After seeing a class syllabus mention about asking for recommendation letters, I just thought I should ask this question.\n\nI intend to graduate in May 2023 and get into graduate school from September 2023, most likely for an MSc in Statistics.\n\nIf I were to apply around December 2022, and my class is this term, when should I ask for recommendation letters?\n\n1. Ask around December 2021 and explain that I intend to apply for grad school next year\n2. Ask around December 2022 when I intend to apply for grad school (but this may be a rather tight schedule)\n3. Ask in between those times, say in June 2022",

          "text": "Alright, that sounds good. I take it that even though that is ideal I can still ask for one if the class ends (and grades come out) in December 2022 with applications in January 2023, especially as the syllabus seems to imply that.",
