Is everything okay?\" \n\nWe gotta ask ourselves, \"What is happening to this student?\" ... NOT \"Whats wrong with this student?\"\n\nI also make it clear that I don't need details. Seriously. The types of things students have disclosed to me for fear of not being believed is bothersome. That shouldn't be necessary.\n\nAnd now that we are looking at undergrads as humans, I'll add my final 2 cents about late work and punitive measures. Might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't deduct points for late work. What are you measuring compliance to rules or comprehension of material? For me, I let students know for however long it takes for them to submit something is how long I'll give myself to grade it. Those students that are in a lull and need support will follow through beyond the bad week they had. The students that just don't turn things in, will continue to not turn things in. \n\nThats my PSA.

Symptoms of sternum pain can be unbearable at times which I still need to find out if gerd is causing all of this. My last 2 semesters of my undergraduate I asked the school if I can do everything virtually due to the pandemic and fear of getting sick with a preexisting condition. Some teachers understood my problems and stated they will give extra time and some professors just graded harshly regardless of your problems, but all in all I\u2019m still graduating so it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nMoral of the story is, as teachers we should try to understand what the student is going through as we are all human and should be sympathetic or empathetic towards others. I already signed up for my masters and got accepted online through Grand Canyon university but will see how my health issues hold up. I do one day want to work in college or work in the government and will always have in mind to always try to understand the other person before judging or giving them a grade.

I was struggling to balance school work and dealing with my mom's declining health situation.  I recall specifically that I told one of my professors about my mom's situation and at the last week on Finals, I asked him via email if I could turn in all the work that I missed out on.  During my section's final exam, he read my email out loud (not saying my name).  I was so shock that someone would do something like that and I couldn't focus on my exam.  After I handed in my exam, he says \"Hey [name], it was a pleasure having you in my class\".  I didn't respond.  \n\nThat same semester, I fell behind on the final project for another class (even though I turned in all prior assignments on time, would often ask for his help during class and office hours, and did well on them).  During class, I hear him talking to another student and from their conversation, it sounds like she had a family issue at home and he seemed to be understanding about giving her extra time to turn in her work.  I ask him for additional time on my project and he tells me to come with him to his office.  He doesn't ask me about my situation at all.  He proceeds to yell at me very loudly and says \"oh, too busy slacking off at on your vacation?\" (I didn't show up to class some days because I was trying to catch up on work while taking care of my mom).  I just didn't say anything and gave into whatever he was saying because I just wanted to finish this project and pass the class.  \n\nI think I posted about this in the past on my school's subreddit and some people don't seem to care and they always try to defend the professor's side.

Yes, it took some extra work on my  end to issue them an incomplete and accept late work after the course ended, but that was fine with me because this case required compassion.
