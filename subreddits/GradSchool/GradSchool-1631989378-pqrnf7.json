I am an MS student in my first semester of graduate school (STEM, USA). To preface this post, I am extremely proud of where I am and feel fortunate that I have the means to go to grad school. My advisor is great, my lab is great, and the program is excellent. I have no prior publications, very minimal research experience, and minimal academic contacts outside of my undergrad institution. I also took some time off after undergrad to work in my field and gain some experience.\n\nI'm already good friends with another grad student in my lab who is in their first semester as well and am excited to work together/learn from them since they have more experience in our field! They are an international student and essentially went straight from undergrad -> grad school. What confuses me/makes me feel unproductive is that they have like 3 publications (one first author) and a ton of other papers they are collaborating on in the works or under review, all from undergrad. They also have contacts all over the world, which is awesome and I'm super happy for them! They have been doing amazing work. \n\nAdmittedly, I haven't been very proactive about growing my network or doing research until now. I do plan on having some manuscripts submitted or published by the time I graduate and have started networking more, so it's not like I'm not working hard now to make up for lost time. I'm not really sure if I have a question after putting this into writing but is it normal for some students to have so many contacts and publications from undergrad? It just makes me feel like a slacker lol.\n\nTl;dr My program and new labmate are great, but they have a lot of publications from undergrad while I have none, making me feel like a slacker sometimes.\n\nSide note: My labmate is super gracious and wants to help me grow my own network/publications. They asked if I want to collaborate on a couple of their projects (I would like them to collaborate on some of my projects in the future as well) and have given me some good contacts so far, which I am very grateful for!", "author": "eeel12345", "created": 1631989378, "retrieved": 1632952272, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdje4fz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqrnf7/ms_student_questioning_my_publication_record_or/hdje4fz/", "text": "People come into grad school from really different places in life, you have no idea what circumstances and what luck got them the kinds of opportunities they were able to take advantage of, or what life circumstances enabled them to take advantage of opportunities. People aren\u2019t starting the grad school race from the same starting line the way you do in undergrad, where everyone has come out of high school and is starting with a relatively clean slate. Also luck does play a really big role- getting the right connections who happen to have resources and are going to make sure a paper get published.

I'm one of the go-to people to come to for coding skills now, and I've lead quite a few statistical workshops for both younger and older students. Publications really aren't a good indicator of value, and connections are great but also not really necessary especially at this level. The point isn't me bragging, because even within my program there are a lot of students who are more advanced than me and have far more publications, but just that the expectation of grad school is that you'll grow and develop the skills you need. It's great to come in with some of them, but the expectation is that you're doing grad school because you need to develop those skills.", "author": "DonHedger", "created": 1632063686, "upvotes": 1}, "hdettwu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqrnf7/ms_student_questioning_my_publication_record_or/hdettwu/", "text": "That\u2019s going to happen.  When I was applying to grad school I had 4 pubs under my name, worked for a major pharmaceutical company, and was going to graduate with an MS. My labmate: no pubs, BS degree, no job experience at all; got into a top tier school. Unfortunately the selection process at some universities is really arcane and it\u2019s sometimes controlled by an \u2018old boys\u2019 club. Regardless, I\u2019m happy that I landed where I am now.  \n\nDon\u2019t worry and don\u2019t try to compare yourself to others.  My old labmate is great and she totally deserves to be where she is.  However, I do believe that the selection process should be public and that students should be notified of the metrics they were inadequate in.", "author": "chemistrybae", "created": 1632017476, "upvotes": 5}}}
