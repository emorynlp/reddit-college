It\u2019s hard to prepare daily hour-long material from scratch and have it be interesting/useful. But how do I answer questions with more authority? Is it like, a tone of voice thing? And now I have to be conscientious of that next time I\u2019m in front of a classroom because apparently I don\u2019t answer questions with enough natural authority. \n\nI appreciate the second comment pointing that out. It\u2019s true, there were some guys who were pretty rude, but it didn\u2019t bother me until just now because now I guess it (understandably) bothered a lot of people in the class too. Which is like, okay, cool, now instead of just ignoring people\u2019s bullshit I\u2019ve got to stamp it down. Will I be seen as a bitchy ruthless human being? Hm. \n\nI held office hours, I held extra office hours, I answered emails quickly, and I had decent attendance in my sections. I had students (all girls) ask me if they could meet with me one-on-one for better help understanding the material. (The other TA - who is a really nice guy - wasn\u2019t approached by anyone for that. Oh, also in case you\u2019re curious, my TA evals were lower than his but I\u2019m not taking that personally since he\u2019s objectively more comfortable with the material than I was.)\n\nAnyways. I worked hard to be a decent TA, and my ratings were like, *just* barely over the absolute middle of the scale, cool. I know I shouldn\u2019t take this as a lesson to not give a fuck about helping my students later - I mean, why teach just for the evals?, but, well, it\u2019s tough to realize that I can\u2019t ignore my gender when I teach. Now I\u2019ve got to teach and be more authoritative and get male students to respect me, or at least shut up?? Of course, maybe a male version of exactly me would have still gotten those comments. Regardless, this story is the tamest of gender-related stories in my field (if even), and I\u2019m afraid of my existence as a woman becoming more difficult and putting me in more objectively unfair situations if I stick with academia. It\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m tired. I wish I were stronger and better.

I had a whole class to analyze how she did it.\n\n1. Body language. She did what you're not supposed to do, which is used closed off body language. She crossed her arms, leaned against furniture and crossed her legs, held her head just a tad higher than she needed to, and kept her face tense. This plus her soft but clear tone of voice just didn't brook any disrespect. She was occasionally funny and she was kind, but she was the kind of professor you would be scared to mouth off to. The energy in the class was palpably deferential. Think McGonagal.\n\n2. Looks -- she had a buzz cut, and while she wore dresses, they were plain, dark colored, and draped well. Think MM LaFleur's line of dresses. She wore boots very often. \n\n3. Student interaction -- she called on students by name if participation wasn't going well. She had every moment of the lecture planned, and she made students interact.\n\n4. She made her preferences requirements. If she preferred an essay to be organized a certain way, it was a requirement. She had an off-limits topic list. She made the class bearable for herself by simply forcing them to not do the things she wanted. She had required office hours for essay revisions. If there was a requirement for a paper and you didn't do it, she wouldn't accept it.\n\nMale professors and lecturers have authority just by walking into the room. Women have to magic it up. That's just how it works :(. \n\nI do things slightly differently. I'm still very new to teaching, and my first semester I had horrible authority problems. I threw out all the funny or personable touches on my syllabus, wrote in a very harsh late policy, and came right out of the gate on syllabus day hammering hard the no late policy and the plagiarism policy. \n\nThen I relaxed a little and made my clear nerdiness my appeal to authority. If I joke about how much I love grammar and go into little side rants about the literature and theory I enjoy, it intimidates them a little bit. I wear a carefully curated wardrobe, lots of blacks and mostly neutrals. I don't wear anything that reads feminine. I have huge tortoiseshell glasses and over-sized sweaters. I chug coffee while lecturing.

I make jokes about it with the students, which they like. I'm actually not in a male-dominated field but I TA for a required course and teach an intro to gender course as the instructor of record. I generally have a few students who are men who try to mess with me. For example, I've had a couple over the years ask me out in front of the class as a clear way to fluster me, as you've said. I get a couple of evaluations that say I'm \"intimidating.\"\n\nThe truth is, I am a little bit intimidating on purpose, so it definitely doesn't bother me. I am kind and I am sympathetic to them, but I don't let them mess with me. I set boundaries and I stick to them. I turn around a lot of their trying to fluster me on them by asking a lot of whys or for them to explain what they mean.\n\nMy advice is to take the constructive from the evaluations, and fuck the rest. I put all my nice evaluations on a document and that's what I focus on. Do what feels comfortable for you and find your own groove. Don't be more authoritative if that's not who you are. Be honest with them. Tell those students that their behavior is not appropriate and is disrupting other student's learning.

Don't bother being more assertive, the evaluations will just shift from \"not confident enough\" to \"full of herself\" and whatnot. What I discovered I've been doing is that I've been deepening my voice - to the point that, when I started getting singing lessons, my teachers were impressed at how different my speaking voice was from my singing voice (I speak like a contralto, and sing as a soprano). It was never on purpose; I just instinctively deepened my voice during teaching so that I would be taken more seriously. Try that just a little bit, as it can damage your voice.\n\nWhat I can recommend is that you prepare as much as you can before sections. Know what you're going to teach and the extra mile after it.
