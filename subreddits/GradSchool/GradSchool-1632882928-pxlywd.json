I want to find an intersection of both for my career except I don\u2019t know what that is. Intellectual Property seems like an obvious answer, but I\u2019d like to be slightly more involved in research than what that job seems to entail. \n\nIn a perfect world, I would operate as a PI/co-I that also has the legal savvy to also review materials for patent applications. Would that just be a patent examiner? Can you even do both of those at the same time?
