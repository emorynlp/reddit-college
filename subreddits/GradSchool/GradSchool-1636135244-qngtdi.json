  "title:": "Feeling lost",
  "text": "So I've been pursuing my masters now for like a year and a half. Most students finish in about two years. \nAnd my mental health is horrible. It started going downhill once I started focusing on my thesis research (last May). I was also diagnosed autistic around this time and decided to incorporate autism into my thesis (probably not a great idea since it's such a new and sensitive area for me).\n\nAnyway, I won't go into all of the details. But I only just realized long, ambiguous projects really aren't good for my extreme need for routine and structure. Every time I've taken on something like this my mental health really suffers and for once I think I shouldn't keep doing this to myself. \n\nBut I'm so torn. Maybe I could make it so my research is easier for me to do? Maybe I could switch to a research essay or course work instead? I feel like a huge failure. Everyone thought I would rock academia. I love coursework, I get straight A+s. Anything else is like a huge mental block and I end up avoiding and so unmotivated. \n\nAny advice appreciated.",

      "text": "Hi friend! I totally get this! Feeling lost is normal, it\u2019s great that you vocalized it! The best decision I made in grad school- I\u2019m repeating a class- was be transparent with my professors and seek out a therapist and meds. My life isn\u2019t perfect but I feel a lot better now. I still feel lost sometimes but talking about it abs being authentic about where I am in life helps.",
