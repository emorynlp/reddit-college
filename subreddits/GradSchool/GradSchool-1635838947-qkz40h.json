I always get grades that are bang average.  \n\n\nI look at the means and the modes shared via our school\u2019s portals.  \n\n\nAnd it really confuses me and stresses me out and I have no fucking clue about what is happening.",

There is a lot of variation among students. \n\nWhile this skill doesn't have a lot of independent value, it helps a lot when tests are used to assess how well you understand the material. The person who most needs an accurate assessment is you.",
