  "title:": "Grants that expect continued participation after funding stops",
  "text": "So I had funding for one year from a training program that disperses federal funds, and now that I'm further along in my program I don't qualify for reapplication, since the funds are meant for early PhD students. The program, however, expects continued participation in all events from anyone who has received funding until they finish their PhD. So things like attending socials, \"volunteering\" to organize events and/or help maintain their website, presenting your research at their seminars, etc.\n\nI was wondering how other people who have had a similar experience feel about this setup? Honestly I think it seems pretty exploitative to require this participation after the funding stops. Since I am no longer being funded by the program, I instead have to obtain my funding through other responsibilities, and participating in a program that is no longer paying me just adds to my workload with pretty much zero benefit to me.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience? Do you think these sorts of expectations are reasonable?",
