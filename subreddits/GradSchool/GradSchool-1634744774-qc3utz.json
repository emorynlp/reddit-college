  "text": "Hi there,\n\nI've done Bachelors in Industrial Engineering with majors in Operations Management and Supply Chain and I'm hoping to apply for MS in IE. \nI've always wanted to study in US but I have low GPA in my bachelor's (borderline 3.00) so I don't know if I'm eligible to apply, nonetheless I really want to apply (fingers crossed). The thing is I don't know which College would be better for me considering my low GPA. Can somebody guide me in which universities I could apply, which have better IE Gradute Courses, moreover a university from which after doing MS in IE I could have better future career aspects.\n\nI would really appreciate it if someone could help me.\n\nThank you\n\n\nTL DR: can someone tell me which universities I could apply for MS in Industrial Engineering with a low GPA in bachelors ( not that low, but still...)",
