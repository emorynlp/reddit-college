  "title:": "Dad died before I could finish, feeling very guilty",
  "text": "I'm in semester 9 of my phd, not counting summers. I went back to school after raising kids. I am ABD but this past year has knocked me on my ass. I'm a divorced single mom, and 2 of my teenagers were in separate accidents and both almost died. At one point I was visiting my son in the morning, driving an hour to school to teach, and driving an hour the other way to visit my daughter in a separate hospital. I've been adjuncting but my university just cut all adjuncts due to Covid, so my actual research isn't getting done and I've only gotten one first author paper out. I just recovered from this past lovely semester, got my CV refreshed, and was working on my non-academic resume. My parents have helped me by paying my rent the past 3 years, and my dad really wanted to see me get my degree. I've just turned around and gotten organized to dive back into research (one kid still in hospital), and my father died suddenly.  \n\nI am really beating myself up for not being able to keep it together and graduate on time...even though I wouldn't have had a grad ceremony anyway. He really wanted to see me finish and now he never will, and I just keep thinking that I let him down. There is only one of me and there is no way I could take care of my kids and teach and get done in time. I feel horribly guilty for being 'lazy' and not being done in time. His death was very unexpected and this just doesn't feel real...except the guilt. the guilt feels very real.\n\nETA: Thank you everybody, it's been a tough week so far. Reading this helps.\nAnd gold? Thank you! Go hug your best grad school cheerleader for me.",

I would bet your dad is proud of you for how you\u2019ve persisted through all of your studies; the graduation is just the world acknowledging what he already saw in you from day one. His pride in you probably has been already been as strong as the pride he would have shown you on graduation day. \n\nAlso I strongly think your dad will be there when you graduate. I have had a similar experience of sadness and grief at a key, culminating event, with my family member passing before it happened, and I had an experience during the event that leaves me a decade later absolutely certain he was there in some form. \n\nAs a random stranger, I also want to validate your hard work and tenacity, so I hope you post on this thread when you officially graduate!",

One of the crucial lessons I learned in grad school was when my friend told me to remove \"graduate on time\" from my vocabulary.  Every PhD is different, and there's no set time frame.  Mine took 6 years.  Finishing your PhD on any timeline is so impressive, and there's no doubt your dad would be proud.\n\nOne of my close friends lost his dad during his PhD and ended up delaying his graduation quite a bit because of his time grieving.  He told me that what got him through it was the thought of writing \"Dedicated to my father\" on the dedication page.",

And, even if it might not feel like it right now, try to believe me that you are the furthest thing from lazy, and you are handling an unimaginable situation with grace. My rough year has involved my father dying from cancer earlier this year, my stepfather still battling cancer, and my mom struggling with health issues of her own. My dad was so looking forward to seeing me graduate (I'm literally writing my thesis now), and now I feel like I'm in a similar race to get there before I lose my remaining parents. I can't say I've handled this perfectly or fully processed it, but there have been a few things that have helped: taking time for myself, creating my own schedule however possible, talking to friends and a professional therapist, and constantly repeating to myself that I will get through this and that I'm not ruining this. At the very least, I hope it brings you even the tiniest bit of comfort to know that you aren't alone, and we will get through this.",

      "text": "My single mother died in a car accident/possible suicide in my 4th year as a grad student. Ended up failing out that following semester and am ABD for now, not sure if I ever really want to finish a PhD elsewhere.\n\nBeing a couple years after it now, I just started a research scientist job without the PhD and only using my masters. Not sure how that has impacted where my colleagues see me yet as lockdowns started a couple weeks after job started. In any case, something worked out with time though that first year of grief was still a haze and when I try to remember it, I definitely wasn't all there lost in a cloud of rumination and wasn't motivated to do research at all.\n\nA lot of that stemmed from guilt in not being with my mom as much during the unforseen last year of her life, instead focusing on my studies rather than family. I didn't respond to her last text asking for help, needing to get out of a separate issue with a family matter and instead dove into a research report due the next day. The text remains unreturned. The idea that she \"got out\" by choice still haunts me but I try to learn from it today by prioritizing the real people more important in my life and not beat myself up for circumstances outside my control.\n\nI do relate in that my own mother always believed and supported me towards finishing that PhD. I feel sad that I wasn't able to live that out. But she did always say that \"You'll miss me when I'm gone.\" And damn do I still miss her. I think she would understand the difficulty I had in finishing knowing how she would sometimes reflect on her own mother's death and mental health issues. So I don't necessarily see her continuing to pressure me from above to finish, especially if said PhD programs don't often support and tend to actually exacerbate issues of mental health, particularly during the isolating period of late stage dissertation writing.\n\nI share all of this just to encourage you to take things at your own pace. You're already amazing raising kids, working towards a PhD, and grieving with grace all at the same time. I can't guarantee that these next few months or years won't be messy but I'm still confident things will work out. Maybe not as you planned and maybe not as your father planned. But you're not chained to past expectations. Do what's best for you and take things as they come.",
