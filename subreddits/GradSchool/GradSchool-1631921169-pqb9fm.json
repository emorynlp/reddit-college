In fact, I\u2019ve only had one professor so far who makes his own exam and I\u2019ve taken 15 credits so far. The rest just used pre-made questions from Pearson or whatever third party academic program the class is using. \n\nI do recommend reaching out to your professor and respectfully asking about the formatting of the exam. That way you have some idea of what you\u2019re walking into (ex. multiple choice, true vs false, open ended, specific concepts from chapter, how many questions, etc).\n\nI also like to do practice questions in the textbook for whatever chapter we\u2019re on (along with homework, of course). \n\nJust relax, always use the restroom before your exam (some may end your testing session if you leave) and if you have questions about the material, ask them in advance, not minutes before the exam. If you\u2019re completing the homework successfully, you\u2019ll do fine.", "author": "iheartluxury", "created": 1632110921, "upvotes": 1}}}
