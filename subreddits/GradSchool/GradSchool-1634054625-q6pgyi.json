  "title:": "Penn Experience Lab Worth It?",
  "text": "No idea if this is the right place to post about this b/c the Experience Lab isn\u2019t a form of grad school but more like grad \u201cexperience,\u201d but it\u2019s a fairly new program and there aren\u2019t a lot of testimonials to be found.\n\nAnyway, I graduated this summer with a B.A. in English and Government (ugh, I know). I kinda bumbled my through college and ended up with a pretty mediocre resume, so I\u2019m having a difficult time finding jobs. I\u2019ve been intrigued by [Penn\u2019s Experience Lab](https://explab.sas.upenn.edu/what-is-exp-lab/), which essentially offers a \u201cpost-college experience\u201d working with start-ups as a sort of professional springboard. There\u2019s an \\~$18,000 price tag, give or take some thousands through aid, but **regardless** of the hefty sum, does it seem like it would be a worthwhile thing to pursue in order to launch my career? Has anyone done it who might be able to offer insight?",
