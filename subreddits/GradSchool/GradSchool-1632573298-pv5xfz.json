It\u2019s been drilled into us to use a strengths based approach with our (future) clients. Yet professors do not practice what they preach. Feedback constantly focuses on what is wrong and does not acknowledge anything positive. The only time positive feedback is given if something is flawless which, less face it, in academia it almost never is - according to at least one person.  Yet, they tell us it\u2019s not about the grades it\u2019s about the \u2018learning\u2019, but oh, If you get a B or lower you have to retake the class and we only offer them once a year because we have a cohort model so you\u2019ll not graduate on time. But please, leave your perfectionism behind, it\u2019s unhealthy and no one is perfect. Except that we expect you to be. And don\u2019t forget to advocate for yourself! Just not to any of us. But we\u2019re here for you and really care about your ~~well-being~~ tuition checks. \n\n\nThe hypocrisy of studying a mental health profession in graduate school with a climate that is toxic and not at all supportive\u2026\u2026", "author": "princessofgamehendge", "created": 1632573298, "retrieved": 1632843973, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hec4wub": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pv5xfz/is_anyone_elses_program_super_unsupportive_rant/hec4wub/", "text": "Idk if this will help, it sounds like a shitty situation to be honest. But I am very sensitive and my advisor told me 1 thing that did change my perspective. She said, take criticism and treasure it. It is valuable and most people will not care enough about you to give it to you. When your committee criticizes your work, they are taking their valuable time and trying to help you improve by telling you the mistakes. Few people in life will give you unfiltered critisidm of your work so as bad as it may feel, in a way you are also lucky to be getting it. I had 1 faculty member that was fairly nice in person but never wrote positive things on my papers. In the end I think they just don\u2019t value praise because it\u2019s already correct so why should they waste their time? (I don\u2019t agree but I understand)\n\n2nd thing is they they are not criticizing you but your work. And you are NOT your work. I have trouble with feeling tied to my work so I get really down if it isn\u2019t good. But it\u2019s unhealthy, you are a student for a reason and your work is a constant improvement while YOU are already worthwhile as a person\n\nHope you feel better.

Instead of having mandatory orientations every year for graduate students to learn how to grade, how to answer student questions, and how to handle students with difficult circumstances, I think faculty should be required to attend a week-long orientation every semester that covers this exact thing.
