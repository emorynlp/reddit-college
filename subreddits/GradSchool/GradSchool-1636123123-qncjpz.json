  "title:": "Applying for a PhD in Mechanical Engineering with undergrad in Chemical Engineering",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm a chemical engineering undergrad currently going through the process of grad school applications. My research interests and experiences lie along the lines of computational fluid dynamics and reactive flows, which tend to be covered by the mechanical engineering programs of most universities.\n\nI just wanna know if this scenario is at all common, and would it hurt my chances of getting into grad school if I apply to these mechanical engineering departments? This is considering the fact that I would have to compete against undergrads in mechanical engineering. \n\nI have looked at the research areas covered by the ChemE departments of these unis as well, but my interests tend to align better with the research being done in Mechanical Engineering.",
