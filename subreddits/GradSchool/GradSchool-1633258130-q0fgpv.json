  "text": "to put it simply, i found that i have made errors when coding my data which frustrates me as I have went through at least 3 rounds of checking before proceeding to writing my analysis. I thought i have checked it enough (apparently not) and was quite confident about it  Also it made me anxious as correcting the errors would take at least a few more months and I am dreading the extended time.\n\nHowever, I am trying to calm myself down by thinking that an extra few months might be dreadful but at least I have a somewhat clear conscience by doing things as accurately and honestly as I could. Also i try to remind myself that doing my masters or at any level really., mistakes are bound to happen. I have emailed my supervisor and informed them about the potential delay so I'm just waiting for their response.\n\nAfter the initial few hours of panicking and anxiety, I think I am more relaxed now. Would love any advice on how to manage my situation or if you have similar stories , please do share.",

      "text": "When data coding, do it slowly. Always give yourself ample time to code data because that is the heart of your work. With data analysis, it is normal to make mistakes. If they will set you back a few months, communicate with your supervisors and let them know about your situation. Even when you do data analysis, you will have to repeatedly go back and redo your analysis. Expect these situations and create time buffers for these in your timeline. Many of us do not deal with a small amount of data so give yourself some grace. \n\nI used a completely new statistical method during my Masters and because I was such a beginner at it, it took me a year to learn the whole thing. Even when I did the actual analysis, I second guessed myself so many times that I ended up redoing the analysis around 20 times before I submitted my thesis. It was a great learning experience, nevertheless.",

          "text": "thank you for your response. its kinda a relief knowing others have went through similar situation. Also,as you said data coding need to be done slowly and you are right.\nI am using a framework that I am unfamiliar with to do my coding and when I look at the differing interpretations by other researchers i get even more confused and anxious.",
