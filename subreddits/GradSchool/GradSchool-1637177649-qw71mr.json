  "text": "Hello everyone! I'm a master's student currently in my first semester, I want to apply for my PhD in April 2022, and I was wondering if anyone had experience completing their thesis within 3 semesters? \n\nFor more context, I'll be finishing all of my course work (hopefully) next semester, and will just need to finish my thesis in the summer of 2022. Currently, I'm also starting my experiments.\n\nI know this is ambitious, but I'm going to try it anyway. Thoughts? Comments? Advice?",
