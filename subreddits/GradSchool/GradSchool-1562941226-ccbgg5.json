I talk too much, my jokes are too long, and my biggest problem with assignments wasn't meeting the minimum word counts, but not going over the maximum.\n\nIn my program, every writing assignment had to be submitted electronically so that it could be scanned for plagiarism. The online submission portal also calculated the word count and page length, and reported those details to the professor.\n\nOne evening while discussing this system with one of my professors, he commented that it still didn't stop students from attempting to cheat. I asked how that was possible, and he told me a few examples that I found hilarious and, at least in some cases, pretty ingenious. Here are a few of the things he has seen:\n\n* One student went though his/her entire paper and increased the font size for every single punctuation mark. All the words were in the required 12 point Times Roman, but the periods, commas, and apostrophes had been increased in order to fill more space.\n* By default, most plagiarism checkers don't check quoted passages, because... well, they're quotes. My professor caught a group of students surrounding their entire papers in quotation marks, so that the online scanner skipped the entire report. In a +1 moment, the color of the quotation marks had been changed to white, so that they weren't obvious.\n* Multiple students have been caught padding the length of their reports by adding words to the end, again changing the font color to white, and then changing the size to 1pt. \n* My personal favorite was a paper that was too long (a student after my own heart!) so the student decreased his/her word count by taking screen shots of entire paragraphs, deleting the words, and replacing them with the pictures. This fooled the automatic word count, but not the page length detection.

That's why I always change my assignments slightly from one semester to the next.\n\nOn a related note, word/page maximums and minimums only work well if they are appropriate to the assignment.

There were a number of speakers and nobody coordinated their speeches beforehand, nobody knew what information would be overlapping or anything -- which was fine, consistency in the subject matter was great.

Not a single word off, it was *exactly* word for word what I wrote.\n\nGranted, we're both academics who specialize in this sort of content, so perhaps the reason there was that we simply are used to making the same sorts of arguments.
