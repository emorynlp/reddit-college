      "text": "Very very open, especially over the last year. I even introduced him to spoon theory. He's also pretty understanding because his wife also suffers from depression. I honestly don't think I'd be doing as well as I have if I couldn't say, \"Boss, I've been super low this week and I'm sorry I haven't been as productive as I said I'd be.\"\n\nHe's very chill anyway, so I don't think he's treating me different than anyone else, but I still really appreciate it.",

      "text": "I keep things professional. \n\nHe is aware that I have XYZ and I inform him when I won\u2019t be in the office because of appointments, but it doesn\u2019t go any further than that. If I were having a truly terrible day and needed to call out then I\u2019d let him know that but without any real detail on my problems. I\u2019m not going to send paragraphs describing my despair at the world. He\u2019s my boss, not my gal pal, not my therapist. \n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t tell me intricate details of his mental health status either. If you\u2019re very, very open and the other person isn\u2019t equally as open then the relationship is lopsided and you\u2019re probably over sharing.",
