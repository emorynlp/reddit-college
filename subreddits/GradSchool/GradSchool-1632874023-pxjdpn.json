For this post please assume that money is not an issue (that isn\u2019t 100% true but also isn\u2019t a deciding factor). I run a mildly successful small business on my own that pays the bills and can get help with tuition. \n\nI\u2019m 25, graduated with a BA from a good school in cultural studies but really am just a weird artist. I\u2019m starting some classes at the Art Students League in NYC. I think the path of being an artist is the one that makes the most sense to invest my identity and time into. I\u2019m just confused about how to go about pursuing my education. MFAs seem to either require a BFA or years of art making, and BFAs are a big commitment and not usually taken again. The third option is to be taking classes at the League and then potentially do an MFA after. Am I missing something? I know everyone is very pessimistic about art school generally but I\u2019m at a point where it seems like the only thing that makes sense in some form or another. Any advice is so welcome. My goal is to both develop myself as an artist and also develop a community/network of peers, mentors, and I guess art world people. \n\nI\u2019m less naive than I might seem as I have been exposed to various elements of this world in different forms.", "author": "jdude17", "created": 1632874023, "retrieved": 1632951960, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"henvtbu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pxjdpn/fine_art_education_advice/henvtbu/", "text": "Try some residencies or distant learning classes for a few years before the mfa (arrowmont, Anderson ranch etc )", "author": "lykexomigah", "created": 1632875083, "upvotes": 1}}}
