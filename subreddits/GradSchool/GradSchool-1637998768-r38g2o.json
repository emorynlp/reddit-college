      "text": "Hi OP! I am one week \ud83d\ude2c from handing in my thesis and I totally relate.  For me it comes down to the basics.  I look at my next few days and deadlines and make a loose plan for what I need to accomplish.  Then for my current day I explicitly write out what \u201csuccess\u201d looks like today (ie: complete drafts of x and y) and use the  [pomodoro](https://www.themuse.com/advice/take-it-from-someone-who-hates-productivity-hacksthe-pomodoro-technique-actually-works) technique to make sure I don\u2019t spend too much time on any one thing. \n\nGive yourself some grace and put one foot in front of the other.  Good luck!!",
