I\u2019m assuming this is probably a trend in academia. \n\nThe higher I\u2019ve gone in school (working on PhD now), the more pretentious and entitled everybody has become. \n\nProfessors act like everything they say is the most important thought anybody has ever had, students talk about abstract shit as if they actually know what they\u2019re saying. \n\nThe thought of going to conferences just to play into the politics of academia makes me want to punch out all of my teeth. \n\nI LOVE what I\u2019m studying, but goddamn dude everybody sucks",

I\u2019m staring my doctorate this fall and luckily the program pays well enough that I won\u2019t have to waitress, but I\u2019m not gonna lie I\u2019m gonna miss this job!",

My colleagues (in my department) are great, we socialize together and get along well at work, etc. The same was true of my graduate program.\n\nI had a few bad professors (adjuncts mostly) in grad school, but the bulk of them were great.

I noticed some theorists and theories are treated like the Holy Grail. I had to write an essay on the concept of 'style' (art history student) and I said one of the main theorists that we were required to study contradicted his own position (I even provided a quote to prove my case) and my tutor went nuts and said I clearly had not read him properly (did not even address the quote I provided that proved my point) he just seemed infuriated that I had dared challenge one of the main theorists studied on the course.",

Prestige is meaningless if the environment destroys you and you either quit or burn out or both. \n\nAs to how you can find that out, it's usually by finding the oldest grad student, buying them a cup of nice coffee (never seen anyone refuse that) in exchange for some questions. $6 (times the number of students you interrogate) + a few hours of your time can save you years of misery.",

You simultaneously get to try out the school to see if you can stay there, build a network of research contacts, and if you don't like it well you made your application a little bit stronger for the next one (assuming you don't spend half a decade stringing RA positions).",

I\u2019ve been trying to smash that culture by creating opportunities for collaboration, but a fellow labmate keeps fucking it up by manipulating other authors into letting her get a higher slot in authorship order. In a recent collaboration, unbeknownst to me, this labmate started interrogating my second author (who has a severe TBI after a nearly fatal accident last summer) on her thesis progress (which is late as a consequence of her accident) and then told her that she should relinquish second authorship to her because she\u2019s late on her thesis and needs to work on it instead.

I hadn't had much sleep as I was working on this, so I accepted responsibility and felt bad for the rest of the day.\n\nWhen I actually looked at the manuscript, I found about 4-6 text errors (commas, symbols, etc) and 3 mis-dated references. This is in a manuscript of +11,000 words, mind, so the dude threw a fit because he couldn't fix less than 10 errors by himself. I get that I was supposed to do it, but jeez louise, can't someone make a few honest minor mistakes without getting his whole self called into question?\n\nSorry, I didn't mean to hijack, but I needed to vent and since he's not the only petty ass PI I've seen, I thought it was appropriate.",
