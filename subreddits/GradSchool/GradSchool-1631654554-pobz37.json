Every time I get an email from him, my mind just goes blank and then starts running circles around me in a panic that I didn't do something correctly, that I am no good and that everything is wrong. The funny thing is is that once I sit down and go through the email, I have a clear sense of where he is coming from and whether there are actual mistakes to fix, and every time I talk to this collaborator, I come out of the meeting with an attack plan, and feel good that I have direction. But just seeing his name pop up in my email gives me such highe levels of anxiety that I can't reasonably explain them after the fact.   \n\n\nAnyone else go through something similar?  \n(I was mostly wanting to get the feelings and reason my way through them. Rant over, thanks for reading)\n\nTL;DR: Despite being a positive presence and influence, anxiety is always present when receiving an email from collaborator.
