Secondly, find a time when you are most productive (that works with your schedule) For me I find getting up in the mornings and doing just an hour of work is good. You are building a routine. Do it for two weeks. Dont be afraid to make adjustments. Try to have a positive mindset.

I had never been good at staying on task for anything or being able to get motivated to do something consistently. It took a lot of introspection, asking around, and talking with my therapist, but I figured it out for myself.\n\nI realized that in general, I always just waited around until I felt like doing something, whether it was something I liked doing (hobbies, gaming, etc.) or something I didn't (work, chores, etc.). Conversely, I would also have trouble interrupting myself from doing stuff once I started (including bathroom breaks, mental breaks, etc.), so even \"tasks\" which I liked would make me sick of them after a while (like getting sick of gaming after a binge-play or building a model kit for hours). To get any progress on anything, I was used to having to be in a hyperfocus-like state for hours and working on large chunks, with only huge leaps in progress being acceptable. This created a cycle of having no control of my time, leading to procrastinating on everything (work and play), increased how much \"revenge time\" I took at night before bed, staying up late because I felt like I didn't do things I wanted during the day, resulting in less time, energy, and motivation to do anything everyday. My bursts of interest and motivation along with my natural ability carried me through my education up to my Master's, but the PhD workload completely broke that down. I dropped to rock bottom in my 2nd year, nearly having to drop out. \n\nAs someone noted below, this is a self-regulation problem (emotional AND cognitive). I asked around for advice for a very long time, but I find that people who are good at time management aren't very good at explaining *how* they got that way. They usually describe things like using timers and schedules, which never worked for me because I couldn't get myself to start and stay focused during those alotted times for things to justify the scheduled breaks. Finally, I found the answer for myself after talking to my therapist - apparently, well-organized people have an \"internal pep talk\" to keep themselves going while they work. I always just assumed that you were either just good at focusing or not, but apparently even productive people lose focus all the time. The difference is that they learned very early on that they have to internally remind themselves \"ok just do a bit more,\" \"you can just do this little bit and then stop,\" \"just try to do some of it,\" \"see if there's anything minor you can do for now,\" etc. I went back and asked my organizationally inclined friends and family again to see if they did this, and *all* of them said they had that internal pep talk. They thought it was so basic, and were surprised I didn't do it.\n\nInternal pep talk takes mental energy to do as well, so if you're already overloaded with other stress, you won't be able to do it as much. My therapist told me that along with practicing this internal pep talk, I also needed to be compassionate with myself. I had to remember that I won't be able to have the mental energy to pep talk myself if I'm already stressed out, and beating myself up for not being productive wouldn't do much good. The thing is, you will always find people telling you to remember to take breaks and being compassionate with yourself if you aren't productive. But for me, that alone wasn't helpful because I didn't already have that internally-driven ability to make sure I started working. I could laze around forever if I constantly rested. So learning about the internal pep talk as well was really what I needed to even get myself to do consistent work in the first place to feel like compassion and breaks were ok.\n\nOn top of this, I worked on ignoring that feeling of having to do things only in large chunks of progress. I started treating it like how I save money - I love putting away small amounts of cash in my savings and watching the number grow (both in real life and in my games). So I started treating my work like this. I started working on things little by little, treating it like \"putting it in the bank,\" and not discounting it as insignificant work if I didn't finish a large chunk. Since I would always used to dread the exhaustive consequences of hyperfocus sessions, knowing that I didn't have to even enter hyperfocus to get things done eased my anxiety of having to start things in general.\n\nAfter all of this was in place, I'm now finally finding that the usually recommended timers, schedules, and notetaking actually work to help keep myself organized.\n\nSo in summary, this is what I worked on, and it has resulted in a relative boom of consistent productivity and feeling much more in control of myself and my time:\n\n- Being aware of my body (aware of physiological needs like hunger or bathroom) and attending to them as soon as possible rather than putting them off.\n- Learning how to internally pep-talk myself consistently to motivate myself to start and keep myself on task.\n- Being compassionate with myself if I don't have the energy to pep-talk myself to do work, including allowing long breaks and weekends to regain energy for more pep-talking during the week.\n- Doing small bits of a task/project little by little, putting the progress \"in the bank\" rather than doing large chunks at once all the time, to ease the anxiety of knowing how much work needs to be done.\n\nI'm sure this will be different for everyone, but I think the takeaway here is that we need to be introspective and observant of what is going on, try to understand the mechanism for why we have trouble starting or lose focus, and then target the missing part of that mechanism as the solution for it. There are many habits and behaviours that can change with enough practice, but it's not always just about \"wanting to do it enough.\" Treat your behaviour like an experiment, and go from there!\n\n_________\nEDIT: First of all, thank you all for all the attention, gold, awards, etc.! And I'm glad this was helpful and resonated so much with you. If you haven't seen my extra notes comment where I detail extra things I had to work on and build on top of to get to this point, [here is the link to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/oe9bda/how_do_you_beat_procrastination_during_grad_school/h45wutr/).\n\nI'd like to address the few comments who have brought up the possibility of me being not neurotypical or possibly having ADHD. I've already considered that I am not neurotypical, but it's also entirely possible it's a result of poor pragmatic language/other mental health weaknesses growing up (which I know to be 100% true from my own upbringing). I am a psychology PhD student, and while my primary work isn't in ADHD or clinical disorders, my work involves learning a lot about pragmatic language and how the the absence of it affects many later outcomes, as well as the use of pragmatic language in coping with autism. This is partially where my methods came from.\n\n**Regardless of what I am, the reality is that I was always having difficulty getting work done especially during my PhD and that needed to be addressed, and I found a method that addressed it.** Even those with ADHD are given these kinds of coping methods alongside or before getting medication, so I am on the right track regardless. I'd appreciate if incoming readers would refrain from speculating about my neurotypicality and/or suggesting I look into it. I've already put a lot of time and energy into investigating this possibility, I absolutely do not have the financial means to get a formal diagnosis at this time, and I would not like to constantly be reminded of this.", "author": "valryuu", "created": 1625507378, "upvotes": 259}, "h45dfoz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oe9bda/how_do_you_beat_procrastination_during_grad_school/h45dfoz/", "text": "stimulant abuse", "author": "FlandersFields2018", "created": 1625506919, "upvotes": 5}, "h45b5hr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oe9bda/how_do_you_beat_procrastination_during_grad_school/h45b5hr/", "text": "I came in Reddit to procrastinate and then read this.
