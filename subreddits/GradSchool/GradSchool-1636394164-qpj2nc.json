  "text": " Hi! Need to get this out somewhere so thanks for reading. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m a second year master\u2019s student. Degree is in entomology. \n\nI have one more semester of classes after this current one. Then I need to finish my thesis project, and my PI estimated that I\u2019d probably graduate next December. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get through ANOTHER year of this. \n\nI really don\u2019t like my program. I love my lab and research, but the course requirements are horrible. I have hated every single class I\u2019ve taken except for one. I only applied to the entomology degree because I really wanted to work in a specific lab in that department, but my true interest is in virology / microbiology. My thesis project studies insect viruses which is exactly what I want to do, but I haven\u2019t had any formal grad coursework related to it. \n\nAll of the required courses are super broad and related to insect identification / classification / ecology and I HATE THEM. I have zero interest in it, I am genuinely suffering through every course and my grades show it. \n\nI need to maintain a 3.0 GPA to keep my assistantship, and every semester so far I\u2019ve had to file an appeal letter to let me keep it even though my GPA is too low. I got super lucky that they allowed me to keep it this long, but I am 99% sure that I am not going to get any more chances. So I might get kicked out anyway. \n\nI am SO burned out. I have no motivation or drive left in my body. I have severe depression and ADHD and I just don\u2019t feel capable of handling anything anymore. On top of that, last week my PI told me that I shouldn\u2019t try to get a PhD like ever. And that really hurt but also I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong. I am a disappointment to my lab and department. I'm not nearly as capable or smart as I thought I was and it's such a blow to my self worth. \n\nBut I also think that if I dropped out, I would regret it forever. I probably won\u2019t get a good job and pretty much make myself unemployable. And I can\u2019t imagine staying in the program this long and then having absolutely nothing to show for it. I moved across the country for this program and if I leave I will have no income and no job prospects and will generally be stuck. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI\u2019m just so frustrated with myself. I feel like I\u2019ve lost brain cells since starting this master\u2019s program instead of learning and you know, getting smarter. \n\nThank you for reading, sorry for all of the complaining and negativity etc. Let me know if you have any tips on getting through the slump.",

      "text": "If you're only one semester away, it sounds like you just need to get a couple of strategies for making it through one more semester of boring classes. Take up a fulfilling hobby, totally change your study schedule, start dating, etc.\n\nAnd if you're so miserable taking classes unrelated to the broader field you're in, then your PI is right, you're not going to enjoy yourself in a PhD program. A PhD is training for participating in academia of your field, which is more than just your subspecialty, so in most programs you'll be expected to take like 2 years of classes to bring you up to speed on the whole field. Maybe have one or two of those will be related to your subfield. And then when you're done with classes, you'll probably be expected to participate in the rest of the department activities, which usually involves going to talks about unrelated things too.\n\nIt's not so much about whether you'll get good grades in a PhD program, but whether you'll enjoy those 5-7 years of your life. Why spend so long on something if you'll be miserable that whole time?",

          "text": "Yeah you're totally right, I think I just need to figure out some ways to get my life together and make some changes. Hopefully i don't get kicked out before I can do that, but we'll see.\n\nThat's a good point, yeah the more I think about it I realize that I wouldn't be happy in a PhD program either way. I have no interest in academia so it's not super important. I think I just took her saying that more personally, as in being a reflection of my intelligence / abilities instead of how it would align with my goals overall.",

      "text": "It sounds like you still love this field, the research, and your lab. Coursework is a means to an end; it\u2019s necessary for the degree but it shouldn\u2019t be your primary focus. If your coursework is taking so much of your time and energy that you can\u2019t do the research you like to do, maybe there is a way to reduce the coursework load. Would it be possible to spread out your classes over a longer period of time? Are there any resources available at your university to help with graduate classes (tutoring, checking papers, note takers, etc)? Hating the field is a great reason to quit. If you love the field, is it worth going through these classes to get to your end goal? If yes, keep your chin up and keep trying and you\u2019ll make it. If no, that\u2019s ok too.",

To be fair, in a PhD, you would be taking broad coursework, but if you did a PhD in infectious disease/micro in a vector borne illness lab (unless you mean viruses that affect insects), you would enjoy it a LOT more. I just think your mistake was entomology.",

          "text": "I get your perspective on her saying that. I don't think she meant it in a hurtful way, more of a \"don't waste your time you'll be fine without one\" way. But I still took it pretty personally and need to get over it. \n\nI actually tried to change majors this past summer, my PI was super supportive and put in an application to join the microbiology faculty so she could continue being my advisor. It didn't work out because my school doesn't have a thesis-based microbio masters, only an online masters that I couldn't use my assistantship for. So there was an attempt, but in the end I'm stuck where I am. \n\nI think a leave of absence could be a good idea, but I don't know how I would manage financially. I'll look more into it. \n\nI set up a meeting with the grad coordinator in my department for later this week, so I hope she has some good advice as well! Thank you for your suggestions :)",

      "text": "Do you need to take a full courseload of classes next semester as well? Do you have any choices to pick classes ideally outside the department or are there specific mandatory classes? (I had 4 mandatory classes and then I think I only needed 3 more courses, 2 of which could be in another department, and the rest have been research hours. Just curious if you have any flexibility there.  \nI'm in an opposite situation of hating research but loving classes (& TAing). I've actually also not had any classes related to research, I wish I had. But I think it's relatively common not to. :/ I haven't asked my advisor (we're not super close and she's pretty hands off, all my research is also on a computer so not in a lab environmet) but I'm quite certain she would not suggest that I get a PhD either. It would sting to hear it so I have no plans of asking but I'd agree. I don't regret going to get my masters and am sticking it out but have certainly learnt I never want to pursue a PhD. I also feel like I'm loosing brain cells since starting, I think part of it is knowing just enough to know I know nothing.",

If you\u2019re like me, I wanted to quit like everyday when I took classes and my grades showed it, but I told myself I wasn\u2019t leaving unless they kicked me out. Try your best and then some. Maybe take up kickboxing for funsies.",
