In addition, there's your financial and personal situation.\n\nIf you are otherwise a competitive candidate and there are no real reasons to do a job for a year beyond \"being more competitive\" I really don't see the point of doing so.",

Make certain grad school is what you want to do and that you have a strong commitment and  good plan for it.",

Taking that year off just making connections in my future field, working, traveling and volunteering was a great break and also served a great motivator as to why I wanted to continue my studies.  So I ended up having so many connections in my field (international education) before starting and feel comfortable that I will land a job in the country I\u2019m living in now.",

Being on the other side, I'm glad I took it even more because you never get an opportunity like that again in my experience.",

You get to either take a break the likes of which you might not get again until you retire OR you get to work a relevant, interesting part time job/internship OR you get to experience a full-time job and in doing so, figure out more about what you want from your career (ie: you realize a total desk job actually sucks and you need some field work or that you need flexibility or that you need several long-term projects on the docket at once or you need the opposite. That sort of thing).\n\nI started a MS right out of ugrad, dropped out, and am now working full time in a university research/outreach support position. I'll be starting a different MS in Jan and know a lot more about what I want my career trajectory to look like, even though the (hopeful) final endpoint is about the same.\n\nThat being said, if you know exactly what you want and you are excited about getting started, your financial situation is pretty stable, and you got an offer you really like, why wait? One of my friends jumped straight into a PhD in neuroscience after grinding in undergrad and she's loving it.",
