  "title:": "University of New Mexico Seeks to strip grad workers of right to form union",
  "text": "Hey all, PhD student at UNM here. It's a minority-serving institution in one of the poorest US states. We get $14k/year for 50% FTE and are forming a union so we can be part of the conversation on our wages. This post doesn't appear to violate the subreddit rules, so I wanted to share what's going on here:\n\n>In response to a petition for union recognition in December, the University of New Mexico has filed a motion seeking to strip graduate employees of the right to unionize under state law, reneging on its prior public commitment to respect the rights of graduate workers to organize. UNM claims that graduate workers are not employees and do not share a community of interest.  \n>  \n>In describing their new position to the state Labor Board, UNM cites a proposed rule from the Trump-appointed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that seeks to rob the union rights of graduate workers at private institutions, arguing that New Mexico should apply the Trump administration proposal to graduate workers at public universities in the state.\n\nStatement from the Union:\n\n>\"We decided to unionize in response to long-standing issues of job insecurity, inadequate benefits, excessive workloads, and low compensation that leaves many workers below the poverty line. We know that without our labor and the labor of other workers on campus, the university cannot function. We teach thousands of undergraduate students, grade and provide feedback on countless exams and essays, work on research to improve our communities, and much more.\"  \n>  \n>\"In October, UNM Provost James Holloway said in a statement to the Albuquerque Journal that **\u201cthe university recognizes the rights of our graduate students to decide to organize.\u201d** Now, UNM is backtracking and claiming that we are not \u201cregular employees\u201d and that our right to collective bargaining should not be recognized. In describing their new position to the state Labor Board, UNM cites a proposed Trump administration rule that seeks to rob the union rights of graduate workers at private institutions, arguing that New Mexico should apply the Trump administration proposal to graduate workers at public universities in the state.\"  \n>  \n>\"As of today, nearly 1,000 graduate workers at UNM have joined the union because we believe that we are stronger together.\"\n\nAnyone can sign the union's petition here:\n\n[https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/sign-the-petition-unm-should-recognize-graduate-workers-right-to-unionize](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/sign-the-petition-unm-should-recognize-graduate-workers-right-to-unionize)",

Universities are taking a big hit on tuition and are looking for ways to make up the difference, and grad students lack a lot of the legal protections of \"real\" employees. Any university with a union and livable contracts will be trying to challenge those contracts under the Trump policies before Biden gets a chance to change those policies.\n\nRealistically what we need is to get these protections imposed on institutions by funding orgs, e.g. NSF or NIH grants can only pay for graduate student RAs if they get paid X amount and have XYZ benefits, AND the university must also apply these standards for all grad students in thesis-based programs. Established NSF/NIH minimum contracts for postdocs has been a major force for good, and we need to extend that to grad students as well.",

          "text": "My university went into the COVID year with a budget crisis. The admin has made it quite clear that they view graduate students, and especially PhD students, as a liability not an asset. If they had their druthers, admin would surely slash grad student pay significantly and have profs make up the difference (or dont, and really make out). Theyre also dubious of graduate instruction hours because grad students aren't paying students, so admin wants faculty to focus more on undergrad instruction. Now COVID has cratered enrollment and the university is looking for cuts across the board. Im close enough to being finished that I dont think itll be an issue for me, but someone starting a PhD here in the next year or two might be in trouble. \n\nAlso according to state law, grad students are forbidden from unionizing. So no chance for collective bargaining. I also think that if admin here or the state house were to be forced into increasing stipends and pay, the result would be fewer students over all and big cuts in most programs. It would be an excuse to shed the graduate student 'dead wood.'\n\nWhile foundations can help impose basic standards, if admin and others dont value our work, theyre not going to support it and active attack graduate programs in lean times.",

The reason you pay grad students in the first place is so they aren't working other jobs and can perform research and publish papers in a timely manner and without distraction.  Part-time grad students don't get to do much research due to working so they can pay rent and eat, and most grants provide short-term funding. \n\nI am signing and supporting y'all.",
