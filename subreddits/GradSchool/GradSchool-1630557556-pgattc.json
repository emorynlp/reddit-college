{"sid": "pgattc", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgattc/undergraduate_school_choice_for_graduate_school/", "title:": "Undergraduate School Choice for Graduate School", "text": "I'm currently a Junior attending Willamette University as a Psychology/Biology double major. I'm looking to get a master's degree in neuroscience and eventually a Ph.D. I've just transferred, so I have little experience at Willamette, but it seems like a fairly good school. I was able to receive a full ride. \n\nHowever, Whitman College wanted me to reapply for either this winter or next year, as they weren't able to offer me enough financial aid at the time I applied. Whitman seems more academically rigorous, as well as providing more assistance entering graduate school, which is why I'm considering transferring. I currently have a 3.88 gpa, previously a 4.0 gpa before personal issues came up that interfered with academics.\n\nI'm looking for advice on whether or not I should transfer to Whitman for my senior year, or if I should stay at Willamette. I'm worried that Willamette will have less resources to prepare me for graduate school. I'm also concerned about the prestige of the two schools. While prestige isn't my main focus at all, I can't ignore that it has an impact on applications. I also love the idea of the senior thesis offered at Whitman. When originally looking at the two schools, I did prefer Whitman academically and thought it would be the best fit, however, Willamette has been great so far as well, and the class structure has been very beneficial to me.\n\nSorry for the long post, but any advice would be helpful. Please let me know if I should include any more information that could be helpful.", "author": "Miningav2", "created": 1630557556, "retrieved": 1632845152, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbfangn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgattc/undergraduate_school_choice_for_graduate_school/hbfangn/", "text": "I think you'll get more mileage out of making the most of the resources at Willamette. If you can excel at your classes there, do some research with a professor and/or TA, and establish relationships that will lead to strong recommendation letters, that will set up you much better than going after a more ideal program in your last year (and spending this year working on transferring instead of longer-term goals). \n\nIn particular, I imagine that attending three different undergraduate institutions back-to-back (as opposed to some interrupted education scenario, where it's a bit more understandable) would raise a few eyebrows, at least in PhD admissions. The optics just aren't that great. It might raise some concerns about commitment (remember, for a PhD you're not only commiting 4-7 years to a single school, but also a single department and lab). There may also be concerns about if the transferring has led to inadvertent knowledge or skills gaps.", "author": "aggressive-teaspoon", "created": 1630658917, "upvotes": 1}, "hba2rg2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgattc/undergraduate_school_choice_for_graduate_school/hba2rg2/", "text": "Honestly, nobody cares where you go to undergrad.
