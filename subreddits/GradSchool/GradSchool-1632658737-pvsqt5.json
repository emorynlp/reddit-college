  "title:": "Is a bad PhD supervisor a price worth paying for your \u201cdream topic\u201d?",
  "text": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m currently one year into a 3-year program at a German University. I\u2019m currently trying to decide whether to look for a new PhD position, or stay in my current one. The dilemma I have at the moment revolves around the fact that I am not getting the supervision I \u201cshould\u201d be getting as a PhD student. Let me provide a bit of background info. My PI is the type of researcher who writes grants for projects he knows nothing about, but thinks are \u201ccool\u201d and have the potential to make him famous. He then hires a PhD student (not an experienced post doc, because they always quit after a few months working with him) to work on said projects. Because he knows nothing about these topics, and as a result can\u2019t offer any proper supervision, between 45-50% of graduate students he has hired in the past have quit. As a result, our group never has lab meetings (not to mention one-to-one meetings with my supervisor), and there is a constant toxic work environment because of my supervisor. For me, BOTH regular and scheduled lab meetings and one-to-ones are important for me to see if I\u2019m doing things properly. These factors have filled me with so much frustration over the past 6 months, and have recently started to affect my mental health. \n\nHowever, even though he isn\u2019t the best supervisor, and can\u2019t give me theoretical and technical 99% of the time, I still love the topic I am researching - it has been my \u201cdream project\u201d since 2015. But because of the situation in my group - which I covered in the previous paragraph - I\u2019m exploring the possibility to look for another PhD position. But I don\u2019t know if I should. So, is a bad PhD supervisor a price worth paying for your \u201cdream topic\u201d? (I should mention here that my secondary supervisor is the same type of person).",

If he and your secondary supervisor are more of the type to insist that you try some half baked idea which neither they nor you has any idea about before you try something yourself, run away, run far and run fast.",

Two distinct topics she did not have the full background in but could get funding. But was totally engaged and repaid my efforts with career progress effort for me on her end. Maybe a half dozen papers from her ideas, and another half dozen co author ones since I brought new skills to the lab. Still pulls me in on papers for stuff I learned years later.",

      "text": "I had basically the same situation in my PhD, and I did stick it out with the same PI. One caveat: we did have weekly group meetings but they were basically useless because the PI couldn't offer a lot of help and the other students were on projects that were vastly different.   I considered this exact question multiple times.\n\nFrom my experience, I think that I gained a lot of strengths in directing my own research and finding help on my own. I did a lot of literature reading and talked with a lot of other graduate students, even if they didn't really have specific advice. It was also cool that by the time I was in my last two years (I'm in the US, so my program was 5 years), I was basically given free range of what I wanted to do. \n\nHowever, it took me a while to really appreciate the positives. I pushed myself through a lot of burn out throughout my time in graduate school because it was mentally exhausting to be working on a project where no one could help me or even offer a vague over-arching direction on what I was supposed to be accomplishing. It was also extremely hard to publish with my PI because he was flaky about meetings and didn't really understand the details of my work.",

Being one year into your program does affect your options, although they are somewhat limited:\n\n1. You could speak to your advisor about your concerns, and how you might address them (e.g., one-on-one meetings, or small group meetings by topic?). You would know best if this option is even worth your time.\n2. You could organize ad-hoc meetings with other students in your research group or similar groups to discuss your research and any problems you encounter. This would be helpful in combating feelings of isolation, improve your mental health, and build a sense of collaboration/camaraderie among your colleagues. However, it ultimately doesn't replace your absentee advisor's role.\n3. You could seek a **co-advisor**, someone who has the expertise to guide you through your PhD. Since you mentioned in your last sentence that you already have a secondary advisor, the only wiggle room you have with this option is to seek out a mentor, who wouldn't officially be an advisor but could guide you through your program.\n4. You seek another advisor. This means starting over and losing 1 year: you leave your topic behind and your student-advisor relationship is finished. My recommendation would be to think carefully about the leading papers and topics that interest you in your field, and send out some emails on whether the authors are taking on students.",

Not just for the work, but also for administrative things, and if your supervisor is not present to help you with things you will face stagnation and frustration, which will compound other commonly experienced feelings like imposter syndrome. I would think very carefully about whether to stay or go in the context of your happiness, progress and satisfaction with your research in the next few years. Good luck!",

Ask the grad students in his group point blank if this is the norm for this professor. Have you spoken to your advisor about this subject?",

It might be a nightmare if they can't at least help you out with that if they are clueless with the topic.\n\nI think the key bit you mentioned there is the toxic work environment, that you didn't elaborate much on. In my mind it would make a different image from just a hands off supervisor, like the supervisor being oddly demanding of your results or controlling despite being clueless and not helping you along. In that case, it's not even a consideration. Just get out, I'm sure someone else will do something similar enough in the world in terms of topics that could accomodate your project.",
