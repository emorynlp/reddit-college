  "title:": "For sure acceptance or risk for an Ivy League?",
  "text": "I am currently a masters student studying Ecology/Evolution at a university in Switzerland and will graduate this spring. It's going well and my PI asked me if I want to stay in the lab to do a PhD. I told them I'd think about it because I was originally planning to look at schools in the US (I'm American so closer to family and friends), but I have enjoyed being a part of the lab.\n\nI reached out to a professor at Princeton University doing research I'm also interested in, not expecting much. But they were super interested in my thesis ideas and said they'd like to work more with me. But, they said that since acceptance depends on a decision from all faculty, I know I shouldn't hold my breath yet. They said they would support my application during decisions and would help with application materials to help me look good, but still not a sure thing. \n\nI'm not very familiar with the PhD search process so I'm not sure if it's a better idea to stick with the for sure yes at my current lab, or take the risk and try Princeton. Any advice for other factors I should look into or questions I should ask to help me decide?\n\nThanks in advance!",

The incentive structure is incredibly messed up and there are so many abuses. I often wish I had gone to one of the \u201clower tier\u201d schools or looked internationally where the work-life balance expectations are healthier. \n\nThat being said, a lot depends on the professor, the department & the program. It also it matters what your long term career plans are (and how set you are on them). If you want to stay in academia, it is probably a good move to switch universities, but if you are flexible (interested in academia, teaching or industry), I would recommend staying at the Swiss university where you can finish faster.\n\nI am happy to talk more in DM. Either way best of luck!",

Certainly you'll be showered with resources and have access to people and things you wouldn't otherwise.",

And they won\u2019t be all that much better than the top 20. For whatever reason Europeans have a negative impression of PhDs from the us. But in my experience US PhD students are by in large stronger and easier to train. They typically already know how to program, have good mechanical skills, and are better at experimental design. Just for context and this is not the only occasion, I once had a German postdoc tell me that US PhDs were not real PhDs. This is laughable for many many reasons. In any case pick the professor not the university.",

I was an exchange student for a semester with an Italian University during my undergrad, and  because I was a junior in the US I was considered a third year student in Italy. Thing was, the stuff the Italians were doing for third year stuff was way above what US third years were doing, and a lot of the material was more in line with masters level coursework in the US. third year physics students in Italy would learn stuff like general relativity and quantum field theory, things that usually aren't taught until the graduate level in the US. Juniors in physics are usually covering things more in line with lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanics or a quantum wavefunction model for the hydrogen atom, things that are usually considered pre-requisites for GR and QFT.\n\nI think part of this is that Italian universities don't have gen ed requirements, so they can pack more coursework into a single year, and part of it is that at least in Italy, high school is \\*five\\* years and the fifth year functions similar to a college freshman year over here.",
