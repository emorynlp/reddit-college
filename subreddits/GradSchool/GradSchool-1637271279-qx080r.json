  "text": "My PI and the PI of the lab that's literally  next to mine through a connecting door are pretty close to each other, so students including I share lab equipment quite frequently. Some of the lab equipment in the neighbor lab are outdated and frequently break, and whenever I ask the lab's post-doc, his answer is always \"I don't know.\" It frustrates me to no end because there is no lab tech in either lab and my experiment schedule get stunted often.\n\nIs it normal that a post-doc that has been here over 5+ years have no clue how to fix something or even fail to try to find out what's going on? Or maybe I m having unusual expectations because in my lab, I am a de-facto second-in-command when it comes to lab equipment handling?",

If we ever ran into issues we just called the company. As a matter of fact, I'd be scared to tanker with any equipment in case I broke it more.\n\nEdit: I've actually only ever known 2 people who fixed things.

Instead I emailed her, gave a potential solution, and said If she liked the solution I'd implement it by next friday.
