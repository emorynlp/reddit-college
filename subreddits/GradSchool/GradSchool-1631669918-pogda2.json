So im thinking i could go to community college next semester and then some in state school for the last years. Im worried though how this might affect the likelihood of getting a fellowship. My major is physics if that matters and i want to study that into grad school. Will it be harder to get a fellowship if i keep changing schools like this?", "author": "Dattebayo_Dattebayo", "created": 1631669918, "retrieved": 1632952609, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcx2cf6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pogda2/i_need_advice/hcx2cf6/", "text": "CC is fine.

Just keep your grades and involvement up!\n\nSorry to hear that you\u2019re having a hard time affording your choice of schools, though. I hope you\u2019re able to stay away from private loans as much as possible. But if you want other tips to save money on university, try doing an on/off study scheme where you work full time every other semester and study every other semester. Takes longer, but a buddy of mine did that working seasonal construction and agricultural jobs in spring and summer months and left debt free. He was even able to afford more (paid for a nice used truck) as his labor became more skilled and he was able to get better jobs with the state. And really take advantage of your counselors and program directors/deans at whichever university you end up at (whether you transfer or not). Tell them you\u2019re interested in any opportunity to earn money or scholarships you can find to pay your way. Most good ones will work hard to help you find financial resources if you show initiative.\n\nBest of luck!!!", "author": "RandyFunRuiner", "created": 1631674521, "upvotes": 2}, "hcweiby": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pogda2/i_need_advice/hcweiby/", "text": "Shouldn't make a difference.
