  "text": "Hello, I would love any advice on this topic. I'm just starting a master's program in physical chemistry and I'm in the process of choosing which PhD programs to apply to. I'm torn between looking at theoretical and experimental research groups. I feel like I have to choose between the two now, since I have to decide if my master's thesis will be experimental or theoretical and I also need to be able to articulate on applications why I'm interested in the research I'm interested in. Does anyone have advice on how they determined what kind of scientist they wanted to be? I haven't been at a bench in years and I really miss running experiments. BUT, the idea of theoretical research has been alluring for the past 2-3 years now and I would never forgive myself if I started a PhD without even trying theory work once.",
