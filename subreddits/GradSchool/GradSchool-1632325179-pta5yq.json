I am currently a fifth year student studying for my PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology. Despite being far along in my program, I don\u2019t have any publications and don\u2019t have a definitive graduation date. My experiences in grad school, especially during the pandemic, have convinced me that I\u2019d like to move away from academia and bench science altogether in my future career. \n\nOne career area that\u2019s super interesting to me is medical affairs or clinical science communication. However, when I read about how to be competitive for these jobs, they usually suggest having experience in a specific treatment area (my work kind of connects to some rare disease states, but it is in basic science) or having something else that makes you stand out from the candidate pool. I\u2019ve tried to get involved in extracurricular stuff that relates to health and medicine, but with COVID still raging, it\u2019s been tough to get started. \n\nWas I just screwed from the start on a potential career because I didn\u2019t do clinical research? Up until the pandemic, I was all-in on teaching and outreach activities to prep for the tenure track - but now that I\u2019ve given up on that dream, it feels like all the effort I spent there can\u2019t be translated into doing something else. Like my potential PhD is going to be worthless for anything except being chained to the bench because I didn\u2019t work hard enough to become \u201cspecial\u201d enough to escape it. \n\nIs there really any hope? How do I turn this around?", "author": "curvebreaker", "created": 1632325179, "retrieved": 1632952129, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdw6iml": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pta5yq/discouraged_over_possibly_not_being_competitive/hdw6iml/", "text": "I'm only a fourth year PhD student, so I obviously can't attest to anything, but I definitely think you have time to turn it around!\n\nI recently began to consider a similar path, geared more towards science writing and communication (my background is in microbiology, so it seems like a good choice given the current state of the world). At least in my experience, there's a lot of virtual experiences you can find related to science communication. I was lucky enough to get connected with a great mentor, and have been writing online blog posts and article summaries. There's also opportunities to do virtual work through infographics, informational videos, or podcasts. I've also seen other people in my groups work on more public health related communication, sometimes working with high schools or creating pamphlets and stuff of that nature. Most of the people I work with aren't even in my area, and probably half of them are in other countries.\n\nFeel free to DM me and I can go into more specifics - best of luck!", "author": "gradhell123", "created": 1632349467, "upvotes": 2}, "hdvc71f": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pta5yq/discouraged_over_possibly_not_being_competitive/hdvc71f/", "text": "Get a job in the direction of your desired career field, as far shifted in that direction insofar as your experience allows.\n\nUse experience in that job to pivot after a while further over.\n\nRinse and repeat until you\u2019re in an area that feels good.", "author": "Weekly-Ad353", "created": 1632332739, "upvotes": 1}}}
