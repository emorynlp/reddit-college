  "title:": "Is it crazy to change fields between MSc and PhD?",
  "text": "My field of studies is relatively interdisciplinary. I first got a Bsc in the \"humanities\" side and then a Msc in the \"sciency side\" because I had decided to branch out and try something more technical. Since then, however, I realized that I'd want to go back to my original love so to speak and pursue a PhD in that area. There's an interesting opportunity right now.\n\nHowever, I am completely unfamiliar with the literature in that field. I don't know the professors, the hot topics, and how to build a project proposal. I only did it for my Msc thesis. But I still love the idea of researching on that topic. Would it be irresponsible to try and do it anyways?",

      "text": "In my opinion, you\u2019ve said nothing that is against following your dream project. Maybe systems are different but I believe no one is already an expert on their field when they start and becoming one is part of your PhD. So if you find an opportunity, go for it:) (Even though your Passion might shift again over time)",
