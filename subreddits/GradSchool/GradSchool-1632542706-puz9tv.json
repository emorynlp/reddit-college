  "text": "I started my master program in fall of 2020. In the beginning I had the typical imposter syndrome and was just super intimidated all the time. Now that I\u2019m over that, I just feel annoyed and angry. \n\nAll of my classes have been online, so I\u2019ve obviously felt like I\u2019ve missed out on a great deal of practical experience I would have gained otherwise. My virtual seminars are oftentimes just a performative circle jerk of everyone trying to seem the most woke or have the most provocative opinion (If I hear the phrase \u201cyou\u2019re so valid\u201d one more time I\u2019ll discorporate). \n\nI\u2019m in this weird loop of thinking that school is holding me back from doing the research and practical work that I love, but feeling like I can\u2019t continue that work without the credentials, while also feeling like those credentials would be hollow. \n\nIs this normal? Should I take a break and reevaluate my goals?",

Anyone not in intentionally remote school (like it was that way pre pandemic and the low prices reflect it) got screwed.

I'm an older PhD student and I'm way better interacting in person than over email. But nope! Now I'm essentially gonna cold-message this guy who will have no context about me whatsoever. \n\nThe few classes that I still had to take once the pandemic started where a joke. A fragment of the quality from in-person classes. And now it has been years since I interacted with anybody outside my area specialty. Those in-department / out-of-specialty contacts are valuable, and I dont have 'em, since it's not like people stay and chat for 5 minutes after zoom meetings. \n\nThe pandemic has made me really wish I wasn't in grad school. I didn't have heat for over a year because I couldn't afford to fix my gas lines. Right now I'm super hungry because my refrigerator is broken and I can't figure out how to fix it or afford to buy a new one. So all my meals are either from the cupboard or the freezer. \n\n\nSorry, I'm not having a very good day.",

I started my doctorate in a clinical health/rehabilitative medicine science field in Fall 2019 and only had a semester and a half of actual grad school before we left for spring break and never went back. I\u2019m going into major debt for maybe 10% of the experience I signed up for. I\u2019m very COVID-cautious and grateful that my school took precautions seriously, but angry and disillusioned that I\u2019m in six figure debt for this. There weren\u2019t enough fieldwork sites in my grad school city so I had to move home, living with my parents because finding an apartment during Covid with two weeks\u2019 notice was impossible. I\u2019m now finishing my doctorate from my childhood bedroom on a laptop. It\u2019s depressing. \n\nI am actually applying to one-year MPH programs for next year in the hopes that (if financial aid works out - not looking to throw good money after bad) I can redeem this a little and experience grad school the way I always wanted to. \n\nI am so sorry you\u2019ve experienced this, too. It was stolen from us and if my hooding/graduation is virtual in May 2022 I think I\u2019ll lose my mind a little, since that\u2019s been the goal that has kept me motivated through all of this. I think it\u2019s okay to grieve what was stolen. I\u2019m just sorry you have to, too.",

It seems like I'm feeling the same thing that you are right now in the first term of my PhD. I do feel a little bit cheated about that, but I also feel like I should've seen it coming.\n\nObviously your situation re: COVID isn't normal, but if you feel like you're at odds with the school regarding the work you went there to partake in, it wouldn't be good in a normal time either. I would think that if you really feel like the credential that you're going to get would feel \"empty,\" then I imagine you'd just go through the motions doing the work to earn it, which wouldn't benefit you either in the short nor long term - It'd likely result in lesser-quality work, plus much of what you gain through the act of researching comes through the effort you put in, and if you don't care to put a lot of effort in, you probably wouldn't get the benefits there, either.",

As of now I have never stepped foot in any of the facilities they have touted so much (and continue to charge me for, of course). I know it is partially on me, as the pandemic was very much a thing when I applied back in April.  I guess I naively assumed that it would be resolved in under 2 years.  The class experience has not been that bad tbh, though I do feel like I am overpaying for online college.",

Depends on your relationship with your advisor and your field, but any good advisor will go out of their way to accommodate/help if you're motivated to push your research and you express that to them explicitly (they're still adjusting to the transitions too). \n\nFrom a post grad research hiring perspective, we know how hard this time is for students and take that into considerations.",
