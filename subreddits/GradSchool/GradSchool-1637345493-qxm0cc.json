  "text": "I\u2019m currently graduating with a terminal MS in May and then working as a full time research psychologist. I want to get my PhD in Educational Psychology part time, so I applied to the only school in the area that would consider part time applicants. It happens to be a top ten school with a 6%-10% acceptance rate. \n\nI\u2019m feeling pretty weird about it. I put so much work into this application with such a minute chance of getting accepted. If I don\u2019t get in, I still have a full time job lined up, so it\u2019s nothing to fret over. It\u2019s just strange that we put so much effort into experiences that have a small chance of succeeding. Anyone else have this existential-type experience?",

      "text": "I would rethink \u201cacceptance rates\u201d as not a reflection of your personal application. I mean, mathematically, acceptance rates are just the (number of applications accepted)/(number of applications). It\u2019s not a measurement of how \u201cgood\u201d your own personal application is. So, an acceptance rate is not the same thing as your chance of getting into this school!  There\u2019s only two possible outcomes, you either get in, or you don\u2019t. So I like to think of it as like a 50/50 shot. I\u2019m hoping for the best for you!",
