  "text": "I have been looking in to jobs because my school ends mid-April. Not looking great. No where if understandably hiring and people are speculating a recession during/following this pandemic. Though I would reach out and ask how post-grad life was like for masters students who graduated during the 2008 recession?",

      "text": "I\u2019m doing fine now, and graduated in 2009. My secret? My parents helped me. A lot. \n\nI know people who graduated with me who were able to make it work for themselves, but many of my friends had help from parents all through college and for several years after. \n\nIf that\u2019s available to you, great. Take the help and don\u2019t be a jerk about it. If it\u2019s not though, don\u2019t beat yourself up if you\u2019re struggling. A lot of your friends you see online who seem to be thriving might have a safety net or just straight up funding that\u2019s keeping them afloat. \n\nTry to build some kind of network. I\u2019ve gotten jobs through friends or friends-of-friends, and I\u2019ve referred people to jobs that I only knew through facebook. A lot of whatever success I\u2019ve had has been about being in the right place at the right time. The more you stay in touch with people, the more likely you are to hear about opportunities that open up. \n\nAside from that, try to get smart about money if at all possible. The personal finance subreddit is a good resource. Try to stay out of any unnecessary debt and take advantage of any job benefits you can get (tuition remission, retirement accounts, FSA/HSA accounts, etc.). Work on your credit. They might not seem like a priority now right out of school, but messing those things up will haunt you for a long time. \n\nGood luck. It\u2019s a scary time, but there are people rooting for you.",

Ended up taking a postdoc I wasnt happy about and it didnt last long at all...then was unemployed for a little over a year...so basically didn't find stable employment until early 2010.  My advice would be to not take an offer that raises red flags for you even if you dont have other options...unless it's just a job on the side to make money (not career related).",

So in 2008, I finished with a degree in civil engineering, emphasis in structural. But new construction, which was my plan, had virtually stopped and a lot of my classmates who had graduated a year before were getting laid off. I stayed working at a restaurant where I had been for a year, applying to every and anything posting I could. Got back in contact with my old boss from an internship I had, and he remembered me and created a position for me at his firm as an engineer environmental engineer. Not at all what I had planned, but it worked out and now I\u2019m getting my masters in environmental and remediation. So be open to exploring other options. And that internship I had, I got from attending a network event (my boss presented at an ASCE meeting and I chatted him up after and he offered me a job), so tap into all your contacts to see if they know of anything too. I do realize graduate degrees are more specialized, but in a recession, getting your foot into a door is better than nothing.",

It took me three months of constantly applying to \"real\" jobs before I ended up taking two shitty part-time jobs. This was a time when the highlight of my day was finishing my shift at Curves, locking up, microwaving my cup 'o noodles and eating it in the dark while I browsed the internet for 15 minutes before catching the bus to my second job. \n\nIf I had to do 2004-8 over, I would spend more time diversifying my skillset, expanding my network and refining what would later be called my \"brand\". In retrospect, I was not an amazing student, I was not a super hard worker and I had a pretty forgettable personality and appearance. It sounds dumb, but this all worked against me when I was competing with Stanford grads for shitty receptionist jobs. If I had to do it over, I would keep in touch with friends, family and friends of my parents in a meaningful way. These are the people who helped me find jobs later on! I would immediately move to my home state where the recession didn't hit as hard and my degree was worth more. I would spend money more wisely.",

In my university's entire physics department (including faculty and students) we only have \\*one\\* guy who is a veteran. He's awesome don't get me wrong, but if you're only going to hire veterans as an agency to do the kind of thing we specialize in there are unlikely to be enough guys like him to go around.\n\nAt a certain point you have to say \"we prefer veterans, but absent veteran applicants we need to pick a non veteran\"",

There are many postdocs who got their PhDs from international universities, especially at prestigious US universities.

Net income is predictable because taxes and insurances are standard, and academic salaries are public and follow a tier-based system (at least in Germany and the UK). I seem to make much less than my American colleagues, but the benefits definitely outweigh the numbers on paper. However, if you are single or have no kids, have no physical or mental health issues, you could probably make more money in the US as a postdoc. Regardless, I have never had an issue with money as a postdoc, and my family and I live very comfortably.\n\n As a PhD student in my field, you will likely make a pittance no matter where you do your degree, but you will overwhelmingly be treated better at a European uni because they tend to treat their students like employees rather than cheap labor.",

And as I said in a previous comment, at least in my field, PhD students do not usually have to teach to get their funding. For this reason, the PhD is also shorter than in the US because you can focus exclusively on your research (as little as 3 years, but often students can extent to 4). Furthermore, many PhD students in Germany are on employment contracts rather than stipends, so they get full social and health benefits and insurances, vacation days, start funding social security/retirement funds, and their time counts as work experience, which puts them on a higher salary tier than students who are paid on stipends.",

      "text": "Context: I got my bachelors in 2008, and took a decade to go back to school for my MPA. So while I didn\u2019t have a fresh masters in 2008, I was entering the job market all the same.\n\nGet creative. Think about places to use your skills in non-obvious industries or organizations. Recognize that it may take time to slot into a position where you\u2019re using the degree you just got \u2014 patience and humility go a long way here.\n\nI joined AmeriCorps after undergrad, because it meant health insurance and a steady paycheck for at least a year. Not saying that\u2019s the right role for everyone, but it\u2019s something.\n\nAlso, focus on your wellbeing. We\u2019re in the narrow places right now, and it won\u2019t last forever, but it can be incredibly demoralizing to look at yourself and say, \u201cI just spent $x and z years on this degree and I can\u2019t even use it, I\u2019m doing some dead end job, and the world is ending.\u201d Find quality of life, even in small bits here and there. Take good care of yourself, now.\n\nGood luck to all of you.",
