Take the help and don\u2019t be a jerk about it. If it\u2019s not though, don\u2019t beat yourself up if you\u2019re struggling. A lot of your friends you see online who seem to be thriving might have a safety net or just straight up funding that\u2019s keeping them afloat. \n\nTry to build some kind of network. I\u2019ve gotten jobs through friends or friends-of-friends, and I\u2019ve referred people to jobs that I only knew through facebook. A lot of whatever success I\u2019ve had has been about being in the right place at the right time. The more you stay in touch with people, the more likely you are to hear about opportunities that open up. \n\nAside from that, try to get smart about money if at all possible. The personal finance subreddit is a good resource. Try to stay out of any unnecessary debt and take advantage of any job benefits you can get (tuition remission, retirement accounts, FSA/HSA accounts, etc.). Work on your credit. They might not seem like a priority now right out of school, but messing those things up will haunt you for a long time. \n\nGood luck.
