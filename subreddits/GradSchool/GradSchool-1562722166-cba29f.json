  "text": "I successfully defended my dissertation today! It went so well, even I was surprised. There were no hard questions and no revisions were asked in the end! \nI feel so lightweight! It has been 6 years since I have started my PhD journey and there were times I thought I was never going to finish. But here I am! \nJust wanted to share it. There is a light at the end of tunnel after all!\n\nEdit: wow! I did not expect so many positive responses! What a supportive team we have here. Thank each and every one of you so much for your best wishes and  I wish everyone an easy journey.",

My university insisted on one \u201coutside\u201d subject expert sit on the committee from another institution,   I got some mathematician from UC Berkley.  He was a \u201chot shot\u201d and asked tangled questions.  My favorite committee member was a Catholic Nun who was Dean of Nursing (i had helped them with some early day computer stuff so they liked me).   She listened patiently to the Berkley dude then sliced him up until he went silent.  Good drama - good day.",
