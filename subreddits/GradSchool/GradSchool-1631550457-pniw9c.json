That's like two academic books (or more) every week. \n\nIn your comments you mentioned that these are books, and I also find academic books to be more challenging to go through than articles because the main points can be quite nebulous and not all academics are good book writers. There are books about, for example, political campaigns that I skip almost whole chapters because they are too focused on trivial details like interpersonal communications between campaign personnel and the minutiae of the campaigns. \n\nFor books, I think the process is still the same: What did they find and how? What does this mean? are questions I ask when I start reading a book and if a paragraph is not actively involved in answering those questions, I skim over it or skip it altogether. The background stuff can be helpful later, but it's not the \"meat\" of the question. Also, before I start reading a book, I will go onto google scholar and look for book reviews and read those first.

In grad school, you squeeze in work on less important short term things like classes and TAing when you can in between working on/planning extremely long-term research projects. It's a *massive* adjustment. Things like undergrad theses and undergrad term papers are meant to prep you for this sort of thing, but the truth is that because of the way the rest of undergrad education is structured (again, short-term assignments, and only a side focus on research and actual science), they really, really don't prepare you. Personally, I felt like I was drowning for my entire first year of grad school, even with a supportive lab and an understanding advisor. You're forced to completely re-wire your brain to un-learn old habits (that used to be beneficial, but now aren't) and learn completely new ones instead. That takes time, and it's very psychologically painful.\n\n>I have 450 pages of readings a week that I HAVE to hand in notes for to prove I read it.\n\nThis is a massive reading load, but no one expects you to actually do all of it, or even most of it. Want to know a secret? Your professor hasn't read that material in years. They're only assigning it to you because they know it has some important information in it, or that it represents some groundbreaking ideas in the history of your field. When they discuss it in class, they might bring up a few important points form the reading that they've collected over the years from when they read it a long time ago, or from previous class discussions that they've had, but mostly they'll be discussing broad ideas like \nthemes.\"\n\nWeekly readings aren't designed to test how intensively you can read a passage; they're presenting you with important ideas from your field so that *you* can benefit from them. With reading like that, you can't attack it head on, or even skim it front to back -- you need to know before hand what specific information/benefit you want to gain from it, and only focus on that as you read it. Take a journal article for example: unless it directly affects your research questions, then only the background, hypotheses, figures, part of the discussion, and conclusion will matter -- that might only be 15% of the paper.\n\n>But, I think I have undiagnosed ADHD (for many reasons that I won't go into here) and doing my work feels impossible. \n\nYour school may offer low-cost adhd assessment and associated talk therapy/treatment, if you're willing to be assessed by psychology PhD students in training.
