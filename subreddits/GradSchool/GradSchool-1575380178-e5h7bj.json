      "text": "I receive a relatively above-the-market stipend (\\~33K a year).  The way mine works, it treats the 20 hours of teaching responsibility as what the money is being provided to fund, and implies that a) your classes are added value received (expensive private school, so about 56k a year in face value) b) you're not paid for your lab work, even though you are contributing likely 40 or so hours a week in work that will contribute to the university's research output. I imagine my situation is similar to most schools.\n\nThe issue becomes that you end up putting in \\~60 hours a week in combined lab and teaching (stuff that should be defined as *paid work*), and that's outside of the work you put into to your classes (which I don't necessarily see as something we should be paid for). \n\nWhen i was accepted in the first place, the acceptance letter attributed a total value of \\~90K yearly to us - health care (\\~2K a year), plus classes (56K or so) and the stipend. The issue arises from the fact that they are assigning an arbitrary amount in terms of added value for classes (when they are free to us, they could set this number at literally any value and say that's what they're giving us). Additionally, the pay is contingent on this 20 hour idea (like most schools), but this number is vastly exceeded.\n\npersonally, I am comfortable with my situation. But I went straight into grad school from undergrad, and my situation is very different from the issues my colleagues face, whether it's international student fees, childcare, dental, etc. I'm so much younger than them (just turned 22) that I'll qualify for my parent's health care, and thus waive my assigned healthcare which will pay my fees for the next five years. This is a situation available to a select few number of PhD students, as most are not entering this early.\n\nthe biggest issue that grad students, adjuncts, non-tenure track, and even tenure track face is high-level administrators. The group of individuals at the \"top of the food chain\" so-to-speak are making salaries vastly outpacing the much larger group of individuals that are actually producing the work that the university generates. theres many articles on this, which I've attached below. These individuals, and their bloated salaries, contribute very little measurable benefit to a university.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinesimon/2017/09/05/bureaucrats-and-buildings-the-case-for-why-college-is-so-expensive/#569e2d9e456a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinesimon/2017/09/05/bureaucrats-and-buildings-the-case-for-why-college-is-so-expensive/#569e2d9e456a) \n\n [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/05/report-says-administrative-bloat-construction-booms-not-largely-responsible-tuition](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/05/report-says-administrative-bloat-construction-booms-not-largely-responsible-tuition)",

This is expected to be their full time job and often they sign a contract to not take any outside work (I did). They benefit the university and their program by producing research which gets published and increases the university's reputation, and teaching which means they are cheap labor compared to full time faculty.\n\nFor example, this term I teach one full class per term (15 hour/week, I am instructor of record), perform research (15+ hour/week) and take one class (10+ hour/week outside of class).

If the income of PhD candidates still keeps going up, the grad school application would be even more competitive. Imagine about this: I may go on a strike in the future, not at Harvard, but at City University of Little Rock online. \n\nSuppose more people in a few years successful get their PhD diplomas, PhDs are less rare, and your PhD diploma just depreciates. \n\nHowever, I don't realy worry about that, because the strike is very unlikely to be successful. The strikers' demand violate any reasonable market behavior. \n\nPs. As far as I know, there are easier $ to get from industry research and PhD programs overseas. Many European colleges are pretty generous to grad students. ETH gives you a solid $80k annual salary. IT companies prob could offer you a six figure job but people they hired seemed to me are mostly PhDs. After all PhD is still a diploma, getting it is sort of like buying an insurance for the future, and certainly there would be some degrees of sacrifice, luxury and leisure, one has to make to get a PhD.\n\nI am just tire to see such sentimental movements. Less people are willing to take time and think twice before taking actions anymore. Okay boomers.\n\nIf you strikers really have guts.

Is your PhD program more of a safe shot? If you do quit your PhD program and go somewhere else, and assume many people like you would do the same thing, incomes of PhD candidates would rise. Strike? Professors at Cambridge and Oxford did that once in a while, and less people are willing to go to the UK as a matter of fact, less money goes to the administration and less income for professors. Similar things could happen to the grad students at Harvard.\n \n>Your argument is that we shouldn't want better conditions because then more people would want to also enjoy these better conditions?

But there\u2019s a bunch of issues that should not exist in a place like Harvard, when the university is sitting on $40bn of endowment. \n\nFor example, Harvard does not guarantee funding for a 6th year even though the average social science PhD is now 6 years long. During the latter years, students also don\u2019t get the health insurance coverage, and have to pay facilities fee to access university facilities, which are essential for research. This of course varies by department. \n\nThere are also plenty of graduate student workers (especially masters students) who are treated like hourly wage workers and do not receive any benefits. Some get paid minimum wage and no more. \n\nDepression and anxiety are rampant around the Harvard campus. Yet the mental health coverage at Harvard has a copay of $35 for up to 40 sessions a year. For comparison, MIT has $10 copay on unlimited sessions. \n\nInternational student spouses have to have a specific level of coverage for visa reasons. This insurance costs $7000 a year at Harvard. \n\nBoston/Cambridge is insanely expensive. Rent in a share house costs around $1000 a month. Should a grad student have a kid while in grad school, childcare costs $2000 a month. \n\nThird party grievance procedure has been one of the main demands of the union, and Harvard has not even made a counter proposal on this. Harvard claims their internal processes are adequate. Yet Roland Fryer got away with a slap on the wrist and a two year suspension only, despite a number of women coming forward on the case. Jorge Dominguez was only forced into retirement last year, despite there being allegations against him since the 1980\u2019s. It only took about 40 years. \n\nYes, Harvard students are still far more privileged compared to many other grad students. But Harvard should be held to a higher standard, and lead changes in the current culture of academia.",

I would expect Harvard to pay more, but I wouldn't be shocked if more was still low.  \n  \nAt my program, grad students are also paid on an 8 month schedule - the half month of august is rolled into the half month of December, and the half month of May rolled into the half month of January. This structure completely fucks over incoming students who put down deposits on a place to live for August first, report in on week 1 or 2, work for half a month, then don't get paid until September 30th... It also messes with taxes, healthcare, any sort of social benefits program... Meanwhile, Faculty can choose to be paid on a 10 month of 12 month schedule...  \n  \nEven if paid well, I wouldn't be shocked if things like this occur for grad students even at Harvard.
