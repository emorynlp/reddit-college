The way mine works, it treats the 20 hours of teaching responsibility as what the money is being provided to fund, and implies that a) your classes are added value received (expensive private school, so about 56k a year in face value) b) you're not paid for your lab work, even though you are contributing likely 40 or so hours a week in work that will contribute to the university's research output. I imagine my situation is similar to most schools.\n\nThe issue becomes that you end up putting in \\~60 hours a week in combined lab and teaching (stuff that should be defined as *paid work*), and that's outside of the work you put into to your classes (which I don't necessarily see as something we should be paid for). \n\nWhen i was accepted in the first place, the acceptance letter attributed a total value of \\~90K yearly to us - health care (\\~2K a year), plus classes (56K or so) and the stipend. The issue arises from the fact that they are assigning an arbitrary amount in terms of added value for classes (when they are free to us, they could set this number at literally any value and say that's what they're giving us). Additionally, the pay is contingent on this 20 hour idea (like most schools), but this number is vastly exceeded.\n\npersonally, I am comfortable with my situation. But I went straight into grad school from undergrad, and my situation is very different from the issues my colleagues face, whether it's international student fees, childcare, dental, etc. I'm so much younger than them (just turned 22) that I'll qualify for my parent's health care, and thus waive my assigned healthcare which will pay my fees for the next five years. This is a situation available to a select few number of PhD students, as most are not entering this early.\n\nthe biggest issue that grad students, adjuncts, non-tenure track, and even tenure track face is high-level administrators. The group of individuals at the \"top of the food chain\" so-to-speak are making salaries vastly outpacing the much larger group of individuals that are actually producing the work that the university generates. theres many articles on this, which I've attached below. These individuals, and their bloated salaries, contribute very little measurable benefit to a university.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinesimon/2017/09/05/bureaucrats-and-buildings-the-case-for-why-college-is-so-expensive/#569e2d9e456a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinesimon/2017/09/05/bureaucrats-and-buildings-the-case-for-why-college-is-so-expensive/#569e2d9e456a) \n\n [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/05/report-says-administrative-bloat-construction-booms-not-largely-responsible-tuition](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/05/report-says-administrative-bloat-construction-booms-not-largely-responsible-tuition)", "author": "Brickolas75", "created": 1575402865, "upvotes": 34}, "f9k89k8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/e5h7bj/harvard_grad_students_going_on_strike_today/f9k89k8/", "text": "I feel really lucky that my program treats us so well.
