  "title:": "Sick and tired of a master's program \"for working professionals\" treating me like I'm 18",
  "text": "I know that this is outside of the normal range of post from doctorate candidates here, but I'm at my wit's end and my friends and partner have heard enough ranting.\n\nI am doing an MPP part time at a university that is convenient to me. This program prides itself as being \"for working professionals\" (though most of my classmates appear to be right out of undergrad). I am only a few years out, but my first priority is my job - I'm on a performance based reimbursement plan (so grades do matter) and they treat me well. \n\nBut, this program just seems to be fucking ridiculous and I'm over it. Please forgive the incoming petty (and maybe mean rant).\n\n* I am in a class where the attendance policy says that missing more than 1 class requires extra credit. Missing more than 2 classes means that \"it will be hard to get a B.\" I have already turned down a work trip and may have to again in a couple weeks because of this absurd policy. This isn't even a lab or something where being present matters - you could listen in and get the same info. I understand that it doesn't foster discussion the same way (not that she stops talking enough for it to even happen...) so I get losing participation points but how is participation 20% of my grade and missing more than 2 classes just automatically pushes me to a C? Come on.\n* When I talked to my advisor about the above issue (in the context that if you had a covid scare and needed to stay home while you waited for results, that would count against you), she said that \"it's up to the instructor\" and that I could \"drop the class if I wanted.\" Yes, but idk - maybe just take some responsibility and don't let grad professors have such obnoxious attendance policies? \n* All the fucking group projects y'all. One of my classes this semester has a group project and it's the second one to say it's important  because \"in the real world, you have to work with people to write policy memos.\" Guess what? I *am* in the real world. And I *do* write policy memos. But you know what? There are 40 hours / week where the person I'm writing the memo with is expected to be available for questions and if they aren't, that's a pretty big deal. Outside of that, they actually *know* how to write the damn memo - we might disagree on style or word choice - maybe there is a squabble over how the tone reflects intent - but that's it. In a class last semester, the professor used the first (individual) memo to create group where he balanced the groups (put someone with an A, a B, a C, etc. in the same group). I ended up having to babysit my group through the process. It's not my job to teach my colleagues. But I have to if I want to get a good grade. Idk - maybe my professors should do their their jobs and stop shirking responsibility? Group projects where I have to find time outside of work and class is silly - the \\~real world\\~ that my professors seem so obsessed with literally does not require that.\n* This one is maybe a bit controversial. But, I'm tired of having to treat everyone's political opinions with some kind of reverence because \"academic discourse.\" If you think racism isn't real, you're wrong. You might even be a bad person, but you're def wrong and as a WOC, I don't want to have to engage with your racist and violent ideas because \\~discourse\\~. I don't want to spend half my class time listening to the instructor convince a student that lobbying is impactful when he is just naive (e.g., \"but why would politicians... take the money?\"). Send the student home with some reading or at least relive the rest of us from class.\n* I hate that we treat knowing pre-algebra as a basic requirement, but not  civics. I had to test into the stats class (which let's be honest only taught me how to pass the exam, not anything about stats) but I started a class this semester talking about the three branches of government for... weeks. Why don't we require students to test into that? \n* I understand exams, but didn't we all agree that having your performance in a 15 week graduate level course determined by 4 hours of your life is silly? Because it feels ridiculous and silly. At no point in my job has a client said, \"quick. tell me what section of the Federal Acquisition Regulation related to technology transaction agreements? And if you get it wrong, I'm gonna fire you.\" And even when a question like that has come up, I've always had the ability to say, \"Hm, I'm not sure. Let me send you an email with the excerpt when I'm back at my desk.\"\n\nI'm just tired y'all. I get that I'm in school and it's not just going to be rainbows and daisies all the time. I also get that I probs just need to get over some of this stuff and is the result of me being unnecessarily exhausted. But, this program sells itself as a program for professionals - hell, it sells itself as a program for \"mid career professionals,\" and it really isn't. I am tired of the babying, the unpreparedness of my colleagues, the obnoxious desire to stick to \"the rules\" even when they don't make that much sense. I just feel like the program is trying really hard and by extension some of the professors are trying really hard to feel / be more important / special than they are. I just want to shake them and say \"no one is in this program because it's \\~prestigious\\~ or they realllllly wanted to take your class, we're all here because it made sense.  Can we stop making the lives of students harder while you pretend?\"\n\nThat's all. Thanks for listening to my rant. Commiseration welcome and encouraged.",

The attendance policy seems shit I'll give you that, but you can't blame the course for you being better than your classmates. Especially as it you make it sound like you have been and are still working in the subject area while they're straight from undergrad. You especially have no leg to stand on complaining about there being an exam, it is a taught course, what did you expect? You'd just have to sit through it for 15 weeks and get a participation certificate at the end? You complain about the exam accounting for too much of your grade, but then you also don't like group projects and participation accounting for your grade either. Did you research the course before you started at all? It sounds like it's just not a good fit for you.",

          "text": "I hear you and I have been trying to remind myself that this is not work - it\u2019s class and it\u2019s going to feel different. However, here are some options for that would make it better and more fitting for folks that work:\n\nProvide a high barrier alternative to attendance. I\u2019ve seen professors say that if you have to miss class, that\u2019s fine, but you\u2019ll need to submit a 5 page paper on the readings and themes by the following class to get credit for the class. This is a high enough barrier that people aren\u2019t going to miss class just because they can, but gives people that need to travel or otherwise work late an option to weigh. \n\nThis is an MPP program, not a science or math passed program. Timed, closed book multiple choice exams have so little functionality here. Alternatives might include papers (even those done in class), memos and briefs, etc. They reflect the actual work environment way more accurately though are harder and more frustrating to grade I\u2019m sure. \n\nGroup projects don\u2019t really have a place in a not full time program, in my opinion. They force you to rely on folks you\u2019ve never met and who frankly, just might not care. They are way more time consuming than doing the assignment Individually. Perhaps give the option to do an individual version of the project? At the very least don\u2019t ask for an evaluation of contributions that\u2019s has to be submitted as a group - that\u2019s not very functional. \n\nI did research the course - but balancing course times (the others start at 4:30 which doesn\u2019t work with work and commuting) and requires coursework doesn\u2019t leave many options. \n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019ll show up and do the work, I just wanted to rant.",

              "text": "Honestly I agree with your complaints, group work is shitty in any course, attendance requests are pointless in a postgrad course, and timed closed-book exams have no functionality in science or maths based jobs after graduation either. They are all well-known features of any taught course however. They're not babying you or treating you like you're 18 for including these things, that's just the program. Ranting is fine, go off! It's just that the post comes off as you feeling like you're above all of these things because you're a working professional. At the end of the day, 15 weeks isn't very long to get a masters level qualification (I don't know what MPP is), you'd be better off accepting that regardless of you and your abilities, it is what it is and you have to do it yo get the qualification. Ranting is fine, but if you take it to heart too much you'll just make it harder for yourself.",

      "text": "I empathize with your frustrations, but I don't really understand how some of the things you mentioned could possibly change. \n\nYour professor's policy is, I agree, ridiculous, but attendance policies in general are not regardless how old the student is. Grades correlate heavily with attendance, and attendance correlates heavily with whether the class gets offered again. Lots of classes get dropped due to low enrollment. \n\nIt absolutely should be up to the professor to set their attendance policy. Our universities already have 90% more administrators than they need, most of them with useless jobs, who nose into classroom policies where they don't belong. We need less McDonaldsization of academia, not more. \n\nI also think that an exam is a perfectly valid way to test your performance in a 15 week course. Although alternatively, you could also be required to do a 30 page research paper with at least 60 references as a substitution. Either way, a course needs a way to measure and assess a student's mastery of course material. So if you hate your exams, maybe suggest to your professor that they implement a comprehensive research paper as a substation. Professors do not have unlimited time, however, so timed exams are often easier than free-range essays. At some point, you'd end up getting dozens of emails asking when grades are posted and, if you've ever been in that position, it's extremely annoying (especially when you announce it on the online portal nobody reads and send emails via the class listserv that nobody reads). \n\nI strongly agree with you, however, about the politics thing. I don't know why such a thing would even be brought up in class, but even in a public policy course a student's personal political opinions are not relevant to the course content and the professor should shut that down. If they want to believe, for example, that racial disparities don't  exist in educational outcomes in a discussion of education policy, they should either provide some *strong* empirical evidence or be quiet. A professor should not be wasting any time trying to \"convince\" a student of well established findings. If they are having trouble understanding the course material, that's what office hours are for. You can lead a horse to water, but not make it drink, and you can lead a man to knowledge but not make him think. \n\nI also agree with you about the group work. Group work sucks and there's always one mediocre person who slacks off and sabotages the group.",

I thought \\*our\\* attendance policies were draconian, esp in the Covid era.  Ours openly conflict between \"stay home and isolate per CDC guidelines\" and \"four absences from this class result in an F.\" Take a guess what sniffly/sick students do when faced with that tidbit of admin's cognitive dissonance?\n\nChomsky:\n\n>My oldest, closest friend is a guy who came to the United States from Latvia when he was fifteen, fleeing from Hitler. He escaped to New York with his parents and went to George Washington High School, which in those days at least was the school for bright Jewish kids in New York City. And he once told me that the first thing that struck him about American schools was the fact that if he got a \"C\" in a course, nobody cared, but if he went to school three minutes late he was sent to the principal's office -and that generalized. He realized that what it meant is, what's valued here is the ability to work on an assembly line, even if it's an intellectual assembly line.\n\n2) Challenging the prof requires work and department politics. This isn't a surprise.\n\n3) Group projects suck, and one person seems to carry the weight.\n\n4) Holy shit am I with you on this one.  We had an issue with this one recently, and quite a bit of the right wing \"snowflakes\" freaked out that we literally discussed CRT in class (CRT originally coming from legal academia) following a professor's slip up.  This is likely a huge issue esp for us the social sciences (or adjacent) where political discussions happen regularly. The worst part is the disconnect between the \"Well, I feel...\" sentiments in society that have a negative material impact on minority/disfavored groups.\n\n5) Yes.\n\n6) Def yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside: While I am American, I attended three universities overseas before coming back, floundering in the bizarro-world of the employment market, freelancing, etc for 5 years, and then doing law school.
