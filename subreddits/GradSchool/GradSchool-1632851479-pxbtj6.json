I've managed to find all appropriate figures I need from papers published under Creative Commons. I want to be sure to properly attribute them. Do I simply include a citation in the caption \"(Jones et al. 2016)\"  and bibliography?

The reference in the bibliography takes care of all of this, including the permanent link if you've got a DOI. In my style (Vancouver) the original figure number and page number should be included at the end of the standard formatted reference in the bib, and should be repeated for each figure taken from that work.\n\nThe caption for the figure should say something like \"From Jones et al, used under CC-BY 4.0 license (44)\" where \"(44)\" is the appropriate in-text citation for your style.\n\nHopefully someone else will find this useful in the future. Many journals now publish under the CC-BY license by default, or by option. The title page will generally have the CC logo at the bottom, or it will have \u00a9The Authors, in which case you need to visit the webpage and check the bottom (usually) of the page where it will detail the copyright. If the title page attributes copyright to the publisher, i.e. \u00a9Elsevier, then you can be almost certain it is NOT CC, though there are some exceptions if it's published as Open Access.", "author": "blteare", "created": 1632873736, "upvotes": 1}, "hen82wi": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pxbtj6/how_to_properly_attribute_figures_taken_from/hen82wi/", "text": "Probably very discipline-specific, and I don\u2019t really know anything about Creative Commons.
