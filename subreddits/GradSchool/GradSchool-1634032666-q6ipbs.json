  "text": "As the title says, I ordered a workstation weeks ago and IT still hasn't installed it. \n\nWhilst it is possible to use another workstation on campus, I'm a PhD student and need access to the office as well as elevated IT permissions which regular workstations can't/don't have. \n\nIt's literally preventing me from working on campus since everyone else has a personal machine. Another PhD student I spoke to said they thought my desk was abandoned since they hadn't even officially given me it until last week\n\nI know departments are very overworked thanks to covid-- what can I do here?",
