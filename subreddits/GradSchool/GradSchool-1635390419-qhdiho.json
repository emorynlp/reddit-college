My institution has a massive back log in mental health services in addition to keeping super strict policies around marks and standards to keep up with your degree/stay in your program. I get they want to remain among the best institutions but now even MORE people are needing mental health services from witnessing suicides because they happen and are often public (in buildings on campus). Then they go and just fix the area that allowed someone to commit suicide in that method instead of looking at their own policies, the economic and housing pressure these kids are under and how crushing some of the expectations on them are.",

I uprooted my life and moved halfway across the country to a city I didn\u2019t know anyone in, abandoning the support network I\u2019d spent several year building. It was going to be okay because the community in my department was fantastic and my partner and I could thankfully afford to fly and see each other pretty frequently (both on generous fellowships). \n\nThen covid hit my second semester. Suddenly I had no department and it was unsafe to fly (I was considered at risk for covid complications several times over). I would go weeks not having a single in real life conversation with a person and went basically a year without even TOUCHING another human being. And we were just expected to keep going through all of it. \n\nThen I was in Texas and the winter storm hit too and it was so traumatic and a harsh reminder of how isolated and helpless I was. The only reason I didn\u2019t freeze/starve was the help of neighbors who didn\u2019t even know me. \n\nI\u2019m in my third year now and have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for a while. At the moment I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to master out and move back to my partner/friends. Grad school is tough anyways but I think people really gloss over how destructive covid has been for a lot of us.",

Lots of programs are insulated from recognizing and dealing with this abuse of power and many times they reward it. So often it goes unpunished. The best thing you can do is to 1) recognize it 2) get help, and/or 3) remove yourself from the toxic environment. You are still a smart person (arguably more so) even if you abandon a grad program and you'll rediscover that there's lots more to life once you're on the outside.",

But it's really a change in advice and thus policy. (Again, this is a general statement about changes in higher ed practices, not specific to Vandy's decisions.)\n\nThe other issue is official cause of death. I recently authored an obit for a faculty member and knew not to include anything more than \"died suddenly\". People who knew the deceased knew it was a heart attack, but the obit had to go out before authorities announced an official cause of death, and the school wasn't going to attach its name to any information that didn't come from local authorities. It would look *more* suspicious if we announced a heart attack and a week later authorities announced cardiac arrest due to a drug overdose.\n\nIn other words, the overall calculation from schools is \"We need to get this news out, we need to make people aware of mental health resources, we can't say anything the family doesn't want us to say, and we won't announce an unofficial cause of death.\" That leaves a pretty bare-bones announcement as the default option.\n\nThat doesn't stop others from reporting a suicide, though. Local news have their own contacts within the medical examiner's office and may report something like \"...in what authorities describe as an apparent suicide.\" Even that practice is changing, though. Reporters are more likely to avoid any mention of cause of death without an on-the-record statement from authorities; instead they stick to bare facts like \"was found dead this morning in their dorm room.\"",

The other crazy part on the school's end is taking on a PhD student is technically a huge investment for the school. Almost everyone in here can probably recall getting some sort of admissions letter stating that you're getting some crazy amount of money in terms of financial commitment. Mine said I was getting roughly $95K yearly when you add up stipend, health insurance, and the cost of tuition (expensive private school in high CoL city). Even when you factor in the arbitrary nature of the cost of tuition, these suicides, among all of the sadness, loss, etc., also represent a massive financial toll for universities that I'm shocked they don't take more seriously, because money tends to be the only thing that these universities truly care about. Because they lose not only those 4 investments, but they also receive a huge hit to reputation, significantly reducing the quality of future applicants and thus perhaps impacting future ability to obtain funding.",
