  "text": "I defended my master's thesis today. It's not over\u2014I still have some coursework before I graduate in 2021\u2014but I wanted to let anyone who needs to hear it know a few things from my not-quite-expert experience:\n\n* Your committee will not let you defend if they don't think you are ready.\n   * Everyone says this, and I agree: *Your committee is not out to get you*. If you are thorough in your paper (which they may or may not read) and hit the big points in your presentation, it will give them enough to understand and avoid probing questions you aren't prepared for. \n   * Think of the post-presentation questioning as a conversation with people you haven't hung out with in a while. Your committee is genuinely interested in you and your research\u2014that's why you chose them, right?\n* Technical glitches happen. In my case, I was in the wrong 'room' for a while, chatting with a colleague whom I'd invited. My advisor texted us and let us know what was going on and everyone was fine; this sort of thing is expected in the new-new-new technological age.\n   * Nervousness is expected too. Have a small coffee instead of a large one, go to the bathroom before you settle in, and smile! \n   * A bit of small talk before the presentation is probably OK. Again, you haven't seen these people for months; check in on one another.\n* If you live with people and/or pets, impress upon them that they need to tiptoe around if they will be anywhere near you. Send the dog on a play date at a neighbor's, or schedule its grooming for that day. And even if a pet or small child wanders in, that's not completely unexpected these days either.\n* If possible, bring a friend. This could be a classmate or someone you know outside of school. You will have a guaranteed fan right there, if you doubt having them. (You will have many.)\n\nAnd that's it for the moment! As I said, this is my lay opinion, but it was a lot less painful than I expected. You will get there!",

          "text": "Good luck! I've been in three master thesis committees (consisting of an external member, and myself), and *\"Your committee is not out to get you.\"* really is the truth. Questions we ask are typically to get the student to reflect and elaborate further on something we felt was lacking or not detailed enough in the thesis. Maybe the student knows something about the subject they weren't able to express in text. The Q&A session is typically much more like a formal discussion than an interrogation which I think many students believe the session is like. After all three sessions I've been part of, the students have concluded that it was far less scary and painful than anticipated, and that they rather enjoyed discussing their work with someone else than their supervisor and student peers. @jukate, you'll do just fine :)",
