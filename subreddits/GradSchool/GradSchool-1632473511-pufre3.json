We also receive grades on the quality of our discussion skills etc. \n\nWe had a prep meeting yesterday before the formal discussion and I suggested a question I wanted to ask. Today, before I get a chance to ask my question, another person asks it word for word and even quotes the same sentence from the article that I quoted the day before. I may seem petty but this is incredibly annoying. I won't be making the mistake of mentioning my questions in the prep meeting again.", "author": "storm_borm", "created": 1632473511, "retrieved": 1632952064, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"he2m09m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pufre3/mini_rant_i_feel_plagiarised/he2m09m/", "text": "Unfortunately, this happens sometimes, even with paper ideas. A friend of mine had another student scoop her entire paper idea because this student asked her for help and instead they chose to steal her whole idea. She told me that, after that, she only shares vague ideas about what her papers might be about. For example \"I think I'm going to write something about self-esteem and social media use\" and if she is pressed for more info, she will pretend like she hasn't really thought it out yet.", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1632476630, "upvotes": 18}}}
