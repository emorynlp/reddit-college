  "text": "How bad is it to do a poor homework (writing a specific aims draft\u2014 simulating like if I was applying for a grant) that\u2019s not going to be graded for a grad school course? I am doing it today and needs to be handed in, on about 1.5 hours. I haven\u2019t done it because I can barely do basic things like washing the dishes, do things I like, I feel sleepy all day. So I basically have to re-schedule my crying time to meet with doing an assignment. I am so ashamed that the professors/program staff are going to think that I don\u2019t know how to write or that I am dumb, it\u2019s just that I am at the worst moment of my life right now.",

      "text": "Not bad at all. Even when I am doing awesome in my program, something always falls between the cracks. Do your best in the allotted time and don't sweat it! Especially in classes, I often toe the line to see how little effort I can put in before my grade slips. This is how I manage my time!\n\nHonestly, it sounds like, because it's a draft, the point of this is so you can get feedback. You aren't supposed to be a fully-actualized writer yet. Criticism, at this point in your career, is good! So get your ideas on paper as clearly as you can, and then take a deep breath, get the feedback and make sure you allot more time for your revision. They will be more impressed  by the final product and your improvement, because that's what you're here for!",
