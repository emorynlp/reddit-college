  "text": "Hey all. I\u2019m currently finishing my Bachelors this month and was planning to do the part time Masters in Social Work program at USC.  Problem is this is every Saturday for the next three years and I would be commuting for both that and my full time job.  We were thinking about moving but I recently found out I\u2019m pregnant so I was considering an online program.  Does anyone have thoughts or experience on this?  I\u2019ve heard as long as it\u2019s accredited that it\u2019s the same but I\u2019ve also heard online degrees are looked at last by employers.  I could use all the suggestions or personal experience y\u2019all have!",
