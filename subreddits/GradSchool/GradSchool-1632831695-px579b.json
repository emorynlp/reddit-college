  "text": "I'm not entirely sure if this belongs here but:\n\nI live approximately 25 miles from school, or about a 45 minute drive depending on traffic. I've been looking into the possibility of taking public transit to school, specifically the train. There's a train station about a mile from my house and then one about a mile from school. There's also another train station down by school that the school has free parking at, but that one is 15+ miles away... The school doesn't offer shuttles off campus and it also has pretty bad parking issues.\n\nI'd love to not drive to/from campus every day but the train ticket to the station by school is $$$, even for a monthly and even compared to the price of gas/month. Additionally, taking a train and not driving my fuel inefficient car everyday would definitely be better for environmental impact. **And this brings me to my question:** Does anyone know of a way to get funding from the school or some other source for using public transit to get to school?",
