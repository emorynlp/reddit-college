  "text": "I'm a college freshman and it's been a rough, rough semester. I am not doing well in my classes due in no small part of the deaths of both my grandparents, the aftermath of my uncle's house burning to ashes last summer, my sister trying to escape her emotionally abusive husband, etc. My professors probably think I'm bullshitting at this point, just last week I electrocuted myself and had to miss class for the hundredth time. God is trying to kill me, I swear.\n\nAnyways, my grandfather was really into ancestry. It was basically his favorite hobby, he traced our family back to the Civil War. This *should* make this assignment easy but A. Every time I think about having to write about them for a project I start bawling B. We are expected to present this to the class, and I'm simply not emotionally ready to disclose this to my classmates right now and I also think I would get too emotional and C. I can't access his work because it makes me cry and none of my family members are emotionally prepared to dig through his stuff, discuss our family history, etc right now.\n\nThis assignment has just awful timing, and personally I don't really want to present my family history to a room of strangers anyways. That's private and some of my ancestors were awful people, adding my grandparents death to this has made it a complete nightmare for me.\n\nI don't know what to do, what do I say to my professor? I can't just declare \"I won't do this assignment.\", and I want to do good work for this class, but this project is salting my wounds every day and I can't handle it. I've tried but nothing gets done because I just get so upset.",

          "text": "That's what I did for mine. I'm adopted so biologically I have no idea of my family history. Even with my adoptive family there's a lot of trauma with the Holocaust and abandonment on both sides leaving many family ties broken. You can also ask if there if a different assignment and just explain there's some trauma within the family that makes this difficult to do. Not sure if they'll accommodate to that though.",

You can share this with the professor and ask whether you can complete an alternative assignment or have a bit of a delay. Neither may occur, but they are more likely to take you seriously if you have the formal documentation.\n\nGood luck with everything!",
