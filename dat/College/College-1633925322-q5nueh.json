  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman at a small liberal arts college (2k students) and we\u2019re 7 weeks in and I\u2019m lonely as fuck. There is a group of girls I met during orientation (they broke us up into groups for orientation and these 4 girls were some of the people in mine) who I\u2019m in a group chat with and I sometimes hang out with them from time to time. There\u2019s also this guy who I kinda like who was also in my orientation group who I hang out with sometimes\u2026.and those are literally all the people I hang out with. \n\nI have severe social anxiety, I\u2019m socially awkward asf, and I get so sad when I see other people hanging out with people all the time and getting invited to stuff. I was talking to one of the girls in the group chat I\u2019m in about how I see her and the other girls always walking around and hanging out with various people they met in their classes, in their floor, etc. and I don\u2019t get why I can\u2019t do the same. I got so sad when I was talking to the guy im interested in and I asked him about what his plans for Halloween were and he told me he got invited to a rave by some guy on his floor. I feel sad bc I don\u2019t have that many people I talk to and I don\u2019t get invited to go anywhere. I spent entire days alone sometimes and I hate it. My depression is worsening and im afraid that im going to be just as lonely in college as I was in high school. \n\nWhat do I do? I have like 1 club I go to every week (and another one that I\u2019m going to start attending this week) and I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have been able to work up the courage to ask to hang out. I get so scared and nervous in my classes that I can\u2019t really talk to anyone. I\u2019m fucking lonely and I hate this\u2026it\u2019s also fall break rn and the campus is extra empty so I\u2019m even lonelier than usual.",

Then also consider you might need to work on your social skills actively vs hoping things will get better. I have anxiety as well but you must know at least intellectually that no one is paying nearly as much negative attention on you as you think they are.",

      "text": "I was in the same position as you. As a freshman I didn't have many friends, and I didn't do much either. I basically just sat in my Dorm room all day watching Netflix or doing homework. \n\nBut an important thing that I learned was that you have to get out of a High School mentality and start thinking like an Adult. When you're in College, you're no longer forced to be around the same people all day and befriend those people like you are in High School. You're an Adult, you can go anywhere in the world. \n\nDon't feel like you have to meet people on campus. Go to bars, go to nightclubs, go to music festivals. Find events for yourself to go to, don't rely on invites from other people. And once you're out in the world, I guarantee you will meet people. \n\nOnce you're out of College and in the real world, this is how you're going to have to meet people. I moved across the country and literally knew no one in the City I'm in. How did I meet people? I went out to the hottest nightclubs in the city, I went to Bars and hung out, I went to Music Festivals and met people from all over the world that I still talk with",
