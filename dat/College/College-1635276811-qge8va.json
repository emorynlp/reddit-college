  "text": "I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m about to transfer colleges (now I\u2019m living at home and go to college in my hometown) but this college isn\u2019t the right for me. So I\u2019ll be transferring and living in dorms, starting next semester. I will have a single room. But honestly I\u2019m not excited about living alone and far from home at all. I have a (very) good relationship with my parents so I can\u2019t imagine living alone being any better than living at home. So I\u2019m asking, what do you personally like about living alone and going to college away from home? I\u2019m trying to find something to look forward to.",

      "text": "This will let you spread your wings a little bit more. I live alone and was 6 hours away from home before I transferred to my new school. When you are graduated and working you will not be seeing your parents everyday. They won\u2019t be cooking for you, running your errands, going to your doctors appointments, waking you up in the morning etc. I think living alone and being more than a convenient distance away from your family is one of the best things you can ever do for yourself to become independent.\n\nOn the bright side, you learn to love the independence & you will settle into a routine. You get to be your own person and see who you really are without influence from others. It\u2019s a great time to grow and be the person you want to be.",
