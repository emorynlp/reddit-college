  "title:": "About the mental health crisis and suicides among college students",
  "text": "In light of the recent suicides at UNC-Chapel Hill and students struggling with mental health issues around the U.S. including my own, I just wanted to try and tell anyone who reads this to tell the ones near and dear to you how much you love them and appreciate them being in your life. Do it EVERY CHANCE YOU GET because life is unpredictable and anything could happen from day to day. I lost my younger cousin to suicide last year who I was really close with and I will never get over it. There are good days and bad days.\n\nToday's kids are faced with so much shit and bombarded with headlines from all this pervasive technology every day that it's easy to get caught up in all the hysteria and pandemonium that's being talked about. Not to mention the pandemic has only made it all worse.\n\nTeens' mental health awareness and awareness for everyone in general hasn't caught up with the 21st century reality we live in. Words like \"weak\" and \"soft\" are still being used about people with poor mental health like this is the 1960s. That is only contributing to the crisis. School administrators and society as a whole have to do some deep soul searching and change their mentalities on this and more has to be done than schools just giving \"wellness days\" to help students cope. Whoever reads this, if you're going through a mental crisis, I hope it helps to know that I understand what it's like to feel that way. We all respond to crisis differently but we all can relate in our own way to what's happening in the current climate. I want you to know you are loved and you always matter to someone even if you think you don't. If you're struggling, for God's sake, please don't hesitate to reach out to someone, anyone, and let them know in your own way that you need help. I hope I strike a chord with anyone who reads this. God bless YOU and take care of yourself.",

      "text": "A huge issue is that a lot of us build a social support network in grade school that consists of family, friends and/or teachers/staff and that is pulled right from under your feet if you\u2019re 100s or 1,000s of miles away from home.\n\nGoing from having a network of people that can help you when you\u2019re down to being stressed as fuck, not knowing what you\u2019re doing and extremely isolated within the span of a few months is too extreme a transition for a lot of people, including me.\n\nI envy my friend that took a gap year to get a job and do some traveling as it definitely leveled out the curve between home life and college. Honestly, I think some kind of gap should be normalized where you can ease in to adult life without the sink or swim mentality.",

      "text": "I'm the age where facebook and social media were first pushed. I remember the infancy of all of it. The cycle of social media is interesting. My generation seemed to keep hold of it for a fairly long time, and some still do. Although, there was a point where a lot of us left them. Most of my friends that are my age don't have any social media accounts.\n\nAfter we left them, a few years down the road our parents started picking it up. Now all of our parents have facebook. It's super easy to see how it's affecting them. The politics and opinions on shit they've never had opinions on are now all they talk about. We can see the toxicity of the platforms through our parents.\n\nI highly suggest getting rid of ALL of social media. The anonymity on reddit is beneficial for users but I definitely don't think it works for everyone.\n\nI've never ever heard anybody call somebody with mental illness weak or soft. I've never heard anybody ever talk about mental illness in a negative way. I don't think it's healthy to assume a certain group of people thinks you're something else because of mental health issues. In fact, assuming that probably adds more stress than necessary.",

          "text": "1) A ton of people absolutely do call those with mental illnesses weak or soft. Like those that call anxiety or depression sufferers \"pussies\" or other insults to degrade them or discount their experiences. I've seen it not only on social media, but in real life too. Don't assume it doesn't happen because you personally haven't witnessed it.\n\n2) Telling someone God doesn't exist for no reason makes you a cunt, you absolutely did not need to say that to someone trying to spread a positive message. Did saying it make you feel powerful and smart or something? Because stating it as if it were fact makes you a condescending dickhead, considering there's literally no way for us to know or not. Saying there is in fact no god is just as wrong as saying there is in fact a god.\n\nMaybe YOU should get off of all social media and delete your reddit, because it seems to have made you a horrible person, in my opinion.",

              "text": "I'll tell you what. You quantify and point out these people who are calling you a pussy for mental illness. Quantify it. \n\nYou're just saying there's a ton of people, does that mean there's actually a ton of people? No, not one bit. If I say there's 20 billion rocks in my bank account, does it mean there is? No. \n\nIt's detrimental to believe that there are people who hate you. It's a victim complex. You're the victim of the 'tons' of people who say bad things about people with mental illness. Except, there's probably very few people that actually do this.",
