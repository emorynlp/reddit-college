  "text": "I was just scrolling through my phone when I get an email from one of our deans. I saw the words \"We are deeply saddened...\"and at the point I just assumed an alum, or an old faculty member passed away. Then I click on the email and I see that a member of my class had apparently died on an off campus car accident. Gone. Just like that. I didn't know the person, and I didn't even recognize the name. That being said, that meant that before they passed, I coudlve walked passed them and I wouldn't have even known. Its just so sad, but imagine from the parents perspective. You just sent your kid to college, and just over a month later, you get an email saying they're dead. So depressing",

      "text": "My brother just recently graduated high school and started his first year of college. At the graduation ceremony, it was revealed to everyone that a male classmate who was originally supposed to have been sitting in one of the seats next to all of the other graduates had passed earlier in the year due to cancer. My brother later told my family that nobody knew what type of cancer, but that the boy was well liked and respected by everyone and that his sudden death saddened so many people in the school, both teachers and students. \n\nI also had a math teacher pass away as well from cancer when I was in middle school. He too was suffering from cancer, but the school just kept telling me and my class whenever we asked about his whereabouts, that he was simply \"sick\". When he passed it devastated us when they told us, because he too was well beloved and liked by everyone. I remember the day they held a memorial for him, where the principal did a speech commemorating him in front of the classroom he taught us in. It does depress me a bit that my class was the last class he was teaching before he died, it just seems so surreal and strange to me to understand that. So nothing in college happened just yet, but my brother and I have felt loss before we even started college.",

A Professor who taught us Programming for that semester was supposed to make the question paper and assign it. But on the exam day, he called us and said that he was unwell, so he couldn't set the questions and the exam would be postponed for a week. We wished that he get well soon. At the same time we were happy that we got an extra week for preparing. Next week, a different professor took our tests, as he was still unwell. We gave the exam, and were relaxing as the semester just ended. 3 days after that, suddenly, we got the news that our Professor just died. It was so shocking. The person who taught us for the entire semester, called us sometimes, suddenly, isn't any more. Never felt so numb before. Made me realise life is just so unpredictable.",
