  "text": "My college is being really difficult this semester and canceling classes left and right due to low enrollment. I only needed to finish my Math B23 Finite Math course to be able to graduate on time and now I most likely will have to wait another year just to be able to take it. I wanted to know if there were any options for me to just take the one class I need in an accredited online college. Is that possible? Any information would be greatly appreciated.",
