  "text": "I'm not sure if anyone will read this, and that's fine, at the very minimum I think I'll feel a little better if I just ramble online.\n\nI'm going through my 2nd year of University as an Electrical Engineering major, and I'm nearly a Junior by credit (51). My freshman year went well with a 3.75 cumulative without any drops, and I even have an internship secured for this summer! But, this 1st semester as a sophomore has been **embarrassing**. I've dropped a class that was an elective that I didn't enjoy, and I'm dropping another class (core) because its possible I'll fail it or lose a significant portion of my GPA if I pull through and pass it with a D.\n\nTo give some context, I slacked off during the first half of the semester, and it ultimately bit me in the ass, which is why I've dropped classes. I've learned **a lot,** however. I learned that College isn't like High School where you can get by without putting in excruciating effort, I didn't know this last year, it was all on zoom and I found it to be easy. College is the real deal now, and I didn't come to that realization until I was almost too late to drop classes (without them being an F). I've been humbled. I'm not looking for excuses. I accept and claim **full** responsibility for the fact that I procrastinated and that I didn't attempt to combat my ADHD. I now know that honest effort is required and that nothing will be a better substitute than hard work.\n\nBut the fact that I've dropped classes has been stuck on me, its humiliating and I feel like less of a man for doing it. Should I have accepted the GPA drop? I know that when I retake my core class that I can do far better or at least not fail, and the 'withdraw' on my transcript will be gone, but even then, was this a bad judgement call? Am I a coward?\n\nMaybe I'm just an emotional idiot, who knows. But this is revolving around me and I can't pick a stance on whether what I've done is right. At the very minimum, I've received a very important lesson and a wake up call. \n\nEveryone else is probably having a hard time, its college after all, but I just going to assume not many have dropped or failed a class before. Any comments, positive or negative, are welcome and appreciated.",

      "text": "I'm pretty sure many people have dropped and/or failed a class before. Many people don't even graduate from university. Dropping a course that you don't think you can pass doesn't make you less of a man or a coward, so there is no need to feel embarrassed. I think proactively making the decision to drop the class is better than sitting around and failing it. As long as you learn from this experience and make sure you are more focused next time, then I believe you made a good decision.",

      "text": "It seems like you're too harsh on yourself as you question whether or not you should be punished somehow for dropping classes. Dropping classes surely isn't an easy way out, and it can be a lot to come to terms with by itself as your post is a representation of, so I think the best you can do is take it as it is and move forward. The more you linger on the fact that you dropped classes, the less you're working toward your future classes, and that's how this cycle might become repetitive.",
