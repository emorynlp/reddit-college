  "title:": "EXAM TAKING TIPS (take 'em or leave 'em)",
  "text": "Prof here -- I don't know how helpful this will be, but I thought I'd give a few tips for folks that are nervous about taking finals for the first time.\n\nJust like my other advice, this is science-based.  Because all that feel-good vibes stuff drives me nuts. \n\n**1.)  IF YOU HAVE TO \"CRAM\" DON'T DO IT THE NIGHT BEFORE.**   For instance, if you have only 3 days to study, breaking it into 2 hours per day per subject is way better than doing 6 straight hours the night before.\n\n**2.) ANKI IS YOUR FRIEND.**  Make the cards now, it's a fantastic way to memorize --but if you don't understand your flashcards, don't bother.  This is a memorizing thing (great for languages or formulas)  [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)\n\n**3.) MEMORY DEVICES:**\n\nYou might have heard of **PEMDAS** (P*arentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction*) make a word out of first letters.  If it doesn't make a word, make a sentence like...\n\n  \"**K**eep **P**ots **C**lean, **O**r **F**amily **G**ets **S**ick\" for the taxonomy order of *Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species\"* or if you're a scuba diver \"**B**ruce **W**illis **R**uins **A**ll **F**ilms\" for *\"BCD, Weights, Releases, Final Check\"*\n\n**4.) CALMING DOWN:**   Here's something I learned from freediving.  If you find yourself going into a major panic, you need to lower your heart rate.  You need to get it as slow as you can.  Now, a lot of folks achieve that through yoga/meditation.  I can't do that.  It just doesn't work for me.  It's too slow and I'm too distracted.  So I had to learn the scientifically proven heart rate lowering hack:\n\n1) Exhale for the count of 8... (this is hard).  A full slow count of 8, so almost a full 8 seconds.  Not a fast 12345678, but 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8 \n\n2) Hold breath for 2 seconds\n\n   3) Inhale deeply for 2 seconds\n\n   4) Hold breath for 2 seconds\n\nRepeat starting at one.  If you don't believe it works, read this article about how some freediver's breathing can allow them to lower their heartbeat to the point where they can stay underwater for 7 minutes.  [https://theconsciousclub.com/articles/the-art-of-holding-your-breath-exploring-the-freediving-breathing-technique](https://theconsciousclub.com/articles/the-art-of-holding-your-breath-exploring-the-freediving-breathing-technique)  They do it using the breathing exercise, then going into deep cold water (which has to do with the mammalian dive reflex which you can't do unless your exam is underwater.)  \n\n**5.) GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP:**   *Tell your roommate to shut the fuck up.*  A good night's sleep is CRITICAL.   This is another reason you shouldn't cram the night before.  Your brain actually absorbs some stuff during sleep.  \n\n**6.) SKIM THE EXAM BEFORE YOU START ANSWERING QUESTIONS:**  I always suggest this to students, and then some of them don't take it.   So what happens?  They spend a half-hour working on a question they don't really know the answer to, and then run out of time -- and they aren't able to get to the questions that they absolutely do know the answers to.  Answer the questions you can ace FIRST. Then go back and tackle the others.\n\n**7.) WAKE UP EARLY.**  Rushing to class gets your heart rate up.  When your heart rate is up, you are more likely to panic.  When you panic, you are more likely to second guess yourself and more likely to make a mistake.  (again, ask any scuba diver.)\n\n**8.) EAT BREAKFAST IF YOU USUALLY EAT BREAKFAST.**   I know some people who just can't eat breakfast early.   But you don't want to be hungry during an exam.\n\n**9.) ONLY USE STUDY GROUPS WITH PEOPLE WHO GIVE A SHIT.**   I remember this from when I was in college.  We'd schedule \"study groups\" and do nothing but eat pizza and bitch about classes.  That was only until I did a study group with a roommate that was pre-med.  We were studying totally different things, but she'd give me flashcards, and I'd ask her questions, then I'd give her my flashcards and she'd ask me questions.   What really worked about that was that if I tried to give some bullshit explanation on one of my computer science answers she'd have no idea what I was talking about and would say... I don't know if that's the same as what's on here.   Ditto with her pre-med questions.  If she wasn't able to explain the answer in a clear way that I could understand as a non-premed student she knew she needed to work on it.   But with some of my friends, it wasn't so much of a study group as it was a pizza party with textbooks open.  \n\n**10.) READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THEM BACKWARDS IF YOU HAVE TO!**    I can't tell you how many of my really good students lose points because they didn't read carefully.   And they aren't trick questions!   I'll write something like \"Give two examples of scene transitions that do X\" and they'll list one.   The reason?  They just saw \"Give... transition.... do X\".   And boom - they lose 5 points on a 10 point question.\n\n**FINALLY -- IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.**  This exam does not determine whether or not you get cancer.  It is not worth beating yourself up for.  Work your hardest to pass it, but if you can't -- I promise you that it's not the end of the world.  You're not a bad person because you failed an exam.  You're not going to get disowned. I promise that you're going to be okay.   Your career is a marathon -- if you slow down and don't do great on one mile, that's fine.  You've got 25 other miles to prove you're a hard worker.",

Im a biomajor and taking anatomy and physiology, biochem, cell bio, and a biostatistics class. Im totally not going to be able to get a lot of sleep. Maybe 4-5 hours a night. \n\nMy exams always overlap. Next week I have 5 exams and a quiz. Some are 2 exams within the same day. Then 2 exams the week after that. I may have to not work a couple of shifts and work extra over break if I have to but how do I actually suceed and not kill myself. All my grades are borderline grades (still good grades) and im failing my biochem class. I could get a B in it if I get an A in the third exam and the final which is worth a lot and replace the lowest test score. \n\nI feel really overwhelmed but not as much as my lab partner who has 8 exams in one week. Im genuinely concerned for her since its her first semester of college ever. At least its my third year so im used to the dumpster fire",

              "text": "Time management has to do with the negative space. I\u2019m a single parent of three, I work full time and I study a language for fun. I run three times a week, do yoga and strength train. I also have two passion projects I\u2019m working on. My body crashes every night at 8 pm and I require 8 hours sleep. \n\nIm very intentional about my time. I prioritize. Eating healthy and exercise is high up on the list. Sleep is not negotiable. \n\nLook at places in your schedule that you can change. Friend time is important, as is down time. What brings you happiness? That\u2019s where you get your energy from. \n\nIf you organize and prioritize, you can accomplish a lot. I clean the house once a week, batch cook once a week and I do a marathon grading session. I drive my kids to their activities, go to their games, walk the dog, etc. I don\u2019t watch TV. I limit my Reddit time. \n\nI call my friends while I\u2019m walking the dog. I listen to my podcast/ audio book/ music while I clean. I grade while I\u2019m waiting for my kids. I clean as I go. I wash clothes every day. \n\nI know my life (and energy level, sadly) is very different from yours, but it\u2019s possible. Carve out time to review your notes after class. Find audio resources to listen to as you walk or hang out in your room. Do the things that make you happy and bring you joy. Feel your feelings and deal with your emotional issues (we all have them). Stay in the moment and appreciate the beauty around you. Dream about your future and let those dreams give you the energy to make it through the crappy stuff. \n\nKeep reaching out. You\u2019re not alone. Transform the dumpster fire into a heat source. Use it to cook. Back away when it\u2019s too hot. Im very serious- the stories we tell ourselves impact the way we experience things. I despise cooking/ cleaning/ organizing. I put my favorite music on and I visualize how much easier it will be for my future self. It\u2019s surprising how much better I\u2019ve gotten over the years and how much I don\u2019t actively hate it.",

Honestly the set of classes youre taking right now sounds very hard, I would have tried to sub in an easier easy A gen ed to reduce the workload. If that wasnt possible I would have just not taken 1 of the classes, but thats just me. I know that doesnt help you know but something to think about for the future, personally Id rather graduate late and do well than on time but frazzled and with worse grades. \n\nIs anatomy and physiology the same class? If so then Im not following how you have 5 exams the same week, if youre taking 4 classes. \n\nIf you can, drop the class youre failing. A withdraw is better than a failing grade, and you dont seem to have much extra time to pull the grade up. \n\nAt this point you just need to buckle down and push through. No or very little play/personal time. Take a short study break every hour to help keep you sane. Review a bit of each class each day.",

You should've been studying through the semester/quarter so that studying for finals is mostly review and refreshing your memory. Yeah it's possible to learn something at the last second, but there comes a point where you either know it or you don't. If it's 11pm the night before the final, you're not going to suddenly understand things better by staying up another 3 hours to learn it. At that point, better to get sleep and let your brain process what you've been reviewing. Even if you did teach yourself something, all you're doing is putting that concept in your short term memory, not actually learning it. That may be fine for random GEs where you don't care about it and won't take another class that builds off of it, but that isn't what you want for major classes or anything in a sequence.",

You don't need a 4.0 to get into med/law/grad school. You don't need a 3.5. Hell, you may not even need a 3.2.",
