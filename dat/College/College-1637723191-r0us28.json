  "text": "Hey im new here don\u2019t really know if this is even the right subreddit to post this but I\u2019m gonna take a shot at it.\n\nAll my life (21m) i\u2019ve dreaded school, high school in particular. not because of gossip or bullies but because of the stress and (honestly, trauma) from the school work, 5,6 classes and ridiculous deadlines. \n\nin my last two years of high school i had my classes trimmed down to only three classes and it was MUCH more comfortable but things were still pretty terrible due to the sheer amount of work i had to do in the class so it didn\u2019t really change all that drastically as i\u2019d hoped. \n\ni am someone who gets overwhelmed easily and especially if i\u2019m told to do something that i don\u2019t necessarily enjoy doing just for the sake of getting a piece of paper that has my name on it so my parents can go and brag about me to people about how i graduated from x school all the meanwhile, i\u2019m feeling miserable and worthless. \n\ni have a passion for music as i myself am a music artist, been in the industry for about 7 + years, self-releasing. i went to a music college in 2019-2020 it was good, (the school\u2019s staff weren\u2019t the best) and overall i enjoyed it because it was something i\u2019m (obviously) passionate about. it was a private school which was very expensive so i unfortunately cannot sign up to another private school due to financial reasons.\n\nI don\u2019t beat myself up for not having a job, money, or never had a girlfriend. i just focus on myself and try to improve going forward. \n\nSchool has never been something that interests me and i carry that anxiety around with me :( \n\nTLDR: I don\u2019t want to put myself through the emotional/mental stress of a traditional college but can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to pay for a private college. what would you recommend i do going into 2022?",

      "text": "As many people say, college isn\u2019t for everyone, and if you get easily overwhelmed with people telling you to do things just so you get a piece of paper, well, that\u2019s what college is lol But you don\u2019t have to go through all that jazz if you don\u2019t really want to.\n\nSince you said you enjoyed your time studying music, I would totally tell you to go pursue that. Try looking for scholarships, maybe CC and then transferring to a 4 year? \n\nGood luck!",
