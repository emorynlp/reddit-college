  "title:": "Current Research Mentor Refused LOR",
  "text": "Today my research mentor said I shouldn't ask him for a LOR for my college applications because it would be weak. His reasoning was because my research in his lab hasn't had much of an outcome. \n\nI'm less upset about his rejection as I understand it's not something I should expect, but I am more concerned about staying in his lab. I work in his lab paid during this semester, and the day before he told me he would also support me next semester. I am only a UG researcher paid for 6hr/week (barely because i'm dual enrolled through my high school) with no support from any other UGs or a grad student. I also end up working more than this 6 hour mark a week because of his expectations. I also control the research direction in it's entirely, unlike other labs where there are grad students facilitating the direction of a project. After this, I feel very unmotivated to continue in his lab. \n\nIs this a red flag to continue working in his lab? His lab is very small so I am concerned that he is rehiring me for the sake of exploiting me, rather than feeling like I am a capable student.",
