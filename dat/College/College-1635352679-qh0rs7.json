  "title:": "I made a meme and my prof is going to use it on his slides for the next class lol",
  "text": "My music history prof is one of those profs who is very passionate about his subject and a total awkward geek. He peppers his lecture slides with memes and puns and some of them are kind of  funny, but what's more funny is watching the prof come across one and giggle about it.\n\nWe had a test today. So I made a little encouraging meme to send in our class group chat with a pun about the material. No effort, just 10 sec adding words to a picture.  It was dumb and cheesy and not even particularly clever  but it made me happy. I showed it to my prof at the beginning of class and he laughed, said it was great, and asked me to email it to him so he can put it in his slides.\n\nI love these little moments in college. I feel like there's a lot more freedom to do silly things like that because profs tend to be fairly laid back and don't mind suspending the seriousness a bit.",

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/user/PrincipessaEboli/comments/qh2164/handel_meme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSome explanation: My prof calls the tests for this class \"Celebration of Knowledge 1,2, etc\" instead of \"exam 1,2, etc.\" Like I said, quirky personality and  total geek. This one was over the Baroque era and we covered Handel's music in one of the lectures.",

Those of us in my class year have an overall discord server  (small department, several classes together, pretty much all friends) and sometimes share notes, etc. Some of them are always sending around word docs titled things like \u201cco(c)k II\u201d . \n\nRelated story though: one of my other classes has a textbook with two authors, both really long last names, one starting with B and the other starting with S. That prof , a mild older guy, will every so often send out a canvas announcement to remember to bring said textbook to class if we\u2019re covering material from it. So we students will literally get a notification that says \u201cBRING BS TODAY\u201d . Cue all the jokes about how we bring bulls*t to class every day.",
