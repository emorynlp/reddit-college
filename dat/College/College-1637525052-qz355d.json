  "text": "when I first got into college in my preparatory year I was so passionate about studying and stuff and the source of this passion was so I can get good grade to be accepted in medicine college but now that I got into it my flame went off why ? Cuz I got into medicine and I succeeded but what next? What\u2019s the source of my passion now?  I don\u2019t even like medicine I just got into it to get a great job. So I\u2019ve been passionless since I was accepted in medicine college. I\u2019ve been forcing myself to study. Just trying to survive and not fail. Not really learning or understanding anything. Just studying so I can pass the next exam not until I started this new show.. it\u2019s a show about a doctor and how treats his patients ect\u2026.\nAnd now I can feel my passion is all back and my flame has lightened again. Thanks to this show called House MD now I feel excited to study and learn not only to pass exams but to treat patients in the future too.",
