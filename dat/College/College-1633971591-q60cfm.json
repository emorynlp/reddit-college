  "text": "Guys, it\u2019s been 7 long years\u2026.I\u2019ve had so many failed attempts at being a full time student (dropped out of one college, moved cities twice) and for a while I thought of giving up. But after finding my purpose 2 years ago, I\u2019ve now completed the requirements to graduate this semester with a transfer degree so I can go get a bachelor\u2019s from a CSU or UC!\nI just wanted to share my joy with anyone who\u2019s reading. I\u2019m so happy right now. I\u2019ll be a college graduate soon enough.",
