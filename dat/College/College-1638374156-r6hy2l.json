  "text": "The title pretty much says it up. I am a high school senior thinking of graduating a semester early. I was wondering how much it would effect my eligibility for scholarships since I won\u2019t have an official class rank. On some scholarships I know that I meet the requirements without class rank as I have a 4.43 weighted GPA (3.7 unweighted) and my SAT is an 1160.",
