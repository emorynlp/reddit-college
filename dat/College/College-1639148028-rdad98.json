  "text": "So I\u2019m currently going to college for welding, I was mixed up and thought that both semesters were tied into the same year so at the end of the year you  would just have to pay it before the next year to be able to apply for classes again..I was wrong and it in fact goes by semester so now it\u2019s December 10th the start of the break, we come back January 10th and I have to have my balance paid off before I can apply for my classes next semester. Anyone have any ideas how I can make a little under 5,000 before January?",
