  "text": "I have my business calc final in two days. Currently have 343/500 points (roughly a 68% which is a C in the class). Ive had three tests (15% each, each out if 100 points) and received (65%, 20%, and 50%). The final is worth roughly 28% (out if 200 points). Professor said that if my grade on my final is higher then my lowest exam score, that it will replace my lowest exam score. What does this mean? Will the final hurt my grade is I score less that a 20%? PLEASE HELP ME",

The best way to know for certain is to see what the syllabus states. That\u2019s what the Dean will uphold if there is ever an issue or complaint.",

          "text": "Yes.  Whichever test is your lowest score will be treated like it doesn't exist.  So if you score less than 20% the test won't count and your grade will stay the same, if you score higher than 20% then your grade will go up as it will replace the test you scored a 20% on making it look like you never had that test.  In my experience a lot of professors do this with their finals.",
