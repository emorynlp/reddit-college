  "title:": "Does anyone else prefer in person exams to online?",
  "text": "Despite having in person classes this semester most of my professors are still hosting exams online. In one of my classes we were even given the choice based on a class vote ( class voted online). I feel like people mistakenly think online will be easier because you can look stuff up but this really isn\u2019t true from my experience. Either you get a professor who writes crazy hard questions or even worse you get a exam with multiple choice and true false questions that are open to interpretation. These exams seem easy yet it\u2019s almost impossible to score over 90% on them. They don\u2019t assess your knowledge well at all imo and no amount of studying will prepare you to read your professors mind.\n\nIn addition to not assessing knowledge well, online exams are extremely stressful. Many professors use very short time limits in order to prevent cheating. But honestly I\u2019d rather just have unlimited time and no notes. Also, I\u2019m always worried about my computer having a technical problem or my internet going out. \n\nAs someone who strives to make an A on my exams I really dislike online exams. Many students seem to think that online exams are awesome because you can just look everything up but it\u2019s really not true. So if you are ever given the choice I encourage you don\u2019t chose online exams because they are usually poorly written or stressful due to time limits, etc.",
