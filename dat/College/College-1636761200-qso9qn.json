  "text": "honestly this is more ranting then asking for a solution. basically i moved to another country for uni and i had to live with a flatmate who i had no word in choosing. at first she was okay sweet and nice but with time she just gets really irresponsible and she gets bossy and SO loud she doesn't respect that i can hear everything, even if it's super early in the morning or at times where i have online tests and i do tell her. idk what to do and i have a contract with her till june so i cant move out. im definitely not gonna tell her about it cuz i don't want it to be awkward\ud83d\udc80 but im just so tired and its only been a month and a half :(",
