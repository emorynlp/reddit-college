  "text": "I'm going straight to the point, I really wanna know how to initiate a conversation in college with people, when i went to my classes today i couldn't find anyone that i can vibe with but also i want to interact with more people but i dont how to talk to them, like for example i went to these two friends and asked them their name and major and how is college going the guy was reallyyyy nice but the girl literally told me what do you want from us why are you talking to us. like okay damn never trying it again for anyone if we arent in the same class. \nSECOND OF ALL, in my college there is ALOT of exchange students from china and korea and i really wanna talk to them but i dont know how specially that i dont see them talking or befriend us the locals maybe both sides are shy? but if you were in the same situation would you like for a local to come and talk to you and how can i approach them without being creepy or annoying, tell me your pov as a exchange or foreign student if you ever been or just put yourself in their place lol thats it for my ted talk.",
