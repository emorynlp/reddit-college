  "text": "TLDR: My research paper went sideways during data collection and I didn't have time to start over. So I submitted a polished paper about how it sucked. I'm having regrets/doubts/anxiety.\n\nI had to do a research paper after conducting unstructured interviews of a convenience group. Set-up for failure, right? Well, I picked poorly and my convenience group and my questions were not compatible. I got no on topic responses and they basically just got triggered and complained a lot. So, I did what any good researcher would do and wrote the paper exactly how it should be done with my results accurately reflected. The downside was that there was no in depth analysis using all the buzzwords from class, but I did identify some trends to explain the incompatibility and used on topic language there. Overall, I think it's actually quite good and it looks purdy. I am worried though. I've had multiple professors, in previous classes, urge me to just make something up when I wasn't comfortable sharing or lacked content for a writing assignment. I find that dishonest, but it set a tone. This is half my grade and after I submitted, I got that sinking feeling as I read the rubric. Should I have just fudged this? They don't teach us how to present SNAFU data and there's a lot of glossing when it comes to handling research presentations of disproven hypotheses.\n\nUPDATE: Professor just emailed me to thank me for the chuckle and said I have a way with words. I don't know if that will equate to a good grade, but mmmkay.",

      "text": "Lol I am in the same exact boat as you. My psych research didn\u2019t work out because of convenience sampling and a poor independent variable. I did exactly what you did and wrote honestly. I feel like with projects like these it\u2019s not so much about whether it was successful but learning from your research. At least in my case, I find it unreasonable for professors to expect research to go perfectly when we are all young people learning how to carry out research for the first time. The best thing they can ask from us is to learn so that in the future we can do better",

          "text": "What bugs me is that \"failed experiments\" don't get published, despite a lot of data suggesting they account for a majority of research. In fact, papers that fail to reproduce published \\[successful\\] experiments are under-published. So, why aren't they teaching us how to write about our failures? Between being pushed to make stuff up for a grade and this absence of prep, I'm becoming more cynical of \"science\" by the day.",
