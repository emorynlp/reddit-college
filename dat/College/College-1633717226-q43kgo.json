  "text": "So I'm a business marketing student at UTD and during COVID I had to stop school due to a bunch of variables (grandma and best friend died, kidney stones plus snow storm). I'm wanting to get back into school and finish my last year as I'm super close though UTD is not offering online classes anymore and I now live with my band in Colorado. I was curious to what if any school would accept most if not all my credits and allow me to do my last year with them? Most colleges only want so many credits and that they want the last two years to be done there",
