  "text": "Currently a freshman, me and my suitemates have been talking a lot.\n\nMy suitemate, Victor, comes to my room to hang out. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem:\n\nHe puts his music (casual trending music), and I\u2019m fine with that\n\nBut when I put my type of music, which is rap (Playboi Carti, and other rappers too), he thinks it\u2019s plain trash. And he wants me to stop playing it or else he won\u2019t drive me anywhere, (I don\u2019t have a car since I\u2019m in university far from home) and we went into a small argument about music.\n\nLook, I have no problem if I don\u2019t like his music even if he puts it on, but when I put my music, he instantly tells me to stop and attempts to disconnect the speakers and thinks its a bad influence, even though I don\u2019t get bad grades or do drugs. I know that rap is a bad influence but it\u2019s my music type. He HATES rap, but he likes old rap. And no, I don\u2019t blast my music.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n\n\nHow come he tells me to stop, begins to threaten me, and start arguments when I play my \u201cbad\u201d music, even though when he puts music I don\u2019t like, I don\u2019t do anything about it?",
