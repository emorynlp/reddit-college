  "text": "Hi guys, I did something kind of stupid for my literature class because I was kind of lazy. I decided to reuse the same quotes I used in another essay in my new paper, however, I will be conveying totally different ideas in my new essay. I thought I would save time by using the same examples, however, it turned out to be a huge mistake from my end. Now I have to edit my paper to make sure that my professor doesn't find my ideas too similar compared to my previously written essay but I don't think this would be too big of a deal as he never mentioned that we couldn't reuse the same examples or quotes. The deadline to turn in my paper is in like a few hours and I can't just rewrite the entire thing. Am I totally screwed?",
