      "text": "Deep breath right now and whenever you start to feel overwhelmed \n\nDo what you can tonight to make tomorrow easier for yourself. Pack your bag, double check your alarms, know exactly where you need to be and what time you need to be there. Write a note to yourself if you need to. \n\nPick a time tonight to call it quits. At some point you just need to put the notes away and try the best that you can the next day. If you can, try to wind down and relax a little before bed. Just 30 minutes can help. Get as much sleep as you can/as you need to function well. (For me that\u2019s 6-8 hours) \n\nTry to eat something with a bit of protein before your exam and drink some water. Go to the bathroom before you have to be in the exam room. Try to get there a few minutes early so you don\u2019t feel rushed before it even starts. \n\nFor the exam:\n\nRead all the questions/prompts twice at least. If you don\u2019t know the answer at first it\u2019s okay to skip and come back. Make a mark by any questions you skip so you\u2019ll remember to go back. Double check your exam before you turn it in. \n\nDo the best you can and don\u2019t fret if you\u2019re unsure of what the results will be. Your worth is not, never has been, and never will be based on a test score. \n\nGood luck friend! You got this!",
