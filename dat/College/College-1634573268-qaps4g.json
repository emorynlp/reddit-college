  "text": "I don\u2019t know how to describe it but I\u2019m the type of person who really cares about how they look and how others would perceive them. Now what I\u2019ve noticed is that despite wanting to put in the effort, I usually just put on the most boring outfits despite knowing how annoyed it makes me feel. I just can\u2019t bring myself to dress up because I know that most days I\u2019ll just go to class, sit in the library and then just hang around in my dorm all day. The most I\u2019ll do is have lunch with friends but even that can\u2019t motivate me to dress up. I have so much stuff just hanging in my closet that I can\u2019t be bothered to put on. \nNow my question is, if anyone else is in a similar situation, how do you bring yourself to put in the effort?",

      "text": "I love fashion. I love to \u201cdress up\u201d and my style got more and more diverse since the past 3 years. I\u2019m currently at the point where I dress up as a weird college student uniform-style with skirts and classy jacket. I used to wear ugly jogging and t-shirt to go to school because I didn\u2019t want to care about people and I didn\u2019t want them to care about me. Now I love to choose a beautiful style to hang out everyday. But I do it for myself mostly, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m into it. It\u2019s like I\u2019m my own fashion designer, and sometimes I try different combinations that looks odd and sometimes I fall in love with it. But if I felt like I had to do it to put on a \u201cshow\u201d for people, i wouldn\u2019t be so into it. People don\u2019t care about you, wether you have a good style or not. So do what makes you feel good.",
