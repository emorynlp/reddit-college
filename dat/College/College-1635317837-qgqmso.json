  "text": "Basically the title. I went through an episode of depression recently and haven\u2019t been able to do much studying. I\u2019m behind on the last 3 weeks of some classes, not even having notes written down for most. These are mainly maths classes. \n\nHow can I recover from this? It feels like its just gonna get worse and worse from here.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not impossible to recover from this. You\u2019re just going to have to dedicate more time to taking notes and doing practice problems to understand the material. \n\nPrioritize which class to study for first based on any major assignments or exams, and review the lessons until you get a grasp of the material. At this point the goal should just be to get a general understanding. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve caught up, then go back to the lessons you struggles with most and review.",
