  "title:": "Asking professor how to pronounce their last name",
  "text": "Would it be weird for me to ask one of my professors how to pronounce her last name? On the first day of class I missed the first 15 minutes or so of her lecture where she introduced herself because I got lost on campus (I just transferred to a new university that is huge). As a result, I have no idea how to pronounce her last name (she's not from the US and I've never seen this name before). The reason why this is important to me is because I like to address my professors as \"Dr. Last Name\" when I greet them, such as at their office hours. However, I don't know if this would be rude in some way or if she would be confused as to why I don't know how to say it. No one in the class ever says her name and I can't think of a plan to somehow make her say it without me asking. Should I just ask her?\n\nI know this is a weird question and I'm majorly over thinking this, but professors make me really anxious.",

      "text": "Nice to encounter such a thoughtful and professionally minded person. Email her, address her as Dr. ___ and double-check the spelling of her name. Explain that you would like to be professionally courteous and pronounce her name correctly. Ask if there is a phonetic hint that might help. The next time you see her, introduce yourself and address her with her desired pronunciation. If you are a little unsure just say \u201cDid I get that right?\u201d Eye contact and a smile goes a long way. Let her answer and then transition into a short question about that day\u2019 class, reading, whatever. Thank her and take your leave knowing you have left an excellent impression.",

If I don't remember somebody's name or how it's pronounced, I always ask right up front. There's no shame in being a human that possesses no capability of remembering names on the first go. Nobody ever does anyways. \n\nThey know that their last name is difficult to pronounce.",
