  "text": "I am currently a undergraduate sophomore student in college. I wanted to get in to art university and so I am planning to take off a year break from current institute to work on my art portfolio. I was wondering if it is possible to apply art college right away after having break from current college. Is there any process I have to take or any extra application I have to fill out? Or do I have to inform current institution that I am transferring before application to art school?",
