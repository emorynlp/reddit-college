  "title:": "Paying Attention",
  "text": "Despite me being an A- student I\u2019ve always struggled with paying attention during class and doing homework. My mother always said I took hours longer on homework than my sibling. I feel like I\u2019ve tried everything and I really don\u2019t know what else to do. I tried setting timers, changing my atmosphere, listening to music, locking my phone, clearing my desk, but nothing works. The worst part is when I\u2019m distracting myself my brain is telling me I need to do the assignments, yet I just ignore it. What do I do? I feel like it\u2019s destroying me.",

She remembered and paid attention way better in class than taking a bunch of notes she wasn't going to look at much later anyway, and if she didn't have something to do she'd be terribly distracted. Maybe find some sort of handicraft hobby to keep you occupied while you listen?",
