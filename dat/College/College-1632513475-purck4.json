  "text": "Hi everyone! I recently finished my degree and I wanted to share some tips for doing well on multiple choice tests that I've learned over the years. \n\nA lot of students think you should choose C if you don't know the answer to the question. No matter what answer you choose, you'll have a 1 in 4 (or 1 in 5) chance of getting the answer right. There's no truth or reason to choose C instead of any of the other answers. A lot of times when people make tests they randomized the answers anyways.\n\nRead the questions and answers carefully. A lot of times we know the answer to the question, but we're reading too fast and misread or misunderstand the question and get it wrong. We might even get the answer right but mark the wrong circle on the test sheet. \n\nBefore starting the test, make a plan for how long you'll spend on each question so you're not rushing at the end. You can also try to do something to relax yourself before the test (like taking a few deep breathes or reminding yourself you've studied a lot and you'll try your best).\n\nIf you know you have test anxiety, it might be better to avoid having any caffeine right before the test. Caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety and too much anxiety can impair our performance on the test. Try to see if there's an alternative that works for you (like drinking water, a smoothie, or something else). \n\nI also created a video about how to ace multiple choice exams if you're looking for more tips: [https://youtu.be/OpjXvXw48G0](https://youtu.be/OpjXvXw48G0)\n\nGood luck!

      "text": "How many multiple choice exams did you take? I think I remember only taking one in an intro gen ed class once, but they definitely weren't the norm. Might depend on major. Or maybe school, too, because I don't know how those schools with 600 person classes get their grading done so multiple choice would make sense.",
