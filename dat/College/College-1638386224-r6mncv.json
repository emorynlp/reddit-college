  "title:": "Should I \u201csell my pain\u201d on my college applications?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve had a really tough life mixed with a very underwhelming high school experience so far (I have good grades but no clubs, no extracurriculars, no achievements, etc.) and I worry that colleges will simply not want me based on my good grades and terrible high school career. I obviously wouldn\u2019t opt to do this if I had something that made me stand out in life but, unfortunately, I seem to be a kid with a shitty situation who somehow made it out alright.\n\nI\u2019d hate to get into college knowing I was only accepted because of pity but I was told to use my life to my advantage by friends. I\u2019m just not sure if this would be a good idea.",

      "text": "I've got 20 years in academia, but not as an admissions officer, so I'll just tell you my general advice, and you can take it with a grain of salt if you want.  \nMy advice is that you should feel free to relate some of your personal struggles, ***but*** that you should present this type of material in a factual, straightforward manner, ***not*** as a giant woe-is-me sob story. It might be very true that you have difficult circumstances in your life, but you have to remember that colleges receive many thousands of applications each and every year, so statistically speaking, an application from someone who's had a challenging life isn't particularly unique or rare. More importantly, difficult situations presented merely as sob stories often come across as an attempt at emotional manipulation, like you're trying to emotionally blackmail the admissions officer into admitting you by relating how hard you have it. That might work occasionally, but often it leaves a bitter taste in the person's mouth, because people don't like to feel like they're being manipulated or scammed.  \nSo, if you want to relate some of your personal story, that\u2019s fine, but definitely focus more on how you've overcome or attempted to overcome those drawbacks and how they\u2019ve made you into the person you are today instead of simply writing an essay about how bad things are.  \nGood luck!",

      "text": "You can definitely talk about your struggles if those were a significant part of your life, but don\u2019t go into the \u201cfeel sorry for me\u201d area when writing. The point of college admissions essays is to demonstrate who you are beyond your grades and test scores. Did you learn something from your struggles? Did they make you a better person? Have your experiences inspired you to help others who are in the same position you were in? As long as you present yourself as being more than your struggles, then go for it.",
