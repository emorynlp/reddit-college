  "title:": "How come I get screwed over by a curve?",
  "text": "So after all the components in one of my courses were graded and entered, my final grade sat at 93.21. However, the final grade I'm receiving is an A- (typical grading scale is 90-92.9 is A- and 93+ is A). I understand the concept of a curve where based on a normal distribution, there are limited As, a middle/larger quantity of Bs, and so on in the distribution.\n\nWhat I don't get is how this is fair? It's a math-based class and the professor taught us with the goal of us understanding the concepts. I learned the concepts, performed up to a standard but now you're saying \"Well too many understood the concepts well based on how well I taught it so despite you falling into an A range, you're going to have to accept a lower outcome so we can fit a distribution?\" I might as well have sabotaged my professor's presentations in class each morning so that the entire class couldn't learn and then taught myself all the material at home so I'd be the only student who learned anything in the class. Or better yet, I should have shared a set of fake notes with others before the exams so they'd all get fucked. Also what if everyone in the class had got in the 93+ range because the professor taught so well, should some kids get Cs because they had the \"low 93\"?\n\nAnd I get there's gonna be some \"oh cmon its an A- to an A chill out\" but I legitimately put in so much time and effort for my classes and then it's like get fucked.",

So for example if I get a 91 I can\u2019t get curved to a B, but if I get an 88 I could get curved to an A. I\u2019d email your professor and ask about that because your school probably has something similar in place",

If grades are too high then that is either because I designed a class that was too easy, OR it was because i was a kick-ass professor who taught the class amazingly well!\n\nI say all of this because it sounds like your prof is too weak to admit his class was too easy and would rather punish students than take ownership of his own failings.\n\nI always tell my students that I try to have high standards for grading but I would LOVE to show the Dean a class of ALL As if they deserve it - I would gloat about hownamazing my students were and risk having a class with a high GPA average.\n\nDefinitely take this up with your chair.

But if the answer was a 90 and the range was from like 85-100 then it\u2019s a bad thing because a person who would have has a B+ without the curve has now failed. I think it\u2019s only good in the case of low class averages, because then scores only go up and not down. \n\nAlso doesn\u2019t really work if the averages are low. In one of my math classes the highest score was a 61, which means even with a few extra points and no curve the whole class would still have failed. I honestly think that professors should be doing their best to avoid a need for a curve. If everyone in the class fails the exam, it means the professor failed to teach the material or the exam didn\u2019t properly reflect what they learned in class. It also leads to needless anxiety. You know that math exam I mentioned? I was freaking out after I took the test because I couldn\u2019t answer almost half of the questions and was considering changing my major.

If I get a bad grade or get affected by a negative curve I should fight to get rid of the curve not have my mind go to sabotage.  Instead of the economy is so bad let me do tax evasion instead let me find some way to improve the local economy and my economy by starting a business or working at a company to improve it. I\u2019m saying just the thoughts of negative is the brat attitude. It\u2019s I got hit so let me hit back or I got screwed so let me screw. No you should turn the other cheek and make sure the next person doesn\u2019t get screwed. Maybe in this case the right path is fighting the curve maybe getting fellow classmates to basically unionize to fight it.",

      "text": "The assumption that curving a grade is based on is that the grade you earn on assignments isn't perfectly indicative of your mastery of the subject. Professors are not perfect at creating assignments that separate the wheat from the chaff. Normally, what happens is that professors make assignments and tests more difficult than they expect their students to master and the people who do better on those assignments end up with A's and so on and so forth. Your professor made the mistake of making the assignments too easy, but a normal curve can correct for that as well. It sucks for you, but it's mathematically fair (assuming they did the math right, which is not a given) and a reasonable pedagogical choice.",

What if in OPs case their class happened to have a group of smarter individuals who mastered the topics and showed it on their assignments. If it\u2019s a math based class there\u2019s a good chance that for all the individuals who got a true A (93 or higher in their assignments), they understood the concepts sufficiently well that warranted their true assignment grade. Why should too many kids in one group who understood the concepts result in the lowest of that group being dropped to fit an arbitrary curve? Oh too many people are passing their drivers license test, let\u2019s pick the ones that passed with the lowest score and then not give them their license because we need to beef up the non passes since the passes are getting crowded",

The distribution of grades can be normalized.) If there was a large group of smarter individuals, then they deserved the A's, not OP. It would also make the assumptions needed to normalize the curve null and void.\n\nThe driver's license test is also a pass/fail test, so normalizing the curve wouldn't make sense. If there are too many passes, it would make sense to change the test for newer drivers.\n\nAlso it's a fucking A-. That's a damn good grade.",
