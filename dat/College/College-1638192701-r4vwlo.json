  "text": "Hi everybody! It\u2019s that time of year for stress, work overload, and burnout. While it always sucks, I\u2019m here to remind you all that the end of this semester is almost near!!! Think about it, once you submit  that last  project or take that last exam, you get a nice break from it. Power through, and remember to always take care of yourself even if that means asking for help or seeing a counselor. You\u2019ve got this!",
