  "title:": "I miss quarantine: confession from a lonely college senior",
  "text": "I had my junior year completely online, and while I did have hardships during that school year, I could always rely on my two closest buddies. For reference, I\u2019m really introverted and socially awkward and I was in an abusive relationship, so missed out on the opportunity to mingle freshman year. \n\nFast forward to senior year: we\u2019re back in person. It just hit me how alone I am in my studio apartment off campus. It\u2019s my last year, and I can\u2019t help but feel sad and nostalgic about my early years of how easy it was to meet people in the dorms and classes. It\u2019s been so rough because I feel left behind for better people now that we\u2019re in person. During quarantine, I always counted on my bestie and my boyfriend. Now, we\u2019re on the verge of breaking up and I no longer have that close bond with my best girl friend anymore. It\u2019s so hard starting anew in senior year because everyone in my year already has their solid group. So, in a way, I miss how quarantine strengthened the bond with the people I did have.",
