  "title:": "How the fuck do I make friends as a community college student during COVID?",
  "text": "So I started my first semester of community college in fall of 2020 (great timing, I know) and only now do I have even one class in person. I live with my parents off-campus, I don't know anyone who goes there, and most classes are still virtual. I'd really like to have more of a social life (or any of one really) but I have no idea where to start. All student clubs and organizations are still shut down due to COVID. I could deal with the isolation a lot better when everything was 100% online but now that a few things are in person it's really starting to get to me. I didn't really have any friends in high school so I was hoping that would change once I started college, but obviously that didn't quite go as planned. How do I start making friends, and how have all of you been dealing with this?",

      "text": "I graduated with my Associate's a little over a year ago and I'll say this. Making friends at CC is hard! A lot of people that attend, at least from my experience, were just working professionals who wanted to switch careers. They have lives already, and can't spend time making any new friends. It's tough, but not impossible. Try seeing if you can study with any of your classmates outside of lecture, go ahead and ask around! Honestly, you might get a few nos, maybe a yes, but it's worth a shot!",
