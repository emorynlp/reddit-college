  "text": "I'm currently a freshman in undergrad. At the moment I'm going for a zoology degree, specifically for conservation or the like, but I can't stand any of my classes. Let me say, my whole life I've loved science. Its all I've ever thought I would do and its all I ever plan on doing. Now that I'm in colege, I thought I would finally be able to focus on what I enjoy and really get to know about science, though it seems I was wrong. I'm enjoying every class I have except my science courses. I'm taking biology and chemistry, (I also took AP Bio in hs and loved it btw) and I hate them. It doesn't feel like I'm learning about a subject I enjoy, it feels like I'm sitting in a room for two hours while someone reads off a script and I'm intended to remember everything they say 6 months from now, if not for my whole career. Is this just the college experience? Am I just bad at the classes? They don't explain or teach anything, its just \"This is this, remember\". I learn more from YouTube than I have from either of my 2 hour long lectures 3 times a week. Should I look into other majors, or just try to stick it out? I seriously feel like I'm stuck.",

      "text": "College is nothing like the real world.  If the degree is needed for the job you want, just stick it out and focus on the end goal.  If you aren't sure about the job you want, volunteer or get internships and make sure it is something you will want to do 40 hours/week for the next 20 plus years.  If you're certain this is the career path you want, just knuckle through it.  A job in conservation will be nothing like your college experience.",
