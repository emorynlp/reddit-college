  "title:": "Things to do during a Gap Year?",
  "text": "I am currently in a gap year, and I don't quite have enough stuff to do. Before I get started, I know the common advice is to only do a gap year if you plan it out well. But I was in a bit of a different situation. Without going into to detail, my college situation was not good, so I decided to go at it again. I have just committed to a top choice college in mechanical engineering and am very happy with the situation, so that's good.\n\nHowever, I am left with not much to do. So far I've just been bullshitting around for 4-5 hours a day. I don't want to get a job as a) I'm not that hard pressed for finances and b) I want to do something that will be more educational. I live near a good research university, so I have emailed \\~10 engineering professors there to see if I could help assist with their research, and all have either not responded or were unable to give me a position. I want to do something STEM related that is educational/career building/resume worthy, but I don't know where to look. Advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "Honestly, I\u2019d suggest get a job even if you don\u2019t need the money. Having a part time job will help you add structure to your day and it will help you avoid just messing around all day doing nothing. \n\nAnd then on top of that you can do some self study on things you find interesting, read a lot of books, start a YouTube channel or small blog to share your thoughts on what you\u2019re learning. \n\nFind somewhere to volunteer- soup kitchen, food pantry, pregnancy crisis center, homeless shelter, after school programs - anywhere in your community where you might be able to help someone. You could tutor kids or high schoolers in math and science. \n\nSpend quality time with your friends and family. Be intentional about doing things together.",

      "text": "A gap year is a great opportunity to slow down and figure out your needs, strengths and weaknesses. It is a good time to start practicing skills that will be useful in college. It helps to start reading and taking notes like you would in college. Unlike students who enter college right away, you get more time to prepare for your first semester. Here are some free courses that you can take to practice your skills:\n\nTaking Your First Steps Into Higher Education:\nhttps://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/taking-your-first-steps-higher-education/content-section-overview?active-tab=description-tab\n \nSucceed with Learning:\nhttps://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/succeed-learning/content-section-overview\n \nReading + Note-taking:\nhttps://www.open.edu/openlearn/society-politics-law/sociology/reading-and-note-taking-preparation-study/content-section-0\n \nEnglish Skills for Learning: https://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/english-skills-learning/content-section-overview\n\nI would suggest reading journal articles now. The Journal of Emerging Investigators offers free access to journal articles. The articles are by middle and high school students, but you can start training your skills in reading articles. \n\nI have a study with me playlist on my YouTube channel that focuses on helping students study better in college. This playlist includes:\n\n\\- 5 effective study habits (I introduce my overall studying style)\n\n\\- How to read a textbook\n\n\\- How to read a journal article\n\n\\- How to take notes (lectures, readings, project and exams)\n\n\\- How to prepare for and take exams (I talk about ways you can tackle different types of exams)\n\n\\- 5 books that can help you build your vocabulary, improve your reading, writing, presentation skills and life skills for college\n\n\\- School supplies that I found to be useful during college\n\n\\- College freshman advice \n\nMy playlist link is: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS\\_VQo0\\_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS_VQo0_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum)\n\nI also have a College Freshman Starter Kit. This is useful for getting you familiar with how to transition from high school to college.\n\nLink to the kit:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeO1X4u0ZWQCkDk3zALoDUPV\\_W7K9wV5HvoFWK\\_Es2E/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeO1X4u0ZWQCkDk3zALoDUPV_W7K9wV5HvoFWK_Es2E/edit)",
