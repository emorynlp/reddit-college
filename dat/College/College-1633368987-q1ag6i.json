  "text": "Got up this morning feeling a bit naff but didn't think much of it. It's gotten worse as the day has gone on and boy do I feel sucky. I feel nauseous, pukey, bloated, and gross and it's my first day back to uni tomorrow! ahhhhhh! It's a split day (three hours in the morning, one hour break, and then another three hours) where I have to stand and draw a model. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this tomorrow, wish me luck.\n\nedit: ha ha yeaaa, decided to stay home ",
