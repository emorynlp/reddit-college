  "text": "I'm an international student studying abroad for college. Due to COVID and other issues, I can't go home for Christmas. Seeing all my friends go home for Thanksgiving, and knowing that all my friends will be seeing their family for Christmas, has just made me feel super lonely and homesick these past few days. \n\nI've also asked around, and no one I know will be in town for Christmas, so this'll be the first Christmas I spend alone, which isn't the happiest thought. \n\nAre there any tips to overcoming this feeling? It's funny because my family doesn't even celebrate Christmas that much -- it's more that knowing all my friends are around their loved ones on a special day makes me feel a bit lonely/left out(? in a weird way)/homesick.",

      "text": "It\u2019s a hard time of year to feel alone. \n\nThe first time it happened to me(I was 16 and on student exchange in rural Thailand), I spent the whole day on irc, chatting with friends back home. \n\nIt\u2019s happened several times in the 25 years or so since then. \n\nMostly, I spend the day focused on myself. I get whatever I want to eat. I settle down with something I love to watch and just chill. \n\nObviously, it\u2019s 2021 and stuff like Zoom exists\u2026 so if you\u2019re wanting to hang out with friends, why not all watch a movie together on Netflix? It sounds corny, but it legit feels great.",
