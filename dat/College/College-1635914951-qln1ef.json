  "text": "Does anyone have any advice/tips on how you force yourself out of your comfort zone and actually go do shit? I'm stuck being afraid and probably quite irrational. I'm not really a very social person and have really been struggling with the 'finding new people' in college.\n\nI found my university has a language-buddy thing where you can get paired up with someone on your same sorta level and practice. I've been trying to pick up French, but I'm no good at speaking. I'd like to get better.... but I've been staring at this unwritten message and can't bring myself to ask to join.\n\nIt sounds really cool and like a great way to actually practice the language and meet new people but I am also terrified of 'new people'. What if me and my partner don't get along? What do I even say? I have all the social skills of a fried potato and barely maintain conversations in English... I don't know if I can do this - but I also think I'm being stupid and should just do it. I'm such a mess. Does this shit get easier?",
