  "text": "so my school  has about 8000 students, and a high percentage of science majors at that. So im taking Orgo this semester and i was mad about there being only 1 professor, and only 1 time to pick from. and it was really hard readjusting my schedule, since i have a kid and other stuff to do besides school. anyways i see that orgo 2 for next semester has the same thing, only 1 time and 1 professor. Is it like this at other schools? or is my school just small? its so frustrating bcuz the time is super inconvenient, and my other classes for the most part have some kind of flexibility!!\n\nTLDR; only 1 time scheduled for this class is ridiculous",

And not to shut you down, but once you get into your major, it'll get even worse. At least as an engineering student, most of my classes had 1 section of 80-100 students, so I just had to take whatever GEs were available around it.",

As you get into higher level classes there are fewer students and thus less demand.
