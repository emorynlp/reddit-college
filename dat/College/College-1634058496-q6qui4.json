  "text": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m a Portuguese high school senior looking to major in the US. I\u2019m going to fund a big chunk of my education via scholarships, loans and work-study. \n\nProblem is: Universities require proof that I have sufficient funds to pay for my first year, which I don\u2019t. The only thing that I can show as proof is the loan. I can only apply to most of the scholarships after I\u2019m an undergraduate and I can\u2019t really prove the work-study part.\n\nIs there any way to go around this? Thank you!",

      "text": "You have to already have the scholarship to apply to the university, otherwise how would you pay for it? You can show a loan and they will accept that, but if you plan on relying scholarships find one right now that will get you started. You can\u2019t do enough work on an F1 visa to pay your tuition, so you have to have the money or the scholarships before you start applying for schools.",
