  "title:": "I wish I would have switched majors. It's too late now.",
  "text": "I'm a geology major. I'm miserable. I knew I didn't like this major my freshman year. I'm a second semester junior right now. I remember mentioning to my parents my freshman year (they're the ones paying for my college ), that I didn't feel like I was in the right major, and they said don't worry stick with it, it will get more interesting, and encouraged me not to change my major. I listened to them, because I thought hey they both have bachelor's/masters degrees so they must be right, right ? Well, no. It's still on me that I didn't switch my major( my parents would have still let me switch, I know that), but this is a lesson in life: listen to your gut when it comes to college majors, not what someone else tells you. \n\nI'm a second semester junior and I literally hate my life right now. My major is geology, and I honestly don't give a shit about rocks, or freaking sedimentary structures, or how some landform formed. I come close to falling asleep every geology class, and I'm not interested in anything geology related, nor am I interested in any of the careers. I'm constantly disappointed at myself for not changing majors. I could have switched majors as an underclassman: the core curriculum for geology is the same as engineering at my school. I'm interested in mechanical or material science engineering. I didn't even consider engineering in high school, because I literally had zero confidence in myself and I told myself that I would never make it through the upper level engineering classes and that I was too dumb (even though I was in the top 5% of my class in HS). Come to think of it, I've always been interested in machines. Even as a young girl I remember looking up how cars, boats, rollercoasters worked, etc. I don't even know how I'm going to make it through the next 2 semesters. I have been making B's in my geology classes, but if I actually put in more effort I would be an A student. My motivation has been steadily declining though as I've lost hope at finding something interested in my major. 2 semesters ago, I made A's in both geology classes, last semester, I made mid B's, this semester I'll either scrape by with a B or get a high C. Still got 2 semesters left. I was a much better student as an underclassman because I was more motivated. I always told myself \"got to power through these boring intro classes and then ill get to my junior year where I'll find something interesting .\" That looks like it's not going to happen, and now I'm lost. \n\nI took a flight lesson at the beginning of this year, and I really liked it and I'm considering becoming an airline pilot. Of course, my parents were all weird about it and all but said it's not a job for a woman (they still believe in traditional gender roles), but you know, screw that. I'm not listening to them and I'm going to do whatever the hell I want to do with my life. \n\n\nMoral of the story: if you're an underclassman and you don't like your major at all, consider changing it if you are able. I understand that you're not going to be interested in every class that you take. In fact, there's going to be a lot of classes you don't like, even if you're in a major you're interested in. A key sign that you're in the wrong major though is if you're a geology major and you don't like rocks, or if you're an English major and you don't like to write.",

You could mention career prospects, which I would assume would be better for engineering than for geology (?). It's not too late to change but it will take more money and you'll likely graduate later than currently expected, but if this isn't for you I think you should seriously talk to your parents about it. About the pilot thing, you can pursue that after your degree, but if possible you should go for the engineering/materials science degree now since it's the best opportunity with your parents paying tuition. Good luck in whatever you choose to do :)",

In my case, advice to past self would be \"See a better therapist and take a gap year, don't go to college unless you have a profession in mind\". Haven't seen it posted, but have you discussed with your advisor, or a councilor in your department if that's a thing?\n\nSwitching your major might take longer than finishing it then going to grad school or making a move into a different career. Most people I've spoken to don't stay in the field they studied, academics or career wise.\n\nYou have a bachelors in a natural science, and one that deals with, as you pointed out, the same core requirements as an engineering degree. You could probably get into a grad program related to materials science, or find a job and pay for aviation school. Time will drag on anyways.\n\nI got a trade degree and realized the job was awful. Went back to college. I faced:\n\n2 years of communications, minor in environmental studies, which was only possible as my trade degree was in the school of forestry. Would give me a B.S. with a minor I loved.\n\nor\n\n4.5 years of business school coursework; no minor. Degree would be \"of arts\" and in basic administration or management.\n\nboth of which have very similar, near identical, career outcomes. So, here I am, and now I have a degree that, since it is in the social sciences, opens up grad schools from environ studies/humanities, harder environ to social work and pyschology. I plan on going to work haha but it's nice to have the option.",

I really wish I would have realized sooner that graphic design maybe doesn't fit with my personal lifestyle. I'm terrible at firm deadlines and communicating with clients about their creative visions. Looking back, I think I could have made a good French major and then used my degree for something more interesting like being an interpreter/translator.\n\nI know someone who changed their major every year and finally, on the 5th major (anthropology), felt like they were on the right track and graduated. Of course, it was years after the people she started college with, but it was what made her feel confident and comfortable.",

If you had any critical thinking skills, of course, you'd realize that gold, along with everything in the lab, was mined somewhere, requiring a geologist.  But I'm not surprised a computer \"science\" major struggles to read even laughable pop science articles.  Guess you fell for the lern2code meme, enjoy being a cubicle monkey in a soon oversaturated field for the rest of your life.",
