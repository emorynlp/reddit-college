  "text": "So, i officially have 5 months left of highschool before i have to choose my college. Our school has this thing called an academy where in 8th grade we chose what career path we want our courses to center on. I chose the Coding academy so all of my highschool experience has been centered around coding. therefore, this fall i applied to mostly tech schools and i thought i knew what i wanted in my life, plus i would have the bonus of a high salary. \n\nThe issue is now i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what i want to do.\n\nI recently attended the University of Southern Mississippi\u2019s tour and major fair and I learned about things like Polymer Engineering and Neuromorphic Engineering along side their beautiful CS program. \n\nMy question is, out of my colleges which one would be the most reasonable choice for an undecided major? I\u2019ll go to mit regardless if i get accepted there.\n\nSouthern Miss- one of best polymer science and computer science schools in mississippi for half of MSU cost \n\nMiss State- Arguably better engineering school but double price and no polymer science\n\nNuemont- Purely CS and graduate in 3 years (im already an early grad)\n\nThank you for any input!!!",
