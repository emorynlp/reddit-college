  "text": "My wife is looking into possible associate degrees in the healthcare field. She isn\u2019t sure she wants to to be a nurse and is really considering other fields as more of her speed. Is it possibly for her to get these degrees part time? She was told a lot of them require two years full time. I have a hard time thinking anyone in NY state quit life and working for two years to solely focus on that. Is having a job while studying full time for an AD feasible? Is anyone one of these in NY? If so, how did you do it? Thank you:)",
