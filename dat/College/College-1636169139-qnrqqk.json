  "text": "I'm using footnotes to cite my sources as I go along in my essay but I'm not sure if I need to cite the whole source (like you do in the bibliography). For website sources, should I still include the link and date accessed? I'll be putting that in the bibliography regardless.\n\nThe reason why I'm asking is because the footnotes count against my word count.\n\nThanks!",
