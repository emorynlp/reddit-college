  "text": "I apologize as this is going to be quite long but I actually think this woman has gone crazy; We had lecture on Wednesday and it seemed to be a normal class, the only thing different was she said she had to cover for a colleague so she couldn\u2019t have office hours that day. Fine by me. After the class she sent out a class wide email explaining that the whole class she had never seen us being so disrespectful and we made her day worse because of some \u201cTragic/traumatizing news\u201d she received regarding a colleague. She had also individually emailed me asking me about a question I had in class that day. I tell her i\u2019ve understood it now and thanked her for helping. She then emails me back saying that she had already explained why the exponent was negative 20-30 times and me asking that question had completely thrown off the flow of the lecture and told me I need to pay attention more and that it \u201ccan\u2019t/won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Yesterday, We had lab without the professor and apparently she had done this to several other students as well. She has also sent several other class wide emails that just said \u201cthere will be a pop quiz on Friday with no equation sheet. be prepared.\u201d Am I wrong for thinking that this woman has lost it? What happened to no stupid questions? Is this an okay thing to say/do?",

      "text": "I would firstly notify the school officials formally via email. Dont engage with her directly in the meanwhile. Save your questions for after class so it's not disruptive to class time which is short. While its rude the way she responded I cant say I dont blame her. My math class has 2 very loud disruptive students that regularly ask questions which were clearly defined previously. Dont be THAT person. Notify the school asap of your uncomfortable position to begin setting up a clear record in case there is questionable problems later.\nFor the record - this is not even close to some of the poor behavior I've witnessed. When the professor tells the class everyone who is conservative wants to kill every person of color - that's outrageous. Telling students that their behavior is unacceptable is well just honest. \nGood luck. Remember, not everyone will like you. But it's not a permanent problem.",

There was a sudden change in her personality and it was confusing.\n\nShe would also get pissed off a lot at the weather because where we lived in the Summer it could easily reach 100 degrees. I remember times when it seemed like my mother was suffocating from the heat at a higher rate than me or my Dad.\n\nNow the heat isnt something the OP mentioned, but I thought about how irritating that must be to feel, and thought, if your body is willing to do that to you, then being a woman must be a very irritating experience.\n\nI dunno nothing about PMS, but I know a lot about irritation, and how it can lead to erratic behavior.\n\nMy mum mentioned from time to time that she was going through \"the change\" when she was in good spirit. I think she felt a little bad about how rude she was during that time and wanted to make it clear that it wasn't really her at the time. It was really sudden and it disappeared as quickly as it had started. But I dunno, really it could've been anything.",

Are subs a thing in your university? We didn't have them in mine. Ither professors familiar with the subjects might cover a class. Or if the class had GTF's they might cover but never just a random sub that you can just call to cover. So if there are no GTFs and no other professors with knowledge in the subject in question OPs professor may be in a really difficult position.\n\nNo acting the way she is isn't professional. But I think it's significantly more complicated than just cancelling classes or \"calling a sub\". This isn't grade school where just anyone can cover for the day.\n\nTo OP I would suggest keeping all emails. Give it acouple days then if things don't improve report it. Encourage classmates to keep all emails as well and make a report together to show how serious the problem is.",
