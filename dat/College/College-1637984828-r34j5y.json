  "title:": "My teacher is mad at me for not submitting the work 3 weeks before deadline",
  "text": "I opted in for some research work. There are 4 people in the project. We were having weekly meetings every Thursday for updates. I did some work however was corrected that i need to work on formatting and editing. Last week the meeting got canceled last minute. This thursday it was thanksgiving so i assumed there is no meeting. Also i had not updated my project as i was still finalizing it. Turns out there was a meeting yesterday. Only 1 person attended the meeting and had done their part. I got kicked out of the project immediately. The participants are connected on WhatsApp but unfortunately this time there was no update on whatsapp either. Today i sent the professor an email with the work done apologizing and asking to be added to project again. But instead i was told \u201cI don\u2019t value time and basically wasting everyone\u2019s time. if I don\u2019t know how to use a calendar i still have a lot of learning to do. The email also said if i want i continue doing other lesser projects if i want to or even leave and it would be ok. \n\nShould i still complete the other pending projects ? Should i send another email apologizing.",
