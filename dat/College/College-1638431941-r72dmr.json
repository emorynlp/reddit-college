  "text": "Okay, I'm in a odd situation. So I'm on my second year at my university. I AM GETTING FAFSA. BUT... I'm still short. With financial aid this term I was easily covered, and the next two terms I'm mostly covered too, but still fall short for some tuition and living expenses.\nI don't have enough free time outside of school to work a regular job to cover it either. And I cannot be a part time student. I'm an out of state student, but, with the program I'm in at my university, I get in state tuition as long as I stay full time. And with out of state tuition, one class would cost me just as much as the several I need now for full time.\nMy first year I was able to take out a private student loan to cover what I was short, but I needed a cosigner because of my lack of income (I have good credit, just no steady income). My father was able to cosign with me last year. But, this year, my dad has had some medical issues, lost his job and can't cosign with me. And I have no other family that could either.\nI have no clue what to do. Am I just screwed, or is there an option I don't know about?\n\nI have also looked at other options to help with money for school and living, such as scholarships but have yet to find any I'm eligible for. I'm a doing fine with school, but I'm not a straight A student and don't have anything really special about me that makes me stand out for or be eligible for special funding.\n\nAlso, one of the reasons I'm short on money for school, even with FAFSA, is medical conditions I have. I often have to travel a distance for my doctor appointments and medications which add up notably.\n\nSorry for the long description. In all, I'm short on school and living expenses even with FAFSA, and don't have anyone that can cosign with me for a private student loan. Anything I might have missed that could help me out? Thank you!",
