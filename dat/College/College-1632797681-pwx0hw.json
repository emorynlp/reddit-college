I also BS every assignment and lie about my opinions or whatever so I could get a grade. \n\nOur professor let us have 4 attempts on a quiz. I wanted to learn but I had no time so I just skimmed through parts of the text and found answers in the textbook without reading the chapter.",

Rather, that person has very little interest or enthusiasm for the the subject matter.  They only care enough to get the grade, not to learn.   \n\nYou are also lying on your papers by telling the professors whatever you think they want to hear.  That will only prepare for you for a career as a sycophantic yes man, which I hope is not your goal.  You instead need to be able to give honest responses, and to know enough to discuss challenges to your opinion in an reasoned manner.",

Go home and study, take a break for dinner, around 11pm-midnight start watching tv and wake up at 11am for class. Im not only keeping up with class but im ahead.
