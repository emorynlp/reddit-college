  "text": "So when I signed up for classes in the fall, I had extra hours I could fill but I was told that there was no requirements for me that fall. I am a freshman btw with college credits earned while in high school. I am trying to go to pharmacy school, however I need to take intro to physics that is only offered in the fall. And I am struggling to find a college that offers that course in the spring within 2 hrs near me that I can take in the spring or summer. The problem is I was not told about this physics course that if I don't find a college for this one class, I will have to take a year off of school. What do I do?",
