  "text": "I\u2019m a chronic procrastinator, I\u2019ve tried everything but I do my best quality work at the \u2018last moment\u2019. There was at least 3 times this semester where I was trying to grind out a lab report or essay the night before, and then I get an email from the prof saying that they moved the deadline back a few days because people were requesting it. I usually don\u2019t ask for stuff like that because I feel that if I dug my own grave I might as well deal with it, but those students that do ask really pull through for me.",

      "text": "I just think of it as a skill to be learned much like othee things. If you've developed a relationship with your prof over the semester, have legitimately been trying, and put in good effort when you are extended extra time - why not ask for it?\n\nI also try to go above and beyond if I'm pushing the envelope. One assignment I turned in a week or two late but did 2-3 pages of writing and analysis beyond what was expected. If your professor actually cares about learning and not just the letter of the law they will take that into account",
