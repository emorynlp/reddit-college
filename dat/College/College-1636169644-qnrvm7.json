  "text": "Hi. First time college student.\n\nI'm doing very well in all of my classes, no worries stuff academically. I'm mainly concerned about my social skills.\n\nI was the shy, quiet kid who didn't have any friends in high school. Still am. My mom said I'd make a lot of friends in college due to the fact high school was a \"fish bowl\" and that gave me a bit of hope.\n\nNow I'm at the end of my first semester and I'm hating it. No one bothers to talk to me or even acknowledge my existence, especially when I eat in the dining area. So, obviously, I haven't made much friends.\n\nI know you might be thinking \"well why don't you talk to people?\"\n\nI want to, but I'm usually busy and too concerned about class ending, what assignment to do, etc. to talk in and out of classes. Ice never been good at that sort of thing. I even joined a club and I feel like I haven't made friends there.\n\nI feel hopeless that no one cares or likes me in this school, and that I should ditch the plans to not make any friends in college. Maybe I should just accept the fact I'm lonely forever and I should just stfu and get my degree. But does it have to be this way?",

      "text": "I hate to be the one to say it, but talking to people is the only way you're gonna get to know them better and to let them know you exist.\n\n>No one bothers to talk to me or even acknowledge my existence, especially when I eat in the dining area.\n\nMost people probably won't approach someone eating alone, I know I wouldn't. Unless I already know them, I wouldn't go out of my way to sit down because I'm gonna assume the person wants to be left alone. This is double true if they've got like headphones or something too.\n\nTalking about stuff before class or after class is a big one for me personally. I always talk to people after like tests or before big due dates to see where everyone is at. You might be busy, but there's always a few minutes where you could talk to people. One of my best friends I met at CC by literally asking him about a quiz question or hw problem. He's been a gaming buddy for 3 years and I owe him for helping me get through school and getting hired. If I never make that conversation with him, life goes on in a very different way.\n\nObviously being idle isn't working and its not that people don't care, most people just tend to keep to themselves besides the super duper outgoing ones. It's time to be the one initiating contact. Find people in your major or that you see in multiple classes. Ask for study groups > meals after study sessions > talking about other interests during study > roll with it from there.",
