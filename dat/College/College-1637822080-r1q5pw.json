  "text": "So I am currently in my third year of college. Graduated high school with high honors, had an amazing first semester of freshman year with a 3.8 GPA, and then the pandemic hit. Between that and a number of life altering events that happened at the time, I fell into a deep depressive episode and lost all motivation/ability to perform well in school. Looking back on it I feel it would have been best for me to have taken a gap year, but instead I convinced myself at the beginning of every semester that I would do better, continued to fail classes, rinsed and repeated for 3 semesters. Now I am on my second semester of academic probation, have lost all of my financial aid, and now this semester is looking to be as dreadful as the ones before it. I have been looking into different options for schooling, but with a 1.8 GPA (that will most likely be lower after this semester), I don\u2019t even think transferring to an online program like SNHU (which was originally my plan) is an option. Don\u2019t get me wrong, while I do feel like my current university is partially to blame for my struggles these past few semesters(couldn\u2019t get ahold of advisors for months at a time, etc), I am ultimately the one responsible for my grades, and I have failed that tremendously. I still have my lease in my university town for spring, but I know I will not be able to afford next semester. \nBasically I am looking for where to turn. There is not a community college near my current university, I don\u2019t have a car to travel to the community college back in my hometown (which would be the only option), and overall I feel like a massive disappointment. I have been going through therapy and feel more motivated than ever to perform well in school, but I\u2019m scared it\u2019s too little too late. Is it possible to even go back to school with such low grades? Have I ruined my future? \nThis is my first long post and I genuinely do not want to sound negative, I\u2019m just hopeful to find options or any advice at all on where to go next.",
