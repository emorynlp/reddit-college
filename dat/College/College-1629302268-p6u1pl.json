Run from those toxic people (even if it's in intentional on their part) real friends don't need to do anything as such just to make others stay, they are just exploiting you then lol\n\n3.if you want to get out of situation: just tell them that your car just got into a minor accident and have to take a mechanic for a week or 2, they will just find other way to get to the place.",

      "text": "Not really a \"mistake\", everyone says overly general things every now and then not really meaning to have it taken so literally. Definitely just be mindful to make clear what your boundaries are if it comes up in the future. People should know better than to overuse your generosity - all college students are busy. If it comes up again, just clarify that you don't mind people asking, but it'll always depend on if you've got other things going on and you'd appreciate if you have to go out of your way, if others can pitch in a bit for gas money.\n\nI have a car in college and have offered people rides before or been the one in my friend group to drive places. Here are some examples of how I manage it:\n\n\\-If friends need a car for groceries, we need to coordinate a time to all go together on a weekend morning when we're least likely to be busy.\n\n\\-I'd just invite friends to go get food with me, so no one ever really asked if I would drive them. Usually this only happened if we were all hanging out and noticed we were in the mood for a late night snack.\n\n\\-If someone urgently needs a ride somewhere for some reason, just ask. Hopefully they understand \"urgent\" means like, there's an appointment they have to get to but their original travel plans got messed up. The answer may be yes or no depending on my own schedule, but it's always cool to ask.\n\n\\-If I'm getting my own errands done with friends in my car too, I don't worry about asking for gas money. If someone asked me regularly for a ride that required me to go out of my way, or even if they needed a longer ride somewhere away from campus one time, I'd probably ask if they could pitch in some gas money.",

It will get you invited places and give you time to bond with people. You can even casually ask for gas money upfront. Genuine friends with common sense will understand what you meant, that it's an occasional thing, and will pitch in for gas. Someone who constantly asks for rides, never gives you gas money or anything in return, or only hits you up when they need a ride is not a friend. Cut those ones out :)\n\nEDIT: Also be good at maintaining boundaries and don't let people walk over you, whatever that means for you. \"I can't go, I have to study.\" \"I'll be drinking tonight, so I won't be able to drive.\" \"I wasn't heading that far and have to come back early.\"",
