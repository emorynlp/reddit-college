  "text": "I\u2019ve been getting NSLS letters and emails each year that I\u2019m eligible to join and I\u2019ve been turning a new chapter in my life where I want to do more for myself and pave way a future with a lot of opportunities. I\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s actually joined this society for college, but to anyone who has in their school, what\u2019s it like, did you actually benefit from being in it, and what types of activities do you have to attend to?",

      "text": "Save your money, it\u2019s not worth it. My school had a chapter that I joined, but it only lasted a semester. We had to go to a few mandatory meetings where we just did icebreakers and watched crappy videos about becoming a leader to get officially inducted. Once we got inducted, we didn\u2019t hear anything about future meetings from our president. It\u2019s been over a year since I last heard anything about it. You\u2019re better off getting involved in other clubs and programs that your school may offer.",

      "text": "It\u2019s benefits are actually minuscule. They offer scholarships but you will be competing with thousands of other NSLS members to get them. They also make you pay a $80-$100 membership fee for essentially just being able to put it on your resume. The group at my school isn\u2019t even competitive, accepting anyone with a 3.0 or higher GPA. It\u2019s a scam, don\u2019t do it.",
