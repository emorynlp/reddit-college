  "title:": "Anyone else feel like they have a lighter workload this semester?",
  "text": "I'm in my third semester of college and so far, I feel like I have a lighter workload than my previous semesters. I'm taking four classes and one practicum (on-campus as well and it's going to be a fun one). T\n\nhe four classes I'm taking don't require much essay writing so that helps. In two classes we have weekly homework to prepare for the tests. In one class, we do a lab, a project based off the labs, and then textbook readings. I only have one class where the workload is somewhat heavy: weekly quizzes, plenty of reading, and some long-term work (a few small essays and a presentation, so this isn't bad!).\n\nI lucked out this semester with great professors and I hope I can continue to find professors like them!",
