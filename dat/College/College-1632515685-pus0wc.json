  "title:": "Which business major should I go into?",
  "text": "I am currently in college and at the point where I have to chose what I want to concentrate in. I was personally thinking Accounting or Finance but I am also very much open to management and to an extent marketing as well. However my main concern is which degree would be most versatile or command a higher salary after college. I will be perusing an MBA (and CPA if I go into accounting) within 3-5 years after graduation regardless of which major I go into if that will make any different in what I should major in now. I just don't want to make the wrong decision and 5-10 years from now I am still making under 100k. Whichever path that has more upside potential would be ideal, I just don't know which one that would be. \n\nAny info is appreciated.",
