  "text": "I have struggled with school and started to build my life together this past year I currently have a 3.5 gpa for my senior year but only adds up to a 2.2 for my last 4 years. I really want to go to university but don\u2019t know where I already am completely informed about community college and will probably end up there however I at least want to try applying to colleges and universities. Is  there any universities that would give me a slight chance of getting accepted or even a program that I can start right now that would give me a guaranteed admission by the fall or spring semester of 2022 all given advice will definitely be taken into consideration and appreciated. \n(I rushed while typing this so my bad if I messed up a couple time)",

      "text": "Look to see if there is a \"regional\" public university near you - meaning a 4-year university that isn't one of the big flagship schools in your state. Regionals are usually much smaller and accept more students that don't get a chance at admission to the flagship (i.e., lower GPA, lower test scores). If starting out at a community college isn't an option, maybe this is. A GPA of 2.2 is probably a little low (my school requires 2.35 overall high school GPA), but most of these universities will also review applications on a case by case basis if you're close to meeting the requirements. The higher GPA in your most recent semesters will definitely be a positive indicator of your potential to be successful in college.",
