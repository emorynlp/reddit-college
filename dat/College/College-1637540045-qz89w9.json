  "text": "Long story short I had a chem quiz on Respondus Lockdown and my internet crashed. I get back in and my time ran out snd I receive at 13/50. Honestly I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more I could have done. I emailed my professor, but it\u2019s the weekend, a break, and I feel like i\u2019m bothering him. I\u2019m worried if and when he gets back he won\u2019t be able to do much to help me. Has anyone else had issues with this software?",
