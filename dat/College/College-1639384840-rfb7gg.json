It\u2019s just one of my major classes.",

I think he should be more socially aware of that",

Don\u2019t blame it on your roommate and his social awareness if you made the choice to not saying anything after he specifically told you to let him know. If you feel like you are taking away his freedom by saying something, than you need to deal with the consequences. I know I would personally not tolerate that.",
