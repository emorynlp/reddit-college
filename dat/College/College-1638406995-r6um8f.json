  "title:": "Is it acceptable to give small gifts to professors as a thank-you?",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I've heard conflicting advice on this. I've really appreciated all my professors this semester, and was considering getting or making them small gifts (ie, a candle, a chocolate bar, etc, nothing over like $5, or maybe making them something handmade). \n\nI would understand how giving professors large gifts, especially as an attempt at bribery, is unacceptable. Would that extend to all gifts? Has anyone else done this?",

      "text": "I'm a professor- in 10 years of teaching 3-4 classes a semester I have only received a gift once.  A better idea might be to write out a nice card thanking your professor.  I have received a number of those, and I always keep them and look back over them if I'm having a particularly rough semester.   They are also great for tenure portfolios!",

      "text": "Aww, that's very sweet of you. If you're going for small gifts for every professor, then I'd say it's fine, especially if it is a handmade one. As for bigger ones, my class really like a professor and we chipped in 2~3 dollars each to buy her a pack of handcream, parfum and body cream. \n\n\n\nAlso, it's almost end of the year, so I don't think people will see it as bad thing, more like an early Christmas gift. Besides, what kind of \"big gifts\" were you thinking of?",
