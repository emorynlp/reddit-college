I don't have that kind of money that can be put towards that right now...",

          "text": "> If you officially dropped out, you would not owe the money\n\nBased on what? If OP owed a balance at the time they left school, that doesn't magically go away because they withdrew.\n\nIf anything, OP might owe the balance *because* they had loans and left before the end of the semester. If you use Title IV loans (Federal student loans, from FAFSA), if you stop attending before the end of the loan period, the school performs a calculation called \"R2T4,\" \"return to Title IV,\" and basically prorates your loans and returns the difference to your lender, which reduces your outstanding loan balance. You're still on the hook for the balance that difference was covering, though, depending on your school's policies around refunds for changes to your enrollment status. Typically there is a deadline, relatively early in the semester, after which you don't get anything refunded for making changes to your enrollment, which includes dropping out. If you finish the semester and drop mid-year, all of the aid you were using for that semester stays on your account and your balance is whatever it was going to be for the term, no R2T4.\n\nAs for actionable advice for the OP: talk to the bursar's office, see if you can arrange an installment plan. Most likely, since you are not currently enrolled at Old School, financial aid will not be able to help you - if you need a loan to cover this balance, it's going to have to be a personal loan through your bank or a peer-to-peer lending service, you can't get a student loan to cover expenses at a school you no longer attend. If you need your transcripts because you're going back to school now, talk to your new institution and explain what's going on. Proactively keep everyone in the loop (your old and new schools probably *can't* talk to each other on your behalf anyway, because of FERPA, so they won't know anything you don't tell them), keep your communications calm, polite, and respectful, and generally the *human beings* on the other side of the desk will be willing to help you.",
