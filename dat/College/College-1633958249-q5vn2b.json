  "text": "I am kinda concerned cause I don\u2019t feel integrated enough in my college. Well I don\u2019t live on campus which can explain a lot of things ( I\u2019m moving on November) but also I feel like people already have their friend groups and I get along well with people individually, but I don\u2019t belong to a friend group. \nI really wanna apply for the school council but you have to stand out and be kinda popular to be on a list. If I don\u2019t stand out, that won\u2019t happen. Also I got rejected at the 3 associations I applied for (but I get they were very selective)\n\nI\u2019m usually a confident and outgoing person, but as time goes, I\u2019m getting less and less confident and I feel left out. \n\nAny tips for how to regain that confident and integrate myself better ?",
