  "text": "There's this \"global youth led organization\" im a part of and just got into an executive board position (a year long position). It's quite relevant to the field I'm trying to get into, but it's really taking a toll on my mental health because the higher ups expect us to essentially take on full time work despite not getting paid. I also work and, ofc, am a full time student. \n\nIk this may sound stupid,  but is it worth sticking it out for my resume? The job im at could move me to a position that is somewhat similar to the field i am trying to get into. The this is that I will have the title \"assistant\" at the job versus the title of \"VP\" in the org. But then again, the org is literally making me suffer. Is it worth my resume or should I chance getting the \"assistant\" position (i have not been offered the position nor may it be open, but I'm intending on staying at the company until I graduate, which is in 1.5 yrs, so I still have time this upcoming semester to try to get the position)?",

      "text": "I review many job and study program applications in my position. The student organization-related activities (+ the title) on a resume count very little if they're not relevant to the field you're applying to. Jobs and relevant project experience count significantly more. There seem to be many points that speak against your engagement in the student activity:\n\n1. An unreasonable amount of time (almost full-time!) that you could be spent on other activities that contribute more to your career goals. \n2. Your activities in the organization don't seem to align that much with your career goals. So it's not really going to make a real difference in your resume and for your skill-building.\n3. The work in the organization seems to make you suffer. I could understand doing something non-enjoyable if you rely on an income. But it's not paid and you have a job already.\n\nI have many students who want to do it all. But you must carefully choose how you spend your time. Saying no to some things is sometimes the better option to achieve your goals.\n\nI'm writing this based on the information I got from your post. I don't know if there are factors that speak for staying in the organization. In the end, it's a decision that you need to make for yourself.",
