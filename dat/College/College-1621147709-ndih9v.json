This also helps to prevent procrastination. \n\n**Don\u2019t be scared to ask for help.** Your professors are there to help you and make sure you pass the class. They are another tool for you to use for your success, use them. If your uni has tutoring, check that out too if you need help.\n\n**Make sure to take care of yourself.** You can\u2019t do school work if you\u2019re so depressed or sick that you can\u2019t move. Make sure to take care of yourself and your needs before you do anything else. *Sleep is more important than pulling an all-nighter studying.*\n\n**Find hobbies and make time for them.** All work and no play will ruin your college experience and make you less motivated to do your work. I rollerskate and I knit, both of those help relax me. Find something relaxing you can do to help de-stress.\n\nEdit to add: **don\u2019t procrastinate** turn in your assignments so that you can get credit. And, if you do procrastinate and don\u2019t finish the assignment, **STILL TURN IT IN** a 50 is better than a 0!!!",
