  "text": "My project for my undergraduate research this semester is to write a literature review (instead of a formal research report). I've been reviewing studies for specifically targeted event-related potentials and oscillations, and I have 50 studies that I've thoroughly looked at - I was supposed to review and do a synopsis of \\~5 studies a week. I need to get started on the lit review now because I have several 3000 word finals due a month, but I really have no idea where even to begin.\n\nAny tips, tricks, advice for me?",

      "text": "If you have access to journals, then you should have access to literature reviews as well. Take a look at one or two. Generally you briefly describe the subject and then go into a paragraph or two with a selected figure for each article. If you can group articles into subsections then do so.",

      "text": "First, obviously, read your sources\n\nThen synthesize them and form connections between them and when writing don't just summarize, but put the sources in conversation - where do they agree? disagree? what arguments/facts about your topic do they support?\n\nAnother important piece is establishing your own gap in the literature that you, through your research, will fill - the lit review imo is basically the \"what are other people saying and what hasn't been said?\" You use your wide breadth of literature to show that you've done your reading and to show that you're saying something new and inserting yourself into the conversation that you've built through your sources.\n\nThis is what I think of with a lit review but I am not a researcher/academic so my words are not set in stone!",
