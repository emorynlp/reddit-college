  "title:": "Work or Scholarships to pay for college?",
  "text": "In my current situation, I will soon need to take the burden of college costs upon myself and that may include a taking out a loan, which I do not want to do. I currently have a performance based scholarship from the state but that doesn\u2019t entirely cover the cost of college. My parents are expanding their business so I likely do not qualify for need based scholarships from the state. So unless I take out loans, the only two ways I can pay for college is through applying for scholarships or working a job. I am leaning towards a job since the current market can land me a job with above minimum wage and I am not good at essays. From my experience, scholarships take up a substantial amount of time with a very slim chance of succeeding, so I am not looking at spending all day applying for scholarships. I have tried to apply to Air Force Reserve, but since I take ADHD medication, that is not an option for the time being. \n\nWhat your thoughts on this issue and would you agree or disagree with my assessment?",
