  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a Strategic communication graduate student at Columbia College Chicago. As a research class project, I\u2019m conducting a study on How dating apps can lead to social media addiction. This is a short 5 min survey that will require you to answer a series of questions. To take this survey you have used or are using dating apps. I would really appreciate it if you can take the time to fill out this survey, which will greatly help to understand the connection between dating apps and social media addiction. If you have any questions, please send me a DM or email at karla.sanchez@loop.colum.edu.\n\n[https://colum.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_9uTN1WPvUXfkFRI](https://colum.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9uTN1WPvUXfkFRI)",
