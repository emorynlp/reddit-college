  "title:": "How many classes/credit hours do you take in a semester?",
  "text": "This semester I took 3 classes (9 credit hours) and I had no problem with the workload. For the spring semester I signed up for 4 classes (12 credit hours) and I\u2019m a little worried I won\u2019t be able to handle it. I know 15 credit hours is the standard for finishing in 4 years but the max I have ever taken in one semester is 12 credit hours. Should I give 12 credit hours a try? Or don\u2019t if I don\u2019t feel comfortable? Any advice is appreciated.",

Of course you might find something else works better for you, and that\u2019s totally ok! You can always try out this load, and adjust in following terms. Good luck! :)",
