  "title:": "How many classes/credit hours do you take in a semester?",
  "text": "This semester I took 3 classes (9 credit hours) and I had no problem with the workload. For the spring semester I signed up for 4 classes (12 credit hours) and I\u2019m a little worried I won\u2019t be able to handle it. I know 15 credit hours is the standard for finishing in 4 years but the max I have ever taken in one semester is 12 credit hours. Should I give 12 credit hours a try? Or don\u2019t if I don\u2019t feel comfortable? Any advice is appreciated.",
