  "text": "hey guys i\u2019m a sophomore education major who is also in a fraternity which will have relevance later. in the middle of august i got off my anxiety medicine because we felt it was ready and it has been going really good until recently. i\u2019ve completely lost motivation to do anything, i\u2019ve been using unhealthy ways of coping with stuff in my life such as drugs and hook ups and i just have no idea what to do. i\u2019m contemplating changing my major too which i\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just a phase but i\u2019m just lost and am wondering basically if anyone else has had this occur to them in college because the longer i keep this up im afraid eventually my grades will start to slip up and i\u2019ll just completely fail out. thanks guys",

Go talk to your big, your president, your brotherhood chair, your chapter advisor, anyone who can help get you resources for therapy or avenues to get some help",
