      "text": "Hey, I have a little bit of input. As someone who's in the \"16-20\" category, who does drive, and who clicked \"No\" about whether or not I buy my own auto insurance, I felt some uncertainty while answering some of the questions. For context, my parents still pay for my auto insurance. So, I happen to not know who my insurance provider is, and clicking \"N/A\" doesn't seem to have the same implication as clicking an option on other surveys such as \"Unsure.\" I also felt strange answering the \"purchasing auto insurance\" question; as I've never had to weigh my options while purchasing auto insurance, I don't know what factor would be most important to me should I have to choose for myself.",
