  "text": "My uni grades on a curve. The cheating is rampant which is causing very high means. This is especially true for stem subjects. I dont know why professors and colleges are so silent on this issue. How can anyone even consider the grades from this period to be worth anything.",

If your exam depends on rote memorization and is easily google-able,  I've got news for you... students aren't learning anything, cheating or not. They will brain dump whatever they brute force memorized literally the second they walk out of that test.",

      "text": "Professor here. While many of the answers posted here are somewhat correct (institutional financial concerns, pressure from admins over enrollment/retention/completion rates, etc...) there's a broader answer that might be applicable here.\n\nI was once told, \"Academia moves at a glacial pace.\"\n\nI didn't agree with this when I first heard it, but I find it rings true the more I teach. There are pros and cons to this. The pros are that academia doesn't bend to short-term trends and fads. The cons are that it takes a longer to respond to long-term trends and changes in traditional norms. COVID is a really big deal, in the short-term. But long-term, it's just a bump in the road. Even if we stayed on lockdown for 2-3 years, that's still a short time in academia.\n\nSo I think the 'silence' you're referring to is simply an acknowledgement that this is a short-term disturbance and any meaningful efforts at change will take longer to approve and implement than the impact of COVID is going to last. We have multiple vaccines, so most institutions are focused on safely going back to normal operations.",

      "text": "I think it goes far deeper, covid only exploted the bubble. The way teachers do exams in general (from elementary school to university) is wrong, they fall in a categoral error by: \n\n\\-Teachers are telling a date to students when the exam is coming: what are your measuring? how much they know or their studying skills (they will prepare for it, contaminating the results)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Teachers are making tests where memorization of X topic or the operationalization of a process is key to have an excelent grade. Again, what are you trying to evaluate by applying this evaluation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Administrators are putting pressure on the teacher, then they are doing it on students. The body of teachers the school have, the classes you need to take to graduate, the general way of doing a class, and the ambient lived on your career/faculty are things that affect you as a student. I know the change between HS to college is tough but it shouldnt be this tough, some programs are too demanding towards students, who live to study every semester and after college, they start to notice they've develop strange rutines or stay in group of friends that share the same way of living.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are we doing to our kids.",

The professors that don't have in class exams actively encourage us to use our notes, the textbook etc. One even let's us write a full double sided page as a \"cheat sheet\" the only thing that cant be on it is examples from the sample test and quizzes. Hell, I asked my lab professor once about a question we had in our lab book and she told me to Google it. \n\nMeanwhile, my sister at community college has to take proctored tests online, they ask to see her ID and then they ask her to show them the area around her. No one can be in the room, nothing on in the background, nothing that can be even remotely used to cheat etc. She uses sticky notes for to do's and motivational quotes, they made her take it all down. \n\nAre some of my professors too lenient? Probably. But the opposite is a huge invasion of privacy. What if you can't get to be alone in a room? Do we give a stranger a tour of our room and let them see our ID? Do we let a Uni install invasive spyware on laptops to monitor everything we do, which can be used even when we're not taking a test?",
