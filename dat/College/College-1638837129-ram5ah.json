  "text": "I have an associates currently in a field I plan on leaving and need help finding an online college that isn't \"for profit\". Id like to go back and get my Bachelor's in IT haven't quite narrowed it down yet. Thinking a major in Network Administration and a minor in Cyber Security.\n\nAny help is appreciated. I was considering Franklin University because it's in my home state and I graduated from their sister College but it's quite pricey. Looking for something that's more at my own pace. I'm heavily self taught and don't want to be \"required\" to be in an online classroom like illuminate.\n\nAny of your experiences or help would be greatly appreciated.",
