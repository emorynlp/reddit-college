  "text": "Hi Reddit\n\nI am a freshman at a University and also work full time along with my studies. This semester, I haven't been able to keep my attendance up to the mark in one of the course and at times have missed three classes. \n\nI would like to appear in the course but I am most definitely sure that professor has noticed my absence even though the class is quite easy.\n\nDo you think dropping and retaking this course next semester is the best way of action?\n\nIs it considered rude to just drop the course without consulting the instructor first?",

      "text": "Nope. Is attendance mandatory? As long as you have decent marks and aren\u2019t falling behind it\u2019s not a problem. We\u2019ve all missed a class or two every now and then. 3 classes a semester is pretty average if I do say so myself. It\u2019s best to not get into the habit of it though.",
