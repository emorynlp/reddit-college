  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a high schooler and next semester I\u2019m going to be taking some dual enrollment classes. I know I\u2019ll be doing ENG 101, but I\u2019m not sure I know the other class I\u2019ll be taking as of now. Does anyone have some tips and/or advice for how to succeed and what to expect? Seeing as these classes are going on my college GPA, it would be really bad to perform poorly because I\u2019m not used to the rigor found in college classes.",
