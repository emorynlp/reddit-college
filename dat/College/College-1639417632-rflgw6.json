  "text": "So I currently have a 2.09 as my GPA. My grades for the first semester haven\u2019t come in yet. Also one F grade is supposed to get taken out. \n\nIve done better this semester and have been using the tips Ive been given. Only issue is that my college makes us get the GPA requirement before we officially declare the major. Its business management and I need a 3.2. \n\nI love the business field and have done well in the business classes that I am allowed to take with no major. Ive also had my own business and work with investments including some startups. I do have business experience and do well\u2026 its just that the classes that are not business related throw me off because I don\u2019t do good in them. \n\nI can get my GPA up to a 3.2 eventually though right? I may graduate a little late but I hope it is possible to get my GPA up to that. I know I gotta work extra hard and smart. I also have a limited amount of classes I can take because I have no major technically. \n\nI can do this right? Tell me your GPA success stories if you can as some motivation",

      "text": "I don\u2019t have a GPA success story by any means but if you grind hard enough you can definitely get it up. It\u2019s super easy to actually calculate what grades you\u2019d need to reach that benchmark GPA. \n\nFirst recalculate the GPA by taking out the F. I\u2019d say try to stay within 3.5+ you\u2019ll be able to raise your cumulative in no time \n\nBest of luck!!",
