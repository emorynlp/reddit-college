  "text": "Okay, so I\u2019m in my third year of college (recently switched majors and universities) and I still don\u2019t know an efficient way to study. I have ADHD so I have the hardest time sitting in one place and studying, and when I actually do I don\u2019t pick up information well. I also get super distracted really easily and it doesn\u2019t help that the apartment I live in is next to an elementary school so all o hear is kids screaming. I know I could go to the library to study but honestly I don\u2019t know campus at all, most of my classes are online so I don\u2019t have to go to campus and this is my first semester here (my old university is 1/4 the size of this one) and I find the campus to be really intimidating especially since I don\u2019t know anyone on campus. Does anyone have any tips or tricks that they use to help? Oh and my major is microbiology",

      "text": "Study in short bursts (pomodoro technique) and switch subjects between breaks! Outline what you want to cover per subject in a week (break it down into chunks. this method is called chunking) and use that outline to cover one topic per burst or per day (whatever works). \n\nWhen you actually go to sit down and study the content, write your notes in your own words. Summarize a section of your book. The sitting down part and just reading probably sucks the most so try to relate everything you read back to your experiences. Yes you might end up on a long mental tangent but you will likely remember it because of relating parts back to your text. Also youtube videos and visual aids might give you some stimulation. Try to even apply your knowledge to your real life. Like if you are in anatomy, work out your muscles and you\u2019ll better understand your body parts\n\nPractice recalling the information and review within 24 hours. Before you go to bed, review what you\u2019ve learned and try to connect it all as a whole towards the end of the week in a big summary. I use my summaries at the end of the week as a study guide for my finals. Hope this helps",
