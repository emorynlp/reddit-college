      "text": "As a general rule of thumb, it's best to always assume that everything you've posted online is public. \n\nWhether or not colleges will actually see what you've put online or care is an entirely different question. Realistically, it's unlikely they'll have access to or even care enough to have access to *everything* you *ever* put online. And it's also very likely that most schools wouldn't even look at all. However, if you've posted something that is easy to find (or even not easy to find) but is distasteful, it is very much in your best interest to take it down and to scrub it from the internet as best you can for reasons that go well beyond what colleges might think of you.",
