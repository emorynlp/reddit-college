  "text": "Today I had the very rare day where on top of there being no school, I had no work due tomorrow, no family blowing up my phone, AND no work.\n\nAt first, when I decided to spend the day in my pajamas catching up on sleep, I felt skittish and guilty over \"wasting my time,\" but after sleeping for literally 10 hours straight, I felt incredible !! I didn't realize how much I was pushing myself until I finally slowed down.\n\nSo I just wanted to let you guys know that if you ever get the perfect free day, don't feel bad about spending it sleeping or just relaxing.\n\nTake care of yourselves; being a student is hard. Also, don't forget to drink water!!",
