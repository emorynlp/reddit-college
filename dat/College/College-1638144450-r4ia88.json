  "text": "I hate talking about it with my IRLs so thought I\u2019d attempt to put my feelings out into the world lmao\nI\u2019m a second year pharmacy student, so I\u2019m in my third semester out of 10 in total. When I just started uni, it was pretty easy for me since I was so used to studying A LOT. Ever since I started school, I was always a top notch student and at the top of my class. So that semester happened and ended pretty smoothly. My problems started in my second semester. I simply felt lazy. I couldn\u2019t study, couldn\u2019t focus on anything related to school and I managed to fail 3 of my classes. I somehow passed to year two and the situation is still the same. With the addition of not going to classes and absolutely hating the whole idea of university. I try studying, but I simply can\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t feel like laziness anymore. Laziness can\u2019t last for over 7 months. I didn\u2019t take two of my tests I had last week, I didn\u2019t attend a single class. We had a short break due to our country\u2019s independence day and on the first day I started crying because I remembered I have to go to school on Monday. School is in 8 hours and I\u2019m miserable. The thought of dropping out and starting a business (which I plan on starting regardless) just makes me so, so happy, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll regret it 5-6 years down the line. When I think of all the career paths there are in the world, being a pharmacist is kind of my \u201cfavorite\u201d one, but this university thing is taking my will to leave bed in the morning, let alone study for it 5 more years. I\u2019ll happily wake up at 7 AM and go chop wood and milk cows, just don\u2019t make me go to class. Oh also, my semester just started about 2 months ago and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll fail this year completely because my motivation to study is lower than the lowest point ever. And even if I do study, nothing stays up in my head. I simply can\u2019t. Did anyone of you experience this before? Did anyone drop out? If you did, how do you feel now? If you have advice or anything to say, feel free. I\u2019m going to bed now, thanks for reading all this crap. ily, bai",

      "text": "It seems like maybe you\u2019re just burnt out from doing school for so long and studying so often. \n\nI normally would never advise taking a break but for people who are going to school for 8-10 years I think it\u2019s definitely a need. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you wether to or not to drop out. But my personal feelings are you\u2019ve already spent the money and time in college/uni for a year or more. Those credits are absolutely useless if you don\u2019t get a degree with them. If not a masters, get a bachelors but get something. \n\nHope this helped",

      "text": "You are exactly where I was in my college years. I was a top student in high school. In freshmen year, math and sciences were easy for me. Then things taking a turn in 2nd year. All the distractions (friends, lifestyles) were catching up. Started to miss classes, missing homework, failing grades, kicked out from department, reinstatement, etc. \n\nYou need to break out from the bad cycles. You can\u2019t do anything w the school systems, the only  change you have control on is the things around you. Your friends, where you stay, your habits (eating/living), \u201cthe distractions\u201d, etc. \n\nAt my lowest point, I met a person that helped me got through the college. She managed to fine tuned my lifestyle and balanced my mental/emotions, getting back to good study habits. It could be anything, but there is a need for big turnaround. \n\nTill today, I regretted no finishing up the major I intended to. But LIFE will throw everything at you, to make you a stronger person. Hope you can get through this, stay fighting, believing in YOU can do it.",
