  "text": "At this point I kinda feel lost, I got my Associate in Arts at a local community college, and transferred to a University not too long ago to study graphic design. But I feel like it's pointless, and I feel like once I graduate I'll have a great deal of trouble finding a job. \n\nI have no passion for this anymore, I've changed so much since I started college and my interests have shifted quite a bit, but I feel like there's no turning back since I'm already so far in this. I have already put so much time, effort, and money into this and I feel like I can't just throw that away, but at the same time, I have no desire to really continue. \n\nWhat should I do honestly?",
