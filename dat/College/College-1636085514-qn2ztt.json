      "text": "When I was in college I coped by getting black out drunk every weekend. I would NOT recommend that at all. Sometimes a good cry sesh would help, but ik that's not for everyone. \n\nMaybe talking to a therapist would be helpful? Definitely not a school one, they are not the greatest in my experience tbh. But telehealth, and depending on your insurance it could be doable and bring even a little bit of relief? \n\nHope you hang in there",
