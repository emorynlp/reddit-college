  "text": "Don't get me wrong, I like a nice class off to relax. For the past couple of weeks, i've had a class cancelled at least once a week. For my business class, he cancels class after an exam (great) or he cancels class randomly with no reasoning. For my math class, she cancels class for a doctor's appointment. For my history discussion, the TA cancels because they found the reading boring and didn't feel like talking about it... umm what this is your job! Now this same TA has pneumonia and its not their fault but my routine keeps getting messed up and it bothers me. Attendance is apart of the grade yet they themselves hardly show up.",

      "text": "I almost never see professors cancel class. I personally wonder if maybe the \"mental health crisis\" is hitting your profs and they're burned out. Students aren't the only one who are affected by mental health concerns that mess with attendance and the ability to get things done-- mental health problems affect people of all ages.\n\nThat or they're lazy. Idk.",
