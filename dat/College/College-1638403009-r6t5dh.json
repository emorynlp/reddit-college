  "text": "Hey guys I\u2019m freaking out about my applied calculus test. I have a 75 in there and i have an exam that\u2019s 15% of my grade this Friday and my final next week that\u2019s 20%, also i missed one of my exams so he said whatever i get on my final i will get on that exam. I know I\u2019m gonna do so bad on the tests. He\u2019s a horrible teacher and it\u2019s a hard class. Honestly I\u2019ll be ok with a D. He said two lowest quiz grades will be dropped so I\u2019m just wondering how will that be calculated? Like how many points would my grade go up? I got a 1/10 & one quiz is missing so those would be the ones that would be dropped. My other 3 quizzes i have 100% on. They are 10% of my grade. I\u2019m just freaking out. This semester was different",
