  "text": "I was in a course based on heavy reading and struggled to do all the assignment. The professor and TA are good. But it took me days to finish final essay and it's refused by professor as the last day to submit term assignment has past.\n\nI know it's all my fault and responsibility to take the consequences. Though I would definitely fail the course now and I actually did good on exams. So I wonders if there anything you recommend I could do just to make thing looks better? Any ideas helps! Thanks.",
