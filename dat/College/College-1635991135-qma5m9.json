  "text": "Monday through Friday I\u2019m on campus for 11/12 hours a day either in class or studying. Today I left my house at 6:40am an didn\u2019t come home until 6:30pm and I still had 2 more hours of homework to do. I\u2019m taking 16 credits while still working 18 hours a week and people don\u2019t understand how much time school actually takes. I\u2019m trying to prove to myself that I can get straight A\u2019s this semester. \n\nAnyways, if you also put in 70 hours a week into work and school, you\u2019re not alone. Keep going. We are almost at the end of the semester.",
