  "text": "I just found out that our tassel and cap and gown is going to be generic black cause our school is too cheap to get us one with our school color. On top that of that our diploma isn\u2019t printed on card stock or even regular computer paper. It\u2019s like this see through flimsy paper? Honestly disappointed. That\u2019s not something I want other people to see. A black tassel when my school color is obviously not black and a diploma that\u2019s see through? Like just send me a pdf of it so I can print it on card stock myself. I don\u2019t even want to pay for the tassel anymore",
