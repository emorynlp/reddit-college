  "title:": "I want to be a better student but have no motivation & have been taking things for granted. Crying as I type this. How to change?",
  "text": "I was born & raised in a different country, went to a really shitty English-speaking international school since middle school and came here for college. I'm reluctant to blame even just a tiny portion of my academic inadequacy onto cultural differences & English being my second language (there are so many other international students out there absolutely crushing the American education system), but oftentimes I ponder the possibility of being a smarter kid if I was born in a different environment. No one except myself cares about my performance, and no one except myself gives me pressure (a double-edged sword, I guess). My parents and siblings don't really want to learn about what I study.\n\nFor the record, I've conveyed my situation to a couple of people before and always got the same response: \"You're already doing great! There are people doing so much worse than you!\" But I want to do better. I know I can do so much better than this; I just don't know how to. \n\nI'm a bio major at a prestigious uni with a 3.6 something GPA (not straight As), am in a couple of clubs (kind of passionate in all of them but not enough to go above & beyond for any), has a lab internship (does the job & my advisor doesn't hate me) and a job (super easy clerical stuff; the only time I get huge compliments). I feel like everything I've done kind of fulfills the checklist but doesn't make me stand out in anyway. Of course I want to get straight A's, to work on a project so hard that I don't sleep for 3 days straight, and to be the last person that leaves lab... But I somehow just can't do any of these. I don't have the drive, at all. \n\nEvery time I fuck up an assignment/exam, I tell myself that it's okay and I'll just do better next time. But I don't. I can't devote myself into school work; I fuck around on the internet for hours and choose resting/having fun over studying. I still study for at least 4 hours per day, but none of these hours just seem to be helping my performance. I never pull all-nighters and find excuses to skip discussion classes because I just don't want to go. I avoid competition. I love what I'm studying; but so far they've been really fundamental and I can't really do anything with those knowledge. \n\nIn general, I'm just seeking advice on how to go above and beyond for my studies. I feel like I've been taking everything for granted; I'm so privileged and fortunate enough to not worry about personal wellbeing or finance, but I feel like this lack of challenge is making me a useless person. I don't want to be a mediocre student; maybe not the best student either, just a great one. I'm thinking of going med school but there's no way that my current mentality would get me somewhere even close to that. Thank you to all who are willing to share their experiences with me.\n\ntl;dr: I don't think I hate school; I just hate myself. What to do HOMIES",

      "text": "Fundamental stuff is fucking boring lol. I would not call yourself unmotivated if you are studying 4 hours a day either. Do you struggle w the material or have any test taking anxiety? Do you feel like you know the material until you get tested on it? On the things you don\u2019t do well in, what\u2019s the problem? \n\nLook at the patterns- do you procrastinate? Are you studying during the time of the day where you are too tired to retain the information?\n\nAlso you are working and in clubs?! You are far from unmotivated, you sound tired and spread thin. How can you expect to want MORE motivation when you have so many demands in your life already? You are doing great and im sorry that you don\u2019t want to hear it but it is true. Please work on giving yourself a little grace and if anything, lessen work load somewhere.",

          "text": "Everything you said made me feel so much better. It's just that everyone around me is doing the same thing, treating working + academics + clubs as the bare minimum. I do procrastinate and sometimes struggle with STEM subjects, but I feel like that's only because I'm not using my time properly (I would be spending excessive hours on one chapter only to forget about everything in a week). I honestly don't know how I really feel anymore; there are people working harder than I am and I don't feel my limit yet. Or maybe I just don't want to admit that this is all I can handle. But thank you so much for the kindhearted reply; I'll try to cut myself some slack and treat my academics with a more open mind.",

              "text": "Well you are comparing yourself a lot- and the problem w that is everyone has different backgrounds, capabilities, and feelings you may not be aware of. It is common for international students to have an immense pressure from their families to excel. Some of those students come from countries that find sharing feelings of depression and anxiety related to that pressure, frowned upon. There are some students who understand science and math much faster than others, their brains just work that way- and although it\u2019s not impossible for others to get it, it\u2019s harder. Similarly, you might have a set of skills that, that person may not have. Your ability to do something exactly how you want it doesn\u2019t indicate your intelligence, it indicates your strength in that particular area. If it is something you really want, it\u2019s not impossible but you will have to work much harder than someone that it might come more naturally towards. And shit, you may even decide that down the line, it\u2019s not meant for you at all and find passion elsewhere. And that is okay too. \n\nThe biggest key to motivation is acknowledging that you ARE capable. It sounds like you think you are capable of more. But let\u2019s be realistic- you wanting to sleep and rest after all this work is normal and needed. You\u2019re not lazy bc you need rest and didn\u2019t pull an all-nighter. You\u2019re not lazy bc you need to decompress at some point and have fun w your friends. You are a normal human and you are doing your best. You do sound burned out and like you have high expectations for yourself, which is good but you\u2019re going to kill your self esteem and motivation if you\u2019re setting impossible goals. Instead of an all-nighter, go to sleep early and wake up early and get going while your brain is not exhausted from the day. Take notes on chapters that you can always go back and study, so you are not cramming readings taking notes and trying to retain information all at once. Maybe have a time of the day where you go to the library & make it a habit. Whatever you feel you should be doing- cut that in half and make that the new goal. Once you\u2019re used to that, you can increase it. \n\nGood luck to you.",
