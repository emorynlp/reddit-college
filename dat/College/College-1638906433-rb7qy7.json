  "text": "I am a history major and at the moment I have 3 minors: library science, anthropology, and German. The German and anthropology minors were because I was already taking a lot of classes in those departments. They added no extra time at university. Is 3 minors too many? Will it benefit or hinder me when applying for graduate school in the future?",
