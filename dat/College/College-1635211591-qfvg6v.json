  "text": "I can't stand college. The work itself isn't that hard. There's a lot of it, but it's not unbearably difficult.\n\nWhat's difficult is that it's a PAIN IN THE ASS to sign up for classes, submit any assignment or get in contact with ANYONE\n\nMy college has this program that offers free online textbooks as long as you sign up for the class. I signed up for 3 classes, expecting textbooks to be included because that's what they said would happen.\n\nThe day of my first class a guy, the director of the cybersecurity department(I am a cybersecurity major), came in and said 1 of the 3 classes I signed up for wasn't gonna be available until next semester because the people producing the textbook just decided they weren't gonna offer it anymore. I was bummed because that class was a prerequisite class that I needed to take a bunch of other classes, and I'm in my 3rd year so I'm already pretty behind schedule. So naturally I needed to figure out what to do next.\n\nThe cybersecurity director said if we had any questions or concerns to go to his office or shoot him an email. I emailed him. He never responded. I went to his office every single day I was on campus and waited for hours. HE WAS NEVER THERE\n\nNot only that but this morning, a week into the semester, the class just magically shows up in my online campus feed, with a million more assignments that I have to do. I got no warning, no emails, NOTHING, plus since they couldn't get the new textbook they're using an old one that I have to pay for now along with the software they use for the labs\n\nIn another class I'm in I've been trying to complete the first assignment, an online lab. I have to reserve a time slot on the computer to do them, but the password to get into the labs doesn't work so for the entire time slot I can't do anything. My professor said to email him if anyone had any problems with the lab. I emailed him. HE DOESN'T RESPOND TO ME. I tried to do the second lab and it uses the same password and it STILL DOESNT WORK\n\nThen I asked him the next day at class and he said \"oh ok just submit the lab, say the password didn't work and i'll give you credit\". WTF I actually want to do the assignment so I'll actually be able to LEARN SOMETHING\n\nNow I'm sitting in a classroom using the time I was supposed to use to complete a lab to type this instead because the password still isn't fucking working. I'm so fucking frustrated",
