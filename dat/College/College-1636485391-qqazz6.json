      "text": "Sounds overreaching. I would be upset if a professor had that strong of a feeling that I would not be doing my own work.\n\nI say take a photo of the photo of yourself doing work. They need to know that someone else didn't take it for you. Also be sure to be able to prove you took that new photo of the photo.. Ideally set up a triangle system of cameras so that when you take the photos it also captures you taking the photo and the camera that captured you doing that. Send all of that to the professor.",
