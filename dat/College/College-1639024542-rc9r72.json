  "text": "I really want to be done but I can\u2019t because I have one semester left and I need 60 credits for the degree, it\u2019s providing me with severe anxiety and stress. I hate it. I procrastinate because I hate everything about it. I just want this to be over with. Crying myself to sleep is not helping. No matter how much I study, the anxiety just creeps over me and I fail or nearly do. Any advice for this poor soul who feels like a failure every day of finals week?",
