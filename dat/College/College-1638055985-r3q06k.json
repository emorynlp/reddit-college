  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in high school in Florida and interested in getting a Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degree aimed at becoming an Information Security Analyst/Specialist/Manager.\n\nIf strictly working as an Information Security Analyst/Specialist/Manager (or any similar job), would I have better employment/salary opportunities majoring either in [Information Systems](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/colleges-schools/UGBUS/IST_BSBA/) at University of Florida, [Information Technology](https://ischool.cci.fsu.edu/programs/undergrad-programs/information-technology/#major-in-it) (or [Management Information Systems](https://business.fsu.edu/undergraduate/majors/mis)) at Florida State University, or [Information Assurance and Cybersecurity Management](https://www.usf.edu/business/undergraduate/information-assurance-cybersecurity/) at University of South Florida?\n\nPersonally, I feel like USF\u2019s Bachelor\u2019s degree is more cybersecurity-oriented and specific, which would appear more desirable for employers and brandish my skills better in the work place, however, USF (#103) is ranked considerably lower than both UF (#28) and FSU (#55), which inversely may have a less desirable effect on employers. Also, UF offers an [Information Security Certificate](http://fics.institute.ufl.edu/cybersecurity-certificates-programs/specialized-graduate-cybersecurity-certificates/) and Master\u2019s degree in [Information Systems and Operations Management](https://warrington.ufl.edu/master-of-science-in-information-systems-and-operations-management/), and FSU offers a minor in [Data Analytics](https://ischool.cci.fsu.edu/programs/undergrad-programs/minors/#data-analytics-minor) and Master\u2019s degrees in [Management Information Systems](https://business.fsu.edu/msmis), [Computer Network and System Administration](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ms-in-computer-science/#cnsa), and [Cybersecurity](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/academics/ms-cyber-security/), which may be something else to consider.\n\nAdditionally, UF offers a combined BS/MS program for [Information Systems and Operations Management](https://warrington.ufl.edu/master-of-science-in-information-systems-and-operations-management/program-options/combined-degree/) and so does FSU for [Management Information Systems](https://business.fsu.edu/combined-pathways).\n\nLastly, as a follow-up question, would it be wise to pursue a Master\u2019s degree in Business Administration after getting a Bachelor\u2019s degree oriented in information security/technology, especially if I were to choose USF as the place to get my Bachelor\u2019s degree at?\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who replies!",

If you plan to enroll in graduate school down the road, then I would take Computer Science in place of Business Administration. You also require CISSP certification.",
