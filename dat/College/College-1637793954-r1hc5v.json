  "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Kristina (23F) and I am posting this survey for a research study for my senior year of college.\n\nLINK TO STUDY: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgRBI5YoYMA6g6o6xpMssvyfFZtl7J0ua4nL3hQUdjmsY13Q/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgRBI5YoYMA6g6o6xpMssvyfFZtl7J0ua4nL3hQUdjmsY13Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nI am looking for people who are in the deaf community and who have been affected negatively or positively by the criminal justice system.\n\nI'm hoping to find out what some of the barriers/inequalities people in the deaf community have when they are dealing with the criminal justice system/court etc. What are some solutions or improvements for this problem?\n\nIf anyone has the time to fill out this survey or has any suggestions in making this study better please feel free to leave me a comment!",
