  "text": "Hi everyone, how did you figure out what you wanted to major in/what to do after college? I\u2019ve changed my mind countless times and can\u2019t seem to settle on anything. I\u2019ve gone to advisors, taken intro classes, done a TON of research on different paths and I\u2019m still lost. Part of the problem is I have varied interests and I\u2019ve always been intelligent (enough) to excel in most subjects so I\u2019m not pushed away from anything except math and science. I just feel so discouraged because at this point I\u2019m still so lost. I\u2019ve ruled out engineering and science majors. For my hobbies, I like reading extensive history on sports (especially football) and politicians, and events that happened in the past, especially after a history class lecture I found interesting. I love sports a ton, so much that even if I don\u2019t play any now, I find myself playing a sports video game constantly, thinking about past games, or throwing a football around. I make a lot of memes (videos and pics) that align with my sense of humor and get a kick out of deep frying random pics of people. I enjoyed writing fictional essays until I started college and had to learn how to write research papers, and absolutely hate that. I\u2019ve had friends suggest that I should become a teacher but I don\u2019t really know for certain and don\u2019t want to box myself in. Also, I came to college as a psychology major and know for certain I don\u2019t want to do that now bc of the difficulty at my school + the reading wasn\u2019t entirely interesting to me. Does anyone have any advice/suggestions?",

      "text": "It can help to get some experience with a career, or to even think about what kind of work environment you want. I chose my major based on liking the subject, but internships and work study were the tangible experiences that led to some idea of the tasks I found rewarding and the work environments that work well for me. I think that would be a good way to view it.\n\n\n\nI think the other thing that helps is to separate your exploration of a *career* from your hobbies. Loving something doesn't necessarily mean you want to do it professionally. So for example, I love creative writing, but doing that as a job would ruin it for me. I do *some* writing for work, but most of the time is doing other things. It's easier to go home and see hobbies as just your hobbies that way.",

      "text": "If you have so many varied interests just pick one. Life can be full of as many \"what ifs\" as you let it be, so as long as you actually enjoy all 3 or 5 or 13 options, you can't go wrong licking any of them.\n\nI would suggest though that you start looking at careers and prospective salary, because all things being equal, one that pays better will give you more financial freedom to pay off student loans, pursue hobbies, and have a little less stress over all.",
