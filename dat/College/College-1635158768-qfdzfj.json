  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to get a computer science degree for 3 years now but the calculus is just killing me. I\u2019ve done fine with my computer science classes and I really enjoy them but I\u2019ve constantly had problems with my calculus classes. I\u2019m failing calculus 2 for a second time and I\u2019m just now starting to realize there is no way I\u2019m fulfilling the calculus requirements of my degree. Is there anyway I can stay in the computer science field without completing calculus 2 or do I need to cut my losses and completely exit the computer science field?",

If you really, really can't pass the class and still want to stay in the field, I'd look into whether your university has a CS minor or CS certificate, and then switch your major to something useful/relevant without the calc requirement -- what that's going to be will depend on your university's offerings.",

Some of the classes I can remember: Intro to computer science, intro to problem solving, computer science principles, event-driven programming, data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming methods, etc. \n\nAnd then you have the IT classes that similar but not as hard like, computer organization and architecture, network administration, application software microcomputers, etc. \n\nThe CS classes are definitely harder than my IT classes. But I'm horrible at math and not a very good programmer tbh. Shit is hard for me",

                                      "text": "Oh dude college is basically nothing but studying. In high school I literally never studied one time. In college, most classes are 50mins - 75mins long and you'll only have a couple a day (if you're full time), a lot different than HS. Because of that you'll be expected to do most of the learning on your own, especially in Computer Science & IT. You'll be expected to practice on your own a lot, whether it's something like learning Java in your CS class or HTML&CSS in your IT class. If you do nothing else but pay attention to the lectures, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nYou'll learn that studying is a skill too, just like learning how to code. You start really not really knowing how to study and learn through trail and error when you get grades back and they suck. Stuff like memorizing flashcards isn't going to cut it in most classes. I'm still working on that myself.\n\nCollege makes you smarter, though. I'm like 100x smarter than I was when I left high school. So this stuff might sound intimidating but you learn during the process and it's absolutely worth it. I was a completely different person than I was before I started college. It molds you through hardship basically lol.",

Or, see if other tech degrees interest you, such as IT or Digital Forensics, etc. \n\nI'm not sure what classes you have taken in CS that were doable compared to Calc 2. Yes, calc 2 is difficult, most definitely. But I'd have to argue that some classes, like Automata, have been considered just as difficult if not worse. I've known several classmates who dropped Automata this semester and switched to the BA program for this very reason.",

You also study what sorts of problems machines can solve and what is considered unsolvable. Take all of this with a grain of salt as I'm trying to convey some aspects of what we have covered in class without expecting you to have prior knowledge of NFA's, DFA's, etc. \n\nThe problem for me is it is a heavily theoretical class and I don't do well with theory. I've heard of people loving the class and finding it easy, or hating it, and not understanding anything about it. Keep in mind every college has its weed-out courses, it just so happens that the Automata/Computational Theory course is supposedly the hardest class in my University's CS program. A third of our class has already dropped it, and probably a third of the remaining class is taking it their second/third time.",

              "text": "Community college classes are easier than large university classes. First, because the standard of admission is usually lower (I say usually because some 4-year universities have 95% acceptance rate, which is ridiculous...), and therefore professors cannot simply grade or give exams/homework on the same level unless they want to give A grades for students with near 20% averages. Anyone who believes a community college professor would be allowed to hand out homeworks and exams on the level of UC Berkeley with same grading standards is delusional.\n\nnow you will see someone reply to me insisting \"but but but *my* university course was easier than community college!\" And I ask them, what is the graduation rate and admission rate to your university? What is the average graduating GPA for your major at the university?  Because chances are they attend some 95% acceptance rate college with insane grade inflation, far beyond the somewhat-unreasonable community college level.\n\nit is politically incorrect to say so, but if you ask any **math/stats** professor in private and in confidence, they will say that community college transfer students on average have more trouble than 4-year students (if they know who is transfer and who is not). And it's not because they didn't cover the right topics, but because they can't give hard homework and exams for students to really grasp the material.",

At CC there\u2019s less of a chance that this happens. Granted, you still have to find a good community college and decide whether your university is really that bad where you need to take classes at a CC.
