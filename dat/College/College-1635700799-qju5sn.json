  "text": "Hey everyone. I realize this is a common issue but I was just wondering what you do in this case?\n\nIt's a classic. Group project worth some 20% of my grade. We're supposed to be submitting data to an online database with 3 papers due at different points in the project. Second paper is due tonight. \n\nI knew from the start that it was going to be rough. They all took forever to reply with their preferred method of contact. When I set up a group text (which everyone okayed) no one responded for an entire week. It got to the day of the deadline and I sent out frantic texts, emails, and canvas messages asking them to reply if they were even getting my messages. Two people responded with sorry, and last-minute helped me type a very half assed paper (one didn't even use complete sentences). Another never answered but opened the document and added his name, never did anything else. The last one never connected with us and never touched the document. \n\nI already took a few steps to try to protect my grade. I made myself the assigned \"point of contact\" (with the consent of the others) because I didn't trust anyone else to do it. I emailed the project TA as well and let her know what was going on. She sent everyone a message asking for their preferred method of contact. I was the only one who answered her. \n\nNow the second paper is due. I made a Google doc, and asked them to describe their individual progress in the group chat so we could start compiling observations. I got one \"okay\". No one has sent me any info. I logged in to the database so I could start looking through it myself, realized NO ONE HAS LINKED THEIR ACCOUNT TO THE CLASS DATABASE OR ADDED ANY DATA. What the *fuck* do I do.\n\nIt's supposed to be comparative (what data did we have in common, what were the differences, etc) so it's not like I can really write it with just my own information. I'm really fucking done talking to the group and I'm thinking of emailing the TA again but I'm scared of retaliation, since I have to work with this group until December and unless I'm able to switch I'll just piss everyone off. Do I send an honest message to the group? How can I even fix this before midnight?",

I'm talking be extremely vocal about their lack of interest, whether via text or voice note.and don't hold back.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learnt in college, it's that it's just you and yourself at the end of the day who need to get that degree!",
