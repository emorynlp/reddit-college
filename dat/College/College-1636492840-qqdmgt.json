      "text": "Go to class, you might be tempted to skip since your parents aren't around and many dont require attendance but its a bad habit to start that only gets worse and will eventually hurt your GPA.\n\nBe prepared to study more, a lot of people have a rough transition because they're used to how little effort you have to put in course work for high school.\n\nLearn basic stuff if you haven't yet like doing laundry, ironing clothes, cooking, etc. No parents there to do it for you.",
