  "text": "Pre-Covid I was an A B honor-roll student during virtual I bombed every class, barely passing and some classes I just straight up failed, I\u2019m talking 60-65 and even still going back into real school I\u2019m not doing great at all I\u2019m not failing anything anymore but I can\u2019t get my grades over a 70 and now my weighted gpa is a fucking 1.7 I\u2019m a Jr now almost done with my first semester back and there is no way in hell that I will be able to bring all of my grades up to even a b range. I\u2019m taking 4 core classes and an elective this semester and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "I never ever recommend taking a break from college, but I\u2019m going to be frank, you might be the exception. \n\nDo not take this as any kind of judgement. It isn\u2019t meant to be that. You are just functionally a human being, and having a really hard time. So stop. Take a breath. Ask if you can return in a year. Go work, write some short stories, get healthy, see a therapist, but take a hard break from nosing your books. \n\nThis might not be financially okay. If that is the case then don\u2019t follow this advice. Instead, see if you can take some \u201csofter\u201d classes. Maybe take a halftime schedule. Just do what you can. \n\nBest of luck to you friend.",
