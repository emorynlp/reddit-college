  "text": "I did extra credit over the semester, and on one of them I got an 8/20 and my grade went DOWN. But remember... this is EXTRA work I'm doing in the class that I didn't have to do and my grade went down for getting a bad grade on it. It makes no sense to me but idk if I'm out of touch here. Doesn't make sense that doing extra work would end up being detrimental.",
