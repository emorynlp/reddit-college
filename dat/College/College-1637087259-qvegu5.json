  "title:": "Is taking 20 Credits/Semester a bad idea?",
  "text": "Because a few of my credits couldn't transfer & my school some of its dropping courses, I'd need to take 20 credits this semester and a few over the summer in order to receive my degree on time.\n\nThe classes are fairly easy & most are remote/distance learning-\n\n2 business electives (Intro To Business & Business Ethics),\n\n2 IT classes(Java & Intro to Info Technology) ,\n\nAlgebra, Trigonometry, and a single credit Geology lab class.\n\n7 Total classes but at least 4-5 of them out of 7 seem pretty free.\n\nCurrently, I have no job & I'm doing fine handling 15 credits this semester. I feel like I could probably do it since these classes look easy, just wanted to hear everyone else thoughts!\n\nThanks!",
