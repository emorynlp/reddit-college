  "text": "I'm not even sure if this goes here but I didn't know where else to turn. I'm currently a sophomore in college and have just gotten my grades for the semester back. Awful doesn't even begin to describe them. 3 A's, 2 C's, and 1 F. This is my first F in college but a majority of my grades so far have already been C's, followed by B's and few D's. My gpa is now just a 3.0. I still have 2 and half years to bring my gpa up, I know. But it all just seems like it'll be an uphill battle and won't be worth it. For my entire college experience so far I have been isolated and unmotivated. I went from being a fairly good student in high school to the worse student in my college (this hasn't been proven or anything, I'm just very sure of it). I don't know what to do. Even if I make all A's from here on out, I'll only graduate college with a 3.4, 3.5 if I'm really lucky. For all the drive and passion I thought I had to do well in college despite the circumstances (college during covid, going to low ranked public school, etc) and eventually go to a top law school, it seems that I might just be doomed to end up a bum and never follow my passions at all.\n\nGive it to me straight, please. I can't take any lies or sugarcoating. Is law school officially off the table for me? Should I drop out completely?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have dropped out, what are you doing now? Is everything okay? Do you plan on going back to college someday?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think you should give up since a 3.0 is still pretty good (probably not good enough for competitive law schools). Like u/DepressyFanficReader said, you can retake the course that you got an F in and replace that with a better grade. If your goal is law school, I\u2019d try talking to some people who are familiar with law school admissions to get a better idea of what your chances are. It\u2019s a holistic process so they don\u2019t just look at grades, but rather your entire profile.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to sit down and reflect on what went wrong this time and how you can do better next time.",

      "text": "honest to god I feel you.  \n\n\nI want to be a forensic pathologist. It means that I have to get into medschool... This semester I finished with Cs in all my classes except the stupid first-aid training. It fucking sucks and I am so disappointed in myself. I just got lucky to not have failed. But jesus it's hard staying motivated.   \n\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is just ignore it. Move on... I'm not even looking past one semester at a time. Just trying to get the credits I need... and focus on that and then maybe move on from that. I hope to transfer after next semester so... we'll see how that works out :')",

You don't need to go to Harvard to be a good/successful lawyer. \n\nI will say go talk to a lawyer before becoming one though. My girlfriend was steered away from it by a firm of lawyers telling her not to do it because it sucks.\n\nRegardless, you got this. Keep moving.",
