Like monopolies, oligopolies and so on. \n\nMacroeconomics is about the big picture, GDP, imports and exports, etc. hate it. \n\nBut I am only taking them because I have to. Otherwise I would keep my distance from both haha",

I understand what goes on in Cellular respiration more than how a marginal cost curve and a variable cost curve relate to a businesses longevity. It's simply a matter of interest. \n\nAnd to answer your question: go with macro first.",
