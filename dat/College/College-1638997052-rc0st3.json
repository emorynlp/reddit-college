              "text": "A financial advisor can help with filling out the FAFSA! All you need are official documents such as taxes, pay stubs, etc of your parents and yours if you work. Depending on how much money your family makes, your tuition can be mostly covered! Have you ever been part of a reduced/free meal program? Are you considered low income? If so, your FAFSA will help cover a large chunk of tuition. An advisor can also help with scholarships! All you need to do is google scholarships online and apply! They can depend on your major, your background (such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, etc), or other factors.",

It\u2019ll ask you to create a login/password and then tells you how to fill out whichever forms you need. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not trying to be mean when I say this\u2026 but if you feel like it\u2019s too complicated/time-consuming, etc. to do the forms that will actually PAY for your college; you may want to reconsider going to college altogether then. Bc college itself is going to be a lot more complicated, time-consuming, hard, etc. than doing a FAFSA form \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
