      "text": "I mainly use word for studying by making study guides through the semester which I can review for the final. Personally, I think the most important part of a note taking platform is how good its equation system is. Word has a wonderful system that lets you use latex and also look up symbols from a really well made list. It also formats the equations to look nice and professional in the file. Some aspects could be better but it is much better than google docs and much more intuitive than using a latex only program. I\u2019d definitely love having a good equation handling system in any note taking app.",
