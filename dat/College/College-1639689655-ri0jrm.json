  "title:": "Doubting my abilities in my major",
  "text": "So, I\u2019m majoring in Radio, Television and Film. My friends at home are HUGE film buffs. The know every director and all of their trademarks, they know how to analyze movies down to the bone, and are super pretentious in their opinions on film. I am most definitely not like this. Out of this friend group, I\u2019m the only one that chose to go into film because in high school, I took a TV/Media class. I fell in love with editing media, and I ended up being executive producer of the school news program. It\u2019s been a nagging thought in the back of my mind that I shouldn\u2019t be doing what I\u2019m doing because I\u2019m not like them. I don\u2019t know many directors, nor do I have an easy time breaking down movies and their themes. I love editing. I love working with cameras \u2014 I\u2019m no director or visionary. I\u2019m embarrassed by this, and I have no backup plan. Film is a pretentious field, and I just want to save myself the embarrassment and judgement of being clueless when it comes to this. Am I being too hard on myself or should I actually consider finding another major?",
