      "text": "At my university an Incomplete means that you will finish the requirements of the class by the end of the next semester. Profs can handle it differently in terms of what you might need to do to finish. When I give students Incompletes they still need to do everything for the class- all assignments, quizzes/exams, essays, etc that they didn\u2019t complete in the actual class. \n\nI am not sure what you mean by postponing exams. People usually decide to take an Incomplete late in the semester, it\u2019s not something you would plan out ahead of time.",

I have a pretty severe illness that flared up 3 weeks ago and is affecting my ability to carry on as well as I should. Not sure if I should continue as usual, or if skipping the midterm would auto-grant me a zero.",
