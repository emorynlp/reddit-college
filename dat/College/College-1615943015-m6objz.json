I only lived 2 miles from campus, but I still spent almost an hour commuting each day (30 min shuttle commute including waiting times bc of very limited parking options). I\u2019ve been really enjoying that extra hour per day since I\u2019m taking a super full schedule.\n\nI have a chronic illness and online is more accessible in every way. If I\u2019m feeling too sick to get out of bed I can attend class from bed. I used to be in so much pain sitting in certain lecture hall desks, now I can sit in my set up at home. I can use a heating pad during class, or pillows, or put my legs up if I feel faint. And then if I\u2019m not feeling well and can\u2019t concentrate or attend class things are recorded or notes are posted that would have been on a blackboard before. \n\nI also make so much more out of the time between classes. I normally lay down during my lunch break now, sometimes in a hammock outside. I can cook myself the meal I want any time. I never have to worry about not having the right books to work during time I\u2019d be stuck on campus or whatever.\n\nSo yeah, this situation was better for me I\u2019m basically every way.",

I know not everyone is fortunate to have a safe and stable home situation, and my home situation was endangered at some point. But I think I really needed a break and it\u2019s going to be hard to adjust to in person classes.\nI mean to be fair what im getting from this whole thing is I really needed a break even if I denied it, and I do WAY better when i learn material on my own and don\u2019t have to do many tedious assignments. Needless to say this has been an interesting year, and i think the varying experiences indicate that keeping an online option should be seriously considered.",
