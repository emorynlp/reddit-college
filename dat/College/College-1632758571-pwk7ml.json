  "title:": "What GPA is \"good enough\" for internships if you go to an Ivy League?",
  "text": "Up to this point in life, B has always meant Bad and C stood for Crap, but I need to drop this toxic mindset for the sake of my social life/mental health.\n\nEveryone around me is super smart. They breeze through assignments with ease and still have time to hang out with friends. I feel the only reason I got into this school is because I sacrificed my social life to study. I don't think I have the discipline/will to do that anymore.\n\nSurely there's some leniency in hiring as far as grades are concerned if you go to a prestigious school. What GPA would make employers raise an eyebrow if an applicant came from an Ivy (that isn't Harvard)?\n\nNot trying to intern at Bain or Goldman Sachs or anything, just a regular 9-5ish office job.\n\nThank you!!\n\n*Note: I tried looking this up, but whenever I search \"GPA\" and \"Ivy\" together, the results are about admissions.*",

Companies with a minimum GPA requirement will apply that requirement to all applicants equally. Attending a more prestigious college should give you more/ better job opportunities than if you attended a less prestigious college, but that's a separate thing entirely. \n\nI think a 3.5+ GPA will be viewed as good enough by the vast majority of prospective employers, if that's the answer you're looking for. Plenty of companies set the bar at 3.0+ or don't care at all about your GPA and will instead look at other parts of your resume.",

      "text": "Not sure about internships but for jobs after college or non internship jobs in college, they usually don't care. Imo don't even put it on your resume unless it's above a 3.5. Your network is far more important than your GPA",
