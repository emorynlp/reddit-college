  "title:": "How to find friends and things to do when I don\u2019t like getting drunk and partying?",
  "text": "What the title says. Still want to have fun and do things with people. But I go to a very heavy party and drinking school where the culture is to go and get drunk all of the time. Very difficult to find people who share my views and values. Like doing things like baking, movies, board games, etc and am kind of an introvert, but still want to have friends and do things with people without sacrificing my health and what I believe in",
