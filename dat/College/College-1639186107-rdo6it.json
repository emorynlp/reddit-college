  "text": "I\u2019m thinking about applying to be an RA next year but i\u2019m mainly just concerned about how being on call could mess with my sleep schedule. I normally like to go to bed around 11 and get up at 7 this semester. I know some RA\u2019s are on call on the weekdays from the evening all the way to the morning and i\u2019m just concerned about how that could effect my sleep if I have a class in the morning or something. Thanks",

Plus at my school we only have 1 day of duty each week (plus about 3 weekends every semester). My suggestion is to avoid shifts on the nights before morning classes.",
