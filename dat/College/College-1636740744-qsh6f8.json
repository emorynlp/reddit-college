  "title:": "Cheating in University",
  "text": "I started university in 2020 and have done 4 programming subjects;\n\n1000 - Intro to Programming\n1010 - Fundamentals of Comp Sci\n2010 - Data structs & Algos\n2100 - Systems programming\n\nEarly 2020 is when Covid hit, and I really feel like if you give the chance for students to cheat and achieve a good mark, 85+/100 would take the chance to cheat and get good grades\u2026\n\nI really feel like I\u2019ve messed up my journey in learning computer science because I cheated hard in 1000, 1010, and most of 2010 - so my knowledge of fundamental programming and the basics are just absent-limited. Then I had to struggle learning harder concepts which built on the fundamentals which somewhat forced me to cheat in 2010. \n\nI REALLY regret cheating, and wish my dumb old self would\u2019ve just focused and studied smarter, harder, and really tried to understand fundamental concepts. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone else (Uni/college students in particular) are feeling the same way, or are in the same boat.",
