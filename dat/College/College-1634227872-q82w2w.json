  "text": "I'm really starting to struggle in one of my major classes and I've been wanting to go to office hours to ask my professor for help, but I feel like I know so little that I don't even know where to start and how to ask her for help :(( Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice for situations like this?",

      "text": "Most of the time someone will help you make a start without judgment or rancor  if you just say this.\n\nSometimes you will get a jerk who is either not helpful or is helpful but in a eye-rolling way.\n\nWhich do you want to do more?  Get help, be happy and sucessful or never have anyone roll their eyes at you?\n\nSeriously,  sometimes you have the bite the bullet and do what you need to do even if you risk the transient disapproval of a virtual stranger.\n\nI am being very strong about this becasue I have seen so many students so much the worse off (soooo much) for reasons like this",
