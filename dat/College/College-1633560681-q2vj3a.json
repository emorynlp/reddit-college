  "text": "Let me start this off by saying I started college a few years ago at Florida State when I was 17. I lived on campus for two semesters, and I spent most of that time sleeping, eating, and studying in my dorm (except for req\u2019d study hours I had to get in the library or firstgen building). I\u2019d go to the dining halls and even sit around campus and talk to whoever walked by.. but after the months there I had zero friends. \n\nNow it might be obvious, but I rlly don\u2019t know how to make friends\u2026 like in high school it was easy cause I seen the same 30 ppl at the same time everyday, and you eventually make friends with whoever you sit with. But for some reason, college was different for me. I def talked to the people I sat next to in classes, but it never went anywhere past talking in class. I don\u2019t think I ever even got anybody\u2019s number in class to share notes etc. After my second semester at FSU I said fuck it and left. From there I did comm. college online, then I transferred to USF St Pete. And it was the same there. Talk to whoever I could, eat alone and continually have no friends. \n\nI say all this to say\u2026 Im going to live back on campus at USF Tampa in January and I\u2019m nervous as shit. I can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s gonna be the same as it was the last two times. Being new again, learning another campus, trying to be social\u2026 it\u2019s a lot to think about\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far lol, do ya have any advice? What I\u2019ve been doing is every time I get anxious I tell myself it\u2019s gonna be different this time (buttttt I can\u2019t be sure of that \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe)",

      "text": "I'd just suggest trying to be more social than you already are. If you want someone to eat with, then ask your classmate, roommate, etc. if they want to grab food with you. If your classmates aren't creating group chats for the class to share notes, etc. then you can either ask someone to create one or create one yourself. Keep being social, introduce yourself, let people know who you are and what your goals are at the university, and don't give up. I hope you have a better experience on campus this time. :)",
