  "text": "I know this might sound a little different and weird compared to what most college freshman think but I have online classes right now and tbh I\u2019d rather have it this way for as long as I can. My social anxiety is kinda high, I get extremely nervous to talk to others and I feel like it\u2019s made me antisocial. Also i get to stay home w family cause my college is 4 hours away and i wouldn\u2019t be able to commute everyday or even every week. Also online classes are less stressful cause i just study and then do whatever I want. I\u2019m also the kind of person who just wants to get my degree and leave. Idk why but im not excited for college. Am I wrong for thinking like this?",

I can just do the work whenever I want and not have to worry about anything else. I guess it is less personal somewhat, but the professor is at least making the class fun by having us do interesting activities for our weekly assignments.\n\nOn the other hand, I also have a few synchronous online classes (like, we meet on Zoom regularly) and those ones make me just as anxious if not more anxious than a regular class would :/ Plus there's more strict deadlines on those...\n\nBut, yeah, if online school is working for you, then that's great! More and more things are moving online these days, and that's not a bad thing -- like you said, it's really great & a lot more flexible for people with long commutes or who have to work while going to school.",

I will say that the one thing I dislike is that I don't feel like most of the professors teach anything, especially the older ones. This could be because they are used to teaching in person, but not having lectures in person where you can discuss the subject matter in person really hinders the actual learning experience for me. That said it definitely changes professor to professor. I was at a community college and those professors were great and really active in your studies if you wanted them to be, but now that I transferred to a university 3 out of my 4 professors barely give you lectures and either don't get back to you or are completely disorganized on brightspace. I too want to just get it done and get out. It's not a bad plan.",

Additionally there's usually way less than three feet of social distancing. I've heard some people focus better, but from all the people playing games during lecture or doing other stuff on their laptop I'd say that this is a dubious claim.",

I think [Study.com](https://Study.com) would be a great option for you. You learn at your own pace, no set schedule, and only costs $199.99 a month. You can get two courses done in that time. I wish I knew about this sooner as I have received my Bachelor's by completing their courses. I also have a referral code for 30% off your first three months which is JeniaMurguia\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",
