  "text": "I have been in college for 6 years already and my parents have been waiting for me to finish. I applied for graduation this semester and got to walk the stage but they dont actually give you that piece of paper until the grades come out. This one class , the teacher had a point system set up but he cut out some homework and quizzes which changed up the points but I have no idea how that is now. I walked the stage, cried with my parents, got told they were proud of me and even got a celebratory dinner.  Now I am super scared and dont know what to do if I didnt pass this class.. UGH God im so scared",

      "text": "Not sure how other schools or majors work but at my school in the engineering department, they dont fail seniors in 500 level classes unless u really f up(i.e. way below average, missing major assignments or exams). As long as u show up and turn something in u will pass. \n\nSchools have a major incentive to pass seniors through to keep grad rates up and they understand that seniors are mainly focusing on interviews and looking for their first real job. If u have a job lined up and they fail u that would be a major hassle so they dont want to do that.",
