At least, that's allowed at UC Boulder. Just make sure the courses you take are transferable, but since you said you want to take gen eds it should have universal transferability.",

          "text": "That's a cool option. Do you know if they allow you to defer scholarships?\n\nI think something common and unfortunate is students who get a scholarship to a 4 year, feel like they should go to take advantage of it, lose it after their first year (sometimes getting minimal credit due to dropped/failed classes), but then they're stuck. If you could keep scholarships while doing gen eds at a CC that'd be huge!",

              "text": "Honestly, I'm not sure. I ended up staying in Texas cause out of state tuition was too costly, even with financial aid and scholarship I was still 8K short on meeting tuition and fees. Which is why I looked into deferring and going to a community college instead, but ultimately my top choice school sent me an offer of acceptance a couple weeks after Boulder did through an engineering pathway via community college. \n\nAnyway, I think scholarship deferment depends on what the qualifications are. There's a TON of incoming freshman scholarships but minimal transfer scholarships. If your scholarship isn't dependent on having no college credit then I'd think deferring is possible. Honestly I think college credit shouldn't matter when getting a scholarship cause I know several people who've got AP or dual enrollment credits while in high school who come in right after graduating hs and are considered sophomores credit wise.",
