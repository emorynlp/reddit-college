  "text": "I'm going to school for a computer science degree with an endgoal of using it in law enforcement for either the state or a federal agency. However, in the meantime I want to find some sort of paid work that allows me to help people instead of a retail job or something. \n\nI'm early in college and am still finishing up prereqs and I don't really know coding as of right now but I was wondering what ideas there were of types of humanitarian jobs that would hire a college sophomore.\n\nIf this is an inappropriate question I will remove. Thank you!",

      "text": "If you wanna make $$$ look into r/CSMajors, those internships are definitely hard to get but pay $$$.\n\nI would be a bit careful about making abstract goals like using your CS degree for law enforcement or federal agency. These kinds of positions generally don\u2019t exist (assuming you mean police dept).\n\nIf you are talking about interning at one of the 3 letter agencies then those spots are pretty competitive, and generally require a pretty solid resume + extensive background check.\n\nIn general I would say that you have one of the most coveted degrees out there, I would highly recommend against using one of your available summers to do retail. I would intern at a startup or something similar. If you say that you cannot code then learn how to code, pick a language (I would suggest python) and go to leetcode.com and picks a few problems to tackle.\n\nJust my 2cents",

As in, it's hard to get the degree cause the field is competitive, or people will be especially on the lookout for people like me w/ the degree?",

If you join a big Bay Area tech company out of college you can easily be making 150k+ as TC.\n\nTo find where to intern, look up handshake.com - your school should have one and start mass applying.\n\nPython bc it has a lot of syntactical as well as other advantages that make writing code cleaner and quicker.\n\nIn general just go on the aforementioned subreddit and read a bunch of stuff - search up how to intern at FAANG and get started.",
