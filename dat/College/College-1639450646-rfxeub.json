  "text": "So I didn't do so well on my chemistry final and got a 75.8%. Our grade scale is 83-76 is a C, and 75-68 is a D. So even though I didn't do so well, you'd think it'd be rounded up to that 76% which would make me feel a little better....but no. Ever had that professor that makes you throw your hands up like WHY!!?!? WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS!!!!????",

      "text": "Feel like we\u2019ve all had them and yeah, it sucks. Definitely feel you on this one. I\u2019ve had luck reasoning with good attendance and showing that I corrected missed points but it depends on how strict they are.\n\nThe reasoning one of my professors gave for this is if they round up why not just set the grade lower in the first place. And if they round up 75.8% then 75.7%, 75.6%, and so on also want their grade rounded up. Cutoff has to be somewhere in the end.",

      "text": "Yep, had one of them. Nice personally, but took himself way too seriously (especially considering this was community college). Got a 89.5% and even did the extra credit which he said would allow him to round grades up half a percentage. He didn't round it. I got a B instead of an A. Later, he told me no one ever gets an A on that class but that I came the closest. A nice compliment, but still a nasty move.\n\nI never understood why he did it. He really liked me, said I was his best student ever and wrote glowing letters of recommendation. He had a PhD, but it wasn't like he came from Harvard and got stuck in teaching community college (he didn't even graduate from a top-100 school). I have never found a reason for him to be so stern and petty, despite otherwise liking me.\n\nNot rounding up from a 75.8% to a 76% is even worse though, not only is it only 0.2%, it is also between a failing D and a passing C. Maybe you'll get lucky and he will drop a low assignment or curve the grade? Probably not, but we can always dream!",

          "text": "Ach, that's cruel. Toying with you with that extra credit.\n\nLuckily, I originally had an A in the class. The final dropped me to a 90.69%, which I'm sure he is saying is a 90%. Although that really doesn't matter though because a 90% or 91% is still a B on the grading scale lol",
