  "text": "I'm not a college student but I don't know where else to really put this. Im a recent grad, graduated a year ago. I'm an architecture major and I actually had a lot of fun in studio designing buildings and playing around with Adobe programs and even building models. I got a job sort of in the field, im a drafter which is probably the pretty standard first job for someone who wants to be an architect. It is an incredibly boring 8 hours a day staring at a screen doing mind numbingly boring work. It is highly technical which is alright, but im not really the type to like stuff with step by step instructions and a list of \"standards\" to follow. I like open ended programs that i can just figure out as I go and arrive at the same conclusion in multiple ways. I went into architecture so I could design and do something artistic. I know things take time but im incredibly impatient and hate the idea of being stuck in a dead end job. Is there another kind of job i could do with this degree or perhaps another field of work altogether? Maybe it's a necessary evil but I'd rather just cut through the bullshit and get to the good stuff. I have considered being a freelance artist on the side or tattooing",
