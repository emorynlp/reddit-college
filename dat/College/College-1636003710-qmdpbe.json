  "text": " \n\nSorry in advance for formatting errors and whatnot, I've never posted anything on reddit before. I have nobody in my life that wouldn't feel shameful to say to this to so I've turned to you guys.\n\nI just started my first year and I am already failing two of the hardest courses I am taking. I am currently in the Engineering program at my school and it is pretty competitive. I have always had trouble doing work and focusing and it has gotten worse over high school. That being said, I felt that I had an opportunity to turn over a new leaf with this new chapter of my life.\n\nIt started out well: I was attending all of my classes, getting assignments done, and I felt good about being in college. Then I was hit with two roadblocks. The first was getting sick worse than I have been in at least 5 years. Not Covid but circumstantially it didn't make a difference, University confined me to my room until I was better. I missed a Calc 2 quiz, I didn't do homework that week, and it lasted 6 or 7 days. The following week I attempted to clean it up, and did a half job. Prof. said the quiz could be my drop grade and the other ones were understanding of the missing work. I ended up in a situation I have seen all too often with my classes, where I felt as though I could never sit down and do the damn work.\n\nThen came the second roadblock, the real kicker. I had done an intellectual/psychological exam a couple of weeks prior to classes. Two weeks following my self-quarantined stint, my mother indicated that she had received the overview of my results. She told me that I had been diagnosed with ADD and Level 1 Autism(proximal to what they used diagnose as Asperger's). I know that she was choosing to be transparent with me but in retrospect this is the kind of thing that should've had a sit-down conversation and a plan to approach. I basically crumbled after that. I didn't go to a single class or do any work for over a week. I have barely pieced myself together enough to go on about my day.\n\nI don't know what to do now because it has been a month and I have dug a whole I can't get out of. I missed a Calc 2 midterm that week I didn't show, I haven't shown my face in Calc since and have thus missed all the quizzes, and I haven't done any significant amount of the work set before be. I just got a D on one of three Exams in Chem and I just might be able to put together a B in that Class if I ace everything else. My engineering professor is the only one who has an inkling of what has transpires and so I think I may be able to make up the work that I have missed. Now I am receiving no response from the psychologists' office regarding official documentation and accommodations so I can't even submit them to the disability resource center at my school.\n\nI'm at a loss and there doesn't seem to be anything that I could do to salvage this mess. I know that intellectually capable of doing everything I missed given the right resources, I even think I could learn everything I haven't so far and complete all the assessments and assignments that I initially missed if I was given the opportunity, but that would require help to structure myself in a way I haven't been able to do myself. As of right now my highest grade is a 79 in Chem that will go down soon and there is basically a month left for me to turn this around.\n\nAre there actions I can take to reach this goal or should I look into leaving school altogether and restarting at a later date when I have all the tools I need to succeed?",
