  "text": "Ehhh Im currently in my first year of engineering and man its stressful for me. Im not stressed because im behind courses (im not)  but im afraid Im not good enough for college. I passed and did well on my first exams. I even outperformed most of my class but im still scared of failing courses and making it harder for myself until I eventually dropout. I've always been a good student and never stresed alot in high school. \n\nI guess what I want someone to say is that its usually not people like me who dropout but those who put no effort.",

The engineering students who do well on the first couple tests only fail if they stop doing any work including taking tests after that. \n\nMeanwhile, look up \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d in case that\u2019s applicable, and Google for \u201cYOUR SCHOOL NAME counseling services\u201d and get on the waitlist.",

          "text": "thanks prof. I've heard about imposter syndrome and read some about it. I think the Perfectionists type fits me as I usually have high pressure on myself. Probably rooted in my family expecting so much from me.\n\nAs for counseling I did meet someone but they always say the same thing. \"This is normal, excersize, think of this instead, have hobbies\". Never helps but then again, there is never a magical way for my problems to disappear.",

You'll have good tests and you'll have bad ones, you might even fail a course but as long as you keep at it you'll get there. In high school I only got A's and B's, in college I got my first C and in medical school I had two tests back to back where I scored 95% (top 3  students) on the first test and literally bottom 3 students on the 2nd test (54%).\n\nThe people I met that dropped out were ones that gave up. You'll be surprised how many people make it just by trying til the end.",

You\u2019ll be okay just keep moving forward but don\u2019t have a dropout mindset because you have worked so hard to get where you are now. Remember you are a human being and school is temporary. Get uncomfortable to get comfortable! Best of luck !",
