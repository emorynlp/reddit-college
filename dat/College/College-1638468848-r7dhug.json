  "title:": "Can you get an extension for mental health reasons and if so, how? CW: Suicidal ideations",
  "text": "For context, I've had undiagnosed depression and suicidal thoughts since I was like 11. I only recently started seeing a therapist for anxiety and an eating disorder 2-3 years ago, but had to stop because of college and have been off my meds because I can't even get a refill of my meds because of insurance problems and moving to a different state/city. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stress of final projects and papers is really getting to me and I'm starting to fail miserably. In my math class, I used to do rly well and get tons of extra credit but on my last quiz I got like a 33%. I have 2 papers and a spanish project due this next Wednesday but have barely started on them because I can't focus on anything because I've lost my will to live. I'm torn between checking myself into a hospital so I don't kill myself and getting some help, but if I do that, then I probably won't have time for my papers and project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a freshman and this is my first semester ever, so I don't know how to email my professor(s) and ask for an extension and what the requirements are for obtaining one.  Does anyone have any suggestions? My professors are very nice but I'm scared they won't believe me when I say I need an extension. I'm also already looking into getting student mental health services on campus",

      "text": "You can reach out to student mental health services and ask them about accommodations and extensions. You should email your professor and tell them you are having some mental health struggles and need extra time.\n\nAlso, if things get worse you can either take an Incomplete for your classes and finish the work over break, or you can take a mental health leave of absence, where you will take a semester or more off and work with a therapist until you are ready to return.\n\nHang in there and talk to someone. If you're worried about harming yourself go to the emergency room or to your student health center asap.",
