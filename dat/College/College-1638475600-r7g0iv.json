  "text": "Within this past year alone I lost my dad, sister, grandma, uncle, and two cousins (surprisingly only one from Covid). I should have taken off this semester, but I did not want to fall behind and I figured I would have been able to find a way to push through this bullshit. Usually, I am a A and B student, but I can barely hold a passing grade now. I never thought I would have to write an email like this and I have no idea how to. Any help would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Hi, Professor ______,\n\nI wanted to reach out to you about being able to submit my late work for partial or full credit. This semester I lost my sister & dad to covid along with 4 extended family members. I know I should\u2019ve reached out to you sooner but I was trying to push through and get my work done- which wasn\u2019t the case. If I cannot submit the late work for credit, I understand. \n\nPlease get back to me when you are available, I can also come in to speak with you during office hours if you would prefer an alternate solution. \n\nBest,\n\nDannyKarate \n\n12/02/21\n\n\n(also set it to high importance)",

      "text": "That's really rough. I'm sorry to hear that. I think this is above the professor's head especially because a lot of them are use to hearing excuses of deaths (as horribly morbid as that is). Is this an issue in all of your classes or just this one? I'd reach out to your advisor and Student Services (or whatever the equivalent is at your school). They're set up to provide you with a lot more support and can compel instructors to offer you accommodations.\n\nIn either case, you do have to be prepared for them to suggest that you medically withdraw or take Incompletes for now. But, those are people that can help you so loop them in and get their read on the situation. They may be able to offer you support you didn't know you needed or wanted also (e.g., reducing the number of assignments that need to be made up, etc).",
