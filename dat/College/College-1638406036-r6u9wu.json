  "text": "The reason I ask is I live in FL (sophmore HS) and we have bright futures scholarships, but I\u2019m interested in leaving the state for college. One school I\u2019ve looked into is University of Alabama which gives good merit scholarships. Anyway, I still have a lot of time before this becomes a priority.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a freshman who lives in Oklahoma but decided to go to college in Pennsylvania. \n\nIt was definitely not a good financial decision, nor was it good when it comes to keeping in touch with friends and family. Spending Thanksgiving completely alone in my dorm eating some instant Mac and Cheese because I don\u2019t have the resources to get back home is kind of depressing. \n\nHowever it is a fun and new experience. It also gave me a deeper sense of independence. \n\nThen again, was it practical? No, probably not.",
