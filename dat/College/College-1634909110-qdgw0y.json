  "text": "I am in my 2nd year. One of my classes is introduction to marketing, and I do not have problem with the class itself, or what I have to learn or anything.\n\nBut I have a problem with our professor. He will start talking about marketing, but here and there, every few minutes, he will throw in some racist stereotype. He is also pretty sexist, saying how women can not do certain things men can and stuff like that, and he even objectified certain female students :/ He said a lot of other awful, inappropriate stuff too, it made me feel sick.\n\nWe have to attend the classes though, so I have to listen to his crap for 3 hours every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is that where I am from, its kind of common, and I can not do anything about it, it seems.",
