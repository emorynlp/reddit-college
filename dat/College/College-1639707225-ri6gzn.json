That\u2019s the minimum payment.\"\n\nIt's because she went to law school. Debt related to law school and medical school is not the norm. It's high but income is also high.\n\n\"What do you pay a month for your student loans?\"\n\nMinimum monthly payment is never a healthy way to look at a loan. Never go with the payment plan they provide, it costs way too much to spread it out like that. You should always focus on the total loan amount. I haven't started paying mine yet, the interest is still frozen so there isn't a good reason to, but when it starts to accrue I will probably pay 10% of the original balance each month and have it done in a year. Interest-wise it's 2.75% and I'll probably end up with around $200 in financing costs.\n\nIt's $5-6k outstanding total. I could pay the entire thing off right now but with such a low rate I just prefer to have that cash on hand this early in my career.",
