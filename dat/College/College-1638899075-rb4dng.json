  "title:": "Trouble picking what school to transfer to after almost 2 years at CC",
  "text": "Hello everyone, so I\u2019m from Southern California and I\u2019ve been attending a local junior college for almost 2 years now. My major is in psychology, psychology for transfer specifically, and I\u2019m having a super hard time deciding on what school to apply to.. Another factor in this decision are the deadlines to apply and I\u2019m not completely sure how to even apply..like I said, I\u2019m attending a community college and the enrollment process is a lot easier than a standard university. Can anyone help me out w this a bit? I was thinking maybe a Cal State college or UC Riverside?",

      "text": "Well, the UC and Cal State deadline's have passed, so if you were looking to transfer next fall you missed your chance!\n\nIf you live in California, both the UC and CSU system are great colleges and you basically can't go wrong attending either. I'd recommend you research your program at each university in their respective systems and find one that matches what you.\n\nYou can apply to basically as many as you want, barring application fees, so you don't really have to \"pick\" until you've gotten your collection of acceptance letters back.",

              "text": "2023 Spring is still an option, yeah! However, not all colleges take specific majors for Spring, it's a bit of a different beast, so make sure to do your research.\n\nDo you use assist.org? It will let you know every class you need to transfer from California CC to UC/CSU. It's 100% a good idea to look at each school you want to apply/program's articulation agreement with your community college. You can find it on there and it's basically the bible for transferring.",
