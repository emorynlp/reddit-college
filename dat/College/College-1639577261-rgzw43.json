  "text": "I have my thesis proposal defense tomorrow. I really feel nervous and I feel like crying because I am socially anxious and my weakness is public speaking (and speaking in general). \nHow should I prepare? What should I do to feel more at ease and confident? What questions should I expect?\n\nThank you please help me \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "I\u2019ve found that the best way to prepare for any type of presentation is to practice talking out loud in front of a mirror, multiple times. It makes you feel more comfortable about what you are saying and helps with memorization. Also if on presentation day you get nervous, if you can get away with it, look over the shoulder/above the head of your audience so to avoid eye contact. Or better yet let you gaze wander from one listener to another, that at least make seem engaging.\n\nHope this helps! Good luck with your defense.",

      "text": "Look, they call these things \"defenses\" as if it's going to be confrontational, but they're not.  The defense functions as a meeting to improve your work, not as a way to tear you down or create obstacles.  Everyone in that room is on your side.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard to know what questions to expect because it differs by field and by project, but I'd make sure (1) that you know how to argue for the \\*significance\\* of the project (why is it important?) and (2) that you're ready to discuss your methods in depth (why did you choose this method?  how are you defining your variables, etc. --- again depending on your field).",
