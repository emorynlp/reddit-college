  "text": "Hey everyone, I\u2019d like your opinion on how to proceed accurately. I just finished my Bachelor(+2 years master) in Cse in Greece. Ideally I\u2019d like to go into game development with some AI/Machine learning as well as those are the subjects that were included in my thesis. I\u2019m searching for a masters degree in Europe, as UK and USA are too expensive. Also I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m putting a lot of restrictions to this, but I\u2019d like the master to be 1 year, but if something good comes up I\u2019m okay with 2 years as well. Do you guys have any suggestions on what universities , countries and departments I\u2019d need to check on?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m interested in Game development programming mostly. AI in a more practical approach is an area I also in interested in. Definitely not research and too much theory as my BA was full of those. The combination of those too would be ideal but it filters the results too much I\u2019d say. Another department that I secondly like is software engineering, but mostly as a tool to develop apps on my own, so studying it seems kinda irrelevant as I will definitely approach it on my own. \n\nThanks in Advance , Alec",
