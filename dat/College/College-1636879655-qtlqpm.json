  "text": "My uni has this method of calculating GPA, and the requirements for both needed to be met to get a particular class of honours. The major GPA is calculated only with courses for school/major requirements.\n\nThis really helps if you suck at some common core subjects (like me, I absolutely suck in Chinese and was forced to take a course designed for students with local qualifications despite myself doing an international one, which is much easier, so I took it early to get it out of the way ASAP). I just focus more on school/major requirement subjects, and try to get better grades in them. For example, I am on track for an A in my python programming course (hoping to chase for an A+) and an A- in calc 2, and I hope to get myself a B+ at least in my materials course taken 2 years early than the suggested study pattern (was 19th/48 in the midterm). Some seniors felt humiliated when they got lower marks than me in that materials course.\n\nI am also on track for a B+ in my mech induction course but I am now hoping to come back with an A-. Let's say that I ended up with a C+ in the Chinese course. This makes up a 3.4 GPA and and a 3.68 major GPA. This still meets the minimum requirement of a first class honours, if I continue at this rate.\n\nDo you think this is a good policy?",
