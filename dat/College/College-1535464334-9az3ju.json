I was in there for an hour before the teacher wrote biology 101 on the board. I was supposed to be in biology 105.\n\nAfter an hour I go to the right class room with some help form people who work at the school. It turned out that I got my school schedule too early and the biology teachers traded class rooms. No one let me know so the only students who knew where the correct room was, were people who got the schedule setup closer to when school started.",

      "text": "Haha, stuff like this happens to me too all the time. And not even on the first day of class! First semester, I had English @ 7:30am. I made it the first few days no problem but like day 4 or 5 for some reason I went and sat in another class for like 10 minutes waiting for my professor to come in before I realized I didn't recognize anyone there. Then it clicked and I sprinted across campus 10 minutes late to my actual class. It was hilarious and my big ass busting into the actual room panting \"I was in the wrong fucking building\" got a few laughs (even from the professor who hated students coming in late, he was a great guy though. Rest in Peace.)\n\nAnother day I just spaced and got to school an hour late, just completely lost track of time and it was during the beginning of a semester where I still didn't know my schedule & room #s by memory. I thought I was like 15 minutes early so I was just waiting outside the classroom door and then all of a sudden the whole class comes walking out after getting dismissed early.\n\nOh and that time I arrived 2 hours late to my anthropology final and missed the entire in-class exam. Luckily half of it was a take-home paper that the professor accepted on the way out. I was totally chilling all morning trying to stay relaxed thinking it was at noon when it was actually at 10am. I swear the professor said it was at 12 a few days beforehand, that's all I could remember. Didn't even occur to me to check the college's schedule.\n\nDon't be ashamed! Thinking back on it, they're just funny stories. Everyone just has those goofy ass moments. I mean EVERYONE. You can ask anyone in your class and I bet at least half have had a similar experience. That's why people find it so funny, to be honest.\n\nJust e-mail your actual professor and let them know what happened, if you have to even just ask the professor whose class you did go to to vouch for you if your actual teacher doesn't believe you. But most professors are pretty understanding about those first few weeks just being hell and a half to navigate.",

In high school to leave your seat without permission was a major sin against the teacher.\n\nIn college, in most classes, you can get up and leave. You could even mumble while leaving, \"Sorry, I'm in the wrong class.\"  You could even walk up to the professor and tell him or her that in a low voice before leaving. You can even leave in the middle to use the restroom if it's an emergency. \n\nYes, call or email your professor.\n\nYou can EVEN show up to class 30 minutes late. Don't make a habit of it, but today, the first day, it would have been OK to show up in the right class 30 or 40 minutes late and then explain to the professor after class what went wrong.\n\n",

I always recommend walking thru the campus a day before you start just to find all your classes and such so you don't panic on your first day. I'm super shy as well so I definitely can see the nightmare in this too though. It's okay to walk out of classes in college no one is going to say anything unless your professor is an asshole pretty much. Like don't sit all class having to pee or miss an important phone call because you don't want to disrupt class with leaving, take care of that stuff so you can actually focus on the lecture / lab. ",
