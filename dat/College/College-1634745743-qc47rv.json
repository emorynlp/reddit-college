  "text": "Hello,\n\nI hope whoever is reading this is doing well. I'm a major in Finance BBA, and I intend to start a business in the next few years. However, I know people that have degrees in music or something unrelated to business and are able to have successful businesses. So I'm asking for whoever has a business, is it necessary/helpful to have a finance degree? I love business and definitely will start my own but I really want to be a psychology major, and if it is possible for me to major in psychology and still be successful in business, that would be awesome.",

      "text": "While entrepreneurs generally need to understand core finance and accounting concepts in order to manage their businesses, a finance degree doesn't include a lot of content that is going to be relevant to the typical start-up founder/ small business owner. \n\nYou don't need a college degree to start a business. If you already have a business plan, you may get more out of working for a successful small business in that field and supplementing your real work experience with books on entrepreneurship topics.",
