  "text": "I have 2 finals from 8am-2:30pm  tomorrow with basically only enough time in between to walk across campus. \n\nThe first one, for Music Theory, is extremely hard and I\u2019m a nervous wreck about it. I\u2019m scraping a B in that class and I want to do well but this test is gonna be the worst. I was up until 3am studying for it last night and I still don\u2019t feel as prepared as I would like.\n\nThe other one is for a History class which I know I have in the bag already (the class is a pretty easy A if you do the reading and speak up in lecture), but one segment of the final involves writing two complete essays and I know I\u2019m going to be exhausted by that point so I hope I can write something coherent lol. \n\nAfter my finals are over I have a 2 hour paid gig so I also need to practice today. \n\nPlease somebody wish me luck, I\u2019m gonna need all the well wishes and encouragement I can get.\n\nEdit: oh and I have a singing final on Saturday and I haven\u2019t practiced vocal exercises at all this week",
