  "text": "Im doing so bad bad in this math class that i just dont know what to do now.\nIt\u2019s too late to withdraw and if i had withdrawed i\u2019d be put at 10 credits. Im taking precalc which is a 4 credit class.\nHeck i\u2019ve really worked my ass off in this class but its just so hard its killing me.\nConsidering im failing, my gpa will end up below a 3.0 which isn\u2019t good since i need my gpa to be above a 3.0 to keep my scholarship.\nI cant even take a winter class even if i fail it cause it wont boost it up to a 3.0 either. I\u2019d basically need a C to have it be up to a 3.0 which isn\u2019t possible since the final exam won\u2019t really make a difference.\nI feel like shit cause my parents are struggling so much with money and have been working their asses off for me just so i can attend college. I used it as motivation but it\u2019s just a struggle when it comes to exams, even if i attend office hours too. \nI just dont know what to do about this now cause they payed a lot for this semester and even if i somehow get to withdraw i wont get any money back.",
