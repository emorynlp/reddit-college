  "text": "hi everyone! (i\u2019m sorry this post is so long) \n\nfor context i\u2019m a current sophomore attending a T10 school in the US studying Economics. i\u2019m also an  international student, therefore i\u2019m on a non immigrant visa. However, recently i\u2019ve been considering a gap year for a couple of reasons: \n\n1. I really badly want to switch my major to CS, however once i complete this semester w my specific course load, i will be on track to pretty much graduate w an economics degree. Therefore this semester is the only chance i have to make that switch if i do want. This would mean leaving the semester halfway and coming back next year to a new course load that would allow me to do CS as my major \n\n2. I\u2019ve lost all motivation to pursue the things that have made me happy in the past ie. working out. Thus i\u2019ve been really really out of shape since I came here w no motivation to actually go back to the gym. I want to continue training and i feel that i need the break to get back into routine for the next year or so. More than that i realized that i do not currently have any hobbies or ways to unwind other than spending my time on the internet, which i hate. I have been developing an interest in music production and sound engineering (which sadly isn\u2019t available at my school) which i would love to pursue and I think the gap year would help me discover this new interest. \n\n3. I have zero motivation to do anything. it\u2019s week 4 and I\u2019ve been skipping classes and not submitting anything in at all or on time. My course work doesn\u2019t give me satisfaction and ik i\u2019m probably going to end up in finance after graduation which is a truth i hate and i\u2019m particularly trying to ignore (given that i\u2019ve been able to secure multiple internships in finance). I hate the world of finance and doubt i\u2019ll be able to survive in corporate america. i honestly thought pursuing an economics degree would set me up on a path of entrepreneurship but that was wrong - there haven\u2019t been any skills i have garnered at all while pursuing economics, which makes me feel as though i am wasting my time doing this fluff degree as many of my friends refer to it. I\u2019m not passionate about it at all, and taking the gap year would help me upskill and switch to CS\n\n4. As mentioned before, i\u2019ve always had dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and building sth worthwhile in the future. However coming into college all that motivation to pursue entrepreneurship faded off once i realised college was basically a feeder into the corporate world and everyone beside me was always trying to get the next internship or trying to work for some big company for compensation . i guess i did get looped into that whole ideation and thus ended up in the college rat race. I have no problem working for a company at all (i do reckon i\u2019ll need some work experience before launching my own venture) but i fear that the mentality i have garnered as per now might see me in the workforce in 60 years to come. Taking this time off might help me realign with my goals (also with the technical skills i acquire in CS i see myself building a ton of things, or being able to implement ideas i\u2019ve had)\n\n5. Potentially undiagnosed ADHD. I for the past few months have suspected that i do have a mental disorder, which i soon realised could be a combination of DDD (depersonalization - derealization disorder) and ADHD. I recently got tested but my results come out in a week and a half from now on. The doctor alluded to the fact that i might indeed need a psychiatrist\u2019s help in the future, thus i was planning to take the year off to work on my mental health and get medicated. \n\nCons: \n\n1. My visa expires in 2025, which is the year i\u2019ll graduate if i do take a gap year. Afterwards i\u2019ll be required to get a work visa which is basically a lottery at that point. I honestly don\u2019t want to waste a year of my visa. \n\n2. I\u2019ll be at home w my parents - i basically did my whole freshman fall at home virtually which was difficult given i was existing in the same space as my parents. My parents typically don\u2019t give me as much freedom and tend to treat me as a child despite my current age. Also being exposed to all this freedom rn then having to go back home doesn\u2019t sound as appealing. However my parents have been receptive about the whole gap year thing and my dad honestly wants me to come back home. \n\n3. I\u2019ll be missing out on friends/ social events  - this isn\u2019t a huge factor tbh, i honestly don\u2019t mind missing out or feeling excluded especially given how many clubs and social activities i joined this semester.\n\n4. It feels like i\u2019m giving up and basically proves to everyone else that i can\u2019t handle it when things get tough. ik i do plan on returning to school but it feels like i can\u2019t take this gap year in peace\u2026.\n\n5. Finances : it feels as tho i might just be better off here in America for the time being since i can work on campus and get money. Going back home means i\u2019ll have to start relying on my parents once again. I\u2019m also thinking of renting a place separate from my parents (if my parents allow me) but I might end up wasting so much money living for one year. \n\nwhat do you guys genuinely think? with all the reasons i\u2019ve given do you think it might be worth it to pursue a gap year? (i\u2019m sorry this post is so long)",
