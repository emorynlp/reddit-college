  "title:": "How do I defend my Thesis from false Plagerism allegations?",
  "text": "For my bachelor thesis, I wrote about Biology and how machine learning can help in drug discovery. however, they said the overall plagerism count was \"too high\". it was 24% and the checker had my entire bibliography of 40 plus citations, including my own name and names of viruses listed as plagerism. Even the term \"Machine Learning\" was listed as plagerism with 20 hits. I explained to them that they can actually look through these sources themselves and see that most of the plagerism \"hits\" were from websites like \"Arab music world\", hidden from google searches or  in most cases where 5 words per entire paragraph were written in the same order. Then they changed their story and said it's not plagerism and that my proffesor whom I met twice and was my supervisor told me that I didn't reference \"basic biology knowledge\" and that I couldn't have written in myself. In the plagerism checker there were 25 other different papers that were using the same terms (because hey it's biology, can't really change names of viruses) and that was enough for them to claim plagerism on me. I explained to them that general knowledge according to [plagerism.org](https://plagerism.org) guidlines or bioinformatic publications online do not cite general knowledge such as \"An antibody is a protein\".  The sections he is refering to are sections where I'm either describing an image from my own words, or basic knowledge I know from high school. Aparantly, this is important to this institution and my supervisor never made mention of this in the feedback of the several drafts I sent him. In their terms of service for the thesis they say that the supervisor should guide the thesis step by step and provide detailed feedback so that the student does not end up in trouble. Now, 12 days after the deadline and several drafts he tells me about this citation of basic knowledge requirement and says I have to wait 7 months to submit my paper again to graduate. In the recent email he was even mocking me telling me that \"there is no time lost and you can do more x for your paper\" when my paper already focused on that topic which clearly means he didnt even read my paper....\n\nHow can I combat this situation where I was clearly not told of important information and that he clearly didnt read my paper? How can I clear my name and get some sort of compensation? I emailed him several drafts and he never advised me on this and yet I'm the one being punished for it. I implemented every single one of the changes he requested and I even saved each intermediate version so in conjuction with the mails its clear to see that I was following his advice. Am I somehow responsible for this? Who can I contact for this situation?",

Shouldn't that involve sometime of benchwork in that advisors lab and then the write up? I have noticed that our Biology idea of a thesis and the Honors on our campus idea of a thesis are different. It could be he is telling you simply writing a review of lit is not enough because it is all other persons work...but in honors and non-stem fields, that IS research/thesis work. Therefore you think you wrote a thesis by careful citing literature and you did...but usually in Micro that isn't enough...thats just the Intro. You need novel experiments testing your observations and write up your methods, results and discussions. Anything less might be perceived as \"cheating\"... try asking and clarifying with prof what exactly he wants you to add...this is just a guess based on you saying you had only meet twice and that you are in Micro",

I recently had a talk with the dean and he said that there is no plagiarism in my paper and that I should cite \"General Knowledge\". My biggest problem with this is that my supervisor saw my work multiple times, said it was great and to upload it. Recently here, a prime minister plagiarised entire sections of her work so the uni implemented new regulations. based on these regulations, he is supposed to make sure that cases like this don't happen, which is why there were mandatory meetings. I couldn't have possibly known this unless they had told me and thats what the supervisor was for.",
