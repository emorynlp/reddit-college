  "text": "I have a final exam tomorrow morning. 25 multiple choice. Five choices each (A-E), what is the probability of getting at least a 25% grade by guessing only one answer for all?\n\nIf I knew some questions, would it also be reasonable to guess the same letter for questions I don't know? I feel like switching answers for questions would lower my chances of getting it right (assuming I missed the opportunity to get it right in the first place with the same choice).",

      "text": "Read all of the questions before you answer. If one letter pops out at you over the others, choose it. If you know the answer, choose it, of course. If you don't know, guess \"C\" or \"all of the above\" unless you know one of the answers is incorrect or \"C\" is incorrect. Don't switch answers unless you know it's wrong or you know the correct answer. Really difficult to calculate the probability of getting 25%. If the test was put through an answer randomizer, you'd probably get within 5% of a 20%. So, anywhere from 15-25% by just guessing one answer throughout the entire test.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that some courses you will fail if you fail the final. Iirc, all of the courses at Missouri s&t were like that, but it might have just been the major courses, not electives. I'm not 100% sure anymore.",
