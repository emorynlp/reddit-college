  "text": "hi everyone apologies for the weird post and formatting i\u2019m on mobile and this also just sort of popped into my head. i\u2019m a sophomore in college and i\u2019ve realized that ever since school started all i\u2019ve been doing during the week is going to campus for class and to study in between classes. occasionally i\u2019ll meet with a friend for lunch, but i haven\u2019t really met that many people in my classes either. i usually just head back to my dorm after classes... and feel strangely unfulfilled?? i am trying to get involved through clubs but most of the ones i am in only meet once or twice a month. i just feel like i should be doing more? does anyone else feel this way?",

      "text": "I\u2019ll offer some free advice. College is nothing like what it seems like in the movies. Sure some people party like they do in the movies, but reality is that a majority of your campus isn\u2019t going to. You don\u2019t HAVE to do anything. If you want to branch out, by all means, have at it. But you don\u2019t have to go out and do things to have a good college experience. I think the only thing I actually did on campus was go for ice cream one time. If you\u2019re feeling lonely, try to make some friends. And the single easiest way to do that, and it will almost always work (it\u2019s never failed me), is to compliment someone. Say you like their shoes, ask where they got them. Tell them you liked what they said in class. Tell them their haircut looks good. Just say something nice and go from there.  Once you have a semi-solid friend group, it won\u2019t feel so empty anymore.",

Like there\u2019s a difference between the Anime Club versus the LQBTQ+ Resource Center, for example. Or even Greek Life like fraternities and sororities (there are even co-ed ones). Try to find an organization that opens up different sections of opportunities with different departments that will help create networks versus a club that focuses on a single activity. \n\nJoining an org was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made in college and it has opened up so much.",

Next week though Im going to go to anime club so maybe I can make a friend or something\n\nIdk man",

I worked woodworking for close to a decade before coming back to finish my degree. \n\nI would wake up at 6 AM to leave my house at 7 AM to get at work by 7:30. Wood working is almost all on a 10 hour shift, so I'd be at work until 6 PM. I'd drive home and get home at 6:30. \n\nFrom 6:30 to around 7:30, I would dilly around to finish up dinner. By 8 I'd eaten and cleaned up the kitchen from cooking. From there I'd take a shower and it's 8:30. \n\nAt 9:30 I would go to bed because I was beat from standing on concrete for 10 hours straight. \n\nCollege, in my experience, has been a fucking cakewalk. We all have different experiences though.",
