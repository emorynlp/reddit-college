      "text": "Everyone is their own hardest critic. Being of average looks is likely not going to be the biggest problem when seeking a relationship, and I think that your critique of yourself here is probably the bigger problem. \n\nHaving low self confidence is going to make finding and forming relationships (with anyone, not just women) difficult. I think the best thing you can do is, number one, do some sort of self reflection and/or improvement to help yourself like yourself more, and number two, stop comparing yourself to others.\n\nThere's always going to be people who are smarter, better looking, more wealthy, etc than you (and me), and constantly comparing yourself and your situation to theirs will do nothing but make you feel bad. Focus instead on yourself and your own strengths, it's a much more worthwhile way to spend your time.",

Whereas you look the best you've ever looked and get those 20 year girls that you didn't get when you were 20...\n\nLife does not end at 22.
