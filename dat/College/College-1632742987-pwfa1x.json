  "text": "I'm a freshman in college and my US History class is requiring a book report, just last year I wrote an elaborate book report and was wondering If I could re-use it? The work is really strong and I recieved an A in highschool from a teacher who graded much stricter than my college professor. Would there be any way of knowing? The only thing that scares me is it is 25% of the grade.",

Putting aside what everyone has mentioned that this is going to be considered plagiarism by your prof and school, it also just completely undermines the education you are paying for. Your professor does not want you to prove you are capable of writing a history paper. You wouldn't be in college if you absolutely could not do it. The point is that the skills you are working on in college require practice. This is especially true for writing. The only way to become a better writer is to write more and get more feedback. Using an old paper robs you of this necessary practice and then when you need to write something new in the future for a class or job, lo and behold, you suck at it because you didn't practice.",

Because you\u2019re already the author. \n\nHonestly, OP, if you never uploaded that paper to a plagiarism checker in high school, then there\u2019s no way they\u2019d find it. If that\u2019s the case and you wanted to use it as a base, then tweak it to update the writing to your current level (you\u2019ve likely improved since HS) and make sure it fits the assignment well. It would be better to write a new paper, but if you\u2019re in love with your original, and you never uploaded it to a database then it should be ok.\n\nAlthough another comment raises a good point. You did just post about wanting to reuse it on a public forum\u2026 so depending on how hard they\u2019re checking, be careful.
