In other words, for some classes the credit transferred but they didn't count the grade I received at cc into my cumulative GPA at the transfer school. When I graduated cc I had a 3.4 GPA, but when I started at my four year I have a 3.2 GPA.",

All my classes transferred over and they waived the foreign language requirement for admission because I wasn't able to get transcripts from the program I did my languages through. \n\nIn general, it's been surprisingly chill and easy. I think they just want to help you as much as possible to get you through the process.",

Or ask for them now. \n\nYour professors only need to save them for a certain amount of years, and you need them to prove say intro math 101 at school A counts as intro math 101 at school B. \n\nThis might be Canada specific, but everyone I know who did this or went back after 5 years or so had a nightmare with this.",
