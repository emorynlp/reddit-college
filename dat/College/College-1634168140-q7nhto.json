  "title:": "Always Check The Rating of Your Prof",
  "text": "Took a class without checking the ratings because the prof wasn't listed when I was registering. First week comes and I completely forgot to look up his name on ratemyprof because he looked nice. Found myself going crazy and belittling myself thinking I was the stupid one because I couldn't understand anything he was teaching. Didn't want to blame him because I saw him trying.\n\nDecided to check the rating when I should had done that the moment I had the chance to, to only see a rating of 1.8/5. 1.8 OUT OF 5?! Childddddddd. Got me questioning why I didn't see the red flags when I told him I was struggling and him being unbothered because some students passed his class. Lectures not matching up with the homework assignments and exams, study guides not matching up with the exams to begin with, and him telling us we should had already learned or knew the materials he was talking about.\n\nAfter checking the ratings, it all made sense. Everything just added up, and this whole time I kept blaming myself because even after studying and understanding the materials \u201che\u201d taught in class, I ended up relearning them on my own. However, to my surprise, to only see the assignments and exam with materials we didn't even go over.\n\nSo in summary, ALWAYS CHECK THE RATING. Don't assume that a low rating is just because they're being over-dramatic. They ain't playing when they rated. So, don't blame yourself because sometimes it's your professor.",

Doesn\u2019t teach, gives absolutely no instruction. Her reviews on RMP are horrible as I\u2019m sure they are with her evals, but she\u2019s been there for years (not tenure I believe) and keep her. She is the only professor it seems that keeps a certain track alive but it drives me crazy theyd keep such a bad professor!",

After my first semester, when I realized that I could pick my own classes, I started really reading through reviews and asking people about their experiences. I am not looking for an easy A, but a good solid professor who will actually teach you. I had a great English professor my second year in college, who was very thorough with instructions and feedback. He had some bad reviews, but they all complained about the workload. So I left a good one to let people know if they really want to learn how to write, pick him. I really learned how to write under him. I am thankful because I have yet to get anything below a 95 for my papers.\u00a0",
