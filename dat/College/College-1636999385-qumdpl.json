  "text": "So I\u2019m a freshman in college and I have never dated but would like to try and get myself out there. I\u2019m in a business college and there are a lot of girls in classes and halls. Do you guys have any tips?\n\nAlso pardon the username I just am sick and tired of covid.",

      "text": "Just walk up and talk to them like normal people except make it clear you\u2019re interested in them, there\u2019s no point in beating around the bush with your feelings be honest and vulnerable. Like Casanova said, \u201cI do not conquer, I submit\u201d it will be scary because a lot of people-myself included- will sometimes struggle with approach anxiety and some have it a lot worse than others so be mindful you might slip up and that\u2019s ok and don\u2019t expect the girls you want to just jump into your arms you sometimes have to play the long game. \n\nHere\u2019s a little example I found and kept in my notes just to have an example of how simple and direct I should be.\n\n\u201cHey, I know this is random but thought you were hot/good looking/stunning and I had to say hi.\u201d (Remember to relax and smile, no one likes the mysterious stone face bad boy.) (if she responds just continue and remember to be direct.) \u201care you single or doing anything this weekend?\u201d (If she says she\u2019s taken just leave if she says she\u2019s single or not doing anything this week keep going) Cool, I\u2019m [y/n] what\u2019s yours? (Get her name and have a little small talk and end it) \u201cCare if I get your number, we can go [insert something you want to do here.] \n\nThere you go short and straight to the point you don\u2019t have to follow this word for word but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have. \n\nGood luck!",
