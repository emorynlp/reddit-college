  "title:": "Retaking Human Anatomy Again",
  "text": "Im in my senior year of college trying to get into a bs program for ultrasound. I had a rough time during covid time with human anatomy the first time (2020) so i retook it in the spring (2021). I just finsished up HA&P 2 this fall (2021), but i figured out the program im applying has a certain grade with a percentage next to it. I am about 1-2% lower than the requirement. Im unsure if i should retake the class to get a better grade or go woth it since the college will only see the transcripts and my percentage and the schools percentage would just should up as a C anyways. Should i retake it or wing it?",
