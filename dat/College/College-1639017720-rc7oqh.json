  "text": "I just completed my Associate\u2019s degree and it has me wondering if it means anything on its own. I know that an Associate\u2019s is a precursor to getting a Bachelor\u2019s, etc., but does it have any meaning if I do not intend to go forward?\n\nSeems like a Bachelor\u2019s hardly does anything anymore (besides dig you a huge financial hole)",
