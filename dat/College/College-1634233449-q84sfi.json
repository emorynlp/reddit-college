  "text": "So I study in Norway as an international student. I lived in student housing for the last 2 years and never really made solid friends with my roommates. I am good at understanding Norwegian but not that great at speaking it, which put a barrier in place whenever my roommates would converse in a group. Eventually I just stopped trying to be overly social because I would just feel myself getting anxious when I would talk to them. \nI moved out recently and moved into a new  flat and really want to make friends. The problem is that by now everyone has their group and I\u2019m just kinda floating by. I don\u2019t know how to be conversational without feeling mute eventually. What is the best way to handle this?",
