  "text": "Well, I recently began to go to college, and I'm happy to be in one of the most prestigious college communities in the country. We have online college as of now. I am studying English honors. \n\nThere is this girl in my batch who is not good at English, and I really do not mind. However, whenever our classes are going on, she keeps on interrupting the teacher and asks her to teach in Hindi. \n\nI get a little uncomfortable because her exact wordings (translated) are, \"Ma'am could you please teach in Hindi instead of English because some of us are from Hindi Medium schools?\" It's so weird. If she can't comprehend English, why is she here?\n\nDon't get me wrong, but if roles were reversed and I wanted to study Hindi, coming from an English Medium school, I probably wouldn't even get admission. \n\nIdk, does this happen with other students too, or am I just being rude with my thoughts? I think I'm neutral towards her because we do not really have the same interests, but then it's weird. \n\nTELL ME REDDIT AM I GOING INSANE?",

      "text": "If I'm going to an English Medium school, I would expect to be taught and talked to in English. I understand explaining something in Hindi if someone doesn't get it, but the teacher shouldn't be expected to teach the whole class in Hindi because that beats the point of the school and it's curriculum.\n\nIt's like when we learn French/German/Spanish in high school and the teacher taught in that language, and also made us ask questions in that language e.g. if we need to go to the bathroom, we had to ask in French.",

      "text": "I think it'd be odd, since there's usually an expected level of proficiency you're supposed to meet if you're not a native speaker of the language the course is taught in. \n\nI think there should be accommodations for those who aren't quite understanding due to the language barrier, but that would be like workshops and tutoring outside of class, like I usually see. \n\nI wouldn't want class to be slowed down because the instructor has to keep repeating everything in another language, since it affects everyone's learning.",
