  "text": "I live in the dorms on campus. While I was doing my laundry this afternoon, I discovered that several of my clothes were missing. Not moved. Gone. \n\nWhoever took my clothes definitely appreciates style. Not everything was taken, just my best pair of jeans, some cute tops, and, yes, a few pairs of my underwear and my two favorite bras. Gross. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that this has happened in our dorm and it\u2019s definitely no accident. There\u2019s a camera at the entrance to the laundry room but I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to stop anything. Tons of students go in and out every day. Stupid idea to put a camera at the entrance and not IN the laundry room! \n\nThe student housing office has taken the extraordinary step to -- wait for it -- PUT UP A WARNING SIGN. How does that help?? This is super frustrating and I\u2019m not sure what to do. It seems crazy to me that A) we can\u2019t get a camera IN the laundry room for some insane reason, and B) we can\u2019t get dryers that LOCK (the washing machines are all locked while the cycle is going!!).\n\nSorry for venting, but if you have a favorite pair of jeans, I\u2019m sure you understand the frustration!! \ud83d\ude2d Has anyone else encountered this and found a way to solve it?? How can I convince the housing office to get cameras installed in the laundry room? Or something! HELP!!",

Some kids just wear them as is. Not the smartest idea as the professors know and will mark you down for improper presentation. \n\nThe problem has gotten better because they allow first and last names now, the school allows you to embroider the sleeve as well, and they have different colors for different sections. \n\nWhat is ironic is no one EVER steals the matching pants. The pants don't have any outward identifiers and cost just as much as the shirt. Also, people pay a lot of money to get them tailored shorter and there is a large amount of shorter kids on campus. The pants should be more appealing that the shirt... I just don't get it!\n\nAll my major has is a crappy polo and a name tag. No complaints, $20 to replace if need be. No one steals any.",

Campus Security is likely responsible for all camera installations, but even they may not be able to install a new one without getting it approved by an upper level administrator because of the cost, or even if they could get approval to install a camera in the laundry room, that likely wouldn\u2019t happen until the next break between semesters. \n\nIf you want a big change like that to happen (new machines/ cameras to be installed) the easiest/ quickest way to get that kind of thing done is to try to appeal to a rich friend or relative to make a significant donation to the school with the specification that the donation be used for that specific purpose. \n\nObviously that\u2019s not an option for most students. One course of action you could take is reporting the theft to your campus security. There may not be much they can do, but if it\u2019s reported, they can at least have it on record and if the thief is someone who does this often they may eventually catch them and be able to return your clothes to you. \n\nThe best way to prevent this from happening again would be to do what others are saying and camp out in the laundry room while your load is going. I know it\u2019s inconvenient but that\u2019s really the only guaranteed way to prevent theft unfortunately.",

Yes, sometimes people were distracting, but I found that headphones and music were fine for me, and I kind of liked the white noise of the machines. I just did generic homework, maybe notes/reading or highlighting, I saved studying for an exam or something like that for when I went to the library.

Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have CCTV cameras installed so I had to be a little more creative. I bought one of those spy pens with cameras and while I was doing laundry again, I just placed my folders on a chair and then set the chair up near the machine I was using and just placed a few clothes. \r  \nGuess what? They were missing again but this time I had proof that it was her with the footage from my spy pen. She then admitted to it and since I was a little merciful, I didn\u2019t report it to the landlord. \r  \nBut if something like this happens again, I would and probably also call the cops. After that incident, we got newer machines and two of them where we can control and lock the dryers with an app.",
