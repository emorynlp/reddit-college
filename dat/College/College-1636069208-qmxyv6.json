  "text": "I havent been doing assignments or going to many classes so my grades are bad. I have just been sleeping all day basically. \n\nI understand it's my fault. my friend was worried so he told a counselor , who then threatened to contact my parents if I didn't talk to them.\n\nsaid counselor told me to request I be allowed to makeup past assignments I didn't do, even if just for half credit. she said she would vouch for me.\n\nshould I ask my professors. i don't want it to seem like I'm asking for pity. lots of students I imagine go thru the same thing and have made similar requests to professors.",

      "text": "Here\u2019s the thing I learned throughout life and worked amazing when I applied it to college.\n\nWhen you are working for someone, are a student, or whatever the situation\u2026 you are just a name. A person assigned to a seat. If you don\u2019t hand in assignments, your teachers assume (because it\u2019s all they can do) that you don\u2019t care, have no desire to pass, and therefore your grade of failing stands. However, opening up a line of communication, is truly the best thing you could do for yourself. You lose that assigned seat and become human. A person with a story.\n\nObviously you don\u2019t want to just make a habit of not turning in assignments and then coming up with excuses.\nBut in a situation like this - you talk to your teachers. Personally. After class. And tell them everything in a short but concise way. And the most important part, emphasize your desire to make up the assignments even for any credit.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance one teacher may say it\u2019s not fair to others and may not give you a chance. But most of the time, they are really understanding and go above and beyond to help you. But again, if they don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing what you are doing, they just can\u2019t help you.",
