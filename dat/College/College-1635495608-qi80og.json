  "text": "Q1. Okay so I\u2019m struggling in my current intro to python class. I don\u2019t know if im going to pass type of struggling. \n\nI wanted to ask if I withdraw from CSE20. Would that count as a fail for my required classes. I have no idea what the withdrawal would do for my chances of just being able to declare as CS. \n\nI got into the CS program but I don\u2019t yet qualify for the major. I know I need a 3.0 in the required classes tho. \n\nSo would it look better if I withdraw now? Or possible fail? \n\nQ2. Also CSE20 isn\u2019t apart of the required classes to be in CS, technically it starts at CSE30. \n\nSo if I were to stay in the class and possible fail CSE20, would that count as part of the required classes? Would it count as my only allowed fail?  Cause I could totally just take the class again. \n\nI really want to do CS but auto grader is killing me. \n\nI\u2019m freaking out about this and I\u2019m in quarter 1.",
