      "text": "Normally my classes finished at least 10 minutes early, before COVID was a thing. That way we had enough time to get from the class to the next on time. And allow for other classes after us to come in. \n\nEither way for most of my lectures, they were 2 or 3 hours in length and normally we didn\u2019t go all the way to that time. Even when lectures were online for COVID. Even when it was a heavier day for content, we were always let out at least 10 or 15 minutes beforehand. Only a handful of times in my 4 year bachelors degree, was I ever let out right on time and not given at least a ten minute grace period. Only once or twice did a professor ever overtime. And even at that, it was only over by a few minutes. For a prof to be consistently running close to 10 minutes over means he\u2019s not respecting his students time and not considering that you guys have may have stuff going on outside of that class you need to get to after. I wouldn\u2019t stay late. I\u2019d leave right when class ends. Maybe talk to him about it and explain that you\u2019re having issues tending to other stuff after class because he\u2019s running behind.\n\nRealistically, he\u2019s either trying to put too much content into one class or maybe he\u2019s wasting time in class???\n\nHe needs to find a way to better manage class time if he\u2019s always running classes later than they should be",
