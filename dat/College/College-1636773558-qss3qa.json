  "title:": "Withdrawing from a course for a second time during my college career? Bad?",
  "text": "Freshman Year I struggled immensely with transitioning from high school/living at home to living on campus and dealing with the workload among other things. So during that time, I had a really crappy professor AND was struggling so I withdrew from a course and made it up over the Summer. Sophomore Year I was home due to COVID so being back on campus this year (Junior Year) feels like Freshman Year all over again. I struggle with being away from home, during social situations/interactions, and also with the workload. \n\nI am currently taking Statistics and have failed almost every test; I am averaging a 64 as of right now and only have one more exam and then a cumulative final which is worth a HUGE chunk of my grade. I feel like if I failed the other exams, the cumulative one is not going to go well. May I add that I literally lose sleep over this class; I got three hours of sleep last night because I studied all night and woke up super early to study this morning before my exam (which I failed). I just feel like maybe it\u2019s a combination of me and my prof\u2019s teaching method; it just is not meshing well, evidently. \n\nI really did not want to withdraw from a course ever again, but I fear that I might not pass and I also am just super stressed out with the workload. I have a huge mock trial coming up (part of my grade for my law class), a 15-page paper, two lit reviews, an 8-page paper, a 50-minute presentation, and another presentation. \n\nSo my question is, in short\u2014does it look bad if I withdrawal twice during my college career? My GPA is a little over 3.5 and I really don\u2019t want to 1. Fail the stat course, and 2. Bring down my GPA. Idk what to do :( I feel like I look like someone who gives up if I have two W\u2019s (withdrawals) on my transcript but I am drowning this semester.",
