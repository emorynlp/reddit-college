  "text": "Personally, since I don't really care too much about learning and just want a job (that pays well), then I don't see why I *need to* go to college. The only reason I'm even enrolled in the first place, is because I get 100% free tuition. If that were ever to change, I'd just drop out. Just curious how many agree or disagree.",
