But I think that they somehow thinks that this sort of thing, deep down, means that they\u2019re a nice or sensitive person. Too good to be \u201cmean\u201d and give a bad grade. \n\nI see it as cheating the people who put in the work and actually deserve a perfect score.",

      "text": "As an instructor, it pains me when people give e everyone the same score they didn't earn. On assignments that have group components to grades, I ask students to grade themselves and others so that folks who haven't pulled their share don't score as well as those who have.  Sometimes it's so clear that some group members were riding the work of others but if you give each other max points, I'm stuck with giving those points. I'd rather know what went wrong so I could work to help groups in the future. But when you ask decide to say everything was great, those issues don't get aired and the status quo prevails.",

Like when assigning duties, the one overachiever wants to do everything, and the shy kid agrees to do one thing, does it well, but at the end of the day, didn't do a fair share of the work, but did everything they were asked. Weird situation to be in as a student to",

So nothing to worry about. If they didnt do anything then thats their fault. You gonna lose sleep because someone else made bad decisions to not do the work? Doubt it.",

Someone needs to tell them to knock that shit off and if they aren't told that, they won't. \n\nWtf are you going to do when you're working at a company and assigned to do a project with a coworker who doesn't do their work? You going to sit there and do half their work too? People like you are at least partially contributing to the creation of coworkers like that because people like you gave them perfect scores in group evaluations.",

Regardless if I am friends with someone they deserve to be marked fairly without bias. Even the people I dislike.\n\nLike it has been said before on this post, if they did a good job you would not be giving them a bad grade. If they did a poor job, It's actually nicer and better for you to be honest to your friend give them poor marks and good feedback so they can improve.",
