  "text": "So I never went to college. My parents didn't really go to college(I think my dad technically went for like half a year) nor did many of my friends/nor my older brother.\nThroughout high school I despised and often skipped my classes, so I figured, \"I dont need/want college, I can do this on my own\". Often getting straight F's for half the semester and then coming back and getting straight A's to balance it out, I passed, but needless to say, my Gpa wasn't great.\nRecently I landed a job at a bank, as a personal banker/relationship banker. The base pay is about $44k but there are quarterly bonuses so I'll most likely be making around $48k after that.\nFor reference, in my past 2 jobs, the 2nd one I was making about $21k as the base and maybe an extra $3-6k in commission, and my last job I was making around $33k and maybe about $3k in quarterly bonuses(before taxes)\nSo ive gone up about $10k within the last few jobs.\nI just turned 22 early this month and realize, most likely, aside from maybe promotions through moving up, regardless if I stay at this company or not $45k-$50k is probably the most money I'll ever make, atleast within the next 5 years or so without a college degree. Which I'm fine with honestly, but why not make more if I can? $50k is managable for me/where I live, but reaching my financial goals both long and short term, may take a bit longer.\nI'm considering pursuing an associates in finance, however, when I search up careers with an associates in finance, most of the jobs are in a pretty similar salary range as I'm in now, maybe $10k more tops, so now I'm back to, \"is it worth it\". Im definitely going to wait atleast another 6 months or so before making a decision but Idk what I should do.",

      "text": "If you're considering college, I'd aim for a bachelor's degree. An associate's degree these days means very little. It makes you overqualified for minimum wage jobs but underqualified for white-collar jobs.\n\nMy mom just got her associate's last year. She\u2019s a state worker and despite her degree, she remains limited to what positions she can apply to within her field because they require a bachelor\u2019s or higher. Her income has only increased about $2k and she\u2019s currently sitting at $48k.\n\nYou can always attend an online college or cc part-time if full-time is unmanageable. But it\u2019s honestly not worth the investment if you\u2019re just going to go for associates because the pay raise will be very minimal.",

      "text": "Consider taking one or two general education courses at a community college to determine whether college is for you. Most universities have transfer agreements with local community colleges, meaning that they have a list of which community college courses transfer into the university. If you take a few that satisfy gen ed requirements, you get the benefit of taking what is probably an easier course with a smaller class size at the CC for a much cheaper price tag. For reference, in my area, a community college course costs about one quarter of what it would cost to take at the university. \n\nI would be really, really careful about signing up for online courses. I'm a prof at a university. I teach online, face-to-face, and hybrid. If you are not a good independent learner, online learning is not for you. It requires logging in just about every day, keeping track of everything you have due, doing things like watching lecture videos and making sure that you're taking notes and focused (harder to do at home than in a classroom). \nIt *feels* like more work than face-to-face classes because the hours that you would typically spend in class are now spent learning independently. For a typical 3 credit, face-to-face course, that's 3 hours of class time and 1-2 of homework per week. The online version is 4-5 hours working online per week. About a quarter of the students who sign up for online programs at my university end up switching to face-to-face courses. The ones who succeed are usually highly motivated, working adults.",
