  "text": "I am currently a senior at a big school in Texas about to graduate next semester. I realized I want to work in the Tech field but am already way too deep to change or even add a Computer Science major.\nThere is another university in my hometown that is a two year for upper-level courses, and I am considering getting a second bachelors there in Computer Science because: 1. It\u2019s at home, 2. It would be cheaper, and 3. I would graduate in about 1-2 years whereas at my current school, I would most likely stay for another 3 years. \n\nI know this sounds a tad bit bad, but I feel like I would essentially be downgrading/ wasting my time at a big school to a small college to get a degree I could have gotten at my current school but decided not to pursue. \n\nJust for some insight, I\u2019m currently getting my degree in Political Science and it\u2019s a bachelors of art.\n\nI guess I just want to know what are y\u2019alls thoughts on this? Should I go back home and get my second degree there or just add computer science here?",

                      "text": "In that case, I would recommend the second bachelors or bootcamp. I could be wrong, but I personally have not heard of many people in HR just getting a programming job unless they had a good amount of prior experience, since programming is a skill that can take a while to get proficient at.\n\nOption 1: second degree in CS. You said that you could take 1-2 years to graduate with a CS degree, I'm guessing it will take probably 2. A CS degree will give you a broad understanding of the fundamentals of computer science, but there will be gaps in terms of practical knowledge, which you might have to pick up on your own. There's also a lot of irrelevant classes you'll have to take, such as math and some CS theory classes, which you likely won't end up using in a programming job.\n\nOption 2: bootcamp. I've heard a lot of mixed things about bootcamps. They tend to be pretty expensive, and many companies look down on bootcamp grads. I've heard that most of the bootcamp students who end up succeeding already had prior programming experience or were just insanely motivated/gifted. But they might not be a bad option necessarily, I would just do a lot of research into it, including asking people on Reddit.",

It\u2019s helped a lot  me getting insight from others. If i do end up choosing the boot camp route i\u2019ll have some time to learn some programming basics at the least",

Does your current school give you the option of returning for a second bachelor's degree in a comparable amount of time to the school near your home? If you are taking out loans at this point for school, go with the option that requires the least amount of loan money possible. You didn't necessarily waste your time at the big school, I'm sure you had some valuable life experiences and seems you have learned what you really want to do. I agree to possible look into working part-time for some work experience so that when you do graduate with the second degree you have actual professional work experience in addition to your two degrees. They may or may not pay for schooling, depends on the company. I will also say that if you qualify, some federal financial aid would pay for a second bachelor's degree up to a certain credit hour limit so that may be something to look into as well. Good luck!",

There is some really wild shit you learn when you major in CS. Theory gets pretty trippy sometimes.\n\nBoot camp if you just want to get in the industry.
