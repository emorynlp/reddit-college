  "title:": "Please help I do homework for 12+ hours, this is debilitating and I don't know what else to do. Need advice on time management",
  "text": "Sometimes I work on homework for up to 12+ hours in a day. I just sit in my room and work. I don't come out to eat or socialize. If I don't forget to eat, I'll usually use food as a reward. I get about 3-4 hours of sleep before I'm back at it again..and that's if I sleep at all. There's no time schedule, somedays I'll just wake up at random hours and start doing homework. I can't stay organized and my thoughts are going at 100 miles an hour, some are even repetitive and it's hard to focus on my work. I'm not on Adderall or any medication. This just all feels like pure energy or something, it's like I can't stop. It feels like I can't take a break or I'll get all panicked. I'm sorry if I don't make sense, it's hard to make sense right now. Just want help managing my time please.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I've been feeling paranoid as well, another factor as to why I can't sleep on top of the energry. Like I said no drugs, this just naturally happens. It's either this or I fall behind on everything and become a depressed mess due to the guilt of procrastination. Sometimes it's a mixture of both(which is my normal I guess).",

I was not expecting to get so much advice and support, I will look back at this for tips and tricks when I'm feeling lost. I tried to say thanks to all of you individually, but there's a lot of you so it's hard. I've done what little work I have left to do, but as far as that I have 4 days where I have nothing due. I'm going to be taking that time to relax, reevaluate, and de-stress. Thank you all so much! Also more advice is appreciated and will be taken into consideration. I promise I have read all of your comments. Thank you and feel free to leave more advice (I need it lol)",

      "text": "Go to the your University's main library, and find a spot in (or any other appropriate pulbic place, but LEAVE YOUR DORM ROOM).  Use the Pomodoro Method, meaning you focus exclusively on a pre-determined task for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break.  Do 4 pomodoros and then take a longer break, like going for a walk and listening to some music.  Then come back to the library. \n\nThe pomodoro keeps you focused, and allows your brain to rest, which is incredibly important.  Being in a public place, particularly where other people are studying, keeps you motivated.  Being around other people concentrating on their studies will make you want to work on your own.\n\nI'd also recommending consulting your university's mental health services, describing the problems you've been having.  You can get help, whether that's through therapy or medication.  Therapy really helped me personally.  Good luck!",

      "text": "I am gonna share my story and then tell you how I dealt with it. \n\nAs an overachieving, anxious person, I can relate to what you\u2019re going through. During my first 2 years of college, I sacrificed my social life, my mental health, my physical health (the forgetting to eat, sleeping a few hours a day and for me, drinking coffee like water and not exercising at ALL) in the hopes that I am going to ace every class. Honestly, I regret that for many reasons. First, acing every single class is not an achievable goal for most students. Sometimes you study for hours and days for a class and it just doesn\u2019t click and you end up not doing great. It took me a while to realize it and actually BELIEVE that it is okay to not get As. Second, not taking care of my mental and physical health just lead me to feel awful in my head and my skin and in the end, lead to me procrastinating even more because I was exhausted and anxious. The accumulated stress actually made me less able to focus on my work and I ended up doing worse than I could have done if I just had taken the few hours a day to take care of myself. Third, friends and acquaintances are fucking important. You don\u2019t need to make best friends in college but people strive on human connection and emotional support. Even people you barely know can help you out and give you tips (reddit showed you that). Just knowing that other people are in the same boat as you gives some sense of relief. Helping out other people make you feel better about yourself. Just talking and unwinding can make you feel relieved. \n\nI don\u2019t know if that little paragraph will convince you about how important it is to take care of yourself but please, just give it a try and I promise that once you are just a little more relaxed, you\u2019re going to see your work as easier and more enjoyable and in the end, you\u2019ll probably do even better in your school work. \n\nThis is how I started out and I hope it will help you, even if it\u2019s a little bit. \n\n1. Set reasonable expectations for your goals for each class. Instead of \u201cI want to get an A in every class\u201d try to think \u201cI am going to understand the material the best I can and do my best on my assignments and exams, and it\u2019s okay if it means not acing it) \n2. Write down/ type on a calendar what your commitments are during a typical week (classes, club meetings, etc) \n3. Take a piece of paper, open your syllabus for a class and write down what you need to do every week for each class. Example: physics class: - reading chapter + small homework due every MWF at 8 am; - quiz due Sunday at 11:59 pm\n4. Set a time in your weekly schedule to finish your work for each class. To continue on the physics\u2019 class example, I decided that right after each physics class on MWF, I am going to do the readings for the next class and the short homework. Saturday I reviewed the material and took the quiz.\n5. For exams and big assignments, you\u2019ll literally have free time in your schedule to study for them since all the routine work has a time to be completed. \n6. Incorporate time to eat for every day. I know that being anxious make you forget to eat, so I think this is crucial bc you need food to function, even if you feel like you don\u2019t. Also, since eating is a time of the day you NEED to commit to, try to find someone to share it with. Eat with or facetime a friend during lunch. Maybe shoot a text and check up on someone. \n7. Incorporate time to exercise. Personally, I think that with my schedule, it was impossible to work out every day like my friends did. I started with working out once a week and then progressively, I WANTED to work out more and more. Now it\u2019s 4 times a week and I have never felt better. Just find a pace that fits you and start with it. \n8. Finally, set an end time to your studying time. Like 9 pm, close your books and do anything other than studying. Meditate, shower, eat, go out, hang out with someone; do whatever you enjoy doing. \n\nDM me if you need to, I\u2019ll be happy to help.",

My suggestion is to get back on a schedule. I plan everything I need to do hour by hour at the start of the day so i know when all my meetings are for different orgs, when I\u2019m going to do my classes and homework, and when I\u2019m going to study for the mcat. It helps calm my anxiety by showing me that I will get everything done if I stick to the schedule and the time I\u2019ll be done with what I need to accomplish for that day. It also allows me to take breaks if I finish something on the schedule early, like if my class gets out a little early or it didn\u2019t take as long as I thought it would to do a homework. I know I can relax for a bit until the next time on my schedule without feeling guilty",

Update it daily, have check boxes so that you can look at the things you've already accomplished. Start with the easiest things, just so that you have something to check off. Divide up work into segments. Do you have to write an 8 page paper? Make each page of the paper it's own check box.  Always have an up to date list of your tasks even if they're not due for months, and check your email/class websites daily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI developed pretty severe anxiety last year, so I was in a similar boat.

They are as much part of studying as note- taking, revision, and reading. \n* Are you spending time writing and re-writing notes? This is a waste of time. Take your notes clearly and by hand in class. \n* Plan your essays. With a good plan, I can knock out a 1500-2500 essay in about 1-2 hours. If you want, I'll explain my planning method. \n* Work on the subjects you are doing badly in, don't keep going over things you already know. \n* Connect with older students, classmates, tutors, and professors for advice.",

              "text": "For the sake of demonstration, let's choose a topic question: \"Should we force people to get vaccines? \" Let's also assume a moderate essay length of about 1000 words. \n\n**Pre- plan/ research (min 1hr, depends on the topic and type of essay. This is what takes the longest time):** \n\n* Read the sources given by the lecturer/ teacher.\n* Do independent research (WHO, CDC, news sites). \n* Understand the current environment and attitudes to the question (we currently are facing a pandemic where we have a vaccine, what stands in the way of vaccination? Why are some people scared of vaccination? Which religeous groups are opposed to vaccination?) \n* Pick up points that are both pro- and anti- vaccine. Write them down and which sources support them. \n\n**The actual plan (10-15 min):** \n\nI normally do this as a mind map, but I can't put images in reddit comments. Instead, I'll try to draw this as a table. I'm not going to do a full plan here since I've not spent the time on doing specific research- rather this is my own general knowledge. \n\nBasically, you will choose a stance (for/ against), come up with 4 arguments, and about three key pieces of information that support each argument. You will write down at least one counterargument (CA) under each heading. If it is an argumentative essay, you can manipulate the CA to show the weakness in the opposing point. You will write down quotes under their relevant headings.  You can add more or less points depending on how extensive your essay is, but remember- don't have too many points because then you're not going in depth into each of them. \n\n**Argument: We should force people to get vaccinated**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|*1. Vaccines save thousands of lives and improve quality of life*|*2. Ethical concerns* |*3. Economy* |\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Elimination of smallpox, polio, concept of herd immunity. |CA: Religious objections. But religion has always been an obstacle to science e.g. helical model |Diseased workers are ineffective workers|\n|The effects of measles on unborn foetus development,  could have been prevented by vaccines. CA: sometimes vaccines have side effectsl, but this is extremely rare. |It is ethical to save as many lives as possible|Impact on business profits, social healthcare takes tax funds away from education and infrastructure, people have less money to spend. CA: cost of vaccination programs, however, this cost is an investment and works out less in the long run. Covid as a recent example.  |\n|Analysis of population pyramids in countries in relation to healthcare over time, as well as comparing countries to each other. |Many objections are due to misunderstanding subsequent fear. Explain how vaccines are tested. |Good healthcare allows children to survive to adulthood- part of a practical solution to women in developing nations having fewer children because they know their children won't die. Addresses overpopulation and women with fewer children can work. |\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you can start writing the essay. In your introduction, you will state your stance, your main points (italics). The body 1-2 paragraphs for each main point. The conclusion introduces nothing new, but serves to basically say to the reader why they should care about anything you've just written. \n\nGood luck, I know this can be painful to learn. If your teacher/ lecturer allows you to hand in drafts, you should try your best to hand what you see as a final copy during the draft stage.",

Ask your dr or therapist for a referral to a psychiatrist- not a psychologist (though they can prob do the testing though if thats your only option) but rally push for a psychiatrist.  That's a medical dr that specializes in mental health issues.  \n\nHave him/her test you for every mental illness and then some under the sun, and throw in testing for learning disabilities.  \n\nYou'll prob sit with this dr for 30-45 minutes to figure out what your needing, your background ect (some prefer to skip this part and just jump right into the testing part and then interview you afterwords, so don't be surprised if that part gets skipped) and the day you do go in for the acutal testing/diagnostics- go in well rested, on a full stomach, don't hide anything/be brutally honest and plan on the testing lasting around 3+ hours.  It'll be a long day.\n\nThat way your regualr dr and therapist will know what they are dealing with, and the psychiatrist can get you paired up with the right therapist for your situation/needs, and you'll know for sure what kind of learning issues you have so he/she and the therapist can work with you and the college to get you the right kind of help.",

Also the world is trying to conquer you, don't let it. I'm sorry you are feeling this way. I know it well.",

Hope things get better for you.\n\nEdit: wanted to add the pomodoro timer method has really helped me too, so I'm not just in homework mode for hours on end. You do work for a certain amount of time, then take a break, then go back. The app Tide is pretty good for me but there's lots of pomodoro apps haha",

I\u2019m taking extra credits this semester and knew I needed to get it together. I\u2019ve finally been able to sleep at 2am instead of 4-5am (12-1am is the goal) and designated an hour on Sunday nights to plan the new week. I take the time to familiarize myself with the upcoming assignments and sometimes begin an outline, or something of the sorts. I use a planner app that\u2019s tailored for students and allows you to enter detailed information in an organized manner which I find useful. I try to add the page-count for a chapter or section; honestly, so I know how much time to plan in case I decide to change things around (or reward myself with a night to relax). It\u2019s a process. It has been quite challenging to say the least, however,  I\u2019m seeing results. What I\u2019ve learned thus far is proper nutrition is important to your overall energy and brain power (vitamins, and avoid foods that\u2019ll make you tired when studying), exercise (such as walking a dog, or walking in general), pre-planning, and consistency. I\u2019ve had great days and I\u2019ve had harder days, but I\u2019m just trying to stay positive and get back up when necessary. I\u2019m glad you intend on seeing a therapist though, I hope you find it helpful. We\u2019re all rooting for you!",

This is easy to do in Google sheets. At the start of the week, I then go through what's due in the next 7 days, and chunk it. For example, I need todo these 5 assignments by Tuesday. When I'm done, and I submitted the work, it is deleted from the list.\nI also have a schedule for myself, so I have certain times throughout the day that I do the assignments.

Create a plan. \nThis can be a schedule or something as simple as fridays are this class and saturdays are this class and friends are sundays. Best advice I got from the valedictorian. \"Do what's worth your time. It required self discipline to do the hard things you need help with but there isn't anything to learn from doing things you have down. After all there there to learn not do.\"\n\n2. Go to office hours. \nEasiest way to turn 6hrs of work into 2hrs is office hours. Professors are there to teach if they want to do research and have no time for students they should have gotten a research grant from industry or worked in a professional lab. They are professors first. Also no professor will be upset for dumb questions. After all the height of education know all to well sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something. Be brave be honest and trust they will help you. 12+ hrs is enough to ask for some help. \n\n3. Manage your expectations. \nNot everything will be perfect. Not everything will work out. Take it as a lesson for real engineering. You will never have all the time you want to make it something your proud af about. An old axiom I heard my freshman year a long time ago was \"the engineer who makes it perfect the first time will never work again\" I thought it meant something a lit like automation work smarter not harder. I quickly found out that that isn't the case do it enough. Worry about things worth worrying about. Big project spend some time on it. But don't finish it in one night. \n\n4. Make friends in class\nIt makes you go to class. First step to passing is showing up. Also engineering is no place for ego we all have to know all of the fundamentals and we end up in the same classes. Ask for help amd trust they might ask you. Return the favor and understand you need to know it it's not a competition of knowing fundamentals more. \n\n5. Its about learning not performing. \nTake it easy and try to be the best you can not more.",

This can make studying sustainable and you can adjust the time (such as 45 mins work 15 mins break) to suit your needs. People do it on YouTube too with and without music so you could do it with them and then eat, take mini-naps, and relax over the breaks. You will also get more done so you will not need to work 12 hours a day. Then you can relax and do other stuff. As others have said, your schedule is not healthy. This might help balance it.",

They can't generate enough motivation to get the work done until the last possible moment. But at that point, it would be too late to break the work in segments.\n\nBut, it doesn't sound like you have motivation issues. So rather than studying for 12 hours, aim for 2-3 hour sessions, followed by some light exercise. Eat during regular times. And if you tend to get distract, steer away from sources of distraction like TV, YouTube, etc. Give yourself a \"play\" time to indulge in those things when you're done with a day's work load.\n\nThe tough part is to get used to the schedule. You have to have enough self-regulation to follow it. After a week or two, it becomes a lot easier to do.\n\nSlow and steady.",

None of that is normal, even for people who have severe time management issues.\n\nIf you're not exaggerating and this is an ongoing problem, I'd seriously consider contacting your school's mental health services ASAP. I am no psychologist, but what you describe sounds a lot like mania, which is a serious condition and one that warrants being seen by a professional. Even if that's not the issue, reaching out to somebody about this problem will help get you other academic support like tutoring, academic skills workshops, accommodations for classes, etc...Every university has resources like these, some of which might need a referral from the counseling/mental health services.\n\nIn the meanwhile, take a look at this definition and see what you think: The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania) touches on this, but a manic episode is described by the DSM-5 (basically the Bible of psychology) as:\n\n\"A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day.\n\nDuring the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).\"\n\nAgain, I do not mean to armchair diagnose you or suggest you internet diagnose yourself, you really would be best served talking to a professional. It's clear you realize you have a problem and I hope I could provide you some insight or that something I said resonated with you. Best wishes on getting some help!",

Especially given your depression diagnosis and the fact that this doesn't just happen with homework, it's even more important to take notice of how you're feeling and work with somebody to address it sooner rather than later.\n\nIf it's possible, maybe it would help to keep a journal or make a few notes about what you're feeling? That way you can be as accurate as possible in describing your experiences when you talk to your therapist/doctor. Although not similar in intensity, I know I tend to look back on my moody-ness totally differently after a couple of days or if my mood shifts again in the meanwhile: Having a first-hand account in the thick of the moment might provide some more useful information and insight after the fact.\n\nCheers to finding a way forward :)",

I used to go weeks in depressive moods, then would go for a time in what is called hypomania. For me that meant I averaged 5 hours of sleep a night and would work on things nonstop throughout the day. Being idle was very difficult and it can lead to some serious burn out.\n\nFind a doctor that specializes in manic depression, if possible. Bring up what is going on and see about a plan of action. There are different mood stabilization medications that make this much easier to deal with.\n\nAlso note that anxiety and ADHD tend to go hand in hand with this disorder. \n\nJust know while it seems difficult there is hope. If you need someone to talk to feel free to reach out to me anytime.",

              "text": "Hey little homie, I've been on meds for my bipolar disorder for about a year, and my life has never been as easy to live as it currently is. Mania and depression are a bitch, but it does get better! Also consider going in for testing for ADHD: a lot of people just 'miss' getting diagnosed as kids (especially if you were quick enough in school to slide by without really needing to pay much attention), and it's a pretty simple 2 hour interview to get diagnosed. I used to think my homework/class issues were completely up to my bipolar disordet, but since they put me on some ADHD meds my life improved dramatically in terms of just like, being able to complete tasks. ADHD is also comorbid with a lot of other mental illnesses. Beyond just meds/therapy, you really do need to eat/sleep more often. Your brain is a machine, it works shitty if it doesn't get the right amount maintenance/fuel. Dropping a class/activity might be the move if you're actually unable to handle your current workload: if you *really can't* skip a few readings/fluff assignments for your class, then it might be that you just legitimately have too much on your plate. Burning the candle at both ends burns the candle out twice as fast! Good luck, I'm rooting for you.",

What I\u2019m planning on doing this semester is creating an hour-to-hour schedule and then altering it as necessary until it meets my needs. \n\nI\u2019d recommend getting up and going to bed at the same time as much as possible, slowly chipping away at assignments while watching their respective lectures (break in note taking = work on an assignment\u2019s problem), and creating times specifically for food and brain breaks. Give yourself plenty of time to study and work, but don\u2019t let it bleed into personal time. Find a time a couple of hours before you plan to sleep and dedicate that for relaxation only.\n\nHopefully it helps make study times more efficient and leaves more room to let your brain decompress a little!",
