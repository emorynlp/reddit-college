  "text": "I'm trying to save up for a car right now, but the college in my town might not be right for me and I might have to move everything to a different city or state. How do you do it? Is it better to get an apartment or live in the dorms? Are dorms big enough to put a lot of stuff? How do you afford anything if you don't know what kind of jobs there are in the area? I've lived in a small town my whole life, so the thought of just getting up and moving to a big city is making me afraid of going anywhere at all.",

I sold my car recently and decided to go car free with no regrets and im not even in a city so you'll be even better off than me \n\n\nI suggest you stay in a dorm. Yea sure an apartment may appear cheaper but when you combine groceries, utility bills, commute costs, furnishings its gonna be the same price as a dorm if not more. \n\nThe best job you can get while in college are on-campus jobs since they work around your schedule\n\nLook at your school's room plans ain't dorms can vary in side",
