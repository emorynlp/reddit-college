  "text": "I'm trying to save up for a car right now, but the college in my town might not be right for me and I might have to move everything to a different city or state. How do you do it? Is it better to get an apartment or live in the dorms? Are dorms big enough to put a lot of stuff? How do you afford anything if you don't know what kind of jobs there are in the area? I've lived in a small town my whole life, so the thought of just getting up and moving to a big city is making me afraid of going anywhere at all.",

I sold my car recently and decided to go car free with no regrets and im not even in a city so you'll be even better off than me \n\n\nI suggest you stay in a dorm. Yea sure an apartment may appear cheaper but when you combine groceries, utility bills, commute costs, furnishings its gonna be the same price as a dorm if not more. \n\nThe best job you can get while in college are on-campus jobs since they work around your schedule\n\nLook at your school's room plans ain't dorms can vary in side",

I could do the no car thing, but my family will all be a couple hours away or more and I don't want to make them drive all the way to my place.\n\nIf the dorms are big enough, then I'd rather go there just to simplify things. Plus, I'm sure everything will be within walking distance anyways.\n\nI agree about the jobs. A lot of available ones don't pay very well and can be very stressful.",

      "text": "If you have a license, you can rent moving trucks, like U-haul, even with little driving experience, which is very scary imo lol. Depending on how far it is, it could be a better option to hire a moving company and have them do the driving for you. \n\nGenerally, dorms will be small and shared between a few others, so I doubt you\u2019ll be able to fit many of your belongings beyond your daily essentials. Apartments could be an option as well as a house if you can find roommates. Look on your college\u2019s Facebook group or community forums/discords for prospective roommates if you want to go this route. More often than not, it will be cheaper and you will have a much bigger living space. \n\nAs for jobs, there is a huge labor shortage in many parts of the world, especially in America, so I can nearly assure you that you would be able to find a job. Check job posting boards like indeed. Hopefully this helps a little :)",

I can get around, but the thought of driving a couple hours or more in a big U-haul truck makes me nervous, so I might hire someone. \n\nI have quite a lot of stuff, so finding roommates might be my only option. That's also true about the labor shortage. I'm making a decent wage right now, I'm just worried about barely scraping by in a new area.",

      "text": "Apartments off-campus are cheaper than dorms in some places. You'll likely feel more independent in an apartment than in a dorm. Sometimes the responsibility of an apartment can be too much for a freshman straight out of high school. The perk of dorms is the social environment and that furniture is included. Dorms are pretty small, so you won't need to bring a lot of stuff. Most people take out loans to afford expenses, however it is best to try to borrow as little money as possible so you aren't swamped with debt after graduating. Check the school's job board or financial aid website to get an idea of what campus jobs are paying. Depending on where you go to school, you might not need a car. Some colleges actually don't allow freshmen to bring cars on campus. Not having a car can save you a lot of money.",

          "text": "Thanks for the response. I've actually been out of high school for a couple years. I used to rent an apartment with other people until I had to move back in with my dad. I did enjoy the independence of an apartment, but I'd also like to be more social and make new friends. My only concern about the dorms is that I own a lot of music gear and don't know how much of it I'd be able to fit.\n\nI'll check what I can do for on-campus jobs. Trying to get a car has been an issue for me, especially this year since there seems to be a shortage, so that would be great if I don't need one. I just don't want my family to have to drive over if I'm far away.\n\nI'm sure everything would be fine if I ask admissions counselors what to do and do some research about the schools ahead of time. I'm just afraid of being so far from home and being way in over my head with everything by myself.",
