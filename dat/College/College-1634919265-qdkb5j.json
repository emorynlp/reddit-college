  "text": "Hello everyone! Can someone give some advice on how to take notes better in college classes? Cause when I'm in the course or lab I take too many notes (like I try to write everything the teacher says because I don't really retain too much info from the classes so I try to write everything down as fast I can on paper and then need to rewrite it on my notebook, and it's taking ages, I pretty sure this is ineffective and doesn't produce me any benefit, but as I said I do this cause even if I don't take to many notes I kinda forget what we talked in the class after is done or even when I am still in) +\n\nHow could I study better? My memory isn't very good at retaining too much info from all the classes, I think is because I did pretty bad in HS (I was like a C+ always, in easier classes I would get B's and rarely A's), even though I took my last Exams with a nice grade so I can get in almost every college I can (PS: cause I am not from the US, the HS grades don't really matter that much, just the finals). Now I am running low on time cause I have so many notes that I need to write in my notebooks for each class, and is frustrating me.",
