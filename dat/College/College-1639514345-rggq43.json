  "text": "the entire semester I didn't study, cause I don't feel like I belong to Computer Science, tomorrow we are doing the first exam this semester.\n\nlast Friday I was so terrified and almost gave up, knowing that it's only 6 days before the exams and I was 1% ready\n\nthat day was my turn to cook and do the dishes\n\nwhen I was chopping vegetables. I experienced a very weird calm silence, it felt like the world has stopped.\n\nmy anxiety and the panic attack totally vanished\n\nit's was almost out of body experience,\n\nI think I experienced mindfulness, and I studied that night like I never did, I was totally focused on my learning material\n\nand since Friday, I have been doing my new ritual before studying\n\ntomorrow is my exam, and I'm very excited",
