  "title:": "I'm 32, how do afford to live and go to school at the same time. I feel helpless.",
  "text": "I went to college for one year straight out of high school when you'd be considered an absolute failure if you didn't.\n\nI had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared and my parents relationship with money and their horrible finances made it very hard for me to take on debt. I was terrified.\n\nNow, I'm single 32m and I want to do something besides tread water. I have jumped around to jobs but I always felt like I wasn't in the right place. I made a post earlier today on r/findapath I have a lot of skills and hobbies but I just don't know what to focus on for a career that won't feel like a waste. I am prepared to figure out how to pay for it and what not but I don't get it.\n\nI can barely make it just working, I pay for everything on my own as many of us do and I know people make it work. But jesus christ, adding that workload and responsibility, gas and time for 4 years seems incredibly daunting. \n\nAny guidance is appreciated",

      "text": "Have you considered a local community college? I can relate with your story. Went to community college right out of high school not knowing what I wanted to do. Did 2 years, terrible student and still didn't know what I wanted to do. Had/have a okay job, got hands on experience in a promotional/print company for the last several years. Getting ready to turn 30 and wanted to do something else. Did some research again at the community college I had gone to. Went back and finished up what I had started originally, but wanted to do more. Started a whole new program in web and mobile development and not far from finishing. All while retaining my current job and everything else that comes with adulting. And the college is significantly cheaper then the big universities around. And if I finish up, and want to pursue one of those, that door is open.\n\nEdit: and this is all while only taking 2 classes a semester. And for me at least, the work load wasn't enough to blow everything else out of the water. So the journey has been long, but im sure it will be worth it.",
