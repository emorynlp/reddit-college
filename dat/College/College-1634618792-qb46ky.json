  "text": "In high school, I was always good at my English classes. I'm currently a freshman in community college, and now that a few months have passed, I'm gonna say this: I hate English. Currently, I have an average C in my English class, whereas in high school my grade was more likely to be an A or a B. The problem with my English professor is that whenever he tells me I need to rewrite my essays, he never explains what parts in my essay need fixing. He gave me a checklist of errors to look out for in my essays. When I used the checklist for my next essay, he again told me I should rewrite it. It's like he expects me to write the most perfect essay in the world. My professor has driven me to the point where I don't enjoy English anymore.",
