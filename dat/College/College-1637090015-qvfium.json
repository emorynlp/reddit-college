  "text": "As a new student, the faculty will be the one responsible for choosing our first semester schedules and I have no problem with it. I just received my schedules today and I noticed that I have around 3 hours between my class.\n\nMy earliest class is around 12PM until 2PM and later from 4PM to 6PM. It's from Monday to Thursday, repeated every week in this semester. \n\nI'm fine with it, but I don't know what to do in between classes. With my lazy ass I probably will stay at the campus doing something. Do you got any ideas what to do?\n\nAnd is it normal to have long break between classes? Of course next semester I will try to choose classes that is close in time.",
