  "text": "In the fall, a lot more of us are going to be able to return to housing or do it for the first time. What\u2019s some tips you\u2019d give new residents? For me:\n\n1. Don\u2019t just room with your friend because. You might have totally different schedules or habits.\n\n2. Communication is everything. \n\n3. You might not make friends with your roommate but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be polite to them.",

There are a lot of annoyances that will just make you miserable if you let them get to you. Complaining about everything might alienate people from you, or you might end up getting passive aggressive \u2013 e.g. they might leave puddles outside the shower, let their alarm ring for too long in the mornings, play music you don't like too loud, have boyfriends/girlfriends that you can't stand, etc. That being said -- definitely set your boundaries. Maybe you decide you have to ignore loud music as long as it's before midnight or not during exams, for example, and speak up when it breaks your boundaries. For me, I grew up in a family of professional cleaners and others' standards of cleanliness drove me crazy, even when they said they cleaned up. (e.g. not rinsing dishes, not cleaning the taps when they clean the bathroom, not mopping after they sweep when the floor needs it, etc.) I realized that as long as my roommates are making an effort, if something isn't clean enough for me, I should clean it myself to my own standards rather than letting the problem irritate me until I resent the people around me.",

I know that this sounds like boomer advice but unless you have a job or have a very good plan at the Bank of Dad you will need to learn how to manage money.\n\n-People are nasty. If you have communal showers, bring a pair of flip flops to wear in the shower. People will come back to the dorms on the weekends and do some cursed things in those bathrooms.\n\n-The bathrooms will likely have 1 or 2 ply toilet paper. If you can't handle it, bring your own.\n\n-Bring air freshener. I reccomend the ones you plug into the wall. This is not only to make your room smell good but also to protect against your neighbors. One time the guys across the hallway from me hot boxed their room and the whole wing smelled like weed for a day.\n\n-Bring trash bags for your trashcan. It makes everything so much easier. If you have a smaller trashcan use tall kitchen sized bags. Bring a Swiffer too and do a once over of your floors with a dry pad maybe once a month or so. But in general, just try and be clean, don't be a stereotypical college kid who wrecks their dorm. You are now an adult, start acting like one.\n\n-Join as many clubs as you can handle in the first two weeks and drop the ones you don't like. Many of them were likely virtual for the last year so they will be very welcoming to new people. If you are having trouble making freinds, this is your best option.\n\n-If you have a room mate don't let your expectations get very high.",

Bring pictures to stick on your wall with tack. Bring a plunger if you have your own bathroom and plenty of bathroom cleaning supplies. Bring a mini vacuum, this will come in handy if you are a girl/will room with women because hair will get everywhere. Get a lamp with a USB outlet attached for charging! Bring a small book lamp to study at night so you won\u2019t blast roommates with the light of your lamp. Definitely get a laptop/book desk you can set on your lap/bed and a comfy, collapse-able cushioned chair. Bring blanket and pillows. Have a bin to store food or cosmetics. Invest in lots of sticky notes to put on your desk to remind you of assignments. Definitely get a laundry hamper. When I lived at a dorm I brought way too much stuff so it\u2019s great to be a minimalist.

I\u2019ve seen plenty of roommates that let a small difference in cleaning habits drive a huge wedge between them, I\u2019ve also seen friendships that existed before college end because of disagreements when living together. Don\u2019t live with your friend from before college freshman year, wait until you can at least get an apartment with separate bedrooms.  \n5. Every single person needs alone time, even the people who seem to be very social and always partying. If you and your roommate have classes all around the same time plan an hour or two a week at the library or another common area so your roommate will have some time to just relax by themselves in the room, and have them do the same for you. When it comes to romantic interests, don\u2019t be the person who will never let a roommate have someone over. Of course it\u2019s not okay for them to hookup with someone when you have to be up at 7 am, but giving you and your roommate giving each other a couple Friday nights each to have a guest over is reasonable. I guess I\u2019m trying to say don\u2019t be that person who never leaves the room. \n6. Depending on the school you go to it might be common to sign leases for the next school year during the first semester. Be careful about who you sign a lease with, if it\u2019s someone who constantly complains about their current roommate there\u2019s a good chance they are also a problem roommate themselves.",

People in your wing and below you will have different schedules and you will be the asshole/bitch for not thinking of that.\n\nUse the study hall if you find your room too distracting. Seriously discipline yourself on time management to knock out your studies (reading, do a chunk of your paper that is due in a few weeks, etc.) hopefully by Thursday afternoon so when you got that weekend coming up you can really relax. \n\nGet involved with your dorm, be it working the front desk or being part of a resident leadership group. Looks great on a resume even if money is not an issue and you don\u2019t really need a job, and you meet a lot of great people.\n\nFind people in your classes who are also in your dorm. Easy study group in PJs, plus you\u2019ve made a social connection that could translate into good roommates when you finally move to off campus housing.\n\nDon\u2019t be a dick to the RA if you fuck up and they catch you breaking any rules (e.g. drinking and underage, pot, etc.) A good RA will note you were compliant and dumped your alcohol down the drain when asked if they have to write you up, and that could mean the difference between a simple warning from the RD or potentially being kicked out if you try to do some dumb shit and try to fight them. \n\nFinally, remember why you are there. Too many freshman get a taste of freedom and are on academic probation by December and dropped out by the following May because they can\u2019t handle being independent, thinking like a child and the satisfaction of \u201cnow\u201d and not as a fucking adult and the future forgetting to go to class or get the work done. When there are parties every weekend, fraternal/sorority membership to consider, or just overall fun things to do it\u2019s easy to fall into that trap. Take care of your business FIRST. There will be another party soon.",

You will be living with your roommate for the year and you shouldn\u2019t be miserable in the one place you should have the most comfort.

Don't play music out loud and assume other people can \"just ignore it.\" If you are sensitive to sound (like yours truly) get some noise cancelling headphones (airpod pros aren't too great about it imho)\n\n\\- Might be an unpopular opinion but you can switch friends. The first people you meet for freshman orientation do not have to stay your best friends. If you start to get weird vibes from them or just aren't enjoying their company then you can start to drop the relationship (obviously you can still be nice to them though)\n\n\\- Try to be friends with upperclassman for car rides and advice (and just being friends lol)\n\n\\- Nobody is thinking about you as much as you think they are. People (tend to be) more mature and realize we are all different people. I have seen multiple people wear pajamas to the dining hall. Nobody cares. Look up the spotlight effect. If you made a joke and no one laughed, they probably will forget in less than an hour. \n\n\\- Getting a bad grade on a test is not the end of the world. Talk to to the prof, go to tutoring and try your best to do better next time. \n\n\\- Use your resources! Especially with bigger colleges, they are so many things they offer like free shirts, free tutoring, money advice, libraries, random buildings to study in, free printing, etc. You (or your parents) are paying for this! Use it!\n\n\\- Join an excess amount of clubs in the first couple of weeks then drop out of the ones you're not in love with (i.e. go from 5 to 2 clubs)",

They have soap in the scrubbing head so you can just pop one in and then throw it away. Also, clean your toilet. If I had a dollar for every room I've been in with a nasty moldy toilet--\n\n* (If you have a kitchen) just straight-up never leave dishes in the sink. Wash stuff as soon as you're done using them. If everyone does it the sink is always clear, and if you're the only one doing it then you earn the right to nag your roommates.\n\n* Buy a small hand vacuum. Full-sized vacuums are impractical, but you shouldn't not vacuum. They're like $50 (and you can also use them to catch flies and stuff). \n\n* It's a good idea to keep one wastebasket by your desk/bed and one in the common area. You will 100% use both.\n\n* If you like spray-on deodorant/perfume/cologne please use it in the common area or the bathroom. Your roommate will thank you.\n\n* Disinfecting wipes\n\n* Laundry bag to keep your dirty laundry in one place and to make it easier to bring laundry to/from the laundry room. Don't use a basket or a hamper. They suck for dorming.",

I don't think most people expect their housemate/roommate to be meticulous, they just don't want rotting food in the sink or your dirty underwear on their pillow.\n\nMental illness can also make people nasty. It can make you abusive. Doesn't make it an excuse or a get-out-of-jail-free card in those situations either. If your mental illness is impacting others significantly then it's your responsibility to get treatment and to work on reducing that impact.

No one gives a shit if you leave clothes on the floor of your room in an apartment or if you haven't made your bed perfectly.\n\nBut if you leave dirty dishes all over the place until they grow mould then you are actively impairing other people's ability to feed themselves safely. If you have such bad personal hygiene that it repels people then you're impairing their ability to focus, to study well, and to simply enjoy *their* living quarters.\n\nThe moment your mental illness impacts other people, it's your responsibility to do something about it. If someone mentions the problem to you and you refuse to fix it, you make excuses, or you just don't really try to change, then that's rude, irresponsible, and unfair *to the other person*. It's unfair even if you try and fail to change. If you're going to harm the people you live with then you shouldn't be living with other people at all.\n\nIt's absolutely not right to shame the housemates who are suffering from that behaviour. That's what you're doing if you say \"oh they might be depressed though\". It's an attempt to deflect blame and responsibility, and to say that you can't ask that person to do better because they're ill. You absolutely can ask that person to do better and you should expect it. If they fail to meet basic liveable standards then that needs to be reported to an RA or the housing association in general.",

If you've never had a fight or disagreement with your friend (that you actually talked about and weren't just passive-aggressive about) then it should be okay. If it's a surface-level friendship/you would feel awkward asking them to (not) do something then rooming together might ruin what you have.",
