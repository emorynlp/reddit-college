  "title:": "I need advice for dealing with a non-responsive online-professor that hasn't shown any interest in teaching.",
  "text": "I am in an all online class at a local college and the professor refuses to acknowledge the posts done by students stating their confusion and errors in the class. This is surprising since every other teacher here has been incredibly awesome.\n\nSo I'm at a loss as what to do. We are past the time to unenroll. I was sure that maybe the first 2 weeks were a fluke and maybe something happened on their end but now at week 3/4 nothing has changed.\n\nWe have had assignments that were impossible to complete and turn in due to there being no submissions page. \n\nWe had a full chapter review that seemed to be from an entirely different class. The syllabus was also from a different class from winter quarter that seemed to be a hybrid of online and in person.\n\nWe have had several posts on the forum for homework and general discussion and the teacher hasn't responded once. They state in a post (probably left from another quarter) that they will always respond in 24 hours. \n\nI had over a week of waiting for an e-mail reply from the teacher that only came in the form of a short poorly worded 2 sentence reply that didn't address half of my concerns. Also this email response was only **after I contacted the head of the math department** and told them I was concerned since there was no signs of life from the teacher. By the time she got back to me the assignments were already due.\n\nI would like to continue the class since its an all online class and allows for me to spend dozens of hours going at my pace. I am a slow learner to say the least. This class is perfect for me except for the fact that lesson videos are missing, the teacher doesn't teach at all and the tests are broken. We had one test with concepts we never touched and another test with missing questions that counted against our grade.\n\nOf the 2 other students I have had contact with, they seem to be having an equally mediocre experience albeit a more positive attitude about it. I haven't seen any posts from the other students though enrolled in the class outside of an introductions post we had to do.\n\nDo I just keep a document of all of the issues that come up and give it to the head of the math department? I still think I can pass with a good grade since we can redo questions a few times. It shows me having a low grade right now but its since none of the written assignments have been graded. \n\nOr do I complain now to the head of the math department and risk having the teacher hate me? I really don't want to shoot myself in the foot and make it awkward if I see her when I attend the college in person.",

      "text": "Who cares if you make it awkward between that teacher and you? Don\u2019t forget you are paying hundreds of dollars to learn something from that class. If the professor isn\u2019t doing their job then that\u2019s an issue.\n\nYou could always teach our to the teachers and express these issues or concerns. But honestly, I  would just address the issues with the head of the department. Maybe explain it to them in a way that doesn\u2019t accuse the teacher of not doing their job, but expresses concern for them. You could always ask the department to keep the complaint anonymous if that\u2019s an option.",

      "text": "I would strongly recommend not going to the head of the math department unless it is a last resort - especially if you can wing a good grade in the class. Professors like this can sometimes be vindictive when put on the hot seat. There is also only so much that the head of the math department can do, especially if the prof has tenure. \n\nIf things don't get better, I would recommend reaching out to your academic counselor and they might have some suggestions. Also, if you are struggling with the actual material or understanding of assignments, try to get 4 or 5 people in the class to be in a group chat. This way you can bounce ideas back and forth, etc. Good luck!",
