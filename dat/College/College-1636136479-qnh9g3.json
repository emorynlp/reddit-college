  "text": "I\u2019m a psychology major with a minor in poli-sci and plan on going for my Ph.D once I finish undergrad and then maybe in the long run get into local politics. However, I also have a love for psychiatry and I would pretty much equally love to be in either profession. But of course medical school is very hard, the pre-reqs are difficult, and it takes a long time to get through (psychiatrists do a 4 year residency program after they get their doctorate). The reason I was thinking about doing this is so once I graduate I have the option to go to either med school or go for my Ph.D, and I\u2019d be able to balance my degree requirements with medical school requirements. I\u2019ve heard that medical schools don\u2019t like when you take core classes over summer and winter semesters, but I wanted to know some people\u2019s opinions on doing this is",

      "text": "I think getting your doctorate of psychology (PsyD) would be a better. Med school is great but you don\u2019t get to pick your speciality. For residency selection you pick your top 3, if you don\u2019t get matched into psychiatry you\u2019d be kinda screwed.\n\nI also don\u2019t know if being a psychiatrist would satisfy you depending on your career goals. Most psychiatrists do medication management.",

          "text": "Yeah all your points are really good. There\u2019s not really a reason to cram all that work just to see if I could get into med school and potentially not even be the only type of doctor I\u2019m considering",
