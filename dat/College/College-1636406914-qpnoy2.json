      "text": "Technically you are supposed to put down the one you lived with more in the last 12 months and if this is equal then you are supposed to put down which one provided more financial support.\n\nIt's rare for them to do any sort of audit based on which divorced parent you claim. FAFSA will mainly flag based on reported income and assets. A lot of people who visit their divorced parents minimally will just put the one with lower income.",
