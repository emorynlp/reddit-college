  "text": "Basically because of my 21 credit hours and this class's very lenient resubmission policy (infinite resubmission until december 4th midnight) I ignored it so I could better focus on my other classes. Starting at 4 am of december 4th I performed all the labs and completed all the assignments and they have since been graded. at this point I have enough points for an A in a class where I put in 8-9 hours of effort total and it just feels wrong",

Those classes can be solid boosts to a GPA, which in turn can makes your resume look slightly better, more competitive for postgrad programs, etc (not a gigantic advantage, but one nevertheless). It sucks that we have to waste time and money on things like that, but it's how college works right now and I just play along with the game. \n\nBut if it's a major class... yeah, I'd be disappointed, but I'd still take the A and try to dive deeper into the material in my free time if it mattered a lot to me.",

So usually there are maybe 9 or 10 total labs. Now in person, a lab could take between one and four hours. For a lot of instructors this semester, they were encouraged to give less work and be more lenient. So they could have easily only assigned an hour's worth of work per lab. That would give you about 1 hour a week for 9 weeks of lab. If it took you about 9 hours of a single day to complete it all, it's the same amount of time.",

Instead we currently have a system that requires contact hours whether or not students need it. \n\nIt would be far better to have degrees that are comprised of exams that students have to pass (think CLEP tests). No time limit. No \"terms\" or \"semesters\". No \"courses\". Students who struggle with one subject can take as long as they need to study it. Students who already have aptitude in a subject can just take the exam and get credit. Fail an exam? No worries, just take it again after a waiting period, 3 months, say. Study what you missed and then pass it. \n\nAll the learning resources are out there, no need for expensive teachers. I'm not going to lecture about calculus better than the free videos you get from MIT or wherever. Need help? There will be markets for tutors and faculty will probably host lectures on specific topics. Students can attend in person or virtually, like TED talks.",

As others point out, some students struggle mightily to get a C whereas others may get to an A rather easily. None of that is predictable. The course may also serve as a step toward other courses where the content may be more challenging. One thing US University accreditors look for is courses with \u201cHigh DFWIs\u201d or lots of low grades, withdrawals and incompletes.  If the course is a stepping stone to others in a major, it may be a gateway to ensure basic competency for more advanced work. And, yes, I know it feels wrong to someone who actually wants to learn. Own that, because not all students want to. Professors are also under pressure to get good reviews from students, even if they think they should teach more rigorously, so please add your voice politely to wanting more rigorous study. This can help both the professors department as well as advisors whose job it is to try and match you with your own learning goals. Good luck!",

Prior to the final, I was pretty much failing. Needless to say, I became a fucking accountant during finals week. Did nothing but study for that exam all week.

He self-studied the subject, so he had no classes for it. He put in a total of 3 hours study to learn a 2 year course (a hard one at that) from scratch and ended up getting a C on the exam. He was debating whether or not to just skip the paper, but decided not to. It turns out that that C got him into his college course. \n\nI still don't know whether or not I believe him as I took that subject and you'd have to be some kind of Einstein to learn all the material in 3 hours.",

Or you can learn as much as you can and retain what information possible and help make the world a better place. :)\n\nIMHO, I think there\u2019s a chance your professor is just being extra strict with the move from IRL classes to online and is trying to weed out cheaters.

                  "text": "Because I have 19 other credits hours to learn from. And it  is in its entirety a lab class, \nSo for this class I had 3 labs, for each lab I was given 2 models and would design and perform an experiment for with the goal of distinguishing between the 2 theories. Using the models you derive equations for the phenomena, and use statistical analysis to compare with the data, obtains someone else's data for an IV that your models predict statistically significantly different DVs . If there is overlap between the test DV and both theories including uncertainty you design a second iteration to try and not get overlap next time and try again. If there is only overlap with 1 theory you are in the sweet spot, and only have to design another iteration to reduce uncertainties but not actually perform.\n\nSorry for writing an essay describing this class, but I felt I needed to clarify what this class was to say I dont think I could get much more from it. The point I was trying to make in my original post was that by allowing infinite resubmission until the end of the class you open up a couple viable strategies that are not really conducive to learning. The worst method is brute forcing the assignments until you get the points you want, but it also allows you to cram.",
