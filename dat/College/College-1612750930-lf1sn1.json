For example, I\u2019m an Accounting Major taking Business Stat and I understood the first 5 chapters but now I\u2019m on chapter 7 and find myself using Chegg to complete my homework and quizzes. I do want to understand what I\u2019m doing but it\u2019s hard sometimes and find myself just completing the work to get a passing grade.",

Some things come easier, some harder, and some words you'll just never use because nobody around you talks about things that require those words. But you'll absorb what you need to. And you'll have the framework to figure out what you need when something new and confusing presents itself. \n\nSo instead of Mexico, you're living in your chosen field of study. You're learning the language of that field, and you'll pick up what you need. This gets easier to see the further on you go as patterns emerge and consistent themes arise. \n\nYou're more capable and intelligent than you realize. Your brain is astoundingly good at capturing things you don't think it is.",

Doing the pomodoro technique has helped me along with using outside resources (because my prof is literally the worst). Accounting is wayyy beyond me, but doing practice problems could help.

I get this really uncomfy feeling if I do something without understanding it, for example, just plugging and chugging into equations without understanding why it works. It's like an anxiety thing I guess. It also helps a lot for exams.\n\n\nIt's for this reason that I have never used Chegg and don't really plan on it. If I get the answer from online, the least I could do is try to reconstruct the solution based on the answer, sort of experiment to find the solution.\n\n\nThe only class I didn't do this in was in a major-required class whose concepts future class won't build off of, taught by a teacher who gave absurd extra credit and 95% of the class an A if you had half a brain, and was just in general a poorly taught and very confusing class with fairly unintuitive concepts (particularly since our teacher was awful). But in any other circumstance I really do try to understand what's going on. I start panicking if I don't and it's not good for my mental.",
