  "text": "I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ve wanted to be athletic trainer for college football. But I have one more year of college left and have had no guidance on how to start entering the field or what to do. I feel like such a failure compared to all my friends. I\u2019ve been going through a lot of family hardships which has messed me up for being on track to graduate and now I\u2019m a year behind. \n\nIf that didn\u2019t work out, my other option was to finish school and move to Toronto. I have no family there, no connections but I\u2019ve always longed for something different. I wish I could do an internship there or something.",
