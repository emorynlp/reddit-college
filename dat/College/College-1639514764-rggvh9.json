  "text": "So I'm a freshman closing out my first semester of college and it's been horrible academically. I'm going to end the semester with an A, a B-, a B, and what is looking to be a D+ in one of my classes that's 4 credits. I've been so depressed that on some days I don't leave my room, and if I'd actually gone to class I would have a B instead of a D. I was absent to class I think 30 times, and because of that my professor subtracted 12 points from my total grade. It makes me so fucking upset that I did this but at the same time I couldn't make myself get up to go to class. In high school I succeeded academically, getting near perfect ACT scores, high GPA, and good extracurricular involvement. Here, I'm going to get a D in what was supposed to be a lighter semester of work. Nobody in my family has gone to college so they can't help me. I'm too embarrassed to tell my peers about my situation. I'm yet to tell my parents, too. I lastly haven't reached out to anyone other than my professor in the class I'm shitting the bed in but she doesn't give a shit about me in the end. I feel like a complete failure. Six months ago, I would've been shocked to get even a C in one of my classes... Now, I'm going to get a fucking D on my transcript! I don't feel like I belong at college where everyone else is so capable and motivated when I just seem to be stuck in the mud.",

      "text": "Welcome to college. College can be *much* harder than high school. It requires more studying, dedication, *and* strategy. I'm a freshman too. College can be literal hell. I made a few mistakes. But I'm still adjusting and learning. As I gain experience, I'm adjusting my strategy as I adapt. You'll be doing that too. It's just your first year. Don't be too hard on yourself. Focus on what you can control, and discard the rest. You got a D, it's not the end of the world. You can move on, learn from this, and prepare for your next semester with a bit more wisdom. Now you know not to skip 30 classes from now on.",

If I could've gotten my ass to class I would've gotten good grades so that's the plan for next semester. The wake-up call came too late, though, so I don't plan to fuck up again and get lost in my head",
