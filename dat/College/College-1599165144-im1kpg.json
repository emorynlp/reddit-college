  "title:": "Sent home after two weeks of classes",
  "text": "If you\u2019ve seen the news in the US, you may have heard about my college, SUNY Oneonta. I moved there on the 17th of August and classes started on the 24th. I am back home. I left on Monday after exactly three weeks being there, concerned for my safety.\n\nI\u2019m a freshman, and I would not be afraid to admit that my peers are the reason why we were sent home. Covid cases spiked like crazy, and at 200 cases the school announced a 2 week shut down. That\u2019s when I decided to go home for the rest of the semester. Only three days later, -today- the cases are now at almost 400 and we have learned everyone is being sent home for the rest of the semester. \n\nI took two tests and am thankfully negative. Though I cannot assure the same for my peers as I already know a few people from my dorm who were not as lucky.\n\nAny questions?\nAsk away.\n\nEdit: I left Reddit for a few days while moving back home and getting my routine adjusted... just came back to the awards and so so many comments which I\u2019ll try to get to! \nThank you guys for all the love! (\u02f6\u203e\u1dc4 \u207b\u032b \u203e\u1dc5\u02f5)\n\n(Also cases are now at 700 so I\u2019m really glad I came home lol)",

Did you get sent home in two weeks because people were being stupid and throwing parties? yeah but you would\u2019ve gotten sent home anyway. The reason they opened up is so that you would have to pay for housing and school and then when things got bad they could just send you home and seem like heroes because they\u2019re doing what they should be. Everybody pinning The spread of an extremely infectious disease on other students allows the school to get away with this. They put a bunch of young people (Who scientifically are bad at making good decisions) in close quarters together so that they could get your money. It is predatory as hell. They take advantage of young people who are excited to go to school for the first time and get out of their parents house desperate for their first taste of freedom. And put you guys in a situation where you could get sick.\nEdit: spelling and grammar",

              "text": "That's crazy. At my school, you're required to quarantine in your room until you've received two negative, and during that time you're aren't allowed to leave your room except for the bathroom and picking up delivered meals on the first floor. After the initial in-room quarantine period, we are tested twice a week, and aren't allowed to leave campus. If you are anywhere other than your room and suite common room, you must wear a mask and keep six feet apart. All meals are take-out and clubs are not allowed to meet in person. All gatherings must be kept to at most ten people, and everyone must be wear masks and social distance. Any violation of the testing, quarantine, and gathering regulations results in immediate removal from campus. So far, one student violated quarantine by attempting to test their swipe card access to a building while on there way from the initial test to their dorm, and they were disciplined within the hour. Since then, we haven't had any other known violations.  \n\nWith student life so restricted at my school, I just don't understand how other schools can pretend like nothing's going on. I'm also  surprised by this equal but opposite attitude of \"it's going to fail inevitably, so might as well do what we want\". Covid at colleges is a serious issue that requires taking serious restrictions, but it can still be navigating by adhering to those restrictions. If you pretend it isn't going to work, it isn't going to work. At that point, you're just shooting yourself in the foot.",

My schools cases are at 68 right now, (about 5%), and they\u2019re holding steady at that number, but my school is also doing an awful job at contact tracing. Contact tracers told me that they are only contacting students/faculty who were in direct contact with isolated students within 48 hours of them being tested.

They\u2019re also taking a bunch of precautions and classes are hybrid leaning towards mainly online. I saw someone\u2019s parents refusing to wear masks earlier (it\u2019s move in day) & they legit got kicked out. It\u2019s also a very small school with no Greek and very little party culture. I think we stand a better chance than bigger schools and schools that aren\u2019t taking it seriously. So I\u2019m somewhat hopeful that we could maybe make it. But I might just be naive. \n\nEven if I\u2019m stuck in my dorm 99% of the time I\u2019d rather be here, 800 miles from home, so that I can be independent because that helps me grow as a person.",

At least we have really good info about how we're doing. I kinda hope we just get sent home sooner rather than later because I'm sick of living with this fantasy that it'll work out. First week or two on campus were pretty good but if we're just bouncing in and out of lockdowns, that's gonna suck.

I go to Notre Dame and we had a big initial outbreak but it all traced back to off campus parties (at a school where 80% of students are on campus). They locked down more strictly for 2 weeks and cases slowed down so much and the positivity rate dropped from >20% to <1% with massively increased testing. Now we're back to in-person classes and we're all very optimistic for the rest of the semester. Clearly the blame is on the students who disregarded the rules and not on the administration who has done everything in their power to provide students the college experience they deserve and pay for.",

Second, you're assuming that the rabbits don't want to be there -- they do! The overwhelming majority of the student body STRONGLY desires to be on campus. As an architecture major, I literally cannot receive a proper education from 1000 miles away with a dining room table in place of a drafting desk and a virtual professor instead of an interactive studio environment.",

Some of them have jobs and internships to tend to. But others are just there to party. This is the kind that mostly would not be there without the justification of in-person classes. There are also faculty and staff, and residents of the surrounding area who have little say in the matter but are affected nonetheless.",
