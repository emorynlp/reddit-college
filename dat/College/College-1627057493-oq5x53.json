If it's people sharing homework answers that are worth 15% of the grade, it's probably not a hill worth dying on. If they're cheating on exams I'd probably report it.",

You want to stay morally sound and do everything the right way? Or would you take the ethically-gray route and guarantee your success?\n\nIf you're cheating for a side class or a gen ed, yeah go for it. It's required you take those so it's literally not worth the risk of potentially failing. If it's a class you need for a major, don't cheat.

      "text": "Had a similar situation. The grade wasn't curved, but I could lose my 'scholarship' if I fell below average (love the EU btw). During online classes everyone cheated and so did I, not ashamed of it, the exams were done in such a way that it was just too easy. If those are the rules then you have to adapt and cheating becomes a part of the exam. TL, DR: if it's too easy to cheat, it basically becomes a part of the exam.\n\nIf you don't know the matereal by heart, cheating won't do you any good. (if you have 1 min. to find an answer in 450 PowerPoint slides). So I guess you have to learn something.\n\nI mostly cheat in classes that I don't care about, because in the classes that I like, I study the matereal for fun and interest.\n\nIn conclusion I'd say cheating is fine if the exams make it too eaay to do so. Cheating in irrelevant classes is ok, because who tf gives a sh. Seriously study what is important to your career. Strayed off topic, but these are my general thoughts on cheating",

If you make those connections in class, you might need to tread carefully. Try to maintain as much anonymity as possible if you decide to snitch or just intensify your studying so you get the grade you want without the curve. If you don't know these people and never will, then go to the professor and reap the rewards.",
