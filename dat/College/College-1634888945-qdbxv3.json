  "text": "I go to a very small university, our residence is about 300 people. Everyone on my dorm floor is pretty quiet and respectful except for 7 people. These 7 people are some of the loudest human beings on earth (and I grew up with 4 brothers, I\u2019m used to noise)\n\nI don\u2019t care how loud they are on the weekend or at what time they are loud on the weekend, it\u2019s weeknights that I care about. Our walls are paper thin and if anything the doors just amplify the sound into my dorm. All of the boys shower together at 11:30 at night, running down the hall in shower shoes, yelling to each other. Around 1 a.m. they slam the doors and go around to each others rooms, then run down and yell down the hall a little more. The biggest issue is, I can hear them through my earplugs. \n\nThey aren\u2019t even my direct neighbors, they are 3 and 4 doors down.\n\nI have asked them to keep it down a few times, one time I finally snapped after pulling a 36 hour all nighter (I promptly apologized for snapping). Nothing has changed, every night just as loud.\n\nCan I write on the whiteboard on my door \u201cI will pay you to shut up\u201d or \u201cplease stop stampeding after 11\u201d?\n Anyone got any ideas? \n\nAlso, no, my university doesn\u2019t have quiet hours, quiet hour are supposed to be always here so there is no specific time.",
