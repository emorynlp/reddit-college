  "text": "My anthropology class all year has had no study guides for exams or review sessions. They just tell you what\u2019s on the test (what lectures and labs) and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no recording for lectures and the slides are very minimal in information. Is this normal? Also, how should I study for this? It\u2019s a cumulative exam on all lectures and labs.",

      "text": "This is absolutely normal, and it will only get more common as you get into more advanced courses. Study guides and such are like intellectual training wheels.\n\nThe best thing to do is to go through all the notes you have taken and ensure that you have a solid understanding of the most important concepts. If you\u2019ve been studying and preparing all semester, it will be a bit easier than if you haven\u2019t. Either way, you got this!",
