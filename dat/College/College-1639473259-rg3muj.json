  "text": "I would love to hear some feedback! \n\nI am developing a series of short e-learning courses on stress-free productivity for college students, because I wish I had known all these things when I was in college myself \u2026 So I'm hoping to help students who are in the same situation I was in: overwhelmed, frustrated and procrastinating. \n\nThe first short course is ready to be published, and I would love to hear some feedback! [This is the reviewlink](https://360.articulate.com/review/content/e3eac740-b550-4cce-b3d5-7f7acb0e2dcf/review)\n\nNote: eventually, I will be selling these short courses, so I was in doubt whether I could post this here, having a commercial goal and all (I checked with the mods last week, but didn\u2019t get a reply?). Obviously this first course is free, and I\u2019m far from making money on this concept, but still. Feel free to delete this post if it\u2019s not in line with the rules.",
