You will have to explain them, and if you write about a hard family life that will help. \n\nIf you have a police record or school records of misbehaving, that's what you face.

      "text": "It depends on what you did and what the ramifications were. If it\u2019s documented on your high school transcript or criminal record, that could influence your likelihood of being admitted to the college you want to go to, especially if it\u2019s a selective college.\n\n\nIf this is the case, you should address it in the extra information section of the application. Write about how you regret acting that way, the concrete steps you\u2019ve made to improve, and overall how you\u2019ve learned from the experience. \n\n\nIf it\u2019s on your high school transcript, you could go to a less selective college for a year or two and then try to transfer to a more selective college. Many colleges don\u2019t require a high school transcript if you\u2019re a transfer student.\n\n\nIf it isn\u2019t on your school transcript or criminal record, you\u2019ll be alright\u2014 colleges don\u2019t look up every applicant on the internet or check the things they do online.",

I'll just say it, but please don't bash me but around the ages of 14/15, i selled my nudes ;//// to get money and i was kinda influenced by. group of girls on Instagram. i told my therapist in school and she had to make a report. cps got involved and detectives. they had to go through my phone, etc. after that i never done it again. around that time i was sexualizing myself too and i liked older guys. now, i learned that i was Immature and me liking older guys was from trauma. i still like them but i calmed it down bc people told me that i was a \"victim\" but idk i find that hard to believe bc it was my fault. \n\nso after all of that, would that like be on my criminal record??? since cps and police were involved? will that be on my hs transcript? I'm sorry i just need more elaboration because i am slow. i also have other stuff that is like making me worried and i need to know but i don't want to put out all details on the internet lol is it okay if i msg you?",

Something that would be on the high school transcript would be academic probation, suspension, expulsion etc. And if someone has a criminal record it would mean that they went to trial and were found guilty of committing a crime (misdemeanor or felony). If neither of those things happened, the college isn\u2019t going to find out about that incident. So it won\u2019t impact your ability to get into college :)",

Because you were a minor, the people who convinced you to do this and the people who paid you are the guilty parties. You are recovering from their abuse and it's normal to feel guilty for this. But you are fine. You could even turn this around and use it as the topic of an essay about how children should be more protected from sexual abuse on the internet. Victims' rights and recovery are huge topics for growth and a great thing to promote.",

You can volunteer at an event that raises money for a children's sexual assault center or a domestic violence center. You can talk to people and help in many ways. I mentioned essays only because a lot of colleges want you to express what your ideals or goals or dreams are in an essay, and that would be great. You don't have to reveal that this is something you were affected by, but it might even help you if you did. You are a strong survivor! Keep up with your therapist and recovery a d you'll do great!",
