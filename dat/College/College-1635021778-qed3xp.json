  "text": "Genuinely curious what your opinions are on this. \n\nFor example, I have an exam on Monday evening; this gives me plenty of time to study beforehand. There have been times where studying before an exam has proven beneficial, but other times, I choose to let loose and focus on other mind-healthy activities. I do feel guilty for not studying the day of an exam (at times), but I try to remind myself that I have been preparing for days on end and maybe enjoying myself before an exam won't be such a bad idea.\n\nThoughts?",

A lot of the times i remember parts i read and where they were in the book so you can kinda read the book in your mind and thus giving you info needed for the question. With the concentration part i'd look at how long the test is going to be. If it's a short test then i would be able to do the exam right after learning, but if it's a test of more than 2 hours i'd need some time between the studying and making the exam",

      "text": "I usually study a week before an exam. I have an upcoming exam in Calculus on Nov 1st. I plan to dedicate an hour every day reviewing what know, and spending the last two days working on topics I\u2019m confused about. I also generally wake up at 1:30am to study and go back to bed at 5am until class. It sounds excessive, I know, but in weaker subjects I want to make sure I\u2019m well prepared to pass my exams with good marks. \n\nMy point is, study based on how confident you feel about the material that will be covered. If you feel you feel there are subjects you\u2019re still confused about, then it may benefit you to spend a few more days studying. Also keep in mind that generally studying for one hour over the course of 2-3 days is more productive than studying for 3 hours in one day.",

An hour before the exam, I crammed. I just did some speed reading for all our lectures and I did great. But this might not work for you, everyone handles studying differently.",
