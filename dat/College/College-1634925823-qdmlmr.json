  "text": "I started college about 3 weeks ago. First week was actually great I talked to many people even though i\u2019m normally a very shy person.I thought it would last but now i lost contact with most of the people i met because we have different schedules. Almost all of my high school friends now go to parties almost every day but i haven\u2019t even hung out with anyone yet.I know these years will never come back. I also still live with my parents and they\u2019re overprotective and strict. I thought my life would change but sadly it didn\u2019t.Now i feel shitty and anxious about how I\u2019m wasting the best years of my life.",
