  "text": "I'm graduating from highschool soon with an IB diploma (hopefully). I'm originally Syrian and I wanted to know what cheap universities are out there in Canada, preferably as cheap as it gets, while offering computer science.\n\nI don't care for how great it is so much as just being accepted and moving there without it being too costly. I've seen threads like this here but they're all 5+ years old and the tuition fees for most unis listed back then has gone way up. I've looked up as much as I can but I can't find decent, cheap universities, and I thought I'd ask if any locals were more well informed on what my best choice is. I would say anything under $8k is good.\n\nI'd really appreciate some help, thank you so much :)",

      "text": "Under 8k might be hard. Local tuition is about 5k to 8k a year. International is usually like 12k to 20k!\n\nMy guess would be focus on places people don't usually go to, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and PEI for example are fairly boring provinces. The territories as well, although colder. If your French is good, also try Queb\u00e9c or other French universities like Universit\u00e9 de Saint-Boniface in Manitoba.\n\nIn Canada [there's a popular magazine ranking universities](https://www.macleans.ca/education/university-rankings/canadas-best-universities-by-reputation-rankings-2021/) might be worth trying those to figure out fees. \n\nColleges don't have a list, but you could [follow the wikipedia list of them](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_in_Canada). There's another for [private universities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_private_universities_in_Canada) which may be cheaper, I know some of the Mennonite schools offer lots of discounts but at the same time you have to follow all their rules.\n\nAnd while it's probably like 10k a year, Red River College in Winnipeg, Manitoba offers a Business Information Technology 2 year degree that is good? ~~Im going there so, feel obligated to sweet talk them~~\n\nBut yeah, I don't see you finding base turion that cheap. Good luck. Maybe also check out if Federal or Provincial student loans will cover you? I know here in Manitoba, Provincial loans are zero interest.",

          "text": "Thanks a lot for the detailed answer man, I guessed there wouldn't be many unis under 8k, but I thought I'd write down that price just in case I missed any. I'll be sure to look at all of these resources, thank you very much. \nCongrats on your acceptance to Red River! Always inspiring to see someone excited about where they're studying. \nI have a question though, how do you feel about algoma university in ontario? I've seen that it's actually pretty cheap, around $11k for everything such as residence books and food and tuition of course. Quite a low population at their Sault Ste. Marie campus, in the city there's only about 74k people haha, could mean things are cheap. Anyways I hope to hear your thoughts on that and would appreciate some feedback\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",

              "text": "Apologizes for wall of text;\n\nCan't say I've had much experience with Algoma but I recognize the name. Appears to be ranked about 75th nationally. I'd say it's probably acceptable, but going to be a very generic university and limited name recognition both because of school and Sault Ste. Marie in general. \n\nThis will make getting a job outside of Sault Ste. Marie harder. I would absolutely stress as hard as possible to get work experience in school. Sault Ste Marie does not have a huge industry for computer science-- that would be mostly Southern Ontario for financial, Quebec for gaming, Winnipeg has some startups and now Ubisoft. [Government has a break down per province of jobs forecast in industry](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/marketreport/outlook-occupation/5485/ca)\n\nI can't say much, not knowing the school or hiring in the industry, but I will stress get experience so you can get a job asap after!\n\nI do however, live nearish to Sault Ste. Marie and lived in Ontario before so I'll give you some facts on that assuming your at their Sault Ste. Marie campus\n\nSault Ste. Marie is pronounced Sue Saint Marie (with a better french accent) it's not salt saint marie unless your trying to annoy people.\n\nIt's very RURAL. Now technically, yes you are in a small city but you have very little around you. You are a single point of civilization in the middle of the woods.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba the nearest capital city is about 15 hours drive away. Thunder Bay, Ontario, the next largest city is about 8 hours drive away. Toronto, Ontario is about 8 hours drive the other way. \n\n( As an international student you might not be allowed to go across to the States, but Grand Rapids, MI is about 5hr drive and has a theme park, Milwaukee, WI is about 7hrs and Chicago, IL is about 8hr drive. )\n \nWhat this means, is there's basically what's in town (and delivery) and that's it. Everything else is far, major concerts and events will be a days drive away. Heck, its probably easier to drive to the states for some things. If your from a large city and used to things like cheap community theatre or something, you might feel isolated.\n\nYou'll almost certainly need access to a a car. [There appears to be some buses](https://saultstemarie.ca/City-Hall/City-Departments/Community-Development-Enterprise-Services/Community-Services/Transit/Bus-Routes-and-Schedules.aspx) but some is eight total routes. Not much for working late, snow storms, getting groceries. I would not move unless you can get an international driver's license, and then either get a car or if close enough don't but try to make tons of friends with cars.\n\nOn top of that, when you fly in you'll probably come into Vancouver, BC (I dunno the route from Syria, I assume BC) then have to land again in either Calgary/Edmonton, Winnipeg, or Thunder Bay and transfer to yet again land in Sault Ste. Marie. It has an airport, but it's not international and travel will be a bitch every time. That'll be exhausting, especially if your the person going back for holidays. It'll also make emergency travel much more expensive. \n\n( Admittedly, you could also go through the US which is sometimes cheaper but comes with more logistical issues. )\n\nNow, I apologize I don't know the climate of Syria but you should know Sault Ste. Marie is part of the Canadian Shield and on a lot of water. YOU'LL GET. SO MUCH SNOW. The Shield is an absolutely beautiful, huge, rocky forest filled with cliffs and thousands of lakes. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Shield) also just look at photos. Infact part of the trans-canada highway in that area is weaving between those rocks, and occasionally blown through rocks. Sault Ste. Marie is fucking gorgeous for camping and hiking, but come winter? You are shoveling. A lot. It'll be heavy, wet snow. The cold won't be horrid, [average is about -10 to -20c in Winter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sault_Ste._Marie,_Ontario) with dips into -30c and rarely lower. But it'll be humid in Winter there, compared to say the artic and that means shoveling and struggling a bit with windchill.\n\n( We have similar weather here in Winnipeg, but a little dryer and colder. It's honestly not that bad. ) \n\nLearn to shovel snow or get an apartment they do it for you. Shovel out your parking space. Don't park on the street when snowplows are coming. Learn to drive in snow. Carry a winter kit, shovel and kitty litter to give you traction on ice if car is stuck.\n\nCounter point of being isolated town in middle of nowhere is Sault Ste Marie is CHEAP. I live in Winnipeg, nearby and pay about $900 in rent and utilities, $150 in phone and internet, $120 transit, $250-300 in food, and another $50-$100 on whatever. You'll probably spend about the same there with cheaper rent. [Here's a crowd sourced cost of living estimater](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Sault-Ste-Marie) as well as Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and Padmapper are good places to look for rental prices. You can probably find about $600 rent easily.\n\nAlso Canadian internet and phone plans are insane, highest in the world I believe. Try desperately to find something cheap. I should get mine down to about $55 each soonish but, it's expensive. \n\nAlso, Ontario car insurance is expensive and sucks. Get some quotes before buying a car. Again I would stress if you can live with roommate who has one and lets you borrow it, much nicer.\n\nI can't speak much to the culture of the city, I've only been there once. Most of Canada has a somewhat accepting culture. By which I mean, most Canadians are like that's nice dear and don't actually care unless it's intruding on our life. /r/SaultSteMarie might have more info, but I'm going to assume it's safe for both international students and queer people (if you are) but being a smaller town might get slightly more bitchy old people who wouldn't actually do anything but will snidely comment. Winnipeg nearby has a month of multicultural stuff (Folkamara) and Thunder Bay I know has pride stuff so it's not like it's that bad, just, small city / town.\n\nLast thing, Ontario doesn't have federal and provincial loans, it's all combined under OSAP. Also. I do know most of the big 5 banks in Canada offer newcomer packages with credit cards and cheap accounts, and Canada has several programs for new immigrants but finding the one for your situation and funding / help can be hard.\n\nIf your a nature-y person, can drive, are okay being vaugely isolated and think forests look cool, you'll probably like it. If you want city, hate snow, or need to take a day trip somewhere you might wanna look elsewhere.\n\nAlso probably ask /r/Ontario and /r/SaultSteMarie and whatever other subreddits exist. There's gotta be a Canadian school one somewhere right?",
