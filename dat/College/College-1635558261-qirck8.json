          "text": "I know this is super cliche advice but just talk to people. This is my method: when youre wherever you eat, in class, library, etc make a comment to someone near you. Literally anything but its easiest if its something related to school. Ask how they think they did or will do on a test or quiz, if they did the hw yet, how theyre liking the class, whatever. Step 2 ask where theyre from, their major, etc. Step 3 ask for their number so you can compare homework answers/notes/whatever. This may seem awkward but just say \"hey can I get your number so we can _____\". Then at some point text them, either have a convo or ask to hang out and study or hang out and do other things. Try to do that at least once a day (start a convo, not text the same person everyday). I met a girl and we are very close friends now, we became friends when I sat next to her in class, I asked for her number and she asked if I wanted to have lunch with her and her friends. She wouldnt have done that if I didnt initiate the conversation. Idk what it is but people dont start conversations like they used to at college, I think everyones socially awkward from quarantine and online classes. Also last week made a friend, we were both at a professors office hours and when we left at the same time I got her number to compare hw answers. If your campus is small like mine youll tend to see the same people, either in your classes or walking to the same building at the same time. Its easiest to start with those people",

      "text": "No need to suffer through the excessive length of my comment, i really just need to get this off my chest, im sorry lol.\n\nI'm a senior and have been struggling greatly w my mental health for 3 years now, had to switch to part-time bc even just taking 12 credit hours somehow leaves me drowning. I thought I finally got it under control this semester and would be able to return to full-time next semester, but its all kind of crumbling again. Havent been able to obtain my medication for about two weeks now, had to end things with my my most recent therapist, and am now trying to find a new one asap. got a call that my brother is in the fucking hospital again. he is struggling w type 1 diabetes and severe alcoholism (going on 4 years now of being in the crippling range - pint(s) of vodka a day). this is the sixth (seventh? idk im losing count) time he's had to go to the hospital since february. i was living w him for the past year while school was online (back in-person now though) and began developing trauma responses to the fruity smell of his ketones rising as he entered into ketoacidosis. Him being in the hospital at the moment i think is really the biggest thing thats fucking w me right now even though i feel mostly disconnected to his situation (this is an intentional move ive made recently to free my self of the emotional toll his condition puts on me so maybe im just lying to myself and im not \\*actually\\* disconnected at all). Rushing him to the hospital over and over and over again as he is literally on the brink of death haunts me (his blood sugar shoots up to 800 and he goes into comas). I thought living with him and having to take care of him was hell, but idk just waiting for that call that my brother is dead does not feel much better. im really pissed and scared at the same time and remembering last halloween when i had to rush home as i got a call that he was passed out on the front lawn as trick or treaters were coming by. I have two tests coming up next week, and another in ochem the following week. i have A's in all my classes rn but im struggling to study bc i cant get my self to focus and i dont have anyone to talk to about this right now bc all my friends/family have their own shit going on and like i said i am between therapists right now. and i guess im just very overwhlemed and scared that this is just the beginning of another downward spiral and that im going to once again end up losing control of my symptoms. i dont have friends in college bc i transferred which is already hard making friends as a transfer and honestly, between my classes and trying to keep up w my idiotic and over-reactive brain, i just dont have any extra time to put into making any (also ptsd induced social anxiety is a bitch that im still trying to work through). so it makes it 10x worse that i go to a huge, party, state school and have to listen to all my drunken neighbors scream and laugh blaring music and stumbling home from whatever parties theyre going to while im sitting here just doing everything i can to try and pull my self together. no hate on them, im glad theyre having fun and whatnot, it's just sometimes i just really wish i could take a break from being me and be a little more resilient like everyone else. i know i sound like (or flat-out am) throwing the biggest pity party here, im well aware of the unproductive nature of wallowing, i know no body cares and i just have to suck it up and get over it, and blah blah blah. i know all this, i have been actively working on healthy coping-skills. its just ive been trying to keep it together, but have found my self extra weak today and i just need to vent this out before i explode. other than that though, honestly, this semester has not been nearly as bad compared to previous ones, so silver linings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway, back to my sad attempt to study. i guess.\n\nthanks for making this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. i hope you get some kitty cuddles soon! i miss my mine too <3",

This is earliest I have ever registered for classes because I'm going to pass these ones. \n\nI hope all of you are going well.
