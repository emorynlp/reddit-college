  "title:": "I picked the wrong major but it\u2019s too late to switch",
  "text": "4 years ago, I was dead set on being a sports journalist, which fell into my school\u2019s communications program. Over the last 3 years, I\u2019ve learned a lot and opened up my future to wanting to do something involving audio, like being on the radio or mixing or whatever.\n\nLately, though, I\u2019ve been questioning my future. A close friend who wanted to do the same thing I did couldn\u2019t find a job (despite tons of experience) and is working as unskilled labor in a radio station. 3 other alumni have talked to us about how difficult any mass media industry is to break in to. I\u2019ve found that I have lost all my passion for audio and video, too.\n\nThe problem here is that I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019m on track to graduate on time. I can\u2019t stand the thought of being at school without my friends so I really don\u2019t want to stay any longer than I have to. The worst part is, I want to switch to education and minor in a language, which couldn\u2019t be farther from my current major. I\u2019d have to stay another 3 years probably. \n\nI would go to my school\u2019s career office but they are really no help- my school\u2019s personnel are pretty poor in general. I feel stuck. What do I do? Do I tough it out and hope I find my passion again? I just want to avoid feeling like I\u2019ve wasted the last 3 years. My school\u2019s enrollment has been plummeting lately so maybe they\u2019ll liquify the college and none of this will even matter.",

Thus you could teach at the high school level or middle school level.\n\nI would consider going for a masters in education as well. Helps with the pay grade and employment. Try to get teaching experience and if you know or want to learn a foreign language, consider teaching abroad.",
