  "text": "This is my first time in college, a community college no less, after taking a year break after highschool. I started in August and i'm almost through with my semester. My original major choice was Art, but I had doubts/second thoughts, and after a few suggestions, decided to go with Computer IT. I don't have much interest or knowledge in IT but heard I would make a lot out of it. After a week in, I had caught covid and ended up staying home for a few weeks. I ended up falling behind and even though I an caught up with majority of my classes, I am still failing one class. This semester has put me in a lot of stress, trying to manage time, hygiene, sleep, and health. I decided to go back to my original major Art. However I am not to sure if this will affect my scholarship. I can't withdraw from the class i'm failing or I will risk my scholarship, but if I fail I don't know if I will still lose it and if it will affect my GPA. I know that if I withdraw, stop attending class, or drop below 12 credit hours I will lose the scholarship. I am currently not in a financially stable place to pay for the next tuition (if I have to) since i'm currently not working at a part time job because I wanted to put my full attention on college. Today was the last day to withdraw. I don't know what will happen if I fail. Is there any advice to help me when I switch majors and start my next semester and any advice for a Freshman?",
