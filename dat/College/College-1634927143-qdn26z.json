  "text": "hi all - never thought id be making this post because i had a really solid friend group in hs. \n\nessentially, ive found it really difficult to make lasting friendships in the past 2 months ive been at school ... im kind of ashamed of myself because i really expected to be going out on fridays, hanging out with people, etc. weekends are legit unbearable.\n\ni dont really know what im doing wrong ? but i am friends with a few people just not well enough to hang out with them on a daily or involve myself with their friend groups. im also fine with talking to people its just been hard to find people also looking to make friends. \n\ni took a really intensive class from 6-9 that kind of takes up a lot of time that i feel like could have been used to join more clubs or meet people. i also have a single so i dont have a roomie. \n\nit kind of makes me sick to think that i may have to spend fridays + weekends alone for a while and i dont know how long at that. \n\ni guess im wondering - to those with solid friend groups right now, how did you make those friends? is there anything you did that helped? thanks : )",

      "text": "Group from my first school - Talked to my clustermates, one was super duper outgoing. He had a thing for the girl next door who ended up becoming one of my best friends. Met my future roommate and other best friend via outgoing persons brother's clustermates. Pretty much met others via proxy after that, but spent a lot of time with those I wanted to be closer to.\n\nCurrent School - Asked some guy in my CC pre engineering stuff about a quiz or hw ended up being one of my closest friends and gaming buddies. Also just talked to a bunch of people in my major in CC and we've all transferred at the same time so we kinda stuck together. Other friends go to same school but I met them via work.\n\nEDIT: Talking is the first part, which it seems like youve got down. The hard part is maintaining and that requires compromise sometimes. At my first school, I'd make an effort to go get bubble tea every week and maybe hangout one night where people weren't busy. For my gaming friend it was picking a day or two where we're all free and playing R6S.",
