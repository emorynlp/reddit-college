  "text": "Ok, so just to clarify before I get into this post this is the grading scale for all of my classes and how it's calculated in our GPA \n\nA     95-100  4.0\n\nA-    90- 94   3.6\n\nB+   87-89   3.2\n\nB     83- 86   3.0\n\nB-    80- 82  2.6\n\nAnd so on and so forth. \n\nSo, I've gotten 4 grades back so far. 3 essays and a quiz. All of the essays were an A-, and the quiz was a B-. But here's the thing. Every professor (4 grades were in 4 different classes) has printed the assignment (even though we submitted digitally) and handed it back in class with a letter grade. So all of my assignments just say \"A-\" or \"B-\" on the top right corner. No number grade, no score, no nothing. And the assignments are not graded in blackboard or put into the system despite one of the assignments being graded and handed back over a week ago, and the others all earlier this week. \n\nThe reason why this concerns me is because I need a 3.3 GPA to keep my full tuition scholarship. Getting a B- vs a B, or a B+ vs a B could be the difference between making that cut off and not making it. So here's a hypothetical situation- if there's a class where I get half B-s and half Bs, and the B- is entered in the computer as an 80% and the B as an 83%, I'm almost certainly going to get a B- in the course which is a 2.6 in my GPA. Meanwhile, if the B-s are entered as 82s, and the Bs as 86s, I'll almost certainly get a B in the class and a 3.0. That's a major GPA difference considering I'm only taking 5 classes. This is an oversimplified example but you know what I mean. \n\nI tried asking my advisor/freshman seminar professor this and she just shrugged and said to aks my individual professors. So I asked 2 of them. They just gave me a confused look and didn't answer my question (what i basically asked was \"I'm not sure what number grade I got on this assignment since the letter grad ehas a range. Is there a way I can find out or is there something I'm missing?) One professor just kept stammering until I said nevermind, the other (the one who I took the quiz in her class) just said \"well the assignment isn't out of 100 it's out of 25\" as if that answered my question. \n\nAt this point I'm lost on what to do. Does anyone have any advice?",

An A- could be a anywhere from a 90 to 94%. So when a paper says \"A-\" did I get a 90%? A 91%? A 92%? A 93%? A 94%? I elaborated this when I talked to my professors but they still didn't know how to answer. I dont see how that is a confusing question",

              "text": "When it says that an A- is a 90-94, yes it means that if you score anywhere between 90 and 94 you will get an A-. a 90 is the same as a 94. Sometimes professors don't really give you a percentage grade but just give a Letter grade alone. I usually just assume I got the cutoff grade",

Your professor just doesnt grade so specifically that you can get a score in increments of 1/100th. There is no number grade, just a letter grade. So what would go towards your gpa is a 3.4 since thats what an A- is.",

Your professor will determine what the final letter grade should be but we have a lot of freedom to interpret the grades as we wish.\n\nIf you had a final score of two B-'s and two B's, whether you end up with a B or B- as the final grade is up to your professor. If it were me, I would use your participation, attendance, and submission record to make that distinction.",
