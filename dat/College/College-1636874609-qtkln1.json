      "text": "i went to a community college after HS, so I didn't have to write an essay. I didn't really have a problem finding the right one. I think it's much better finding the right college,.so you can write your essay on why you truly fit there. it wouldn't make sense to write a college entrance essay to a school you don't know about. college research is key! trust",
