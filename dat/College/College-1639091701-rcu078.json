  "text": "I\u2019m honestly so ready to turn in my final essays today. I\u2019ve written four and I know I have one left to do because I hadn\u2019t saved the majority of it before my computer died. Had that not happened I would\u2019ve been finished for the year and I\u2019m having a very hard time forcing myself to stay focused long enough to rewrite it. I care about my grade, but it\u2019s hard to force myself to do it again.",

I\u2019m honestly considering how much it would affect my grade to simply not do it. I know my professor knows I did at least a portion of it because we met about it and discussed it and my ideas. I\u2019ll give myself until tomorrow to try to finish it.",
