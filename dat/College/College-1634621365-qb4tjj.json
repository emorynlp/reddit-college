  "text": "So basically I\u2019m on a waitlist for a program at my community college that will give me an associates and certification in a certain medical field related career. While I\u2019m waiting I\u2019m planning on working full time wherever. However I\u2019m not sure wether it\u2019s worth to pursue an second associates degree in the mean time (I\u2019m garanteed a spot in the program it\u2019s just a 2 year+ wait list) I\u2019m not sure what I would use this other unrelated degree for so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even worth. Is it better to have a degree just for the sake of having one or should I just work and wait to get into the program that I actually need for my dream career?",
