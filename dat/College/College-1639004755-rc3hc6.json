  "text": "I have been out of school for 7 years and decided to give it a shot. Majoring in biology, my courses were; statistics, intro to psych, and Anatomy & Physiology. I\u2019m genuinely bummed. I should have pulled 2 A\u2019s and 2 B\u2019s, but I honestly got tired and lazy on my finals. I used to be a straight A student in high school, and think I might be being too hard on myself... but then again idk. Is this a bad end to my fall semester?",

Sometimes it\u2019s a lot to take on when you\u2019re not used to the structure needed for classes/ time to do homework and studying/ anxiety of things due or tests coming up, especially w a full time load!! And science classes are super hard. \n\nAlso are you needing a certain gpa for a particular reason?",

              "text": "Its a really normal thing to second guess your abilities, but I've found that in lots of things, the people getting to those goals aren't most times the people with the greatest ability, it's lots of people that are really persistent. So keep being persistent and trying your best, there's also nothing wrong with at some point going a different route. I guess what I'm trying to say is after a while it's not as much about ability, it becomes more about how persistent you are and the effort you put in. If you feel like you get lazy near finals, which I do as well, then try and improve there. So take that with a grain of salt.",

What\u2019s helped me most is finding some good study friends that know their stuff. Otherwise, most school have free tutoring if you are struggling w the material. I used to be able to cram information last minute and pull all-nighters to study, but I find that is no longer the case so time management and avoiding procrastination is key w those super hard classes. Good luck to you <3 you\u2019re amazing.",
