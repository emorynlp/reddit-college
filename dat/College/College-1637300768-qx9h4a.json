  "text": "So I am planning on going to a university from a community college. I am going to an apartment that does roommate matching and me and a friend that I met from a different friend we\u2019re going to room with eachother. The rooms are 4 people, each having their own rooms. We never hangout we just go to the gym together. I couldn\u2019t really see us hanging one on one and we are different in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t know if I should just room with him or take the chance and do the roommate matching form for my roomates. He would still be going to the college and most likely still be in the same apartment as me, we just wouldn\u2019t be roommates. Any suggestions?",
