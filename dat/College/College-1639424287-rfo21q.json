  "text": "Its almost the end of the semester and i failed 2 tests and i have 1 more tests. I'm honestly stressing over this. My professor recommends i should go into a ESL class. I have no clue what to do and it sucks. I don't know what my mark is in that course but i hope i pass and that i don't have to redo the course during the break or something. Any advice or tips can help.",

      "text": "What kind of tests are they? Like is it writing essays or is it multiple choice / open ended on grammar / reading comprehension? \n\nI would recommend going to talk to your professor 1:1 to find out why you\u2019re doing so poorly. If you can demonstrate that you\u2019re trying your hardest and willing to put in the work they may be willing to allow you to do a similar test or retake the test if you ask. I found during my undergrad degree that many profs are cool and will bend the rules a bit if you\u2019re a passionate student and they understand your situation and see you trying. That\u2019s different than a student that doesn\u2019t come to class and slacks off and then asks towards the end what they can do to increase their grade. \n\nIf you\u2019re failing because you honestly don\u2019t have a good level and grasp of the English language then you may have to take what grade you get as long as it\u2019s D or higher. If you fail or make a D you can petition to have the board remove it from your transcript based on extenuating circumstances. Being placed in the class when your English level is too low May quality. At that point you should take an ESL class or self study English grammar with a native speaker and then retake the course if required. \n\nHonestly your professor can recommend what options you have and considerations you should take. An academic advisor is also a good resource for this too.",

Thank you kind stranger for the tips.\n\nSo far my grades, in this course, are C's and D's so i hope i can make it up on the final.",

              "text": "Yeah just talk to the professor and ask for their advice. Profs are usually pretty cool. And don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Learning languages is difficult and as a native English speaker that\u2019s learned Portuguese, some Arabic, and am currently learning Mandarin Chinese, English is one of the hardest languages to learn. The rules of the language make 0 sense and change all the time. I once took an advanced English grammar class that made me feel like I didn\u2019t speak the language at all.",
