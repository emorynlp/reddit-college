  "title:": "Fuck my life, 90% of classes will still be online this upcoming Spring semester",
  "text": "Fuck California, screw COVID, and fuck the educational system for not making it possible for students to resume in-person classes. My WHOLE life, and education have been disrupted due to covid. My 20\u2019s have been taken away and I am sick of it. I\u2019m only getting older, and my graduation date has been pushed back. I\u2019m almost 24, and I\u2019m still a freshman because I haven\u2019t been able to take the classes I really need in order to transfer to a 4 year uni. I CANNOT learn online. I need to be in the classroom, so I can ask questions and get the assistance I need. Online learning is not the way, and I feel like faculties don\u2019t care about students. They don\u2019t care whether or not we get a decent education anymore. It\u2019s not them who have to struggle right? They\u2019ve already gotten their degrees. \n\nMost students would like to return to campus, but professors are too afraid to return. At my school, there was a survey. 70% of students said they wanted to be back on campus. Guess what? 80% of professors felt unsafe. This clearly shows that our opinions don\u2019t matter. I am ready to drop out of school, and enjoy the rest of my 20\u2019s. I honestly can\u2019t keep doing this. At this point, I won\u2019t graduate until I\u2019m like 28. Twenty fucking eight. I wanted to travel the world, do cool shit, experience other things. How can I do this if I\u2019m stuck in school? Can someone please tell me what the best course of action would be in my case? I feel like I\u2019m wasting my 20\u2019s on SCHOOL? I\u2019ve dropped courses two semesters in a row because I just couldn\u2019t do the online thing. I went from getting A\u2019s and B\u2019s to not understanding or being motivated to do the coursework. I\u2019m going to wake up very soon and be 30 years old. I don\u2019t want to be 30 without never having traveled or done cool things. \n\nWhy can\u2019t people accept that we will be living with covid, and there is nothing that can be done. It needs to stop ruining people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s been TWO years. I had two kind of shitty birthdays, and my birthday is coming up again in March. I just want to fucking cry. I had planned a trip to Hawaii for my 23rd, and that didn\u2019t fucking happen because of COVID. \n\nI should be living my best life right now but I\u2019m running out of time. Time is one of the most important things in the world. It\u2019s a social construct, but I don\u2019t care. I want to enjoy life while I\u2019m still young. What do I do man? I already feel old smh. I feel like I am going to have a lot of regrets on my death bed. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for feeling like you\u2019re missing out? Or not being able to do the things you want because of school, but also sucking at school because it\u2019s online? I should have gone to college right after high school. I really really regret it now. I could have been done, and enjoying my life right now. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \n\nAm I wasting my youth? Feels like it.\n\nEdit: Missed a word",

You can always travel later on in life after graduating/being established in a field & you will honestly be better able to enjoy it as you\u2019ll be able to afford more. Your feelings about COVID are exactly why your professors don\u2019t want to attend in person, they know the student body isn\u2019t taking it seriously enough &, being older & more experienced, they know  it\u2019s not worth risk until all are vaccinated. Vaccines can eradicate viruses only if a high enough % of the population gets the vaccine. Back to your concern, it\u2019s not the end of the world if you travel & party later on in life. You\u2019re not wasting your life on school. Online learning is a great tool but if you need help, you need to ask for it. Your college should have free tutoring programs, & your professors have office hours. Both can be done over Zoom so you can ask questions & get help on the material. Trust me, you\u2019re not wasting your time. I\u2019m 40, I\u2019m in college, & my oldest is filling out applications for fall \u201823. 1 of my kids thrived online, 1 struggled. All 3 of us used tutoring to help where we needed it. Soon enough your school will allow the classes with Labs to be in person with proof vaccination, they might even allow it with weekly negative tests. But you\u2019re not wasting your time in school unless you\u2019re not asking for the help you need",

          "text": "Why can't the college just require vaccines for in-person classes with medical exemptions? That would make people who want to go back in-person happy while accommodating for professors and students who would still like to be online (unvaccinated students/professors without a medical reason, or students/professors who just don't want to take any risk at all in-person would remain online). When vaccines work if a high enough % of the population gets them then I don't understand why this can't be an option.",

              "text": "The problem being people lie. They\u2019re behaving like spoiled brats. They don\u2019t want to get vaccinated, they don\u2019t want to wear a mask, & too many would rather buy fake vaccine cards or get a fake exemption. Requiring a vaccine to be able to attend in person schooling isn\u2019t a new concept either. You have to have tons in order to attend in person Kindergarden. You have to have more to attend in person 7th grade. & if someone doesn\u2019t want to, for medical or religious reasons, they can be homeschooled through their district instead. That\u2019s the same system CA has & I\u2019m glad of it. I see 5 medical specialists, 3 are for my lungs alone. Every dr tells me there\u2019s no such thing as a true medical exemption as the risk of adverse reactions to the vaccine are far less than the risk of getting Covid. I had anaphylactic shock for all 3 of my covid vaccines, i got all my shots under medical supervision & was treated immediately. I would not survive getting covid. If someone doesn\u2019t want to get vaccinated against covid, that\u2019s their choice but just like any K-12 student regarding the 30 required vaccines, they won\u2019t be able to attend in person",

                  "text": "How about a medical exemption for the people who get blood clots or heart issues from the vaccines? Those are far more difficult to treat than anaphylaxis. On top of that, if somebody knows they're going to have an allergic reaction to the vaccine they shouldn't have to get it. You're a trooper and while I commend you for that you shouldn't have to undergo anaphylaxis just to get a vaccine (if you are allergic). Besides, vaccines work when the majority of members have it - if in a population of 30, 28 people have the vaccine the two unvaccinated people are protected from the disease. This is why medical exemptions are okay on vaccinated campuses, because if the vaccine works properly the unvaccinated are protected through herd immunity. And anyways, in California there are ways to check if you have the vaccine and faking vaccine verification isn't easy. And you're right, requiring vaccines to attend in-person schooling isn't a new concept, and neither are medical/religious exemptions which have been in place for decades, because again if the majority of members in a population are vaccinated, then the unvaccinated are protected via herd immunity.",

          "text": "Yeah I can always travel later on in life, but I won\u2019t have the energy I have now. Also, if I decide that I want to have children in my 30\u2019s, I won\u2019t be able to travel or do any of the things I want to do. As of right now, I don\u2019t want children but that may change. Your 20\u2019s are the time to have fun and party. Not later on. It won\u2019t be as fun and I won\u2019t be young anymore. \n\nAlso there are a ton of people who refuse to be vaccinated, and there is nothing we can do about it. Life has to go on. So your argument that \u201call have to be vaccinated\u201d is fair but there is no way to enforce that. We are placing too much power in the hands of people. We don\u2019t live in a utopian society where people do the right thing all of the time. At some point, we need to get on with life. Why are people who have been vaccinated worried about whether or not other people have been vaxed? If we\u2019re protected, that\u2019s all that matters. If the next person chooses to put their life at risk then that\u2019s on them. \n\nI honestly think that professors and faculty have gotten so used to sitting at home that they\u2019d rather do remote work. They get to just sit at home and make money while students suffer. A lot of people are using covid as an excuse for everything. We are going on year three, and everyone is still suffering. \n\nI just want this to be over. It\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t taking it seriously, it\u2019s just that people who have been vaccinated should be able to return to campus. We should have the option to choose what route we take in terms of working from home or working on campus. \n\nHow old are your kids? I wish I could do well with online school but I just can\u2019t.",

Your 20s are a time of bad decisions because you have plenty of time to fix them. Focus on school. With a degree, you\u2019ll have plenty of time & money to afford traveling. People who goof around in their late teens & 20s focused on partying & wild adventures, end up struggling their entire lives. Those that focused during that time, get their education, become established in a career, have plenty of money, & end up traveling more & more often then their counter parts. \n\nNo, the US isn\u2019t a utopia but thinking of yourself only is also the problem. We worry about the jackass that chooses not to be vaccinated but are worried about their grandparent with cancer who\u2019s meds won\u2019t allow them to get the covid vaccine right now. We worry about the kids who aren\u2019t old enough to be vaccinated yet because that\u2019s what a society is supposed to do - take care of your fellow man. And yes, we can make people get vaccines if they want to do certain things. Even before Covid, different countries require proof of different vaccines. Attending elementary school in person requires proof of vaccination. Attending 7th grade+up in person requires proof of vaccination. If you don\u2019t want to get those, then you don\u2019t get to travel to those countries, & you don\u2019t get to attend school in person. These are not things you can debate, these are simple facts of living in a society. You may not live in a utopia but you also don\u2019t live in an isolated wasteland either.\n\nYou keep blaming covid & your professors for your problems but you\u2019re wrong. Your problem is yourself. Quick crying about what\u2019s you think is wrong & go work on the issue. If my autistic son can learn geometry & algebra online with the help of tutors then you can too! I\u2019ll say it again, call your school\u2019s library about their free tutoring & get the help you need. You feel lost & overwhelmed, contact a counselor on campus, or contact the health center on campus & talk to one of their counselors. If you won\u2019t get the help for yourself that\u2019s available to you through school, then move - Transfer to a school in a state that does allow you to be in person. Bottom line, whining about it & doing nothing will get you nothing.",

I know life doesn\u2019t end at 30 but your 20\u2019s are really important years. Years to experiment and try new things you know. I spent the few years after high school working and saving money. It was a pretty smart move to be honest, but now I\u2019m graduating way later. \n\n28 to me is 30. At 30, most people are having kids, settled in their careers etc. That window to travel and experiment with different things is gone. It\u2019s just the reality of the situation. \n\nI\u2019m not being insensitive, I just need people to see where I\u2019m coming from. I was once terrified of covid too, but now I\u2019m like okay I\u2019ve been vaccinated and years have gone by. No I haven\u2019t missed out on just birthday stuff, my social life hasn\u2019t been the same because of covid. I mean you can\u2019t event meet fellow students online/make friends? I\u2019m not learning shit in school because of covid. I\u2019m now graduating later because of having to do school online and not doing well. Also you don\u2019t know my life. You don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through. \n\nI am grateful for the things I have. I just feel like I\u2019m running out of time for all of the things I want to accomplish and do. There is no way I\u2019ll be able to travel right now while I\u2019m in school, and I won\u2019t be able to do that at 30. I just won\u2019t.",

That being said, I make sure my classes have live zoom meetings or recorded lectures, & I research each professor online before signing up for their class. My in person lab work has been great, well organized, & sanitary. My school has made ample resources available including 2 different tutoring providers, zoom office hours for professors, & study groups. I highly recommend contacting your school\u2019s library & ask about their tutoring program. It\u2019s always free for active students",

If it's any consolation, I haven't been enjoying myself as my young adult life has been spent in isolation. Covid lockdowns happened when I was 18 1/2 and in the essentially two years that have passed, I have not experienced much life. I cannot drive, I rarely leave my house, I rarely do much outside of my computer. Most of my adult life has been spent inside of my house. I occasionally get out, but it's not often. I have no idea what it's like to be an adult because I'm lacking vital experiences, experiences that I might have had if a pandemic did not occur when I turned 18. I feel like I was more of an adult my first semester of college when I was taking in-person classes than I do now two years later. It's pathetic, really. \n\nAll I can really say for your circumstances is that you had no way of knowing that a pandemic would strike and derail your plans like this. Getting a job prior to going to school to pay for your education was a smart move as you had no idea a pandemic was on the horizon. Your circumstances are extremely unfortunate, but know there are probably others in a similar situation to you.",

I\u2019m also sorry that you haven\u2019t been able to have the experiences you hoped for. Luckily, you still have time. Everything will pan out. If I could go back to 20 years old, I\u2019d be the happiest person ever. When I was 20, I didn\u2019t care about time. It felt like I had all of the time in the world and I did. \n\nYou have plenty of time to learn, grow, and work on yourself. \n\nFYI, I can\u2019t drive either. I do have a car, and my partner is currently teaching me how to drive, but I\u2019m not all the way there yet.
