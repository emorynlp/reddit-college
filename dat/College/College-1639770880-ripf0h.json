  "text": "I was planning on transferring to Virginia Tech (from another 4-year university) for the spring 2022 semester but will no longer be transferring there. I qualified for a fee waiver and a small portion of the fee was placed to my spring 2022 fees. Does anyone know the steps to withdrawing an acceptance from a university you have already accepted involve?",
