  "text": "So I\u2019m going to school for mechanical engineering and I am about to finish my second year at a Community college and then transfer over to a university. I can either go to ASU or GCU. All my life I have always chose GCU first because my mom and sister went there and also it is a private school. It has a good engineering program as well. ASU is known for there stem program and also cheaper since its not private. My real question is when looking for a job in the future will it matter where I got my degree? I have asked engineering teachers and they have said it could go both ways. Such as if I go to GCU I might stand out and maybe a ASU degree wouldn\u2019t cut it for the job. Or if I go to GCU they might think that it is a new program(GCU is a newer school) and they would rather have someone who went to a school known for their engineering which is ASU.",

      "text": "Go to the cheaper school. ASU is a really strong engineering school, and has connections to many large companies (Oracle is a big hirer I think). I\u2019m an EE not a MechE so I can\u2019t speak too much on mech though. You\u2019re going to learn the same things no matter what school you go to, so it really comes to down price and opportunities the school can grant you",
