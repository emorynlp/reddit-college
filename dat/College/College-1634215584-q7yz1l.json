      "text": "Studying is much harder. No one will hold your hand through subjects or devote an extra day to subject matter you don\u2019t understand. Sometimes I forget to check my Canvas and don\u2019t even know about an exam til a week before we take it because it\u2019s not the professor\u2019s responsibility to tell us. You\u2019ll also be going a lot more in depth to subjects and depending on your major reading. A lot. \n\nFriendships are both harder and more fruitful. You\u2019re going to be busier, especially by your junior year it\u2019ll be hard to have as much time for friends as you want. But, you\u2019ll also have more freedom and if you live in a dorm and find friends on your floor it\u2019s super fun. \n\nProfessors in college are only different in the sense that they get a lot of academic freedom. There\u2019s really no one watching over their shoulder and they make a lot of the choices for their classes. That can either be great or horrible. \n\nSocial life sort of depends on what school you go to. I have a lot of friends who go to community and the social life there is a lot harder, like the other commenter mentioned. I go to a huge university and there\u2019s always parties to attend or organizations to get involved with. If you\u2019re worried about the party scene, either join a frat or find out when they\u2019re having parties. If parties aren\u2019t your thing, get involved with some organizations that interest you; they\u2019ll have events of their own. \n\nCollege is insanely stressful and you will be more solely responsible for your own life than you have ever been before. I also wouldn\u2019t go back to high school at any cost. I like being in charge of my own life and success, it\u2019s really fulfilling and the independence is all worth it imo. Also if you try to make the most of it college can be really fun. Make sure to put school first but go out and enjoy your time.",

      "text": "Studying: I\u2019d be surprised if anyone actually studied in high school and find it easy now in college.\n\nFriends: I dropped most of my friends in high school because they are superficial and always caused drama. The few friends I have now are the ones that stuck by me in high school. Don\u2019t have any college ones because I go to community college and only take one in person class. \n\nTeachers: The same no matter what, you either love them or hate them. Only difference in college is that they\u2019re not babying you. They\u2019re not there to constantly remind you to hand in your assignments on time, and you actually have to reach out to them if you need help rather than them offering it to you. \n\nHanging out/Social life: Can\u2019t really offer anything since the community college social scene is pretty abysmal.\n\nExperience overall: I prefer college in the sense that I can take mostly online classes and work at my own pace. However, I hate CC and can\u2019t wait to transfer out of state once I\u2019m done. Good way to avoid a lot of debt though and significantly better than high school.",
