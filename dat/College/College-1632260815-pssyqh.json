  "text": "I have like two classes that my professors barely talk/teach, they\u2019re making the students teach/ lead the class? And I feel as if they\u2019re not doing their job anymore. I\u2019m not learning because the students leading the class don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re talking about. Why is this becoming normalized in classes now? I have social anxiety and this makes going to class 100% worse.",

      "text": "That\u2019s how I teach my summer class, but I do check the students\u2019 presentations beforehand. It\u2019s a valid style of leading a class when down right. How are you assessing that the students presenting are not teaching the material correctly? You may wanna bring this up with your professor at office hours. \n\nOn a personal note: So many professors, including me, are simply burnt out. We\u2019ve been teaching nonstop through a pandemic. But we keep doing the best we can so our students can graduate.",
