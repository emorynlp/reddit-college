  "text": "I\u2019m about to graduate as a marketing major. Only took me 3.5 years. I\u2019ve never had a job or internship before because I got rejected from everything. I hate saying this, but I\u2019m kinda autistic, and I try to hide it so much, yet I still get rejected from every job. My professor who I did an honors research paper with just told me about a full time job that she will recommend me for, and that our school has connections with the company. So I have any better chance? I feel like even if I get the interview, I\u2019ll still be rejected.",
