      "text": "Community college is a weird limbo where its a mix of kids from high school that want to save money/repair a low high school GPA and adult students that are there to better their lives and everyone commutes. I wouldn't even bother trying, you will only know them for two years max before everyone goes their separate ways and never talk again. It sucks but it'll be easier to focus on classes.",

      "text": "I formed a study group with a few guys that I share all my classes with. \n\nDepending on your situation it could be incredibly hard. Be straight up with people and keep trying.  Most people in community college commute and book it out of there as fast as they can. A lot of the students are still In high school causing them to be too busy or too big of assholes to put up with for the most part. \n\nIn the end it comes down to you asking someone to be your friend. I'd start small by asking to study or work on homework. Out of 7 engineering students that are in all 5 of my classes 2 stick around to hang out. The others all go home as soon as they can. Add covid and remote learning and it is a challenge. Keep trying and you'll get there eventually.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t agree with the person who said to don\u2019t even bother trying because you\u2019ll all go your separate ways after two years. Two years is a hell of a lot of time, and it\u2019s probably the same amount of time you\u2019ll be spending at wherever you transfer as well. So it\u2019s absolutely worth trying to make friends\n\nAt my 4 year it\u2019s extremely easy to meet people through clubs. I don\u2019t imagine a community college would be *that* different. If anything, it\u2019ll probably be even easier since community college students who seek out clubs are probably even more willing to meet people than regular 4 year students",
