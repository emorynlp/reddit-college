  "text": "I've been thinking about transferring to a college in Florida and I've really been eyeing UCF. Not only is it WAY closer to all my friends and family, but I researched that it's a decent college for psychology and about the same price as the college I'm currently attending now. I was wondering if there's anything I should know beforehand, or are there any other colleges that I should check out!",
