  "text": "I (20f) am a TA for a pass fail course, where I have NO input on the grades the students receive. It would only be me being unprofessional, the students know I have no control over their grades. Even though I\u2019m in a position of seniority, I don\u2019t have \u201cpower\u201d over anything or anyone. The school I work for doesn\u2019t have conduct regarding TA\u2019s because they only exist in pass fail courses. Would it be terrible for me to go on a date with a student?",

Then there\u2019s the process of finalizing grades so I wouldn\u2019t see him until school was actually over, (so basically that would b next semester since we live apart), and I\u2019m back to thinking I should just act now",

If they ask you to get coffee or something then say what you want.\n\nI asked to hang out with an undergrad TA in one of my classes and it was fine. We talked for a while before though. Honestly just didn\u2019t want to wait for like a month for the semester to end. Nothing really happened after we met up a few times but it was an interesting experience.",
