  "text": "My finite math professor doesn't take attendance and told us we could do the assignments at home if we didn't need any help. I still go to class to do my homework in person since I can't always study at home. I noticed after a couple of weeks that hardly anyone shows up to class. Somedays I don't feel like going but I push myself to go anyways. That being said, if you can do the assignments from home do you go to class in person or stay at home/in dorm?",

If it\u2019s a small class, then I\u2019d show up because it looks better for you. Your professor will notice, even if it doesn\u2019t count towards your grade.",

College is about networking and building relationships and you never know when a professor is going to have an opportunity for you. I've gotten a huge number of opportunities just from being a good student and having a good relationship with professors, and I know for sure they wouldn't have passed my name along if they didn't regularly talk to me in person.",

If you feel you can\u2019t learn well enough on your own then definitely go to lectures so they can explain it well, but if you\u2019re comfortable chilling and doing the lectures by yourself and you\u2019re allowed to then go right ahead. Just make sure you don\u2019t get behind on content at least keep up with topics",
