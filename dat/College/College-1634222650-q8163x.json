  "text": "I currently have a 50% in my philosophy class. There are only 3 tests and each test counts for 33% of the class grade. \n\nI only got 5/10 on the 1st test and the highest grade in the class was a 7/10. The average was 4/10. He said there is no curve and people just need to study harder. \n\nI don't think I am stupid. I have a 4.0 GPA and I have all A's in my more difficult business, science, and math classes. I studied and took notes but I swear that many of the test questions were never mentioned in class. He doesn't give back the tests and he never responds to my emails when I ask to review my test. \n\nI looked my prof on ratemyprof and he is one of the most praised and \"easy\" teachers in the department.  I am so stressed for this class. I cannot get a F as it is required to graduate and I need my scholarship. I don't even understand why he thinks it's ok that no one will be even getting a B in his class.",

What they are putting on each exam and how their teaching during class is contributing or not contributing to that material. Where else can you find that info (are they testing you  mostly from reading). Each class period keep in mind what types of questions you think they might ask and how you can find that information.",
