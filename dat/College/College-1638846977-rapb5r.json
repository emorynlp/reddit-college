  "text": "I am on a fair amount of psych meds in order to function and maintain a a happy life, and I am planning to transfer next Fall. A unique challenge that I only though of recently is health insurance. I am on my state's version of Medicaid, but I read somewhere that you have to be a resident of a state for a year to get on their version of it. So I am wondering if my psych meds would be covered through a school's health insurance, if that's even a thing. The schools I am applying to are public.",
