  "text": "Graduating this semestar and my best piece advice if you can take your core classes and pre-reqs first. My last two semesters only took one core class and allowed me have easy load, search for job,intern during school, and generally more freedom last year. \nDo the hard work at the start and relax at the end. From an engineering major.\n\n\nSidenote:capstone/senior design you can normally take if you meet pre-req took my junior year instead senior.\n\n\nEdit:Like many others mentioned only do this if you know what you want to do before going in. I do suggest though at minimum if you can try make your last two semesters as easy as possible , upper level electives, senior design projects, plus the stress of job search kills everyone most people struggle manage senior year. (Especially learned this my junior year, hardest year basically taking all my tough classes on top of covid intern job search). This advice vary person to person just wanted give different perspective as for me the amount of time opened up senior year to pursue personal endeavors and work ethic skills developed from the hard workload helped me to achieve my college and career goals.",

Bigger universities are great at this and a class that interests you is always easier than one you are bored to death in, no matter how easy it is supposed to be.",

      "text": "Ehhhh....depends on your major and your interests  as a whole. I personally really enjoy my major and HATE that I still have an elective to finish in my last semester or two. I have really been enjoying the upper level courses of my major, gives me this whole ~immersed~ feeling, being involved in discussions and comfortably writing analysis, critical thinking, etc.\n\n Then there's my electives... the material is not what I want to be in school for, it is not what I want to do in life, I feel out of place, and it feels more like busy work because i wouldnt be there if it wasn't required for graduation.\n\n I end up getting annoyed that I am taking time away from the classes I actually want to be involved in. I actually took more electives towards the start of my major because I was always signing up late and that's what was open. I used to think what you're suggesting, that it's going to suck when I have all core/technical classes senior year. But I was wrong, it worked out, I love being with people mostly only my major, similar mindsets, just adds to the immersion.\n\n Im dreading the one elective I put off because the last elective I took I felt out of place. Electives make me feel of place because either (a) they consist of lower classmen that still treat college as an extension of highschool. Or (b) if it is upper level, I am likely the odd one out, because most people are of the major that the class is meant for, so things don't come as easy to me as the rest of the class and im not used to the learning style/professors that most people in the major have adapted to\n\nBut again, this can def depend on your major. I am in a  \"soft\" science. I could imagine that maybe for something super math or science based, the upper level courses may become very grueling if they're all piled on at the end... so maybe... assess based on your major and skillet? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f... I see you kind of made this point in your edit, just figured I'd add in an example of how the reverse can be preferable to certain situations",

          "text": "This is often the case, but I guess it depends a slight bit on your particular situation. Sometimes the upper division major classes aren't necessarily too challenging. I tried to focus a bit too hard on my major classes so far as a second year & it's been a huge struggle for me. I kind of wish I listened to my advisors & peers more about balancing my coursework. I feel deenergized especially w/ the pandemic, but definitely also because I'm just taking too technical coursework & feel stressed because I'm not able to keep up very well. My advisor warned quite a bit about going too deep into the major classes starting out & how some people started failing out of lots of classes at the beginning of college in the major this way (mentioning that a decent bit of students start out taking linear algebra & even more advanced courses coming in & then failing them in large numbers) & to go at a reasonable pace as well as my peers & the department is also quite restrictive about taking grad level classes for undergrads often requiring that you took enough senior level coursework beforehand. There is just too much of a jump from basic school math to research math & for the vast majority of people they need time to really internalize the necessary habits of mind to succeed. I do realize that this is much because math is both immensely creatively & logically demanding though. Also, the people who tend to want to quickly push ahead tend to be a bit too driven to the subject & need to learn to balance lots of things in their life & taking some gen eds to balance helps w/ that. But there are definitely some people that have things figured out enough & might still be able to pull it off alright. I think even if that was the case, they would still benefit from a more balanced approach & that overall for most people at least in demanding majors taking a more balanced approach is best. After all, I think that the most intelligent people tend to be generalists. I noticed this w/ the person who had the most math coursework in our batch & he ended up having to drop out after his second quarter because he didn't have the diligence to keep up in his classes & had lots of unhealthy habits even though he definitely had a ton of book knowledge.",

They are outside of what you get used to in major-specific courses and doing this may work for some, but will likely be extremely difficult for others.\n\nAnother note is that you will be 1-2 years out of practice when applying to jobs and internships. That can really hurt your transition.\n\nI wouldn't recommend separating gen eds and major courses at all. Take a mix (as long as you have committed to a major) as this will help you relate each class to others outside your field (this is how the liberal arts education model works after all).\n\nAs one last point, a lot of schools won't even allow this to happen. Many programs require a certain threshold to be met before officially declaring a major, and gen eds are included in these requirements. This is done to prevent dropouts due to lack of interest, it is better to spread out courses to prevent burnout than to power through. Just putting it out there, the current educational model is in place for a reason. As my advisor put it \"There is extremely good reason that the peer review and defense processes only uses 3 reviewers, this has been refined over 200+ years of observation\". The same is true of the university model, except it has been over the past 1000.",

Taking 12 credits a semester and doing the six you missed during the year over the Summer is optimal if you have a Summer job that allows you to put time towards classes. Contact your financial aid office to see if aid can be applied towards Summer classes.",

              "text": "Many four year universities have a wide variety of majors. When you first enter college, you have to take a series of classes called pre requisites. You'll take math, English, art, science classes. That helps you explore different subjects and see what you may like. Don't worry about not knowing what you want to do, I didn't either. As you take these classes, I recommend thinking about what you liked as a kid. Was it art? animals? Bugs and science? Do you like Reading, Maths, physics? Very few people know what they want to do when first entering college. You can look at a college site and see what kind of programs, majors they offer. But in general, state colleges offer many different paths. Edit: You can also choose to go to a community college first to get your gen eds out of the way, at a much more affordable price.",

              "text": "u/sunnyroses did a great job of explaining this! I just wanted to add a few things. At least here in the US, there are two year school where you can go to kind of figure out what you want to do. Some offer associates degrees in general education (which is just like taking more of your standard English/math/science/history/language stuff). This is great for being able to transfer to a four year school and have all of your gen eds out of the way once you've decided what you want to do. Two year colleges are significantly cheaper than four year colleges (in the US). Some two year colleges even offer incentives for students that apply right out of high school. I know if you meet certain requirements straight out of high school, some states will offer to pay for your two years at a community (two year) college. This is, however, less common.",

When I was in high school, I wasn't even sure if I wanted to go to college and felt directionless. I decided to enroll in a two year and discovered my interests there and graduated with an AA. And now, I recently transferred to a UC in Fall 2020! It's really a great route to take. Yes and some high schools that are located near community colleges offer programs where you can take classes at a community college and gain college credits while still in HS! My younger brother who is in HS is going to take two community college courses over the summer. It's really cool.",

It seems like a great way to expedite the process. \n\n(Also if anyone is interested in the two free years it's typically called Promise Program or Promise Scholarship i.e. Tennessee Promise Program.
