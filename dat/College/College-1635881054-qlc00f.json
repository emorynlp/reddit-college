  "text": "Is there some logical reasoning why college sickness take so long to go away? My friend from 2 weeks ago said he was sick for a week and a half. This one girl mentioned how she was sick for 2 weeks. Now its me and my roomate who has been sick for a week. WHY. There has to be some reason for illness to last so long during some of the most crucial time of our lives.",

      "text": "Stress is a huge contribution for how easily you get sick and how quickly you recover. College is hugely stressful, doubly so if you live in a dorm type setting which is basically a social Petri dish to start. \n\nSorry your still not feeling well! Try to rest and give your body what it needs!",
