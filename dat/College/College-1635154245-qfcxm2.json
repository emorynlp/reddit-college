  "text": "Im 20 from the uk if that\u2019s important \n\nSo since I started doing my exams and everything I have always thought I\u2019d go into teaching, I love and am passionate with the sciences but with low self esteem I didn\u2019t think I was smart enough to go that route.\n\nWell I saw a course in forensics that interests  me greatly, it\u2019s low level but I\u2019m really willing to stick with this. \n\nAnyway I was wondering if anyone who has switched courses like this has any advice? Im worried incase leaving means I\u2019ve waisted my time for the last couple of years trying to get into teaching",

      "text": "I'm in the US so it's maybe a little different. There's a tool my college uses that basically takes our existing finished courses and you input a new degree path (like say from health science to accounting) and it will tel you what you'll be able to keep from your existing path (likely the couple math classes and general education credits) and what you'd need to complete going forward to get a different degree. I did a small change for my degree (health science to public health) and I need about 20 credits to finish either since they're similar and I'd already taken several public health courses as electives.",
