  "text": "I graduated HS last year, all of my friends entered college and I couldn't due to my low admision score for college. So I've taken this year to study and hopefully enter next year. If I enter to a bachillerato(usually a programme where studrnts enter if they got a few points less than the limit of admision of the career) (called like that where I live) its a programme that lasts 1 year and if approved, you get transfered to the career by itself for ex: Law (bachillerato of law) I do think my current mock results are leading towards that result and it worries me even more. In that case, I would be entering to study Law early 2023 where my HS would be on the third year already and essentially I would be 21 college freshman graduating from law at 25 compared to my HS at 23. Im a bit insecure about it, just seeing my HS classmates above me, level above. Can someone cheer me up?",

Everyone has their struggles and their circumstances are different. Don't feel bad about being in a lower grade than your peers, feel proud that you had the guts not to give up on college as your goal. You can do this!!",
