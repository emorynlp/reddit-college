  "text": "I have a project due tomorrow at Midnight (I guess today now) I also have to finish a chapter test for Algebra and THEN study for the big exam on wednesday. The project is a group project and my partner asked me to do stuff but the program would not compile, I also have to do that math somehow as well. Oh and did I mention I have to work a seven hour shift at work tomorrow. I am going to have to get up work for a few hours, go to work, get home at 9 pm them just work and work until it is done. I am also considering calling into work today, just so I can have the whole day. Then Monday, Tuesday, and a few hours wednesday morning I have to study, study, and study some more. Like I said, I am trying not to stress.",
