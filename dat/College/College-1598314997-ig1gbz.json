  "title:": "Please don\u2019t do this. Worst ice-breaker ever.",
  "text": "My professor decided to go around the (virtual) room and have us each say our names and what internship we had this summer to break the ice. He specifically asked for our internships. Over half of the class awkwardly came up one-by-one to say that they couldn\u2019t find an internship or that their internship had been cancelled. I, luckily, had found a research position over the summer, so I was able to talk about mine, but I spent as little time as possible on it. \n\nNobody wants to gloat about their internships when over half of the class lost theirs, and nobody who lost theirs wants to get up in front of the class and talk about how they lost it. We\u2019re all seniors in STEM, so it was pretty important that we found an internship this summer, which made it even worse. Please for the love of god if there are any professors here, DON\u2019T DO THIS!",

Who is to say one of the students who has an internship won't give a head's up to someone in the class who doesn't and give them a chance?\nWhatever will you say if you find a full-time job in your field and someone asks? \"I've decided not to take that job because someone else might feel bad if they find out?\"  There's always Waffle House (well, not in South Louisiana now) and zippy-marts.\n\n  Maybe the best thing to do is simply say:\n\"I do not want to hurt someone else's feelings so I will not answer the question.\" That way the only person's feelings to worry about are your professors.   Who cares about them?",

But he checked attendance with a roll call, so there was no need for introductions.)\n\none of the professors who did an introduction though, asked each student WHY we choose this subject to study. Which is a legitimate question.. some of us still couldn't answer. Like me. My answer was that it sounded interesting and since I didn't feel a pull toward any other subject, I picked this one. But, that subject isn't necessarily very practical for the future so... yeah i've been asking myself the  question \"Why this\" for the last two years.",

By far the worst one I've ever had.\n\nBack ground first:  I've transferred a few times and for some reason most school hate the history credits from other schools.  So I'm taking \"History Survey: Ancient through Byzantine\" for the 3rd time.  Our \"professor\" teaches 3rd grade during the day.  We were his only college class.  He treated us like 10 year olds.  We went around the room reading the book aloud.  We drew pictures about the topics and had our classmate add onto them.  That was suppose to \"create a study guide\" for final exam.  That exam was 12 randomly selected essay questions from a pool of 30.  Each required 1/2 page answers.  Hand written during class.  And we drew pictures together to study for it.  For a freshman level class.  Now you know that kind of nonsense I was dealing with.  \n\nFor the ice breaker: He assigns a partner.  You stand face to face, maintaining eye contact.  Each of you does various hand gestures, stomps, etc and the partner is supposed to mimic them even though they could only see them through the their peripherals.  You don't say a word during this \"ice breaker\".  This went on for several minutes.  To make it more uncomfortable, the girl I was paired with had a very severe facial deformity.  You could tell she was mortified by this.  It affected the entire structure of her face and forehead. When I'm 3 feet away and meant to be staring this distraught stranger in the eye for several minutes, it was impossible not to glance at the rest of her face.  We both felt aweful at the end of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, yeah, if you're a professor trying to come up with ice breakers, don't even consider that one.",
