  "title:": "Professor complained that I took too long to finish a quiz?",
  "text": "We have weekly quizzes for one of my classes. I have had this professor before, but since switching to canvas he has been looking at specific student activities.\n\nHe complained before about how students were not watching his entire lectures. Like, every single second of it. I watched all the lectures but once I was done with my notes, I exit out. \n\nNow, recently, he seemed upset that it took me 40 minutes out of the 60 provided to complete a 20 question quiz. I got a 18/20 of the quiz. He asked if I just wasn't \"prepared\" however, I watched the complete lectures and took notes! I even read the textbook. In general, I take longer to take quizzes and I am at home where I do not have the best privacy. \n\nI also do not feel the need to rush through any assignments unless needed.\n\nShould I even bother responding to my professor? He left it as a comment on the quiz after he graded it.",

Unfortunately, the only thing you can really do is take the high road here. \n\nI would reply explaining that you wanted to make sure you were giving the best answers you could and that there was time provided for you to do so. Also tell him that if feels that you are unprepared, you would be glad to go in to office hours and discuss better studying strategies.",

Explain that you feel well within acceptable limits to spend approximately 2 minutes per question. Lastly, offer to schedule a short 15 minute zoom call to discuss any additional concerns. \n\nThe professor might have a genuine concern that you are not understanding the material. I had a professor for a second time and he reached out when he felt my work was subpar relative to the prior semester (related subjects in the same field). I guess my point here is, don\u2019t forget that your professor is a human too.

So he should know if you're watching the lectures - I'm unsure how it works if it opens out into a new window though.  \n   \nPerhaps f I was looking and it took most of the students 5 minutes to take a quiz but it took you 40 minutes I would be concerned too, so it could be more out of concern rather than accusatory. I find it hard to tell with my instructors a lot. You'd be surprised how many kids drop out after the first month or so because the course work is too difficult, I know some instructors who try to catch those who maybe falling through the cracks - not that I'm saying you are.   \nAlso I have found that a lot of different instructors have different expectations of quizzes on Canvas, some allow open books, google is fine etc, some expect you to take it without notes without opening other windows, I found that without asking it's hard to know who thinks which way, so I would ask for clarification.  If he was expecting you to take it without notes or google, 40 minutes could seem like a long time. I was taking a long time on quizzes and an instructor pointed out to me that I was allowed to use notes, which cut down the time it took me dramatically. A different instructor had timed quizzes because our final test was timed and he wanted us to try to learn manage our time better since it was such a large assignment.  \n\n\nIt sounds like there's no way to know without just messaging back. If he's a jerk, you have more proof, which may come in handy later. I know a lot of instructors who are a lot more lenient with students who they communicate often with because they know they're genuinely trying.",
