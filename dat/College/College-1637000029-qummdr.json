  "text": "I'm currently enrolled in a literature course in a university but it doesn't really passionate me. Due to depressive disorders in the past I've never completed courses and I feel like it's too late to start over now, despite my motivation that's left in this aspect. But I feel like I'm going to fail this time since I don't know if I still am ready for the work load. What should I do?",

I struggled with wanting to take courses I didn\u2019t need that interested me. One or two is okay. A whole semester is an expensive delay in graduating.",

It\u2019s not too late to start over, but you aren\u2019t getting younger and the sooner you can realize you are the only one who will hold yourself accountable, the better. Id give the course a shot, and try and finish it as a goal for yourself.",
