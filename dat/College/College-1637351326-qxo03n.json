  "title:": "Should I go back to college while working?",
  "text": "I am 21 and I had to drop out of school in 2020 because I couldn\u2019t afford it. Now, I am wanting to pursue my bachelors, but I work 5 hours a day Mon-Sat (11:30-4:30). I am the only employee at my office, so my hours are not flexible. I also can not quit or move.\nThe closest university to me is an hour away and I\u2019d need to do some in person classes to qualify for scholarships. Some can be online, though.\nI am worried that I\u2019m going to be putting too much on my plate if I do this, but I\u2019ve always been motivated and done good under stress. I want this for myself, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s realistic. Do you have any advice for doing this, or do you think this is an unrealistic goal?",

She works full-time with the state, 5 days a week for 8 hours. She took four classes and spent most of the weekend doing her assignments.\n\nSo it's not impossible to do, it may just get extremely stressful and you\u2019ll have to manage your time accordingly.",

Not only I work but also babysit full time and those days can be random. Not much advice but know you are not alone. I\u2019m here for other people\u2019s advice.",
