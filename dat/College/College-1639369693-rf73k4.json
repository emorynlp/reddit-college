      "text": "Bio prof here. We generally don't advise physics until later (soph or junior year for premeds). But first-year freshman bio majors generally are all advised into majors biology, general chemistry, and the first math, along with core curriculum like English composition. The only exceptions are students who come in with credits already or students who don't meet the math requirement yet for general chem.\n\nEdited to add: Here's an example [recommended sequence for biology major at LSU](https://catalog.lsu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=19&poid=10215#BiologicalSciences) (not where I did my undergrad), just to give you an idea. This is actually almost identical to how we do things where I am, except genetics waits until junior year, and we don't require calculus (we also serve a much different population of students than the flagship does).",
