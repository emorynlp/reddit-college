  "text": "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m terrible at time management or too hard on myself or what but I can never feel accomplished or do as much review as I\u2019d like for my classes. For example for math I want to review with math videos such as organic chemistry tutor or Professor Leonard. But these videos tend to be at least an hour long if not longer and I want to get through at least 1, but that doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nI get my homework done, but I also want to do these extra reviews to understand the material fully. I find it super helpful. \n\nWhat is a realistic number of hours to do homework/realistic number of tasks? \nOther times I get really distracted or bored, or friends want to do something so I never complete everything I set out to do that day. \n\nI want to watch like three 1 hour videos on math, in addition to other practice for other classes. Because I\u2019m taking notes and trying to do the math problems as I follow along it can take a while. Is this too many expectations? Or am I bad at managing my time? \n\nWhat advice would you give?? Thanks!!!",

      "text": "Tbh\n\nFor STEM\n\nYou grind out problems, and look up the wording of problems you don't understand fully\n\nFor humanities (writing, reading)\n\nAudiobook it right before the class. I've found that I forget most things about a book unless I read it a day or some hours before the class to reinforce discussion. Writing essays? That's kinda subjective, but just use every sentence to answer whatever question is given in the prompt.",

      "text": "General rule is expect 2-3 hours for every 1 hour in class. I also try to give myself one day off and schedule it as a 9-5 ish.\n\nSo 15 hours in class, is 30-45 hours studying. So 5 days a week you have 3 hours of classes, let's say at 9, and 2 pm.\n\n8:30 - Get to school.\n\n9:00 - 10:25 - Class one \n\n10:30 - Get to library, set up, maybe get more coffee \n\n10:45 - 12:30 - Study for about two hours or until hungry \n\n12:30 - 1:00 - Lunch, walk around, destress\n\n1:00 - 1:55 - Study another hour. Ish. \n\n2:00 - 3:25 - Class two\n\n3:30 - Repeat as before, go find study spot, set up.\n\n3:30 - 5:30 - Study for 2 hours (or a bit more)\n\nCongrats you now have 4 hours, 5 times a week for 20 hours. This is enough to keep your head above water.  \n\nYou have 10ish hours left. Personally I break this down as about 3+ hours on one or two weeknights of lazier studying (videos, rewriting notes, readings before class) often while on Discord because I'm lazy. And a single week day of like 6ish hours max. \n\nFor exams and cram time, you'll probably be studying multiple days a week instead, but most of the year you'll have one weekend day off and 3-4 weeknights off. \n\nYou only have 4-5 hours a night of time after travel, school, cooking, sleeping, showering, existing. Using a schedule where you study between classes helps A LOT. Most of the time your friends will bug you after class, not to hang out at 10 AM. \n\nAlso try to do all your adulting on one day. Groceries, laundry, chores, all are easier if you can just do them at once not every night. Plus laundry is a good time for lazy studying, your stuck there for a hour or two anyhow.\n\nThe amount of tasks is hard to quantify, so I would focus on time and getting things correct. Also, YouTube videos can often be speed up slightly if you have a good ear saving you a few extra minutes.",
