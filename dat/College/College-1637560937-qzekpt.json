  "title:": "I (M) need advice with my roommate and his girlfriend living together with me.",
  "text": "It\u2019s my fourth year in college, and this hasn\u2019t ever been a problem before, but my roommates GF comes over and lately I feel like a guest in my own place. It\u2019s on-campus housing and there is no privacy or solitude. I\u2019m constantly on edge whenever she\u2019s around, and can\u2019t be myself, express my thoughts and have a joke with my buddy.\n\nShe comes over to study, sleeps with us, showers, has sex, and does everything here. I feel very alone, but I can\u2019t retreat anywhere either. It\u2019s very stressful.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna talk to him since I love the guy to death, and I don\u2019t really talk to her (it\u2019s a little weird). She\u2019s very nice, supportive, and not a monster so I don\u2019t know who to blame.",

      "text": "you're paying for the housing, i assume he is too. there's a contract between you two to share the space. it's totally a dick move on his part if his gf is there constantly, sleeping over, essentially living with you. you never asked for nor agreed to a third roommate, especially one that doesn't pay rent lmao. confront him on this issue asap; set boundaries (no more sleeping over as much, maybe he can go to her place to hangout sometimes or they can go elsewhere...). be kind but firm- if it ruins the friendship, that's on him, not you. you deserve to feel comfortable in your own space- him being your friend or her being a kind person is irrelevant.",
