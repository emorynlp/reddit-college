  "text": "Hi there. New to this. I\u2019m looking to start college soon within the next year. Preferably an online program considering I work, pay bills etc. I\u2019ve always been super interested in computers, photography, social media, graphic design, web design etc. What type of degree should I go for that would bring me a career with longevity? If I\u2019m going to be spending all this money I want to make sure it\u2019s something I enjoy and I\u2019m good at. Any info/advice is appreciated! Thanks.",
