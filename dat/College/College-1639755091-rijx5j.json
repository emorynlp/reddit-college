  "text": "Soo I have an assignment due 12mn (40 mins fr now) but I plan not to do it. Just feel so drained this day & had a lot to do. I know my grades would be in danger for not taking the assignment but\u2026 I want to prioritize myself first since I feel like I am close to the edge. \ud83d\ude41 i wonder if I should start blaming myself for failing already.",
