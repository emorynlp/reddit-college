  "text": "Ok so I\u2019m a first generation college student, I literally don\u2019t know a single person who\u2019s graduated college so I can\u2019t really go to anybody for advice,\nI know I\u2019ll have to eventually see my advisor and ask her about this.\nAnyways yeah, I\u2019m a first gen college student, I\u2019m a freshman in my first semester and I don\u2019t wanna continue into my second semester. What the fuck do I do lol. It\u2019s mainly bc I\u2019d rather go to a community college, or get a job. \nI wanna finish this semester just so I have the credits or whatever but after that I don\u2019t wanna continue. My main confusion is how do I go about doing this and what\u2019s happens with my aid? I have like 17,000 in financial aid for the spring semester so what happens when I don\u2019t go through with that semester? Should I just go through with the spring semester? I know I\u2019ll have to pay it back regardless. As you can see I\u2019m clueless and I\u2019ll take any advice I can get thanks :)",
