  "text": "Hey random internet people, I'm 25 and in my first year of uni (out of 4), in English I guess my course would be called something like Environmental Social Sciences. So I've been very interested in this topic for a long time, I'm always reading stuff on politics, climate, sociology, anthropology and stuff like this, so I thought uni would be great for me, but as it turns out, I'm just not really enjoying it at all... Several times I feel like some classes are a waste of time for being either too superficial (the amount of content we need to study is so large there is no time to actually go deeper into topics), having a boring subject or the worst, when the subject is supposed to be super cool like Anthropology but the professor just sucks. All in all I don't feel like I'm learning a lot from it. Besides, I'm struggling to keep up with the amount of assignments and reading required, especially for subjects I don't give a shit about and find extremely boring (like law and maths).\n\nI wonder what's wrong with me as my colleagues seems to be doing somewhat fine, I don't know, I always hated school and I generally don't do well with hierarchical authority, but I love studying. My course is expensive and I really don't know what to do, this is what I always wanted to get deeper in, but now it just seems like I'm wasting my time and money, this is stressing me out big time. Did you ever feel like this and what you do to keep on university?   \n\n\nPS.: this sub should be called r/university, no one calls it college lol",

      "text": "It honestly depends on the person. Some people may like university, and others may not, and that\u2019s ok! University is also very challenging, and does require a lot of work, no matter what your major is! \n\nMy advice for you is to figure out what you want in life, and decide from there where to go. Your goals in life may help you decide if university is right for you. For example, I have goals that will require a degree, but a lot of my family has goals that don\u2019t involve going to university, but going to fire school (I live in a family of firefighters). \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to you what your goals are, and you have to decide if university is part of that. It is a tough decision to make, but if you know what your goals are, then it becomes easier to make that decision.",

      "text": "While I don't believe it is for everyone, if your biggest goal is to graduate and get a job in this field that you are interested in then you should push through it. Bad professors and courses you have no interest in are just a way of life unfortunately. \n\nAlso you are in your first year and I am assuming you have not taken most of the required courses for your major. I'd imagine it becoming more enjoyable for you as your college life progresses especially with how you describe your interest in the field. \n\nHowever, its all depends on how much you want to work in environmental social sciences. If you are willing to put in the work (which includes taking courses you don't enjoy) then do it and if not then drop out and move on.",
