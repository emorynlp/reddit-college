  "title:": "I want to go to a public college (Sheridan) for Game Design, but my father won't listen to anything that doesn't have the word \"University\" in it. How do I convince him that Sheridan is a good college, or is he right?",
  "text": "The title pretty much summarizes my question. My dad doesn't want me to go to any school that isn't a university for who knows what reason. He said stuff implying that Sheridan is similar to a trade school and it doesn't teach me what I want it to, but I've looked at the curriculum and it has exactly what I want. \n\nI told him how Sheridan is regarded as one of the best Game Design schools in Canada, but he just replies \"They probably pay the websites to say that\". How do I convince my dad to let me go to Sheridan? Or is he right about Sheridan not being a good college?",

      "text": "Let your dad know that he's not the one attending college but it's you. Plenty of advisors from colleges have agreed and proven that education from public colleges is no different in teaching than the university except for the opportunities that are given during your undergrad and the option for a further grad school. Public colleges are being recommended for students to save money depending on their major as public colleges have a thing for getting people in and out of their schools with a degree compared to universities, who have a bad habit of purposefully having the student enroll longer than they need to in order to bring in revenue for the school and have the student take unnecessary classes or convincing them that in order to do better they have to take the grad school offered by the university. Many students tend to look at universities because of the name, but you get a lot of financial benefit from going public college compared to a university. This is coming from a junior in university who's advisor at first told them they would have to stay 5 years in school until I called BS and did my own class evaluations and I'm graduating on time.",

      "text": "Sheridan is extremely highly regarded in any area with a connection to design, and well connected for work. You might also though look at the Brock University program, which has the same kind of cohort structure as Sheridan's and good industry connections. (I have a family member who applied to both and ended up at Brock. He did not seriously consider non cohort based programs or any that looked like you'd come out without a strong portfolio from coursework.)",
