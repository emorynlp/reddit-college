  "text": "When I get too stressed out and overwhelmed.  I start self-sabotaging. \n\nI don't know how to stop. \n\nI have a lab report due today that I still part of the way through that I am still stuck on. I emailed my professor to get help and he's not responding. \n\nI have a physics exam that I really don't want to fail. And my physics professor is not good at teaching at all. The entire class failed our previous test. And I have to use the internet for help because my university doesn't have a science tutoring department. And no one in the math lab knows anything about physics. \n\nI have a genetics test on weds with a lot of material. \n\nAnd I can barely sleep and eat.",

      "text": " Im glad you posted this because I do the same thing in the sense of I stop doing my basic needs, I get headaches, I lose all focus, etc. I try to pull myself out of it by just playing music in the background and pushing through the work the best I can. Luckily I am in an environment in which other people reminds me about eating and sleep, otherwise that would probably escalate. \n\nIf you want advice Id say lab report first, try to skip around the part you dont understand if possible, then study physics, then genetics. For physics is there a different professor for that class? (anyone else who teaches the same course)? if so I recommend going to get their assistance.  Remember your mind and body is like a laptop: you can do a bunch of things, but eventually you are going to need a charge (sleep, eat, relaxing).",
