  "text": "Okay,\n\nHave you ever asked your instructor why the math book you're using is so not helpful and explains things in the worst possible way and gotten the response, \"Because it's written for instructors, not students. I know, it doesn't make any sense\"?\n\nOr\n\nHas someone who claims to be really good at math (perhaps an engineer - someone who you know got really far in math) offered to help you and been completely flabbergasted after looking at your textbook and said, \"Why on earth would they explain it that way? That was the most confusing possible way to explain that\"?\n\nNow, have you noticed the new editions of these books coming out constantly - almost as if to say, \"these ones will be even more helpful\"?\n\nI feel like learning math used to be easier for people. I'm left completely speechless when I spend hours upon hours trying to decipher my textbooks and cannot figure out what they're trying to say to me. And then, if I'm lucky, I come across a source that explains a concept clear as day.\n\nAre textbooks getting worse and worse at teaching because they're trying to explain the same exact thing with different words so they can keep writing new editions and profiting from them? Was it actually EASIER to learn math in the past? Why can't we use 50 year old books that explain the concepts better?",

      "text": "Yes. I once used a textbook from 1972 for my college algebra class last semester and it explained everything to the point and in a concise way. No bs problems on \u201cfind the maximum vertex for the astronaut floating in space\u201d just practical examples with the appropriate formulas in a big header box that was easy to access.",

      "text": "It varies a bit, but yeah, textbooks definitely don\u2019t always explain things the best way possible. For math, resources like Khan Academy can be helpful up to differential equations and linear algebra. With more advanced courses, you might be able to find people who explain things well on YouTube.",
