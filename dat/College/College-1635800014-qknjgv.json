  "title:": "Considering switching Majors from Nursing to Outdoor Rec",
  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college, and I\u2019m starting to second guess my major. In highschool I talked about wanting to study all sorts of things from engineering, to marine biology, and nursing. My parents really latched on to the idea of nursing school. Several of our family friends are nurse practitioners, and they make great money. I was an honors student throughout highschool, and my college has a pretty competitive nursing program. For a while I even considered getting my bachelors in nursing then going on to med school.\n\nOver the weekend I took a whitewater kayaking trip, and the two team leaders are Outdoor Recreation Majors. One plans on becoming a park ranger, while the other is getting certified in recreational therapy. They said the degree was very versatile, and it honestly sounds pretty awesome. I told my parents, and while they told me they\u2019d support whatever path I chose, they joked that a lot of the courses for the degree seem like blow off classes. \n\nIm worried that if I switch majors, I\u2019d be selling myself short. After all, I\u2019m currently fighting my way through organic chemistry.",
