  "text": "I got a 'Need Based Grant' (in South Carolina) and I can't find any information anywhere about what it can be used for. Can it only be applied towards tuition, or do I just get a check in the mail? Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I can't find this information anywhere. The government website has an FAQ, but no mention of this. If I try to google it, I just get a shitload of spam.",

      "text": "Grants (and all financial aid) are sent to your university first. Most grants (and financial aid) can be awarded up to cost of attendance, aid goes to unpaid tuition and fees first then the remainder can be refunded, you cannot receive more aid than cost of attendance though (includes room and board estimates). Some grants may dictate that they are for tuition only, you\u2019d have to check the details of that specific grant",
