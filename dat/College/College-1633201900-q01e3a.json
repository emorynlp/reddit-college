  "text": "Profs of Reddit, you literally wrote the assignments, chose their format, chose the timeframe to give them out, and chose the deadline. So why does it still take 4 weeks for me to get my grades and feedback? I see no excuse other than just not caring about student learning tbh.",

      "text": "Lurking prof here. Short answer is you're right, this is bad behavior. Call your prof's out on it in their end of the semester evals. \n\nLonger answer: grading is the most monotonous thing in the world. Imagine you're an expert on a topic, and you have to read a paper on that topic written by a novice. That's going to be pretty painful (that's not meant as an insult to the students--they're learning, of course their assignments are going to be relatively elementary). Now imagine you have to do it 20, or 30, or 50 times in a row. Now imagine you have to do it 30 times in a row, three years in a row. Reading the same papers over and over again, writing the same comments over and over again. A lot of the feedback is repeating stuff you specifically mentioned in class, stuff that you specifically wrote into the assignment sheet, because you know what mistakes students are going to make before they make them, because you've done this a million times before. On top of all that, you know that 95% of students are just going to check their grade and never read the feedback you spent so much time writing (you know that because they make the same mistakes on their next paper). It is absolutely the worst part of being a professor. It's like painting a house that you know is going to be torn down, and as soon as you finish you have to move on to painting the next house that is going to be torn down. \n\nThose aren't meant to be excuses, and, like I said, ultimately you're right. But if you're wondering the reasons, I think most professors would agree with what I wrote.",

Professors are people who love their subject matter so freaking much they devoted their lives to it. Our assessments are not tricks to trap you, we just genuinely want to see what you\u2019ve learned (in general, I know there are some jerk profs out there but they are hopefully rare and soon to be retired). We believe we\u2019ve given you the tools and resources to demonstrate your learning effectively. So just come into it with a spirit of intellectual curiosity. Read the directions carefully! Review the course materials that apply to that assignment! Just, make an genuine effort to show that you\u2019ve learned something and don\u2019t treat our life\u2019s work like it\u2019s a huge boring waste of time chore (even if you think so, just don\u2019t make it apparent to us). \n\nMostly I\u2019ve found that students who ask questions like \u201chow can we make this less painful for you\u201d are already doing this, so you probably needn\u2019t concern yourself with this advice. But you\u2019d be shocked at the frequency with which students tell us things like \u201cthis is dumb why do I even have to\u201d or \u201cyou never told us we needed to do that\u201d (after two lectures, an email, and specific assignment instructions saying exactly that thing they needed to do).

Grading depends on the assignment and if it\u2019s a small class with just you, or a large class with TAs (which takes forever and has additional layers I\u2019m going to skip for now). \n\nGrading a presentation or a quiz/exam is pretty quick and easy if you don\u2019t procrastinate, but papers take forever. Trying to decipher the poor writing and give points where possible is what takes the longest amount of time and is incredibly monotonous and soul crushing at times. So despite what students think, we prefer not having to take off points because it makes our lives more difficult/takes more time (especially since we need to explain what was wrong). We could just give all the bad grammar papers zeros or 100\u2019s but then we\u2019re subject to grade appeals and such. \n\nOne other item that slows down grading is consistency. Usually I (I don\u2019t know who else does this) will need to go back to previously graded assignments to assure I wasn\u2019t just in a specific mood when grading those and therefore was grading unfairly. \n\nFinally, we have other things we\u2019re expected to do as part of our profession. If this is an R1 (like I\u2019m at) research is a HUGE part of what we do and it takes up A LOT of time. We also have committees and such that occupy a lot of our time. A lot of our grading comes \u201cafter hours\u201d (i.e., Is take home work) and some people have families/kids and such. That said, reasonable turn around is an expectation of our job.",

I work approximately 60 hours a week doing: my own research and corresponding deadlines (I spend approximately 15-20 hours a week on this), my own class work (same as research), prep for section (2-4 hours per week), teaching/going to lectures (5 hours a week), office hours (3 hours per week), going to my own classes (15 hours per week), and emails/general upkeep (3-4 hours per week).

      "text": "As someone who has been\u2014and still is\u2014a student, I get the frustration, I really do. In the field I teach, I consider detailed, specific feedback on each student\u2019s work to be about half of my opportunity to provide quality instruction, so I want to be as punctual in providing that feedback as possible. In some courses I\u2019ve taken as a student, that punctuality was critical, while in others it was mostly my curiosity and impatience driving my frustration from delayed grading. In any case, having to wait on grades *is* definitely frustrating.\n\nHowever, like any situation, it\u2019s rarely as simple as \u201cif this person cared, this source of frustration wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d For context, here\u2019s a selection of just some of the responsibilities I have demanding my attention at any given time:  \n\nTeaching 5 to 7 unique courses per semester, acting as academic advisor for students, scheduling my department\u2019s courses, managing three equipment-heavy labs, purchasing equipment and supplies, diagnosing and repairing equipment, writing and revising curriculum, supervising student projects, on- and off-campus recruiting, conducting course and program assessment, serving on 3+ committees, developing marketing materials for the department, managing dual credit instructors and courses, developing mandatory professional development materials, maintaining contact with employers and advisory committee members, filling out admin-required paperwork and documenting contact with students (because, like students, upper admin like to assume faculty just aren\u2019t capable of doing their jobs), and, of course, grading.  \n\nThere simply aren\u2019t enough hours in the week to accomplish everything that needs to be done in the ideal amount of time, and my entire school is understaffed, so everyone on campus is doing the work of multiple people. Unfortunately, that does interfere with getting some graded work back to students in a timely fashion, no matter how dedicated we are to student learning. I can work 70+ hours a week and still not have half the time I need to actually accomplish everything that truly needs to be done. I end up having to make the most of what time I do have based on what will create the best outcomes for my students.  \n\nSome foundational courses for first-year students in the program require feedback on assignments to be provided twice a week to be effective, and that grading takes priority. Upper-level courses with work that relies heavily on prompt feedback is second priority, as I know my seniors are more comfortable asking questions in class when they need help. Elective courses for non-major students, where more than enough time is provided in class to complete all coursework while I am present to answer questions and provide assistance, is third priority. The rare senior course where feedback on an earlier assignment is not necessary for completing subsequent work is lowest on the list.  \n\nSomeone else in the comments put it well: You get what your *institution* pays for, not what *you* pay for. If, as a faculty member, I only had my courses to focus on, and if lab managers and recruiters and advisors and marketing staff (and so on and so forth) would be employed by the school, I could have *all* work graded and ready to return by the start of the next class. That, unfortunately, is not the reality of the situation. I do the best with the time and resources I have, and I know many others are doing the same.",

It can take a *long* time to grade written assignments, particularly if your peers happen to write incoherent drivel that practically needs a translation service, lol. Professors that don't care about students will just give those students and F and no feedback, but professors that care need to take the time dig into that mess so that they can explain to the student how to improve so they *don't* fail the class. \n\nSo yeah, grading can be hard.

Really the assignments that have little impact on my grade i turn them in and kinda forget about them until i get them back. Could also throw projects in the mix too since you really have to go with the rubric and thoroughly grade each one.\n\nExams should and usually are the priority for professors in my experience. Never waited longer than a week for an exam grade and thats how it should be.\n\nBut also some professors like to give back a bunch of different work all at once so you get your hw and worksheets and other stuff alll handed back at once.\n\nSeems like your professor needs a TA. Had a physics teacher who teaches 3 classes a semester and always got work back within 4 days or so. TA graded the homework while the professor did the lab work and exams, it was only 3 things but theres alot of calculations and i didnt find any errors in the grading.",

The teacher set up a class question board and a general 'FAQ' page because there was no damn way she could answer all of the emails she received within a timely manner. (*No* fucking clue btw why my uni decided to set up that course like that. It's the only class I ever took that had a major ratio issue.)\n\nAlso-- just for some input on emails. I work in an online customer service retail, responding to emails every day. I also use premade responses to make my work easier, modifying them slightly to fit each question. In any given hour, I could probably respond to around 20 emails with a relatively detailed answer. I can answer 50 if I disregard any attempt to be genuine and use *only* premade responses.\n\nAnd this is me, as someone who has a lot of experience with emails and spend all day going through the routine of it. I don't know how your class is set up but if your professor spends everyday day teaching, researching, grading, hosting office hours, etc. then they might have very little time to answer emails, and it might be virtually impossible for them to reply to everyone. I mean-- just thinking about my example-- if even 1/6 of my class had emailed my professor every week, then she would receive approximately 200 emails. If she works at a pace similar to me, it would take her 10 hours to answer them all within 5 business days. And by that time, she might have had another 200 emails to get through again.",

You, *hypothetical student*, turn it in on time, as do half of your peers. But the other half doesn't, and turns it in in three days or later. Well, in three days, another assignment is due. So I can either grade all your peers' work now for the first assignment and make you wait later for the second, or you can just wait anyway since I won't release grades until everyone has been graded so answers cannot be shared, because students cheat and escalating that nonsense is a mess and a half. Either way, it's not my fault students can't do their work in a timely manner when I also have to do all the other grading, the class planning, the office hours, the department meetings, the college-wide meetings, the committees I've been forced to be on despite not wanting to nor having the time, and I still need to be able to eat and sleep so you can have grades at all. \n\nAnd finally, I'll admit I wrote that as I was heading to bed after an exceptionally long day, and assumed you were OP. I apologise for that, but not for the content of my post, since the rest of it is valid. I still have no sympathy for you when you don't seem to have sympathy in return, I still think that if you can't understand that you aren't the center of the world that's not my problem, and I still gave valid advice that ought to be followed if you, *hypothetical student*, are going to be rude about the fact that not every student is going to be as *perfect* as you.\n\nI'd rather take an F from someone who admits they have no idea what they're talking about, especially when they clearly think they're being \"funny\" but are actually just a sad excuse for a troll.

Don't assign papers if you don't like grading them? Not assigning written work is a disservice to students learning material which requires nuanced, well-developed, and carefully-articulated understanding. A classics course wouldn't be a classics course without essay-writing.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying that four weeks is appropriate in any typical circumstance. But if you're this frustrated about it, muster up the courage to talk to your professor face-to-face (going to office hours and bearing in mind that your professors are people too), not just ranting about it on reddit.",

And things like tests depend on how much of it is essay, it is monotonous and students want to know why they have points off and it can be specific. With essays, we have to read the whole thing and make sure you meet all the goals, have proper grammar, and correct citations. I have one class of 63 and another of 150, so grading can definitely take a while.",
