  "text": "i go to a community college. i only got into one state school but i didn\u2019t go because it was very expensive and my parents did not allow me to take loans. this is my first year and i failed two classes. anthropology and political science. i don\u2019t know what to do. i tried so hard for the both of those classes but still failed. i\u2019m incredibly embarrassed and i too scared to tell my parents but i\u2019m sure they\u2019ll find out eventually. please help! i don\u2019t know what to do and i would appreciate any advice on how to discuss this with my parents and how to move past the fails.",

Got too distracted because of personal life events?\n\nWhat happened? Nobody can tell you what advice is applicable when we don\u2019t know why you failed.",

          "text": "it was just this mix of being depressed, forgetting how hard school was (i didn\u2019t do actual school work for a year and a half due to the pandemic) and trying to conceive myself that i was was okay. i did study but it wasn\u2019t enough. for my posc class, the professor only has test as ways to show that we did work. he gave us lectures and few supplemental material. we would have to take notes and study them. i did this for each of the four modules. i tried my best to study but each test i didn\u2019t do well at. i\u2019m not an amazing test taker. for anthro, i was just incredibly confused the entire time. i studied as much as i could, but at the end i didn\u2019t do so well. this class had ended in november, so my parents are aware of me failing anthro. but not posc. i\u2019m the first born of my family, but i have an older cousin who got into this really good school up north and i constantly felt like i should have been like her, instead of staying home and doing cc online. i\u2019m not blaming her at all, but i\u2019ve been depressed for months that i\u2019m not going to a college that i actually like. i basically lost all of my friends due so i decided that online would be best for me. but it hasn\u2019t worked out like i would have hoped. it worked for me during my senior year. i can provide more context if needed.",

      "text": "Retake the courses next semester, maybe try different professors. It will help your overall GPA to retake them and pass it the second time around, than to leave it as Fs on your transcripts. College can be hard especially for a first year since it is very different from high school. Don\u2019t get discourage and try again. You got this!\n\nEdit: Also look into any tutoring services when retaking the courses to see about getting some extra help.",
