      "text": "Short answer for reputable schools:  Yes, the degrees earned online or in a traditional classroom from that institution will be of roughly the same quality and will be indistinguishable to anyone with whom you share your degree or transcripts. \n\nThis is based on \n\n1. Direct experience as a professor who has taught the same classes in both formats using the same material and textbooks for two universities. \n2. Direct experience as a hiring manager.",
