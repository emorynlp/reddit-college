  "text": "Hi, I'm a Junior and I'm a accounting major (so far, I might change my mind later) at UIC (University of Illinois Chicago).\n\nNext semester I'm probably planning to take:\n\n* MGMT 340 - Intro to Organizations\n* MKTG 360 - Intro to Marketing\n* ACTG 315 - Intermediate Accounting 1\n* ACTG 326 - Cost Accounting\n* MKTG 462 (Marketing Research) or ECON 300 (Econometrics) - Probably  10x more likely to choose the former (MKTG 462) rather than the latter (ECON 300) \n\nI'm a business student and I need to fulfill colleges business core requirements as well as my major requirements. I already fulfilled all my gen-ed requirements in my first 2 years at community college and I'm a transfer student. Business Core requirements and Gen-ed requirements are two different things at my school.",

What's worse is that I suspect that I got dumber then before (for reason's I don't want to explain).\n\nAll I know is that I struggle with programming logic more than others, but I've never taken any physics or engineering classes in college so I don't know how I trully feel about those classes.\n\nAlso switching to education and becoming a high school physics teacher is a good option. This is especially the case since I'm not sure if Applied Physics is a major that's directly employable in the field without a PhD.\n\nI wish you good luck on all your future endeavors",

I've struggled mightily with the calc sequence along the way and that's the reason I want to switch from a general concentration to education. There's no more math classes left to get through and at this point I would have 3 or 4 physics classes to do and a group of educ classes. \n\nI've yet to encounter any computer work in my classes, which is good because I'm terrible with them. Maybe it's just my school but there's no programming requirement in the physics majors.",
