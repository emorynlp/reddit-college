  "text": "I go to a CC (community college) in California. I am planning to transfer to a 4-year institution and I already planned on taking 33 units next year alone (spread from Spring, Summer and Fall). I don\u2019t quite understand how transfer system works. Yes, I do know you need 60 transferable units (or 90 quarter units) prior to transfer; and I do know you need to complete all 60 before transferring in the Fall. But how does the application work? If I\u2019m completing lower division units (30~) by the end of Fall semester, should I apply for the following Fall term? Or how does that work? I heard schools like Stan State (CSU) accepts lower division applicants, but what about UCs? Other CSUs? I plan to apply to some UCs, and a handful of CSUs. Any help will do. Thanks!",

      "text": "I got my associates degree then I transfered by applying to a 4 year. You need to reach out to their admissions to see what credits will transfer. It varies from university to university. So it's the same process as applying to the CC but this time instead of HS information, they need your college.",
