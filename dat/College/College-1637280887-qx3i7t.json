Flash forward 3 years, I am taking classes at 2 community colleges and have 3+ gpa at both. So I doubt its going to hurt me in the long run.\n\nMy undergrad was a huge pre health college. They would talk about the F versus a U for med school and how it averaged out. So its a C I think for med school. I forget how law school would factor that in as well. \n\nAgain I doubt after several years of work, post bacc law school isn't shut down totally. But who knows.",
