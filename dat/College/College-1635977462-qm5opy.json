  "text": "I mean I can read them all I want but I can't comprehend or retain anything. I can read for like 30 minutes but I won't have a clue what I even read. I don't know if it just bores me or what. I can read an entire 400+ page book in hours and remember mostly everything but with textbooks it's the complete opposite.",
