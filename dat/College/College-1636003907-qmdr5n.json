  "text": "Hi guys I'm a 19-year-old sophomore at a college. My freshman year was online due to covid. I had my doubts about going to this college when I was a senior but during the pandemic when I was in high school I chose the college cause life with the lockdown was so uncertain back then. Now that I am a sophomore and have classes in person I realize that every day when I commute I regret the drive every day. I even had a few breakdowns and cried on the drive and when I was in bed thinking of how I felt I made a mistake. I'm not trying to badmouth the campus and the students and even the college. The students there are some of the nicest people I met. It's just that I feel really uncomfortable in the area and feel that when I'm here and I'm not able to truly explore who I am. Going to college should be a thrill but here I realized how unhappy I am. The area around campus feels unsafe, and I have seen some messed-up dangerous stuff happen. I'm thinking of transferring to maybe out of state. My Gpa is 3.7, and I'm hoping to increase it at the end of this and spring semester. I also have good extracurricular with being part of town organizations and have will be able to get good reference letters from my past work experiences. Currently, after the completion of the fall semester of 2021, I will have a total of 56 credits before I finish my sophomore year in the spring semester of 2022. What do you guys think I should do. Any comment, advice you say would be greatly appreciated. Also, I made a few friends that I talk to and walk with but do not really have a social circle and just don't see myself fitting in with any of the groups I saw at the campus. I tried and have made efforts but every time my classes end I just want to go home and don't want to be on campus. Thank you once again.",

      "text": "i went through something similar but not this drastic. i really gained a sense of community my sophomore year by joining a volunteer-based organization. it\u2019s a really small and tight-knit group with a lot of leadership opportunities and that made me become a lot happier. \n\ni would suggest trying to find a group on campus that you can grow in and really devote your time to. i think that could possibly really improve your sense of belonging on campus.",
