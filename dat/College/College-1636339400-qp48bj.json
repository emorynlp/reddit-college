  "text": "Throughout highschool I've used a bunch of cheap folders stuffed in my bag to organize my papers for each class, but it's pretty tedious trying to pull out the right one and they seemed to fall apart after a semester of heavy use, especially since they always bend and tear getting jostled around. Does anyone use different/better methods to organize papers?\n\nI've been looking for something like [this](https://www.staples.com/staples-7-pocket-expanding-file-folder-fabric-letter-black-51818/product_2756992?ci_src=17588969&ci_sku=2756992&KPID=2756992&cid=PS:GS:RE:RP:NB:FALSE:TXT:SV:Open:1679103750:60732599210:&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8p2MBhCiARIsADDUFVFOYKwBUnjdxDOvuRmQ-hEOJ_1AE8-rd0vWeGOa6UDdyqERRuqF7r0aAuzREALw_wcB) to keep all of my papers in one place in my bag. Would this be a good idea? Any recommendations/advice?",
