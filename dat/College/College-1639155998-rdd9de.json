  "text": "Currently at an 80% in my math class... the final is worth like half of my entire grade. I did pretty badly on my most recent midterm, so now I'm worried about the final. I expected the final to be relatively difficult, so I'm not sure if I can get an 80% on it. I could take the class S/U (basically pass-fail) (which I would have to decide before taking the final), but I'm not sure how that would impact my applying for grad school down the line (might go into something math-adjacent like stats or economics or biology).\n\nSo, the worst-case scenario is a C+, or a Pass on the P/F, which I'm not sure how that would impact me down the line. Best case scenario is I do relatively well on the final, and end up with a B-, or maybe a B (B is unlikely but B- is possible)",

      "text": "I'll play devil's advocate and avoid sugarcoating it.\n\nA C+ is not good. It straight up isn't. Grad schools, especially professional ones (medicine, law) put a *lot* of emphasis on your GPA, and IIRC, the matriculant GPA for med schools, for example, continues to rise. A C+ is a 2.3. That will undoubtedly hurt your GPA. No question. Fight for that B and up. B+/A- and up, ideally. \n\nAt the same time, like others have said: you have plenty of time to bring your GPA up.\n\nPlenty of people have gotten into grad school (including medical school) having *failed* courses. Obviously it's not ideal and requires more work on your part, but a bad/failing grade isn't and shouldn't be a career-derailing catalyst should you put in the work to make things right the next time around.\n\nBut every grad school is a little different, especially across fields, so I would recommend looking into your field/schools of interest and seeing how they view things like P/F, W, and GPA standards. \n\nGood luck!",
