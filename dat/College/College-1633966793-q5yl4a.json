  "title:": "Help! I need a 7th point of view for this assignment and I\u2019ve 6 of 7 written.",
  "text": "This an English writing assignment with a topic of my choosing. We need to propose a topic and list 7 points of view to take a stance on and write how they correlate and differ.\nMy topic I chose is Cold War propaganda and how it affects us today. My point of views are as listed: 1) American FPS games (such as Call of Duty), \n2) Russian FPS games (such as Metro), \n3) Current American Views on Russians, \n4) Current Russian Views on Americans,\n5) Cold War Era American propaganda, \n6) Cold War Era Russian propaganda\n\nAll I need is a 7th and I\u2019m kind of stuck on what to use as a base. I know this is an out there topic, and something I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people don\u2019t really think about or look at so it interested me and I\u2019ve always been interested in the Cold War.\n\nIf you could help me find a 7th view, I\u2019d be greatly appreciated. Hope you\u2019re all doing well, and college/university life is good to you all!",
