  "text": "I hate finals. I have such bad test anxiety and it's so much pressure. I've done so much worse in college than in high school and it's wild to me. It's my senior year, but I'm so burned out. Finals are the worst. Good luck on your finals everyone!!",

Even generalized anxiety (obviously doesn\u2019t have to be pass out level!) is an acceptable reason they give extra time and/or a quiet environment. I\u2019d be happy to share the process if you need.\n\nAlso, huge good luck! I believe in you. :)",
