  "text": "What is everyone\u2019s opinion on group assignments? I was recently in one and didn\u2019t have that great of an experience. I was given two task to do by the group leader. Everyone had specific roles towards the project. I completed them and placed it into the group project. I\u2019ve asked countless times before, what else needed to be done. What could my task be improved on or who needed help with something. Everyone including the group leader would say everything is fine . And even telling me I don\u2019t have to be apart of the zoom meetings towards the group. I still was apart the zoom discussions and even tried to work on things without no one telling me. Time later on the peer evaluation form, I\u2019m getting poor feedback from the group. Saying I didn\u2019t help enough. On top of the Professor saying that I wasn\u2019t appearing to be as active. When he was apart of our group chat and obviously saw my contributions. It left me confused and very blindsided. I thought with me asking what else I could help with was enough. With also trying to work on things on my own. Without trying to not step on any one\u2019s toes or change whatever they put in the group.",
