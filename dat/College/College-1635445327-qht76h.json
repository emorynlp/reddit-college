  "title:": "*need advice* student looking to order ~$10K of electronics/robotics goods for a college",
  "text": "My professor asked me to help him order a bunch of \u201cstuff\u201d (toys) for our electronics/robotics lab. We have already ordered just about everything worthwhile from Sparkfun + Adafruit and have a bunch of money left over.\n\nWe already have both SLA and filament 3D printers, small industrial 6-axis robotic arm, large Kuka arm, sensors (photo + optics, IMUs, all sorts of digital + analog basic sensors, LiDAR), and some actuators (servos, steppers, DC, some pneumatics (not enough), solenoids, some linear actuators), and some building materials/hardware.\n\nI need to order from somewhere that accepts POs (purchase orders) and is a reputable supplier. I also need to order everything from at most 2-3 suppliers. \n\nAside from that I have a lot of freedom to decide what to get.\n\nSome thoughts are: \n- building materials (aluminum extrusion, more printer material)\n- an open sourced robotic arm\n- open sourced arial drone kits or materials to experiment there\n- some sort of satellite related kits or components (the program is going to launch a satellite in the next couple years and this could be an opportunity to get learning/starter materials for that project\n- new and fun sensors\n- lots of actuators (pneumatic, hydraulic, nice servos, etc)\n- digital + audio displays\n- RF equipment\n- lot of micro controllers\n- ~20+ RPi 4s\n\nIt would be cool to get a bunch of little components and a few bigger more expensive toys.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate help on where to buy from and any ideas of what to purchase.\n\n(Community college in Southern CA, USA)",
