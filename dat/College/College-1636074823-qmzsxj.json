  "text": "Thanks to anyone that reads this and tells me what they think\n\nMy dad isolated me during my teen years. As I became a young adult it became clear to me that there was something truly wrong. One time after intense conflict he admitted to me that he was a master manipulator. Throughout my childhood he would say that he was a psychopath and said it so nonchalantly that it became trivial in my mind. It was just something normal that he said...but I believe that to people outside of my immediate family it would sound shocking. He has a very shady professional history... associated himself with some pretty questionable individuals. He was really the only influence in my life for many years. He put ideas in my head that made me not seek out/afraid to seek out other adults. It was just him. He discouraged me from having friends and speaking to adult family members. He's very good at convincing others and managing what the rest of my family members believe.\n\nIn retrospect, I wasn't able to do the things that we normally due during out young development. No girlfriend, didn't finish high school (got GED at age 19), etc. I am 25 now. \n\nI enrolled in community college and did very well! I have a great community college resume that includes community work and a story that admissions officers may enjoy. I believe I can get into a top school. I am thinking I can get into the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and go for a very very low cost. I'll be 26 for fall 2022 I want to go and study hard, prepare for a career, but also to socialize with other students and just people I meet in Los Angeles. I want to enjoy my undergraduate college years. Talk to girls. Do spontaneous 20 something year old things. All while being sure to graduate and do an internship or two.\n\nI think this is what I should do and that if I don't I will regret it. My friend said the shipped has sailed on the whole college thing. I bet my dad would tell me to just focus on my studies and not have friends or do anything fun. Sure I'll be a few years older than the average junior in college...but does it matter? Thank you and I look forward to your thoughts.",

      "text": "Age wise, I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue. I made a friend in my last semester of college and it wasn\u2019t until halfway through that semester that I realized he was 25 to my 22. Still didn\u2019t affect me afterwards. \n\nIn any case, you should take it slow if people skills are something you don\u2019t know much about, but it\u2019s definitely not impossible.",
