  "text": "Hello I'm a first-year college student and for the exit test we gotta read and use this article, cite it whatever, the point is it got 2 separate but kinda related topics.\n\n \n\n1. *n \u201cBack to Basics: Test Scores Don\u2019t Lie,\u201d Diane Ravitch identifies a number of problems in the American education system.\u00a0 What parts of her discussion seem to be most valid when compared to your own experience?\u00a0 Draw upon your prior experiences to support Ravitch\u2019s point of view.*\n2. *Compare what Ravitch has to say about peer pressure with your own experiences.\u00a0\u00a0 Be sure to make direct references to Ravitch\u2019s essay.*\n\nI've never had to write a essay with 2 separate topics so how can I combine those two ideas into 3 topics? Should I just use both questions as a topic and come up with a third one? Any help would be appreciated my professor made it very clear she don't work holidays so I cant ask her lol.",

      "text": "Unless your assignment specifies the format, I\u2019d personally stay away from the five-paragraph essay style. Focus more on organizing based off content and don\u2019t worry about how long it is paragraph wise. Beyond that however, it seems like these questions are very closely related. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it seems like question 1 is the general question and question 2 is something your professor wants you to focus on in some part of your essay. Does Ravitch discuss peer pressure in their book? If so, it seems your prof just wants you to make sure to use that part.",

We're supposed to give solutions from the article and from my own life but the article doesn't really offer solutions lol. College writing man. I appreciate the response nontheless.",

      "text": "Hi OP. It\u2019s hard to say without knowing what subject you\u2019re taking or reading the articles, but I think I would write 1 paragraph answering each question and use the last to discuss how they can work in conjunction to disrupt education. I would offer an experience that encompasses both, like being peer pressured to cut class or feeling like it\u2019s not cool to pay attention in class and how that impacted your test scores\u2026but that may be redundant\u2026idk. You could also do a micro approach when you answer the questions in two paragraphs and a macro approach to both issues in the other. I hope this helps your writer\u2019s block!",

Both of these bullet points are just asking you to find points from the essay you read and compare them to your personal experiences.\n\n\nSo, what I'd do in this situation is pick three points in the text related to the topics mentioned (problems in the education system, peer pressure) and dedicate one paragraph to each. If you want variety, you can pick some things that are similar to your experiences, and some that are different.",
