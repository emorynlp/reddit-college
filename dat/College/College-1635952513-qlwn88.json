  "text": "I never thought it would get to this point but I am honestly thinking about dropping out and going home. I'm a senior now and I go to a big school in a place where it rains a lot, like literally every fucking day. It sounds so stupid but thats the reason I am struggling so much. I have a ton of friends and support systems here, a great job, and I love my degree program, the only thing I can't get over is the weather. I have a therapist and a HappyLight now and I'm doing everything I can but I still can't get over my seasonal depression. It was never that bad before the COVID winter, and I'm not really an emotional guy, but its so dark and gloomy compared to where I grew up that I just cry for no reason. It really affects me and I just want to go home but I'm so close to the finish line, what should I do lol.",
