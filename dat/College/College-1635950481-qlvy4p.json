You\u2019re saying STEM should stop complaining about STEM, which, okay, I don\u2019t agree but that\u2019s a reasonable opinion that one could have, but then you make a point about psych majors without clarifying. Of course there\u2019s a difference, but what does that have to do with STEM complaining about STEM.",

              "text": "I have two thoughts, and they\u2019re mostly unrelated to your general sentiment I think, but I thought I\u2019d share them. \n\nI think we need to acknowledge that there is a fundamental difference between liberal arts majors and STEM majors, in that the former is very much a \u201cmake of it what you put in it\u201d, and the latter is very much a \u201cyou are what it makes you.\u201d So the rigor of the former is much to do with how much effort is put in, and the latter is much to do with how well you can recall the material. \n\nAlso, one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that many undergraduate STEM majors compare their programs to undergraduate liberal arts majors, but I think this is also fundamentally flawed. Sure, many liberal arts majors go right into the workforce, but many of them choose to pursue graduate studies. It has been my experience that most STEM programs are terminal, so their initial rigor is obviously great, but most liberal arts programs are more of a foundation, and their corresponding graduate programs are the terminal programs. You don\u2019t see a STEM major downplaying the difficulty of law school (though I\u2019m sure some do), and yet many law students have liberal arts degrees. You don\u2019t see STEM majors downplaying clinical psychology, graduate economics, etc, and yet many of those students hold liberal arts degrees. I think most people who go into liberal arts programs have a realistic expectation of outcomes. You don\u2019t see psych majors assuming they\u2019re going to get their bachelors and suddenly become a pioneer in the field.",
