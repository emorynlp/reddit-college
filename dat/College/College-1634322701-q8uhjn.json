  "title:": "Will employers care if I transfer back to old university?",
  "text": "I started a business program in University A in September 2020. I had about a 3.97 gpa BUT had 3 WD. I got accepted to a transfer to University B so I transferred to University B because it had a better reputation for my program and I was worried the 3 WD would affect my employment prospects (they don\u2019t show up on University B transcript).\n\nDue to some financial issues, my family wants me to consider transferring back to University A. (Tuition/living expenses for second year and up is cheaper.) I applied for a transfer back, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to go back until September 2022.\n\nAssuming I get accepted for the transfer back, will employers care about this transfer mess? Should I just stay at University B? (It will be a lot harder financially on my parents).",
