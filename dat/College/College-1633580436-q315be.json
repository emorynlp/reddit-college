  "text": "i\u2019ve barely been 3 months into community college and i already want to leave. my major is graphic design but i have to take stats and english. despite being a graphic design major, english is my easiest class. i\u2019m failing art, and i\u2019m failing statistics. i\u2019ve heard from a lot of people that college isn\u2019t needed for graphic design just experience but i don\u2019t know what to do. i don\u2019t want to look like a failure cause i quit so early but at the same time i don\u2019t want to continue and wish i had left a long time ago when i could. thoughts? :(",

I would definitely check what employers are asking for in job postings nearby.\n\nRegardless of whether you decide to continue or not, don't let other peoples thoughts control you. Especially when it comes to decisions for your career. I know it is easier said then done but just wanted to emphasize it.",

      "text": "Believe me, my best class I took for an A was a Japanese history class. Not my major at all but did well in it. So no worries if your class is easy and since you\u2019re there to learn which should be a hard classes In your major for learning unless that professor makes it complicated and not a great instructor. You\u2019ll know when you get one. Have you gone to tutoring or office hours? If you\u2019re not understanding the material then you should go to one or the other really recommended. YouTube and google is also a good resource for stats. Like other comment said, don\u2019t let other decide your career. You might want to answer if you truly want to quit school or if you are just feeling overwhelmed with the material. You can always take part time college work if you need to work on college readiness like studying and all that. There\u2019s no rush when it comes to college",
