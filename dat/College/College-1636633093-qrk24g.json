  "text": "So I'm 19 & a college freshman, I absolutely hated highschool....it was legitimately the worst four years of my entire life. It was insanely traumatizing and I still have the affects of it. I was a complete loser. I love college to the stars! I mean seriously, it makes me so so happy. I feel so much better about myself. I'm just trying to have fun...and keep my grades up at the same time of course. My old highschool group posts so many snapchat stories from highschool. And I'm always wondering why. Are they not satisified with college? Are they living in the past? Is it just nostalgia? I mean what's going on? Because I just don't give a hoot and have moved on.",
