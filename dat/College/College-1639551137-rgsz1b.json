  "title:": "My most glorious college class moment ever occurred in an otherwise shitty class.",
  "text": "The semester ended about a week ago. I passed all my classes with As and Bs, but my biopsychology professor was an absolute pain in the ass. She would give us an overwhelming amount of course material to be covered for exams, and this was not helped by the fact that there were only three exams the entire semester. The whole class made it clear in the WhatsApp chat that her policies were not loved, and that is putting it mildly. I would say that at least 80% of the discussions in there were about how much they were against the professors teaching style and why. I don't really blame them either, yet this class which was by far the most difficult I have had to deal with in my two years of college provided me with my most glorious moment as a college student. Ever.\n\nShe assigned us this project in which we need to make a model that displays and covers the basic functions of a neuron. She specifically said in class and her instructions on Canvas that the model can be anything, from sculpting, to painting, to anything that can be used and interpreted as a model to explain the functions of neurons.\n\nSo, I decide to make a map, inspired by fantasy worlds, that displays the functions of a neuron. And it worked out beautifully, as she asked for a description/legend in the original assignment instructions, I was able to create a detailed description of the map highlighting the specific names and details of the map and what each represented in the functions of the neuron.\n\nLater, after submitting, the submission comment my professor gave was unlike any other compliment I ever received. Here is the comment copied from the submission:\n\n\"This is certainly the most creative and unique \"model\" neuron I have ever received, and I appreciate all the effort you took to make such a great map and description/story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and I think it must have helped you understand the electrochemical transmission process better with your analogies there. \n\n I really particularly enjoyed how you incorporated the potassium, calcium, and sodium ions/channels.   Well done! \"\n\nI had never received such a compliment from any learning instructor ever. This was before the first exam in the semester, which was imo when the class began to realize what they were dealing with. Even though this class would begin to turn to shit a few weeks after this assignment, this moment was priceless. It was not a hard assignment, and I do not consider myself to be a very creative person. So, this meant a lot to me. I literally screenshotted the comment and put it in my university account's Google Drive, just for sentimental value.",
