  "text": "Well first of all, my major is teaching english. I was accepted in one of the best universities of my country. I really love my major but I'm starting to fear it. I'm not a confident person at all and not very good at speaking. It's causing me trouble since all of my teachers expect me to talk and discuss things in the class. Hell I'm even afraid of answering the questions that I know their answer and I'm sure It's correct. I'm afraid of choosing the wrong word for my sentence. My classmates, some of them, not all, are really good at speaking.The fact that my classes are online made it even worse for me. Typing in the chat box is hard since I'm using my phone and I can't answer questions quickly.\n\nI'm working on my speaking so I wouldn't make mistakes when I'm talking but about confidence I don't know what to do. My classmates told me they are stressed too but they have to talk to get good marks. (They don't sound stressed tbh)\n\nIs there anyone who was like me and could overcome this feeling? I don't want to get low marks in my first semester...",

      "text": "Well first of all, if you want to be a teacher you will have to speak in front of people all day and you will also have to be the one who keeps the class in order. So it\u2019s not just for getting good marks, it\u2019s for actually being a teacher. My advice is to practice. Talk in front of amirror if you are scared to do other things, watch yourself. Practice with friends and family. If the problem is that you have to speak in English, improve your English and practice that too with family, even if they can\u2019t understand you. If the problem is the language then try to listen to movies in English and such stuff. You could also ask your classmates to practice with you. Also I understand you are scared of making mistakes. Nothing happens if you say the wrong thing in class, it\u2019s better than saying nothing. Try to force yourselfto participate more- when you see that nothing bad happens you will become more brave. Confidence is different for anyone and there is not one magic formula, but my advice is fake it till you make it. If you make a mistake don\u2019t apologize or get flustered, simply move on. You can laugh it off too. It might seem like everyone is judging you but believe me, they are busy with their own problems and no one cares if you make even a huge mistake. You are there to learn not to be perfect",
