  "text": "Hi, I will be going to Drexel University in the spring. I\u2019m very nervous about it. If anyone goes there dm me about the culture. It\u2019s a really good school, so I\u2019m nervous that there will be a very competitive culture. I\u2019m literally coming from a hole in the wall school in Georgia (USA) and I\u2019m just nervous in general. I don\u2019t want the words \u201cgood school\u201d and \u201ccompetitive\u201d to be synonymous but I can\u2019t really help it. My old school was extremely low performing and nobody really cared so I don\u2019t know what to expect.",
