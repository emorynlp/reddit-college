  "text": "Hello,  \nI'm upset about a C/C+ I'll most likely get in Calc 3. I have a borderline B in the class (83.93) but it's most likely gonna go down once I get my final exam grade back. I'm especially upset because after bombing my first exam and getting a 48.33% I studied my ass of for the next two and got a 85 on the next and a 91.667 on the third. How can I overcome this?",
