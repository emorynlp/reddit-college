      "text": "This happened to me my freshman year - first semester (and I withdrew from the one class I could\u2019ve passed because I was scared I was going to fail). I never had to study in high school, I got the good grades etc. College hit me like a truck.\n\nIt really sucks to have wasted my first semester and spend all that money (It was my own money though so my parents minded less what grades I got because I paid my own consequences). But ultimately, you have to take it as a learning experience. A lot of colleges offer some form of tutoring for cheap or free, take advantage of that and ask how to study better/more efficiently. If you can\u2019t salvage what you have now, focus on next semester and doing things differently!\n\nI did not fail my second semester. I did end up taking a break from school after my first year but I\u2019m back after a few years break (Which I honestly don\u2019t recommend). But still, do what you need to do and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help or to change things up!\n\nGood luck with your finals. What helped me is to write summaries of materials (because I was not used to learning from the textbook)",

              "text": "Sometimes it\u2019s best to take a step back from school. I ended up taking medical leave for mental health issues when I realized I was getting overwhelmed and burnt out. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s an option for you but it may be something to consider if your school allows it. You could also discuss that option with your program counselor. It may be that you\u2019re overstudying as well and you\u2019re not retaining the info like you thought. You may want to explore different options for studying, something that may be easier for you to understand and retain and something that may be less time/energy consuming so it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s all you\u2019re doing. \nWhat helped me most to get back on track was making everything fit into smaller tasks and having a google sheet with all those tasks listed by due date and importance. It helped me from being overwhelmed as it was all right there. It may also help to watch videos for studying rather than things like bookwork or PowerPoints (if that\u2019s what you mainly use to study now). I won\u2019t go on and on in this reply as I don\u2019t want to ramble but if you ever need advice or some support feel free to reach out OP. You\u2019re not alone.",
