  "title:": "Struggling with the feeling that my parents DON\u2019T miss me.",
  "text": "Let me start off by saying I (18f) have a great relationship with both my mom and my dad. I come from a very loving home and am blessed with awesome siblings and happily married parents, which I think is part of what makes this all so confusing for me. Now siblings are one thing, I know when my oldest went off to college I hardly reached out to her. That doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t missing her or thinking about her, but I was a kid myself and my priorities were focused elsewhere. All that to say I would expect and not worry about this from my siblings but\u2026my parents do not reach out to me. Like at all. I only once in a while receive just a text, pretty much always reminding me about some responsibility I have to take care of. Not one time has either of them called just to talk, where as I try to call about every other day (because I really miss them!!!). I can\u2019t help but wonder if they just wish I would leave them alone. For reference neither of them even shed one tear when they first left me here (10+ hours away from home, I might add). I feel like even the shittiest of parents kind of cling to their children when they go off to college, at LEAST for the first week or so. I\u2019ve experienced none of that and it really hurts my feelings. I feel like I\u2019m the only one whose parents don\u2019t miss them at all. When I talk to them on the phone, I can hear it in their voices that the conversation is like a chore. Should I stop calling? I\u2019m honestly devastated and I feel so alone.",

      "text": "My experience was similar. My parents and I have always had a good relationship. I was the youngest and when I moved out they finally had an empty nest. They were truly enjoying that experience and for the first month or so at college I was enjoying my personal time as well. \n\nIt wasn't until after about the first month that I realized I was always reaching out to them first and I have always done my best to not take it personally. I know they love me a lot, but they're also from a different generation and they aren't in constant communication with their parents either. \n\nIt's not that they don't want to talk to me but they're also going through a huge change in their life as well. Navigating a household with freedom and no kids or school obligations. I slowed down on the calls and I call probably once a week now. Those phone calls end up at least being an hour and they feel more genuine because we have a whole week of things to talk about! \n\nReally you're going through a life change and so are they. Things are gonna feel weird! But that's okay!",

          "text": "Definitely a very similar experience. It took me about a month to realize as well, and I\u2019ve also tried not to take it personal, but it gets pretty lonely and starts to eat at you. You make a good point about the different generations thing. It sounds silly, but it hasn\u2019t really occurred to me that they aren\u2019t sitting around on their phones all day like I am. I do feel like we have pretty aimless conversations most of the time (which isn\u2019t a bad thing in and of itself, just a reflection of my desperation to be paid attention to), so it might serve us well to let some time go by between calls. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that. I plan to have a heart-to-heart with my mom tomorrow. Thanks for your advice. <3",

No tears when I said goodbye to my child \u2014 but you can bet I was crying as our car drove away. \n\nI agree with other comments, your parents may be trying to give you space and not pressure you into keeping in touch. I think it\u2019s fair to communicate your feelings to them and see where the conversation goes.",

      "text": "So\u2026 I am a (non-traditional) college student and a daughter, but I\u2019ve also got a daughter.\n\nI call my mom every month or so. I miss her. I don\u2019t need her help with my life choices, but I love her and miss chatting about what\u2019s going on in our lives. It\u2019s always nice to talk with her.\n\nMeanwhile, my kid is young. I love her to bits. I\u2019m also trying to raise her to be the kind of person who calls home because she wants to, not because she needs to. I\u2019ll welcome the social calls, but I won\u2019t be sad when she leaves for college\u2014it\u2019ll be a place where she can develop new social and intellectual skills that I couldn\u2019t give her. It\u2019ll also be a chance for me to finally breathe without worrying about how my actions affect my kid! If she can handle independence, that means I\u2019ve succeeded in my portion of helping her become a self-sufficient adult. And if she wants to call home to chat about what\u2019s going on in our lives? Heck, I\u2019ll be grateful she wants to chat with me about those things. But I\u2019ll leave it up to her to reach out, because\u2014if I\u2019ve done my job\u2014she\u2019ll have more exciting things going on than our relationship. And I will, too! And that\u2019s okay.",

      "text": "Being a parent is complicated. I also come from a loving home. My parents shed no tears about us going to college, had no empty nest syndrome, and never called me (I went to college before cell phones were common and before texting). I am 40 and they still never ever call me. My mom has called once in recent memory and it was to let me know of a car accident. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love me. They still love to see me. What I think is that your parents are well-adjusted. They are confident in the security of your love for each other. They think part of good parenting is letting go and letting your child become an adult and have their own life. I would have a talk with them and let them know you are struggling and wish they would call you more often. Also - maybe they are not phone people. ? I hate talking on the phone with an eternal passion. It would probably ease your mind if you could visit in person and see they still love you and love being with you, but the distance makes that hard. Would setting up a regularly scheduled FaceTime chat help?  \u2014 Everyone is different, and one day you may appreciate it that your parents aren\u2019t intrusive and give you the space to live your life independent of their constant communication. But I certainly understand you aren\u2019t ready for that yet at 18, and I think letting your mom know you want to hear from her more will help.",

It\u2019s true, we\u2019ve always had a relationship of mutual trust and respect where they were never really \u201con\u201d me, even when I lived at home. I hope it is the case that they simply believe I\u2019m doing well so they should just step back and let me live my life. But obviously, I am struggling, so I think I\u2019m gonna carve out some time tomorrow to at least call my mom and tell her how I feel.

              "text": "I hope you have a good chat and feel better soon. Going so far to college is a big adjustment, and so is the first time having a relationship with your parents that relies on things like phone calls (which again, some people like me absolutely hate and avoid). As a mom, I can say I am 100% sure your parents love you more than you could possibly understand. Don\u2019t let seeing the more involved parents of your peers make you think otherwise. From the outside looking in, it may feel to you that those parents are acting more loving, but for your peers who are in constant contact with their parents, the reality may feel more like smothering. A healthy balance is best for all.",
