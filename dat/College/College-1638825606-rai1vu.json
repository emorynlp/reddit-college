  "text": "Maybe this isn\u2019t the right sub. But I graduated in 2015 and never went to college. I eventually learned a trade and have been mig welding for 2-3 years. I worked 7 day weeks and the pay was good, but I know I can do better without working so hard psychically. My gf just got a better job after graduating college so now I want to go. I\u2019m looking into applying to a local tech school and getting an automation engineering degree. I\u2019m mostly wondering if anyone can relate and give advice. College is way more stressful to think as a reality since I feel I\u2019ve waited too long.",

You\u2019re going to feel out of place, just keep on going.",

If as a 25-year old you stay in the dorms or try to go to parties full of 19 year olds you might find that weird. But you will be fine in class.",

I really liked it, and the students were a wide variety of ages. Some straight out of high school, some in their 50s or 60s who were making career changes. Lots of parents getting degrees to better provide for their kids. I really don't think your age is something to worry about.",

It does feel strange but we have to remember not to compare our lives to anyone else\u2019s because like someone already said, we are all on different time lines. There is also no timeline for finishing a degree, society just creates these milestones and that is why it feels strange, but I\u2019m sure you will do great. You shouldn\u2019t feel like you have waited too long. You can\u2019t rewind time. Good luck!",

Long story short, I started college at 27 and I'm graduating this weekend. I'm currently making a little less than I was making in the oilfield, but with my degree I'll easily make more now! There's some good advice already in this thread so the only thing I want to add is treat college like a job. That's how I approached it, anything I had to do for school (exams, homework, projects, etc.) I pretended that if I failed/half-assed it that I could get fired.\n\nGood luck!",
