  "text": "I have an intro to physics exam tomorrow at 2pm, it is 5pm right now. I have access to all the lecture slides, I am planning on taking some time to go over _most_ of them and try to understand as many formulas and such as possible, and take very brief notes. I'm not sure what exactly to do, I only need 40% to pass. \n\nWe have done:\n\n- SI units\n\n- Motion in one direction and Vectors\n\n- Newtowns Laws of Motion\n\n- Circular motion, momentum, work, energy, power and efficiency\n\n- Structure and molecular properties of matter\n\n- Waves and sound \n\nAny help greatly appreciated",

      "text": "I'd try identifying common problem types for each unit and seeing how the formulas can be manipulated or substituted into eachother! Paying attention to your units and how they cancel out can really help guide you through problems too even if you don't have a formula sheet or if you're just unsure if you used a formula properly.\n\nI actually tutor introductory physics and I find something that really helps my students is going over substitutions when there's a formula you need to use but you are missing several variables for it!",

      "text": "Review your free body diagrams and the conservation laws: energy, momentum and angular momentum, and practice a problem for each of these topics. For waves, review the mathematical form of the solution and relation between the velocity, frequency and wavelength (try and understand the derivation of this relation). Go over the Doppler effect if you've covered that, and try a practice problem.",
