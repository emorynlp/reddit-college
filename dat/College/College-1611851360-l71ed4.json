  "text": "Just created google sheet that you can track when your assignments are due, when they are overdue, and whether you finished the assignment or not. It is made using conditional formatting with google docs. If you want to change the name of the prefixes for classes instead of using numbers, right click on 1st row and go to conditional formatting where you can edit it and replaces the numbers with names.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sort by date, go to row F where the due date is, click on the letter f at the top, click data, then click sort sheet by column f, a - z\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or things you feel I should add/ change\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink To it: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9\\_HQ3FGUMmA8/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9_HQ3FGUMmA8/copy)\n\nLink to public copy: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9\\_HQ3FGUMmA8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9_HQ3FGUMmA8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWhen you access it, you can make copy and edit it yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPhoto of Sheet: [https://imgur.com/a/JTY72B7](https://imgur.com/a/JTY72B7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy!\n\nUPDATE 1: There were some bugs that I found out and fixed it. If you were having issues try again now.  \nUPDATE 2: Changed bright green for finish to grey in order to have it not take away from work that needs to be done\n\nEDIT: I did just find out google sheets has their own assignments track, which funnily enough is somewhat similar. There's seems easier to use but has less functions than mine. Take a look at both and see which one you prefer best. Will continue to add more things to the sheet",

On the doc, I put one homework assignment as due today and another as due on Jan 31 which is two days from today(JAN 29) but when I put it as a work in progress on the status section the color on due goes from dark red to having no color at all.

Might update my spreadsheet though to look more clean and add things like the time, which could be super useful!",

I like the way Google sheets has the drop down menu for completion status where it fills the row light gray when complete because I personally don't like bright colors in my own spreadsheets. Google sheets I think is easier to customize since the classes/subjects are in a different sheet and don't interfere with the other cells accidentally. My only suggestion for you would be to consider how many colors you use so they don't get distracting.",

I had absolutely know idea bout the already made template which is a bit funny since they are somewhat similar. The main reason I have many colors is to help differentiate things like classes, if assignments done / not done, and how late it is. I personally find if colors are repeated more distracting but I totally get where you are coming from.   \n\n\nAlso will try and make it more user friendly to change colors if someone wants to tone it down more.
