  "text": "I had my first genetics exam this morning. It was anxiety inducing. \n\nIt feels like the end of the world right now. Even thought I know it's not. \n\nThe short answer questions always trip me up because I never have the time to finish. My professor had 4 parts to every short answer question. I only has 30 mins to finish it. That wasnt enough time. \n\nSometimes I regret being a pre med biology major.",

          "text": "I can't do that. As soon as I get to the next question it locks. \n\nIt would be awesome if my professor did that. Because if the test was in person I could go straight to the short answer questions.  \n\nThe test was 38 questions long. Some of the questions had three parts to them. \n\nWe had two hours. But, that wasnt enough time for me.\n\nI'm probably the only one that has issues with the short answers",
