  "text": "I thought it was going to be super exciting and liberating, but it really is the opposite. I have almost no free time. My friends who I was at least in classes with in HS have no times that we can hang out. Everyone's super spread out through campuses. It reallu just feels like a ton of work with not much fun in it. Any tips on maybe how to make it more exciting? I'm supposedly at a big party school and a sophomore.",

Most of those people who party all the time have shit grades or do low-effort degrees/courses. \n\nI don't have much to add - it's really just up to you. I had a dog-shit time at college/university (still in my final year), but I realize that it's partly my fault. \n\nYou have to put yourself out there..",
