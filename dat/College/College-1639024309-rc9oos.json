  "text": " I am researching for-profit education for a project of mine to see if or how the profit-seeking nature of these types of colleges affects the  learning or teaching experience there, and I would be interested in  hearing first-hand experiences from anyone who is a current or past student or instructor at one of these institutions.\n\nIt's okay to not disclose anything specific, the main things I would like to know are things like:\n\n\\- How much do you think what you learn can be useful or applicable in your future profession?\n\n\\-  Is the experience attending a for-profit college similar or different  to that of non-profit college (if you've experienced a non-profit  college as well)? And if it is different, what are those differences and  why do you think they exist?\n\n\\- Do you think that your voice \"can be heard\" by the administration? Do you  think that the administration has your best interests at heart?\n\n\\- Why did you choose a for-profit school over a non-profit?\n\nI know that for-profits, especially big ones like DeVry or Phoenix, are quite infamous in the public eye and online, but I would love to hear  more personal experiences that might reinforce or even dispel some of  the baggage that they carry. I'm more familiar with the situation in the  USA, but I've heard that they are very popular in Asia as well, so  experience from any for-profit college is completely welcome.",
