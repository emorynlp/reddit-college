  "text": "Hi! So I am living in a college dorm and we are sharing one kitchen on each floor. So far so good. Each of us has a small cabinet which we can lock. In them we can put our stuff like pasta or anything dry, you will get it. I don\u2019t use my cabinet as I am a lil bit sensitive and over hygienic lol. I got a tiny cabinet in my room which I use. \n\nSomehow I forgot to lock my kitchen cabinet a few weeks back. Now it looks like the whole floor is starting to put its stuff in it when they don\u2019t have any room left in their cabinet. I mean it is okay for me as I am not using it but I will move out soon. So should I just put the stuff out tomorrow or any day when nobody\u2018s there or should I really wait until moving out. \n\nAlso I am not sure how the others treat stuff, that means whether they will damage it when being drunk or anything lol. \nSeems like a really stupid question but I am really not sure how to handle that without being a shitty colleague.",

      "text": "they probably thought that it was a public cabinet or something. if you wish to reserve it for your use again, I think it would be courteous to leave a note on the door saying you are going to lock it in X many days and they need to remove their stuff by then.",
