  "title:": "Which business major to go with computer science?",
  "text": "I'm a sophomore at MSU, and am pursuing a Supply Chain degree, but recently I've been thinking of changing my major to Computer Science. I realized that because I've taken a bunch of business classes already, I only need to take one summer semester to graduate with both degrees. Which business degree would best complement a CS degree? I can still go with SCM (which MSU is known for, but I don't know if it synergizes with CS), or Finance (leaning towards this option), or Accounting.",

      "text": "Depends on what you want to go into,\n\nFor records I have a ba in history minor in computer science and business (regular) and my undergrad doesn\u2019t offer data analytic anything as a degree of any kind.\n\nI want my ms in information science as I am the data side of computer science. My first project was database photos. \n\nNow I am pricing auditing going to the airport getting menu prices then going to a set comparable location to compare. So McDonald\u2019s versus a McDonald\u2019s within 30\u2019miles  away \n\nI will have to get my cpa license as it\u2019s safer for me. As I am close to the word auditor now. \n\nI also have no finance experience and my computer science doesn\u2019t have any math requirement so I am also in now pre calc to rebuild my math for my masters.",
