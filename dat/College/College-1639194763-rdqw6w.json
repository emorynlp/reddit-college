  "text": "I am literally at my wit's end. I'd be graduating an entire year later over this one fucking class. Honestly, graduating on time is more important to me than my actual major. \n\nthe messed up thing is that for that extra year, I'd literally only be taking 1 class per semester. I've failed assignments and stuff before, but never a class. Certainly nothing to make me graduate an entire year late. I can't even look myself in the eye, I feel like a fucking failure. All I can think about is if there were any major that I could switch to that would allow me, as a junior, to graduate on time, I absolute would without a doubt. I have never felt so hopeless in my life.",
