  "text": "I am creating my first semester schedule, albeit with a later registration date than most and I'm non trad. The courses for my major seem to be filling up, along with time conflicts for any available schedule. I need to hit full time status for financial aid, but I also want to make sure that the courses I'm taking are applicable to my degree. Luckily, I am enrolled into two courses, and on the waitlist for another. Now I just need to schedule in a 4th course to top off that sweet 15 credits :p.",
