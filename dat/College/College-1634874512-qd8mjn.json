  "text": "Your well-being matters. Your body knows what it needs. It\u2019s when we don\u2019t tune into our bodies that we get thrown off, and it\u2019s hard to get back on track. What you do to nourish your body will allow you to maximize your college experience. If you are hungry, eat. If you are tired, sleep. Unless you truly have something that you can\u2019t wait until later to do (it be like that sometimes), allow yourself to be nourished, knowing that those moments of nourishment are still purposeful. Notice how much better you feel the next day, how much more you look forward to going to classes and extracurriculars and even doing your work. \u2665\ufe0f",
