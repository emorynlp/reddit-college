  "text": "Torn between adding a CS, IT, or stats minor to my degree program. I\u2019m a sophomore, and I\u2019d like to go to law school, and I have a pretty high GPA (3.7ish) as of right now. Is it worth adding any of these minors to have more of a technical background, and if so, which should I choose?",

      "text": "My gut says stats would be the most helpful to go the law school route. As a lawyer, a good understanding of statistics may allow you to use research studies and data to support claims, whereas you'll probably never need to code anything or configure a network or anything. But most of what I know about lawyers come from TV, so take it with a grain of salt.",
