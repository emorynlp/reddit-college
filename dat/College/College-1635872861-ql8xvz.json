  "text": "I'm an undergraduate student studying Industrial Engineering and currently a sophomore. Before sophomore year, I had grades I was happy with, around 3.4-3.6, but now that this semester is nearing its end I think I'll be getting a full semester of Cs and (hopefully not) Ds. I'm worried that my odds at a good graduate school and job are now decreasing because this semester will ruin my gpa. There are a few exams left, but I doubt I will do well on them. Are there any tips on what I can do? I already feel like giving up the semester.",

      "text": "I am currently in your same shoes, same major and everything. I believe that if you do not specifically want to go on to grad school, your GPA is not that important of a factor. I still believe that it is not so hard to come back from a bad semester, we all have trips and falls, it is just important to remember to keep your head up. Remember your purpose and carry on, it is not an easy path we picked, but that's one of the main reasons we probably did pick it. Get easier classes and a bunch of credits next semester and you'll definitely make up for it.",
