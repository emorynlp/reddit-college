  "text": "so um i dont know how to explain this so ill just say, I really screwed up this semester. This semester I  signed up for 3 classes except one of the classes started 3 weeks into the semester and I completely forgot about this class , this class is 3 weeks in and its apparently too late to drop the class without a W. Im going to try to catch up and miss one project but Is it bad if I retake this class to replace the fail, worst case senerio? im pretty sure its worse that im trying to major in CS. How screwed am I?\n\nbackstory: I stopped going to college in 2013 because I was failing all my classes so my academic record is bad, I was on probation before I stopped going and still am. This year I decided I wanted to do something with my life so I decided to go back to school which I thought was going to be easy but I was wrong.",
