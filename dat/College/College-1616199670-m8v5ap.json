So you got a zero because you didn\u2019t do well or you didn\u2019t take the test?  \nDid you get ahold of your professor the minute it happened? How have you been taking exams up until this point? \nJust curious. I feel like there\u2019s more info to this.",

      "text": "Take a few deep breaths, panicking will not help you here. Technical difficulties are perfectly understandable to most professors. A couple days ago I had a similar problem, where my professor wanted us to upload a pdf with all our answers to the exam assignment within the time limit. I worked on the exam in word, but when I tried to convert the document to pdf my computer simply couldn\u2019t do it in time. The exam was locked and I hadn\u2019t submitted a thing. I emailed her about the issue with my answers attached, and it eventually got resolved and she agreed to grade it.\n\nAs long as you email your professor, explain the issue, and ask if you can still take the test, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand. Electronic exams are much harder to administer with without something going wrong, and I\u2019m sure your professor knows this. But if they do have a hard time believing you, if you have a way of screenshotting the technical issue and sending it to them that will help your case. I had to do that with my professor to prove I hadn\u2019t used the opportunity of down time between when the exam ended and when I emailed her to cheat and change my answers (I screenshotted the date/time stamp of when the pdf was downloaded and saved to my computer)",

      "text": "My wife teaches at a college and what I have learned from her is that professors are often as anxious about their students passing their exams as students are. If a professor sees that someone received a zero on an exam then they will likely work very hard with you to find a way to correct the mistake. They also want their students to pass. There are external pressures on professors to ensure their students pass. If it is an understandable mistake, then don't fret. There are many ways to fix the problem. The class structure is also far less rigid than you may expect. Just be open, honest, and patient.",

Explain that the grade was in no way based on your performance, and not graduating on account of what ultimately boils down to a clerical error is a really shitty reason to expect someone to pay another half years worth of tuition. I know this seems serious, but there\u2019s no way that they will send you up the river for something like this. Talk to your professor, and I would assume it would be fine. If not, go to the dean, the president of the university, or whoever else you feel appropriate. This will be fine, don\u2019t worry.",

Someone cheating would not get it a second chance. Someone that spending thousands upon thousands of dollars to go someplace for an education being forced out of graduation and what is very literally nothing more than a clerical error is the kind of thing that goes beyond The 99 out of 100 statistic. You have to factor in context to this. These professors hear a lot of things from a lot of people. A lot of those people are in a lot of trouble though. You\u2019re not in trouble. Besides, the way you responded to me comes off as almost a push off excuse. Something that makes you feel like going to the dean or the president of the university is not going to do anything, so why even bother? Number one in regards to that, I know you\u2019re scared because it\u2019s a shit situation, but I\u2019m happy to tell you that you\u2019re also wrong. If the school did this to you, it could literally open them up to litigation. We live in a world where people sue their high schools because they were told they weren\u2019t going to be allowed to walk the stage at graduation. What\u2019s worse is that a lot of times they win. You have so many more options and so much more on your side then you\u2019re giving yourself credit for. You need to go in and talk to these people with confidence. No, I\u2019m not saying force or attitude, I\u2019m saying conference. Let them know that it was a minor accident. Any reason that you could give me to not go to your teacher, and then the other people I\u2019ve already spoken of is nonsense.",
