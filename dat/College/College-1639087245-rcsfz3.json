  "text": "Just to get an idea:\n\nI am required to take a freshman seminar for one credit hour at my school. This class met once a week (instructor often cancelled despite being just one day per week) and little assignments due every week that ranged from mental health to study success while in college. \n\nProblem:\n\nThe instructor gave me an A- which breaks my 4.0. I really have no clue how he came to an A- since I did not miss a single day of class, had a 95%+ for my final grade, and had a good relationship with the professor. What can I do? I emailed her asking why, but I would like to hear what you all might have done to get a better grade in a situation like this or what you\u2019d do.\n\nEdit: She changed it to an A.",

      "text": "What does the syllabus say is the cutoff for an A? If it's less than 95% and you definitely had more than a 95% in the class, the professor will likely fix it (and if not your school should have a grade appeal policy).\n\nIf it is really an A-, be assured that the practical differences in graduating with a 3.9 and a 4.0 are close to nil in terms of jobs or graduate study. Most students who get straight As their first semester eventually do get an A- or lower, so don't get too hung up on maintaining a 4.0.",

Now you don't have to worry about it. \n\nSure, you should still try to do your best, but now you are free from the insidious expectation of perfection, which , I'll be honest, is entirely impossible to achieve while contributing anything actually valuable to yourself, or society as a whole.",
