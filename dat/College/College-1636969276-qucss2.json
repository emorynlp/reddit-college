  "text": "I hate my college and life, first my dream was to be a doctor like physician or my plan B to be an engineer but at the end i went to pharmacy school so I accepted it, i was too clever and one of my top at my class in high school but my grades suddenly started to downgrade at college, i don\u2019t love chemistry that much though i get an A in it. My college is in another country and i went through culture shock and after 5 years i still hate my life, at the moment I\u2019m behind graduation still an extra semester left. What should i do I\u2019m lost and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late to do",

Cause sometimes I think about ending my life because of that.",
