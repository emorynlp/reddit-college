  "text": "I am starting college later than the usual 17/18 year olds so I may be wrong here, but college feels more like high school THAN HIGH SCHOOL! I am constantly in communication with professors because they practically baby sit our work by requiring notes as a grade...\n\nSo because I'm older/not tech savvy, I did not know I could merge individual PDFs into one. So I turn my notes in ON TIME and she refused to grade it because it needs to be one PDF(she told me this two days later), ok cool.. figured it out and uploaded it and all those notes turned in on time no longer matter because I get points chopped off because it was \"late\".\n\nTen years ago college sounded more like \"show up, you should take notes, but everything is your responsibility and the test/quizzes/projects will let me know if you studied or not.\"\n\n\n\nTLDR/ All notes are graded, had to create a pdf and prof didn't want to grade the 5 individual PDFs so learned to merge them and reupload into one PDF only to get a chunk of points taken off because it is considered \"late\" since prof responded two days later.\n\n\nUpdate: I read the syllabus and it is not stated in any specific way how the PDFs are to be uploaded.\n\nThanks to a fellow redditor, I emailed her and she is updating the grade.\n\nThis micromanaging is not only one class but three others too where I am graded on notes every week. So all the note taking that HAS to be neat and understood by the professor IS DIFFICULT! I learn with notes but in my way with doodles but that isn't \"college\" level per se.",

I was really surprised my first semester when I realize that college was full of younger students who didn't seem like they wanted to be there and so therefore the professors had to implement policies that were quite similar to the ones I experienced in high school 10 years ago. It's obviously quite frustrating when you just want to study, complete assignments and turn them in and be on with your day. The micromanaging is definitely not something I thought I would have to deal with in my late twenties. Some professors are definitely more lenient and expect you to operate as an adult, as they should. However I think some professors who have been teaching intro courses for 20-something years realize that some students right out of high school still expect to be babysat which is quite frustrating.",

The students response then is to complain to the dean about how cruddy the professor supposedly was. When you ask the students what they did in class, you find out they didnt really do anything. Read through reddit. Countless college students saying how they never even opened a book and tried to rely on powerpoint lecture slides. Guess what, passive learning doesnt really work. Yet somehow this falls on the instructor to fix even though the student puts in zero effort themselves. \n\nAdmin gets pissy about bad student reviews and students having to repeat classes they failed. This has led some instructors to start pushing back by making attendance and notes mandatory and part of the grade. Looking at notes helps instructors by giving them feedback about their lectures. If they can see through notes that students appeared to totally miss a concept, they may focus more on that during the next class. \n\nInstructors dont want to be be spending a lot of time reading student notes outside of class. We have better things to do with your time, just like you. My students have to turn in hand written assignment each week. Im not grading on penmanship, grammar, or \"doodles.\" I can read chicken scratch. And I have many times found students having incorrect thinking about a concept which I was able to give feedback on and correct. \n\nSo is note taking annoying for some, yes.  Hopefully the instructors are giving feedback on it though which can help you get a good grade in the class and actually learn which is a positive result.",

I turned 18 at the end of the program, and started my first quarter of freshman year five weeks later).\n\nThere was a student in the grade below me at my high school who graduated a year early (so they walked with my class, rather than with theirs a year later) and started college at 16 (they did a summer pre-college program at their University, like me, and their birthday was at the end of it, like me - they're almost exactly a year younger than me, to the date) so they turned 17 at the end of their summer pre-college program and started the first semester of their freshman year three weeks later. \n\nMany people like myself and the student who graduated early have late birthdays and/or graduate early. My brother could've graduated early, at 14, and gone to college, but my parents didn't want a 14-year-old around a bunch of 18 to 21 year olds and decided to wait, so he went to college at 18 and was able to triple-major (VERY rare) because he used his time from 14-18 to do CC courses in various fields, dual-enrollment through his high school (he's considerably older than me and was raised in a different town, and went to their high school). And this all happened in the late 90s and early 2000s with him, so the commenter who mentioned the dual-enrollment HS-CC thing being a recent phenomena isn't correct - it's been around for a long time.",

The next step is usually the department chair.\n\nI just wanted to add this clarification as a lot of people want to go straight to the dean, but the dean will most often just kick it back down to the department chair, and everyone in the process may develop a slightly negative perception (unless the complain involves blatant discrimination or something equally heinous, in which case you should sing like a canary from the rooftops because no one should get away with that).",

Not on a \"I think my work deserves more than B\" kind of basis, but on the same basis you're describing.\n\nI've been docked for things that weren't in the rubric or weren't explicitly communicated & I've debated those negative points. Only twice has a teacher refused to change it (it's my 6th year).\n\nEDIT: They are human too. They have a lot of work to grade & sometimes they may pass over things like this. Most professors really do wanna give you a good education. So just be polite to her :)",
