I personally write things down as my learning style. when I write it, I understand it, because I write things in my own words and I can go back and re-read it when I need to.\n\nsome people are visual learners, hearing learners, writing learners, etc. you'll need to figure out what's best for you.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not a stupid question. I was in the same boat in high school and had no clue how to study (I\u2019m still figuring it out). There\u2019s this YouTube channel that I follow that\u2019s run by 2 brothers who are medical students. The channel called Mike and Matty. The brothers devote their channel to discussing scientifically proven methods of studying and how to apply it to college. Here\u2019s the [link](https://www.youtube.com/c/MikeandMatty) to their channel but I\u2019ll try to provide an introduction to what they talk about.\n\nBasically, it comes down to 2 things: understanding (learning) and remembering (studying and memorizing). With studying, the key to test yourself with practice problems, flash cards, etc. to see what you know and don\u2019t know, then go back and filling in the gaps review what you missed. This works when you have a decent/good understanding of the material you\u2019re testing yourself on (which is a lesson I had to learn this semester). The understanding part comes from taking advantage of every resource available to you for a class (videos, textbook, lectures, office hours, etc.) and (this is a bit of my own commentary) and interacting with the concepts being taught - through note-taking and probably other methods as well - connecting these concepts to what you already know. You seem to have the understanding part, so testing yourself through methods mentioned in Mike and Marty\u2019s videos would help you find gaps in your understanding. I hope this helps and if anyone wants to add or correct my understanding, that\u2019s cool as I\u2019m only a freshman in college.\n\nEdit: sorry about the paragraphs lol.",

If you are short on time and the test is problem-based, do a little background reading and drill a ton of problems for hours straight. For all standardized tests I would just look up past years\u2019 practice exams and do hundreds of problems. If it\u2019s definition and concept-based drill all of the definitions and memorize them with flashcards/quizlet and make a concept connection map. If its analysis-based read analyses and try to recreate them. Then do reading on the topic as well. Also make a concept connection map.",

      "text": "Depends on the type of subject, if it's math-heavy then as one person already mentioned, firstly, understand the theory, and then apply it practically by practicing all of the problems, A LOT. Also, take a blank paper and write down all the formulas on it, including 1-2 to examples of math problems using those formulas. Often just writing formulas on a page does not help if you do not know how to apply that formula. \n\nIf it's theory-heavy then you should write everything down i.e., start with note-taking during lectures - write down everything the teacher says - literally everything including any diagrams the teacher makes on the board; then review them when you come home every day - connect your class notes with the text in the book or bullets points in a PowerPoint. If you have to compare & contrast 2 different or slightly similar philosophies, then you can simply make 2 columns & write each philosophy's main points in bullet points side-by-side and as long as all the key/technical jargon words are in there, you can almost get full marks for that question. \n\nEven if you do not write any notes during class, as long as you pay attention to what the teacher is saying and write down the odd word you catch, that will help as well. Of course, there is also the fact that a person's attention span is 20 minutes max after which they easily get distracted. My friend would make mnemonics for every concept she could and would summarise 1 chapter on a single page. She would be able to recall all points of concepts using these mnemonics and would then expand on them in exams. She got good grades in exams like A's & B's. \n\nAs someone already said, when you revise concepts every day then they get better ingrained in your mind. \n\nLike another person said, some people are visual learners, others hearing, and so on. My 7th or 8th grade class did an experiment once, our teacher gave us a list of 10 objects to remember using one sensory sense each time for each of the 5 senses. And then quizzed us to write down the names of how many objects we could remember each time using one sense at a time. I found out I remember most objects when I wrote them down. It was a fun experiment. Similarly, I also used the technique of looking and reading out loud the text of the textbook - using 2 senses to understand and recall the concepts I studied and then write them down in tests & exams in my own words. You can also add underlining and/or highlighting text into this as well. This helps you review main ideas just before an exam. Just figure out which combination of senses helps you better recall concepts during tests and exams.\n\nAlso, when you are doing comprehension, you can do 2 things, underline main phrases/words as well as write a summary of a paragraph on the left or right margins. That way, when you come back looking for an answer to a question, you can easily find it.",

This way I don't fall behind if I need to just sleep. If you're someone who can get by by just looking over work notes, you should do it before you sleep after you learn something new in classes.  This way you can quickly look at your notes before an exam. I never spend hours studying. But I'm not in a hard major lol. It was only those annoying general ed courses that my studying would actually be for. I normally end up watching youtube videos about my topics explaining the concept very well.",
