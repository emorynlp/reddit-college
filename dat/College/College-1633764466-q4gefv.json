  "text": "So I'm on my last year of college but I feel like I'm not ready to graduate yet, knowledge-wise and experience-wise. Add in the fact that I've had to retake some classes during this COVID era of education even though I did well pre-COVID, I just don't think that I'm qualified to become a \"working professional\" just yet. So what I'm trying to say is that I don't think I'm hireable at all, and I would appreciate any advice for this. I've been pessimistic about finding post-graduation opportunities even though I had a good encouraging environment friends and family-wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Apologies if my message is unclear, I'm just writing this on impulse.",

Embrace it as is, and realize that unless youre some crazy 4.2 student then everyone is just a kid with a few books worth of knowledge who put on their big boy mask for the the work day.",
