  "text": "I honestly really hate my internship at the moment and was wondering if anyone has tips to get through the rest of the two months I have left. Its a mandatory one that I need to do to get my bachelors and it just really sucks. I hate what I'm doing and honestly don't think I'll go into the same industry once I graduate. I have this one nasty colleague who's always complaining and in a foul mood and when I have to work with him for weeks it makes me depressed. Any tips you guys have would be greatly appreciated :)",
