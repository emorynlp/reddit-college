  "text": "I have an average GPA at my community college because of my mental illness. I took a bunch of classes and started to do badly because I could not focus on anything but the side effects. So I took a break and studied into a higher IQ. I am returning to college. \n\nHow do I erase my GPA and start over? I want to get into a good college.",

      "text": "1st of all let\u2019s not use our mental illness as an excuse. It may be a contributing problem, but it\u2019s not \u201cthe reason\u201d you got bad grades. \n\nGood news: in my experience at my community college they had a program where you could \u201creset\u201d your gpa only one time though. I don\u2019t know if it actually reset my gpa, it may have just been a thing that wipes classes below a 2.0 or something. I don\u2019t remember. \n\nAlso good news: every college I\u2019ve been to has had a policy where if you retake a class (and pay full price of course) only the highest grade is counted.  For example: if I got an F or D in a class and retook it and got an A, the previous attempt still parses in my transcript but the associated GPA affect of the first attempt is nonexistent\n\nThese are just my experiences. But I believe most colleges have a similar program. They just want your money man, you ain\u2019t going to Harvard.",

      "text": "If you transfer colleges, the classes that transfer don\u2019t affect your GPA (at most U.S. colleges). U.S. colleges typically require applicants to submit transcripts from all previous colleges and acceptances can be revoked if you don\u2019t do it. So you can\u2019t erase the past, but you can improve the future.",
