  "title:": "Why can't I study in the morning?",
  "text": "I usually wake up pretty early \"so that I can study early\" but I will never start doing it until 11AM.\n\nI find myself a lot more productive from 11AM to 11 PM.\n\nNo matter how much I sleep or what my routine is ( whether it's going for a walk, having a good breakfast, taking the morning calmly or setting my day up before starting).\n\nI don't want to force myself to study through caffeine (I had to cut it down to 1 cup due to bad anxiety, which I'm drinking in the afternoon anyways), since it doesn't work. It just makes me more anxious about the fact that I'm not studying.\n\nI think it's because every single day of my life I'm used to wake up and go to class, which is a quite passive kind of study. Taking notes can be awakening itself, since you have to take them so fast, while trying to understand something.\n\nBut when it comes down to pure studying, I am just reluctant.\n\nI study physics and I noticed that doing problems instead of theory helps me a little bit, but still.\n\nAnyone can help me?",

      "text": "People have natural circadian rhythms. Most people think that circadian rhythms dictate just our sleep wake cycle, but they actually affect much more than that-- they dictate most diurnal patterns. Chances are you have a biological rhythm that is \"set\" so that you are most productive during the hours you specify. It's possible to change your rhythm, but it's generally not easy because although there are environmental/external factors that contribute, circadian rhythm is also partially endogenic in origin (controlled by internal biological factors). \n\nMost young adults are not morning people, but that typically changes as you get older, so it's possible that some years from now you'll become more of a morning person.",
