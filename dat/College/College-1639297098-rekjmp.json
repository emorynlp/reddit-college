  "text": "\nHi i have a specific situation and I need some advice. So i graduated high school a year ago and Im currently taking a gap year (unplanned but much needed). I\u2019m still at home but working. I have my eyes set on this one school that I feel is perfect for me. The only issue is that it\u2019s in Philadelphia. I would have to travel to go to this school but distance isn\u2019t really the main issue here. My parents are worried about my safety as Philadelphia isn\u2019t the best area. This is totally understandable and I don\u2019t want to do anything that\u2019s unsafe. But this college is is in center city which I know is the tourist attraction. And plenty of people I graduated with are going to colleges in Philly. I\u2019ve heard the college campuses are pretty safe and have security, but Also knowing what I know about Philadelphia, I dont want to be naive or stupid. Is me going to college here a bad idea? Any advice helps.",

      "text": "I haven't lived in Philadelphia, but I've been. Compared to other city centers of large cities, e.g. Chicago or Washington D.C., it felt a bit rougher. However, it felt safer than Baltimore and I can't say I really felt unsafe. I went walking around the middle Philly at 10pm once and while there were a fair number of homeless people around, I didn't fear for my safety. Be cautious, but it's not horrid. It often looks worse than it is, but don't tell a proud Philadelphian that (and sometimes the most depressing looking restaurants have greatest food!).",
