  "text": "Hi everyone!\nThe Professor said he will curve our 3 midterm grades, but I didn\u2019t have experience with curve. Can someone explain to me how it is going to work?\n\nFor reference, we have three midterms, 55 points each.\n\nTIA!",

      "text": "Let\u2019s say the highest possible score is 100. The exam is taken and the scores come back with the highest score being 91/100. This 91, the highest test score, becomes the 100. And what about the 9 point difference? It is a gift from the academic Gods. Everyone is rewarded the points difference. For ex. Remember the 91 now = 100. Every one is given 9 points (100\u201391). So a curve can be a game changer. If you scored a 51, and 60 is the passing mark, ..happy days. U just passed. If you're in class with a whiz kid and he scores 99\u2026. There isn't much of a curve to be had, just 1 point.",

              "text": "From my experience, this technically meant that there would be no curving since the professor\u2019s expected outcome was true. If it didn\u2019t go the way they planned then they would curve it. However, this may be different with yours depending on how many students got perfect scores and what most students actually got on the exam. My theory is that he will add up those midterms and curve the grades after the addition.",

The curve usually helps students who don\u2019t do so well without making the smart kids feel like they\u2019ve been cheated. The curve won\u2019t hurt u if u end up with relatively good grades. No worries! I\u2019m happy to help.",
