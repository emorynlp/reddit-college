  "text": "so i made 2 good friends this year so far as a freshman. i go to one of the biggest party schools in the nation but for academic reasons (i\u2019ll party occasionally but it isn\u2019t my thing). \ni found two girls like me who had become some of my best friends. one decided to become an RA (lets name her Sally). Sally didn\u2019t tell me this and proceeded to basically ghost me even though Sally, Beth (my other friend), and I had apartment tours scheduled. I found out through Beth, who has a class with Sally, of this decision to be an RA, meaning she wouldn\u2019t be living with us. Fine, whatever, lets look at 2 bedrooms for Beth and I. We went on a few tours last week and decided we were gonna apply for the one we loved coming this week. Woke up to a text saying shes decided to live in the dorms as well next year. \n\nAt this point i\u2019m convinced there is something wrong with me, what are the odds both drop out within a week? Apartments are gone by November so I guess I\u2019ll be living in the dorms in a single like Sally and Beth will be doing. I don\u2019t trust going blind as it didn\u2019t work well for me this year. \nAny advice? How do I look at pathetically living alone in a single in the dorms as a SOPHOMORE? \n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never make a friend that truly wants to be my friend. (Every friend I\u2019ve had in the past has either backstabbed or left me unexpectedly with no explanation). I\u2019m sick of going to welcome events alone and looking like the pathetic girl with no friends.",

      "text": "For one, I'm sorry you had to go through all that with your \"friends\". I think a lot of people just aren't as committed to certain friendships as other people, and while it sucks, I think it's just a sign that they weren't meant to be in your life forever. You'll find your group/people that you click with who you'll love being with and who'll love being with you. Just keep exploring and you'll find them eventually! \ud83d\ude01\n\nIn terms of being a sophomore single dorming? Well I'm a sophomore now, but this was my first year dorming (woohoo Covid ruined my first year too!), and I got a random roommate... And I think I'd only ever single dorm again. Yeah I hate my roommate, he's insanely picky, incredibly obnoxious, and beyond controlling - moreso than my own parents were, which sucks. I'll be a junior next year and definitely plan on single dorming. I would never move back home because of how that environment was, and I can't afford (or have friends) to move into an apartment with yet. So I'd say you're totally fine dorming in a single as a sophomore! \ud83d\ude01\n\nWishing you the best!",
