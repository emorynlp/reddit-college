  "text": "I\u2019m a first year Bio undergrad student. I only chose bio as my major as I\u2019d get to take all three sciences again to help me narrow down what I want to major in. I like physics the most right now, and I\u2019m big into outer space, but I\u2019m not the greatest at math. I like to do physics math, but I\u2019m barely staying afloat in calculus. I\u2019m aware that if I choose to major in physics my course load will be very math heavy. \nIs it worth it for the passion? \n\nAny tips/advice/opinions welcome",
