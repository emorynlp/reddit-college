  "text": "I go to a liberal artsy college that touts the whole \u201cdesign your own major\u201d when in reality it is an emphasis. Except in every explanation given to prospective students, they say \u201cyour emphasis is like a major\u201d, so this whole time I\u2019ve thought my customized program of study WAS my major. And now I\u2019m finding out my \u201cmajor\u201d is just biology, when I designed my own curriculum in neuroscience, which was approved and signed off by my advisors as is standard procedure.\n\nI\u2019m peeved to say the least. Has anyone else run into this problem? Will my diploma even have neuroscience on it? Currently big stressing about this.",

      "text": "I don't know what your school calls it, but ours is GPS; it's where you view all courses required for your major. You can view your grades and GPA, etc. I'd check what major is being listed when you log in there, as that is what will likely be on your diploma. \n\nMy university also has the ability to design a major but it is a lengthy process with tons of forms and essays needing to be submitted. The issue is everything has to be checked to ensure the school can even grant some degrees as they may not be accredited to. So, if your school doesn't have a neuroscience program, they may just be giving you a biology with minors or emphasis on neuroscience. Or just a plain degree in biology. Your advisor should be able to tell you exactly what will be listed on your diploma.",
