  "title:": "is it a good idea to double major in psychology and cognitive and behavioral neuroscience?",
  "text": "hi, everyone! hope all is well. i started college this year as a freshman and i was wondering if a double major in psychology (bs) and cognitive and behavioral neuroscience is a good idea. i am really interested in both, but i am hesitant/unsure in making the switch from general psych to a double major. i know that i have a lot of time to decide, but i\u2019m a bit of an over thinker and like to plan out things before. \n\nthe cognitive and behavioral neuroscience major at my school is offered jointly by the cogsci and psych departments here, and recently i have taken more of an interest in learning about behavioral neuroscience and i would love to combine it with my passion for psychology. however, the reason i first decided to major in general psychology is because i don\u2019t know what career path i want to go down when i graduate, and i would like to keep my options open. i\u2019ve been trying to look for some satisfying careers in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience specifically, but i haven\u2019t been able to find any that prefers the major specifically. for this reason, i am a little hesitant and looking for some advice. \n\ndo you think that a double major in both psychology and cbn is useful? or is it not worth it? any advice is helpful. thank you so much for your help in advance!",

I think you'll find that a psychology degree will \"check the box\" for jobs which require any degree, but there are few entry-level professional jobs for which a bachelor's in psychology is the desired qualification. [Psychology grads earn meaningfully less than most other college grads](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_sbc.pdf).\n\nUnless you go to grad school for psychology, you'll have limited job options related to what you studied, and when you apply for jobs unrelated to what you studied, you'll be completing with lots of other applicants who may have more relevant majors or more relevant job experience. \n\nI don't know much about what kind of job options you might have with a double major in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience, but I imagine that's another field where a graduate degree is likely required if you want to work with patients or work in research. \n\nIf you want to make sure you have good job options when you graduate, I'd either switch majors entirely, and pick something more in-demand than psychology, or double major in something more in-demand.",

              "text": "The majors most in-demand tend to be directly related to a common occupation, like nursing, finance, mechanical engineering, etc. Employers want to hire people who already have some relevant training and job skills. \n\nSince it sounds like you aren't sure what you might like to do after college, I recommend you do some additional research into different occupations/ career paths, and then choose a major based on what type of work appeals to you. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) is a great resource for learning more about different occupations. \n\nAll college degrees are fairly flexible, in the sense that majoring in something like accounting doesn't mean you have to be an accountant for the next four decades of your life. Your college major will influence which jobs you can get right out of college, but once you have a few years of work experience, it's your skills and experience which will dictate which jobs you might be able to get next. If you major in psychology but also earn a bunch of useful IT certifications, for example, you could have a solid career in IT without ever needing to earn a degree related to IT.",
