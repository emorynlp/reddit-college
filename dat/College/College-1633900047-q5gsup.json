  "text": "why does everyone make it seem like your first year of uni is so amazing ??? tbh i\u2019m not really digging the college hype n all like i\u2019m really disappointed by the fact that so many people around me is having so much fun but i just cant feel the same \u201cfun\u201d that they\u2019re feeling. idek why. i\u2019m so frustrated. the first few weeks were great, but then i\u2019m starting to not enjoy it more and more and i\u2019m honestly not sure whether transferring is worth it considering how hard i worked my ass off during HS to get to the uni that i\u2019m attending now. \n\ni don\u2019t know if i\u2019m depressed, but i just want everything to stop. i wish so many people saw the downsides to the college journey because it\u2019s honestly so overhyped.",

      "text": "IMO, what you are feeling is very logical and common.\n\nSociety puts so much pressure on kids to do everything they can to get into a good college. If a person spends their whole life preparing for something, it\u2019ll be hard to live up to the hype because let\u2019s face it, nothing is perfect. \n\nThe first year is especially hard because it looks like everyone is having fun. Most people haven\u2019t really established a solid friend group \u2014 even if it seems it. And if they have, it probably doesn\u2019t replace the tight friendships you\u2019ve built over the past 12 years (if you\u2019ve gone to elem, middle and high school in the same area). \n\nBut, you will work through this. It\u2019s temporary. And you\u2019ll be stronger for it.",

      "text": "I also hated my first year of college (I hated the first semester more than the second semester, but still hated both)!!!!! For me, it was a stressful time as I felt I needed to decide what I would do with my life after I graduated, as I was not 100% sure what major/ job, etc that I would do. I also had a lot of pressure from my parents to decide as they wanted me to go to med school, while I was more interested in chemistry. It did not help that I commuted since I was not away from my parents to think on my own about what I would do with my life/ get to make more friends/ join clubs. I chose to commute to save money though, and now that I have almost graduated I think it was worth it to not stay on campus. Overall I think I have had a decent experience, I felt like it got better after the first year. For me, though college, in general, has been more stressful than high school since now I have to worry about keeping grades up for scholarships and grad school. But yeah I will agree college is overhyped, I have become more disillusioned with the education system as time went on in college.",
