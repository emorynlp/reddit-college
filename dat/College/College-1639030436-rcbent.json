  "text": "Basically there is this girl in my dorm (I\u2019m kinda ex-friends with her now) who injured her knee. She was forced to move into medical housing since we have to walk up 5 flights of stairs to get to our dorm. Anyways, when she moved into medical housing, she left almost all her stuff in her old dorm even though housing department told her to take all her stuff with her. It was very strange to everyone in my dorm especially her roommate because it\u2019s a severe injury that takes 9 MONTHS to heal after surgery. The surgery isn\u2019t till another 14 days btw. It\u2019s a mutual agreement in our dorm that there\u2019s no way she\u2019s coming back and that she should have taken all her stuff with her. Her roommate has mentioned multiple times that she keeps texting saying that it will only take 2 weeks to heal and that she\u2019ll be back in the room. Every times the roommate mentions it won\u2019t because it takes 9 months to heal, she won\u2019t listen. It\u2019s gotten to the point where she keeps coming back to the dorm while CLEARLY limping and in pain even though they stopped her keycard from working at the dorm. It feels like a dog marking her territory. The point is we want her to get her head around the fact that she\u2019s not coming back to the dorm. How do we do that?",

As long as she\u2019s paying she\u2019s staying. Why don\u2019t you and your friend move? Sounds like she needs better roommates.",

      "text": "Uh, you don't?\n\nAs long as she's paying for her dorm, or it's paid for, she has the right to live there? Unless you're omitting something, nothing is or should change. Their medical injury is irrelevant. I seriously hope you're omitting something because your level of entitlement here is off the charts.  They pay to have their belongings there, and to live there. All the mental gymnastics in the world doesn't change that",
