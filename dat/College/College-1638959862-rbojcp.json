  "title:": "Being crushed mentally and financially by my school.",
  "text": "I am being berated by my school to pay money that they have yet to tell me where from. I have not gotten an itemized receipt telling me where all my aid and loan money was going. They are being grossly negligent and making me go through too many hoops to try and \"help\" me. This has kept me from signing up for classes for a year now. I've been in college for 5 years now and likely, at this rate, never to finish. I have been to 3 different colleges and this experience is truly insufferable. I have never felt so hopeless in my life because the money they are asking for is not doable for me financially. I just want someone to give me some good news or a way to fix this issue and get my damn degree. I know I have probably left some big plot holes and willing to bring some information to light upon request. I do not know what to do and feel I have exhausted all my options.",
