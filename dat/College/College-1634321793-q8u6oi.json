  "title:": "How do you form connections with professors/what do you ask them during office hours?",
  "text": "Hello!\n\nI've always heard that going to professor's office hours is great to knowing and getting closer to professors for research opportunities, recommendations for Master's Programs, etc. However, I'm not really sure what to do during office hours.\n\nAs an introvert, I sometimes have no clue what to ask the professor. I've asked basic things about the class, basic fundamental questions, and generic questions about research opportunities, but how do I go further and ask more meaningful questions and form stronger connections? I think I may be applying for a Master's program soon, so I would need at least 3 recommendations for that. Honestly, I think although I've been to a couple of office hours, I doubt the professors even know my name because my questions are quite generic. Thanks!",

Knowing professors can be helpful as long as you are a decent student (B or better), but if your grades are not good, they probably still won't recommend you.\n\nI won't recommend any students without personally knowing them - how else could I recommend them?\n\nDr. Grandpa",

If me , or my school regularly recommend people who do badly or are unqualified that very quickly gets around in a small world.\n\nSecond I have hired people and taken on grad students and been on admissions boards etc.  When you take on people who are unsuitable, it really sucks for everyone, including the candidate.\n\nThird, I actually sign something that says what i am saying is true to the best of my knowledge \n\nFourth I try not to lie about important things .  I have told my sister her ugly couch was lovely, but I really don\u2019t lie about other things and I wouldn\u2019t do it for someone I couldn't recommend anyway.  \n\nFifth Why would I lie to misrepresent someone who i barely know.\n\nI have written great letters for people who don't have great grades because they have other things going for them, but I wasn\u2019t lying about that.",
