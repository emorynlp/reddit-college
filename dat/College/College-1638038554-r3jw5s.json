  "text": "Hello Reddit. I\u2019m speaking to you as a newly inducted College Freshman. I\u2019ve come here to ask for your advice on something. Recently, I\u2019ve been newly consumed by a gnawing desire to take a gap year from school and devote my time to working on a farm in germany. To be clear, I have no contacts in germany, speak very little german, and have no idea where said farm would be. But I could easily figure all that stuff out. I\u2019m just wondering wether it would be a huge waste of time or not. Thank you!",
