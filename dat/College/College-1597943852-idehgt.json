  "text": "In person classes gave me a sense of motivation and a lot of purpose. Now going all online, all FIVE of my classes have the first assignment due date on August 30th. One class that was filler opened everything up, and I got the assignments done to October 1st. Like I have so much time, how do I know I am truly learning?\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t mean to karma to the front page twice, lol. I just feel more motivated doing outside projects, etc on campus. It\u2019s more disciplinary at home, and my resources can be limited.",

It was really difficult with 3 people on their laptops at the same time. I was behind my classes as it was a lot of stress. Now it's better, I am using some online platforms for extra help. Coursera, Udemy and Lrnkey are my saviours of the day. It feel much better after that.",

The one thing that\u2019s irking me, though, is that two of my classes have THE SAME ONLINE MEETING TIME??\nOne of them doesnt have an official meeting time so the professor just chose the time he did, but the other class does have an official meeting time and it happens to be at the exact time as the other class.\nI emailed them and they basically just said I may have to take a different class... bruh. I have like 11 classes left in my degree and all of them are studio art classes that are either full or are at the exact same time. And I\u2019m not taking Ceramics from home, I dont have the space or the means to do that.\nI\u2019d be fine without even meeting at all and just getting the assignments and some inspo from the videos and readings they give us, then just finishing everything on my own time. But they really want us to have MANDATORY zoom meetings for a Photography class. For what?",

Also, I won\u2019t have to prepare my lunches anymore which is so nice because I truly hate doing that. I also hate waiting in between classes because there aren\u2019t many places to sit and do my work (our library has been closed for updates for a while now). Also I\u2019m just an introvert at heart and I don\u2019t like being surrounded by people all the time. Being at home feels like such a blessing BUT I also feel that professors are expecting top notch work from us when... in reality I feel like we\u2019re all going to be burnt out from sitting in front of our computers all day. I feel like I can\u2019t pay attention as well in a Zoom class as I could in person, y\u2019know? Anyway, that\u2019s just my take on all this.

Even if I can't go to office hours to help me study the way he does it makes it so much easier than my math class where she posts videos online every week and the class period is supposed to be for questions but nobody is asking any.

I can focus on computer related stuff like I'm working on learning Java but math is kinda different. I do computer stuff well there because the kind of jumping from thing to thing works well they even have a name for it linear learning. But math is kinda harder for me to learn that way. The same stuff that makes it easier for me to try learning about computer type stuff just ends up making me even more likely to get sidetracked from what I should really be focusing on. Plus I'm just better at focusing on computer stuff because I spent my life playing around on computers learning them in a similar way (even if I jumoed into the deep end and still have bad habits I'm breaking). It's too bad because I actually enjoy math normally but this just turns it into a grueling fight to stay focused both by not getting distracted with other stuff and not zoning out thinking about who knows what. I'm starting the think maybe I should try to withdraw from math before the refund deadline but because of family stuff its likely that the longer it takes the harder it will become for me to pay for school.",

Plus most of the time they want to use crappy apps like zoom to try to get in and digest the knowledge that they are giving to you, the main problem is not just the vague boring uninspiring lectures that forces people to do their own research(cough cough cheating) it is way to difficult to get on a horrible made web cam app like that and the links either broken or not there and once you miss the class that's your ass.\n\nWhy pay for classes that almost $300 or over that don't really teach you or engage with the topics at hand with the class and professor, if we are gonna use unreliable services that barely work. I feel bad for my Florida's or any other subtropical state because once Hurricane hits and you are force to do your work online, then you sir are stuck. America is in gigantic mess right now and people from other countries that I know stated they don't want go back to America until their get stuff together after all the stuff they witness from the media. With that they should focus reopen important locations first which are schools & businesses are meant to sustain and people need to thrive and survive: Warehouse, hardware, grocery stores, and some restaurant that pack don't pack alot of attraction, cellular services, cable/satellite provides to get the latest news with fast internet. Do not go after reopening places that make Corona crap even worse than before which are clubs, Casinos, concerts, and other entertainment attraction sites. \n\nThis is why my home state is labeled not just the meme state of America, but also the west side Corona epicenter aka the Westside Wuhan. If New York can slow down the spread of Corona by following strict guidelines and still reopen school to the public then other states can too. New York was the highest ranking corona case state, and now they are labeled as one of the slowest Corona case state because the strick policies that they made that magically somehow open wonders for them. \n\nIf students don't want to follow the safe policies of returning back to campus then punish them for a semester and switch their course to online only everytime they abuse it. It's simple as that. We don't need idiots who wants to be the cool guys by being a jackass and taking off their masks or do any other stupid things to ruin our return to on campus classes. In 4 years after this year I will be 30 and I don't want to live most of my college transfer years learning experiences at home which I will be force to be anti-social to the public besides working.",

After finally getting some passing grades in the first time in my life over the past, couple of years, this pandemic completely derailed any further academic plans for me. At this point, I'm just going to focus on my job and wait a few years until things finally get back under some form of control.   \n\n\n  \nMight be a little more wrinkled and weak in the joints by the time I get done(37 now, been at this college game since 17. Slow learner and such). But if it means staying safe and healthy, I'll be able to live with a later than normal finish. Nothing else really going on in my life and never was, so I at least have something to keep looking forward to.",

The problem is that whenever I go into a breakout room, no one talks and it's just a bunch of people staring at black screens.\n\nThere are some successful breakout room implementations that I've encountered, but it really relies more on whether the students are actually engaged and want to turn on their cameras and talk. The TA definitely has a role in encouraging people to participate, but at some point a lot of it is unfortunately out of your control. \n\nI guess one thing that I've observed to work relatively well is calling people by name? Like if no one's talking in a breakout room, ask a specific person a question to start a discussion. But it's also a possibility that they just respond to that one question and never talk again.",

Lower tuition or require your professors to record lectures or hold live ones via zoom imo. Part of the reason my tuition is so high, is to pay the \u201cbest professors in the state\u201d to teach me, not to give me quizzes that they ripped straight from the textbook\u2019s website.

Because they don\u2019t want to spend the massive time it requires to record those dead-ass pre-recorded lectures that you are complaining about.

It was never mandatory but they would stay on and you could join if you had questions and leave once you got them answered. I liked this because it allowed me to do the lectures and pause/go back to things I may have missed during a real-time lecture, but still gave me the opportunity to ask questions/get clarification in somewhat real time as opposed to via email.",

          "text": "100% second this. \n\nI deliberately chose to complete all of my lower-div classes during my first two years, which proved to be a dumb mistake. I guess that's pretty commonplace and is kinda how college is designed, but I did have opportunities to take smaller upper-divs this past year, and a lot of my lower divs weren't prereqs for later classes and could've been taken any time. My reasoning was that I would have a bunch of upperdiv and grad classes in my last two years, which would be more fun and more meaningful in a sense. I was looking forward to the upcoming year, having picked smaller major classes that I was excited to take in-person.\n\nAnd then coronavirus hit. If only I saved some of those gen eds and huge lecture classes for right now. Like goddamn I missed out on some really cool classes this past year that I will miss out on unless I can somehow fit it into my senior year schedule, and that's assuming the 2021-2022 school year is in-person.",

And plus to set up advising appointments is broken. Nobody wants to do everything online and it just kills the point of attending to a specific university. Is just a massive waste of time and money, and there alot of people thinking about dropping college at this point and focus on getting 2 or more jobs at this point.",

It has nothing to do with trying harder at all. Intrinsic motivation is asking what you want to achieve, like setting a goal. As opposed to extrinsic motivators such as reward/punishment from someone else.\n\nFinding intrinsic motivation actually can be hindered by just \"working harder\". Stepping back for a moment and not working and taking stock and evaluating things. It is more working smarter. If you're just pushing through looking outside for reasons to do your school work, that's working harder. Working smarter is taking a breath and asking why you're doing it and developing motivation from that.\n\nI went back to school last year as even though I've done well since a bad time in 2010-2013 (Cardiac arrest, homeless living outside, etc). 2 years ago found myself not fulfilled even making $100k/year and went back to school. Had to step back a few times and find my intrinsic motivators when I've questioned my full time classes that have become all online. In just over a year I did 65 credit hours between school and CLEP exams (All As except once A-) and now am a junior and had to reset myself the other day as classes start online on Monday and once again they're all ones with no lecture but all self teaching as usual. Working harder would have been a mistake as would have crashed and burned.",

Aka roadblocks or speed bumps. Positive outside factors would be if you lived alone with your cat and got to do your studies in your underwear (which is the best way to study).\n\nAn outside/extrinsic motivator to do your studies is keeping a scholarship that requires it. Or if your parents will beat the shit out of you. Or if you get your degree you can make a lot of money and feel smug skipping your reunion because you're not the high schools jock hero who now smokes meth and steals copper.\n\nAn inside/intrinsic motivator is doing your studies because when you've completed prior coursework you felt accomplished and better about yourself, and you want to prove to yourself you can do the same an the next level higher.\n\nThe line OP used is common. It also applies to raising kids. Some parents do reward/punishment (outside motivators) to teach right from wrong and doing what you should, and others think better to teach inside motivation that you do good because it is right and not because you're scared of getting in trouble.",

      "text": "I've taken a lot of online classes. Here's my take on them and a bit of advice.\n\nFirst, due dates are irrelevant.  Simply put, most assignments give you a week. You can't look at them as if you're going to 5 lectures on August 30th. Instead, you are going to 5 lectures between August 24th and August 30th.  \n\nSecond, they aren't lectures either.  Some professors may upload a lecture online, but most don't.  Instead, they are pools of resources.  Study guides, power points, articles, case studies, etc.  You have to read and learn the material yourself instead having a professor spoon feed it to you.  You won't have a professor repeating the contents of the syllabus every week.  You can read it yourself.  All in all, online classes give your more resources to work with, but you have to put more work into learning that information. \n\nAs for it not taking as much time, yeah, that's normal for some. Most professors and advisors repeat the same formula of 3 hours of work per credit hour per week.  In over 250 credits, I've never exceeded 1 hour per credit per week.  Looking back, I can't say there's been any significant difference in the amount of information learned in online courses versus in-residence courses. \n\nIt all depends on the professor, your academic aptitude and how much work you put it.  Some professors phone it in and your course is ridiculously easy and you learn nothing.  Some students have a stronger aptitude than others and can finish faster, while others will struggle to finish on time.  Also, you can put the bare minimum into your work and still get an A, or you can do more to try to learn. Read every article that is linked. Get on google and search the subject to learn more.",

          "text": "You missed what I'd consider to be the most important part:\n\nThe homework software. \n\nif you're unlucky enough to attend a college that signs contracts with textbook companies or have professors that get kickbacks for using them, you will likely find yourself spending the majority of your time in homework software. Cengage or Pearson, most likely. Your in-person classes may have had some, but you mostly did the learning in class with a professor, and the questions in the software.\n\nFor an online class, you will do all your reading there and all (or most) of your homework there. Quizzes, tests, exams, all on the software. Depending on the class you might find yourself learning absolutely nothing from the professor and just using your resources to pass the tests. You might see some power points or PDFs in the classroom folder the professor uploaded, but when you look at them they all say \"Cengage\" or \"Pearson\" in the corner because the professor didn't create them, they're just providing what the software gave them to provide. You can barely even say it's \"their\" class at this point.\n\nYour professor will do very little, you'll learn very little, your access codes will cost a lot, and so will the class fees, for what was essentially an automated \"teacher\" that recites multiple choice questions from the book and nothing more.\n\nAnd you'll feel ripped off, because you absolutely were. You'll find yourself asking why colleges are allowed to get away with such scams, and you won't have an answer.\n\nThis has been the norm for online classes for a long time, but I imagine a lot of people who usually only take in-person are going to experience this for the first time. I know even some in-person math classes are turning into glorified third party software usage sessions while the professor turns into a simple moderator.",

Not like college owes that to me but this platform is incredibly annoying. My main complaint is that a lot of problems won't give you partial credit. If you do a problem that takes 10 minutes and get it wrong, you are required to do it all over again. Most of the time it is a transcribing mistake on my part which adds insult to injury knowing I actually got the question right on paper.

If it didn't, no student would pass subsequent math courses, would they?\n\nI've used Cengage for Financial Accounting 1 and 2,  Managerial Accounting, Medical Terminology and a few others.  I learned those topics well enough to apply their concepts in subsequent courses that built on them. The model clearly works for these subjects too.  \n\nThink about it this way.  A singular professor or even a singular department at a university will devise the curriculum for a course. No need for external validation if the school is already accredited. Then that professor could half ass the instruction and hand out A's like candy, setting you up for failure at the next higher level.  Or you can have a professor that takes it upon themselves to play gatekeeper and grade more harshly than any other professor, hurting your GPA and future prospects.\n\nCengage, Pearson and McGraw Hill are using hundreds of professors to devise these courses.  They are administered and graded in a standardized fashion.  I understand you feeling like you are being ripped off financially because the professor assigned to the class isn't really the one teaching.

They're procedural and scenario based.  You can't solve accounting problems through multiple choice.\n\nMedical Terminology.  That's fill in the blank. I'm sure that could be presented in a multiple choice format, but that's not what Cengage does.\n\nWe'll add Spanish.  Again, fill in the blank.

It also shows that you can independently complete an entire project, from start to finish. Not just meaningless lines on a resume but an actual product they can look at. It doesn't have to be fancy machine learning. Just something that shows that you know what you're talking about, can communicate it effectively, and have the internal motivation to do something extracurricular because you care about it.\n\nYou can take that idea and stretch it to any discipline. If not github, put it on a blog or something. Find a question that you've always wanted to know the answer to, or something you've always found interesting, and do some research on it and write about it. \n\nTake some inspiration from your classes. Most will have practical projects. For example, in one of my classes, we had to develop a sample interview process as a group. It's not real world experience, but it's close and you can word it as such on your resume. Don't just put it down as a class project; list it as something you have experience in doing.\n\nAnd if you still can't come up with any ideas for your discipline, ask your professors for advice. Any good professors will be happy to guide you with finding a passion project.",
