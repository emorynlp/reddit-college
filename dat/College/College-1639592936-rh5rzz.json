  "text": "So I go to a medicine based high school meaning that everyone here wants to be a doctor or something health related. Literally almost everyone at my school has 4.0 UW GPA whereas I usually get all A's and maybe 1 or 2 B's  on my report card. This is honestly not that good according to my school standards and this bothers me. Last year in virtual learning I got Mainly A's and a few B's and C's. This year however I've got My GPA at 3.7 and I have 2 B's. I honestly wanted to know how this would affect my chances of getting into top tier colleges when almost everyone at my school has a higher GPA and much better grades than I do.",
