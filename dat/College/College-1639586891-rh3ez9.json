  "text": "So basically I have a really bad understanding of calculus BC because my teacher sucks, if I somehow manage to pass the ap exam would it be a good idea to just take calc 1 and calc 2 in college so that I can actually learn it for real? I\u2019ll need it for my major \n\nOr should I just try to learn it myself over summer or something and use the ap credit",

      "text": "I don't know how AP credits work for your college, so I'm just doing to use mine for reference. If you were to get a 3 for calculus BC, you would get credit for Calculus 1 only. \n\nI don't see the point in taking Calculus 1 again. Passing Calculus BC with at least a 3 means you have some kind of understanding of Calculus. Otherwise, if you genuinely knew nothing, then you would have failed. I suggest just taking Calculus 2, and polishing up on your Calculus 1 skills.",

I met with the professor to determine if I was ready for the class or not. \n\nCan you meet with the professor to determine if you are ready for calculus 2?",
