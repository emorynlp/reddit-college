  "text": "But because of my fellow classmates. My professors will even devote time during class for us to respond to a discussion board and people will still not do it and instead wait until the last minute its due. This sucks when you have to respond to 2+ of your classmates and have to stay up until midnight the day before its due so you have people to respond to. Its like these students don\u2019t understand or don\u2019t care that them taking forever to do the discussion board affects other peoples grade and schedule.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be this person.",

Maybe let your prof know that this has been an issue and request they have initial posts due prior to the responses. \n\nI realize it's the end of the semester, so maybe something to keep in mind for future courses and your course evaluation.",

After all, the professor makes these discussion boards quite a hefty chunk of our grade for whatever reason! I think I'm almost at the bare minimum word count, but until I hit that word count minimum I'm just going to continue bloating my language and maybe even doing a circular argument just to get the bare minimum. Oop - looks like I hit the minimum word count! Off to reply to another classmate and pretend to give a shit!",

Everybody hates them and very rarely does any meaningful discussion arise out of them because of that, and because of that rarely does anybody learn anything from them lol.
