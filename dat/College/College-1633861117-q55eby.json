  "text": "Sometimes late at night I'll spend an hour or two searching old classmates on linkedin or handshake to see what their resum\u00e9 looks like or things they have done. It started my senior year. It's sort of like I want to know where I could end up with my degree/experience, and also trying to find things I could do to add on to my resume. I feel like I'm the only one who does this though",
