  "text": "I have anxiety and I like my space to be quiet. I want to come home and feel fully relaxed. As is typical with college living, it\u2019s hard to have a space completely to yourself, even if it\u2019s an apartment. I\u2019m also social and I enjoy the company of others (I just prefer to have a quiet place to retreat to afterwards). My past roommate experiences haven\u2019t been terrible like some horror stories, but they haven\u2019t been all that great either. I found my current roommate through a social media platform, but I realized it\u2019s hard to see how living with that person will really be after only a couple meetings. I\u2019m considering for housing next year:\n\nOption A) Do a one bedroom apartment and get a small pet to keep me company (hamster or rat) for next year. \nPROS: will reduce anxiety from being around someone all the time; I will finally be able to sleep as I\u2019m a light sleeper and have always had sleep issues with roommates.\nCONS: might get lonely\n\nOption B) Attempt again to find a roommate that better fits my lifestyle, either through Facebook or roommate matching services\nPROS: will not be as lonely, can potentially make another friend, cheaper rent\nCONS: less sleep, anxiety \n\nIs it worth it to find a new roommate, or should I just fuck it and live in a one bedroom with a pet to keep me company? \n\nDoes anyone have experience in living in college apartment with a hamster or rat? Does it take away a lot of energy?\n\nTLDR if you have anxiety and crave personal space but are also social, is it better to live by yourself with a pet or with a roommate?",

      "text": "For what it\u2019s worth, I chose to use the schools roommate matchmaking service provided to all students living on campus. The result? I made a friend for life. I realize this is anecdotal and you may not experience the same situation I have but that\u2019s not to say you should automatically think negatively when it comes to having a roommate. \n\nIf anything it will teach you to deal with things civilly, if they don\u2019t live or act similar to you that\u2019s a great opportunity to be able to work on your conflict resolution skills. Again, that\u2019s not always an option, and I realize that, but you shouldn\u2019t go in feeling at a loss already is my point.",
