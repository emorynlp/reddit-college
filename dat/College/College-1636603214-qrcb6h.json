  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m currently trying to decide what classes I should take in the coming semester but it\u2019s more difficult than I expected. Right now, I\u2019m taking Anatomy and Physiology 1 and it is definitely quite intense to me. I currently have a 74 in Lab and 78 in Lecture (I think) and I do want to to kinda take a break. I need to take at least two classes next year, history (for when I enroll for a university in the next Fall) and a science. I need thoughts on what science would be easy to balance with that. It as HAS to be either A&P 2, Intro to Micro Biol, or Intro to Chem. I say has because of the program I\u2019m applying for. I\u2019m advised for Micro but I just wanna make sure it\u2019s smart w another class. Plus I don\u2019t know many people here at my school to ask around and I don\u2019t trust my advisor. \n\nFor additional info, I\u2019m in a community technical college and I\u2019m trying to make things very do-able since I am full time at my job. \n\nFeel free to ask questions if it helps!",
