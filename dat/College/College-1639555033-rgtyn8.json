  "text": "I'm in my third, almost fourth year of community college - and only in my third semester. already off to a great start, huh? I was doing okay-ish but COVID fucked up a lot - that's my excuse, at least. I went from a 3.0 GPA average to a 2.0. Yes, that bad. This semester, though, this is all me. I fucked up. I really did.\n\nI have a 91% in one class and as soon as I complete the final I'm finished. The final is an essay; it's simple, and I'm almost finished with it. That class is not one I'm worried about.\n\nSame with another class. I'm almost finished with it, just a few papers (which are almost done - just gotta proofread them) and I'm done, more than likely finishing with a 85-90% average for it (only because I didn't complete one of the 5 papers - yes, i know, i fucked up an easy grade, but my GPA is so low that these two classes will boost it significantly.)\n\nThe third class is my biggest issue. Yes, I'm only taking three classes this semester. I did this because I wanted to lessen my workload. It helped but I'm still a major fuck up. I've tried my best to understand this subject but I continuously do not do well on work in the class. I'm sitting here at 3 A.M. desperately trying to finish something to hand in. I have 4 assignments which are 30% of my grade. I have one done and I can finish two more. I have no idea if it'll help or not. I'm doing so badly in the class and it's too late to drop it. I'm genuinely freaking out and I'm pissed at myself for not doing more to help myself. I have to take the final tomorrow and I pray I'll pass it. Somehow I've only missed two classes (both because of family reasons.) \n\nI don't know what I'm doing. I don't want to fail out of community college. I don't want to fail this class. I wish I could go back in time and yell at myself, but I can't. I really don't know what to do.",
