  "text": "my girlfriend\u2019s professor is requiring her class to provide urine samples for a lab. there is no drug test or such involved. her professor said if they don\u2019t provide their urine, they get a 0 on the lab assignment. is this normal? i feel like there would be some sort of rule or law where you shouldn\u2019t be required to provide your urine to a professor for a grade\u2026 seems odd to me. just to add, her and other students in the class feel uncomfortable about this assignment",

In a common office setting, you might have 121 (1:1, \"one to one\" chats with supervisor and individual subordinate), weekly/monthly reports, team meetings where everyone describes what they're up to (committee/department meetings do not do that), etc. In other words, a supervisor literally supervises. So if you question a supervisor \"what did X subordinate do last week?\" they should know.\n\nThat is not the case in academia. The chair and dean will not know what any professor did last week, or last month, or perhaps the entire year, beyond surface details like abstract of their work and perhaps what class they are teaching. The professor does not have 121 chats with anyone other than regular conversations, there are no weekly/monthly reports, no team meetings where everyone talks about what they did last week/month for a few minutes each. Quite literally, nobody is *supervising* the professor.\n\nOn the other hand, professors certainly answer to someone (chair or dean, depending on school structure).\n\nFor example, if you live in USA, you should know that USPS offices have a supervisor that has no disciplinary authority over the people they supervise. I know this because I had to wait over 20 minutes for a clerk (on their \"coffee break\") to handle my passport application after the supervisor told her to do so. The supervisor told me to file a complaint on the USPS website because she can't do anything. (I suppose as the supervisor she writes performance evaluations, but perhaps they are not effective). In this example, the supervisor was not a superior.",

(By \u201ctypical\u201d I mean not specific medical professional training programs- I assume if the girlfriend in this story were in nursing school she might not be so surprised by the lab.

Collection of urine properly is part of the deal and when it tests positive for not being a proper \u201cclean catch\u201d\n\nI am not sure what damage you think can be done by \u201c urine to potentially viewed by other people\u201d or why that is a problem.\n\nI should also point out that if you are using supplied urine, they are still handling urine, and that the weirder thing is that adults would be weird out by urine in a cup.\n\nOP never said there were no option other than failure, and in this world is it unlikely in the US that this would be the case, nor did I advocate for that.  I can barely fail them for actually failing.\n\nTLDR\nIf you are taking one of the classes that uses human urine samples , this is overwhelming likely to be a class for a major or certificate that requires you to know about such things and to deal with such samples , so this falls squarely in the suck it up buttercup category .\n\nOn the rare occasions that such things are approved for other purposes they are usually the best and most affordable option (and sometimes with supply chain issues the only viable option).  So if I did choose fake urine or supplied urine, there would immediately be a post here about how college was a scam and how prices are rising and how lab fees are the work of Satan.\n\nI again ask, reminding you that urine itself is not pathogenic (the kidney is a truly amazing thing) then what is so \u201cdiscomforting\u201d about human urine.\n\nAmericans are really ridiculous creatures.  This is the only country I have ever lived in where this is an issue (not the IRB part, that is pretty universal in developed countries but the manufactured umbrage and finding things to be upset about )",

And then I\u2019m only objecting if there\u2019s not a good reason and proper oversight- which is why I directed them to the appropriate office to bring such concerns. There may be some good reasons but I\u2019m also aware of cases where lab policies exist for lousy reasons. If the student is concerned she has a right to ask about it. \n\nI\u2019m not bothered at all by students handling human urine in lab and I never said I was. I\u2019m even ok with asking them to bring in their own urine, as long as there is an alternative option. There is nothing in modern medicine which requires people to study their own urine (as opposed to someone else\u2019s).\n\nAs for the clean catch, I fail to see how successfully performing a clean catch on yourself should be a class requirement. From personal experience, I can\u2019t do a clean catch on myself without another person\u2019s help (for anatomical reasons). There is nothing about my physiology which would prevent me from being a good medical caregiver or learning to collect samples from others. Learning on yourself is often a good and simple way to learn but there have to be alternatives. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.",
