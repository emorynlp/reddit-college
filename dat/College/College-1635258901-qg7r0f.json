  "text": "It looks like if I have any hopes of graduating in a timely manner I need to transfer to a new program. My college is in New Mexico and I am sick of out of state tuition and their 2 year plan is impossible to do, according to the advisor. She told me why but it doesn\u2019t really matter, I need something else. I was ok with a little extra to graduate sooner but the lack of transparency has led me to where I am now. I will do research of course but I want to see real opinions this time.\n\nBack to other programs:\nWhat do you, and don\u2019t you like about your current program?\nDo you happen to know the VTNE success rate?",
