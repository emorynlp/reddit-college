I would also keep any review sheets equation sheets and maybe even exams if you think they'll be useful later in your college career. That means only things in your major and even then maybe not. I'm in engineering and there have been a few times I've referenced back to some of these reference materials, but I could probably count on one hand in the last 2 years now how much I've done it.",

If it's on paper I'd probably digitize it if you think it's worth keeping. You could scan it if you just want to keep the data, or you can take the time to actually put it into an Excel sheet or something but that would take a little longer. Digital storage is cheap so might as well",
