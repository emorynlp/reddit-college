I live in Michigan so cost of living isn\u2019t nearly as high as other states so I\u2019m not expecting 70-80k to start. Just curious what you guys landed out of school.",

Most professional jobs here make between 50-90k, 6 figures happen at director level here. Unless you open your own distribution center/storage facility/trucking company.",

The employer also pays for unlimited education related to the employer which I\u2019m taking advantage of which is an 80k benefit. It all worked out. A company in Portland  just wanted to hire contractors and give no benefits the pay was better but it would have been a worse deal for me. Plus I would have never moved to Oklahoma and I\u2019m very happy here.",
