  "text": "Hello Reddit, I entered my first semester of college this year with 28 credits transferring from PSEO classes I already took. I still plan on going to college 4 years. Per university requirements, I started making my 4 year degree audit plan today, and noticed that because of my 28 credits knocking out most of my Gen Ed requirements, not only could I do my plan of majoring in business management and minoring in economics, I can actually double major if I wanted. I know this would likely be a lot of work, but I think I can do it, as I don't have a bunch of other major commitments in life as of now. This semester I'm taking acct 231, microeconomics, geology, cbe 101, math 146 (college algebra). In other words, these classes will count towards any major I go into, so I can switch my major and have no repercussions. Economics intrigues me, but I've heard poor judgements about it from econ majors",

      "text": "I would recommend accounting.  Business majors are a dime a dozen and nothing special.  Economics doesn't translate into any particular job.  Accounting grads are in high demand and if you get 150 college credits (and take the right courses) you could take the CPA exams in the future.  I base this information off being in the workforce for 30 years and seeing a lot of unemployed or underemployed business and marketing majors.  An accounting degree goes far in the business world.",
