I know teachers think making tests on the weekend gives us more time to prepare, but what it really means is that we don\u2019t get a single day off. I really need to get a job but just can\u2019t because I wont be able to handle more work.",

I used to have all assignments due on class days, but now that only half the class comes at a time, that seems kind of pointless. I thought about having students turn in some work they days they don't come in (if you come on Wednesdays, your work is due on Fridays and vice versa) but that felt like I was imposing a structure for no reason given they wouldn't actually come to class. So I just made everything due at the end of the week on Saturday to give students the most flexibility, given I usually wouldn't look at it all until the following week anyway.\n\nI guess no good deed goes unpunished.",

Most of my friends are also abstaining from going out because of COVID (or their parents won't let them) or they live far away or at college, so it's mostly just gaming with friends that are available that really constitute my leisure time.",

I know 15 units is \u201cfull-time\u201d, but putting 9+ hours in Sunday through Saturday is not how 15 undergrad units is supposed to be. Distance learning is exhausting. Every week i\u2019m learning a little more how to manage distance learning, and I adjust. I know I am adapting & one day i\u2019ll achieve a balance. So far I haven\u2019t missed an assignment and my grade average is an A. But again, no life just school. First round of exams are next week. Not sure how i\u2019ll fit extra \u201cstudy\u201d time into my schedule without losing sleep, but I will figure it out. All in all, distance learning blows.",

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot I don't like about online/remote learning, but at the same time, I feel like people are using it as a scapegoat a lot.\n\nBefore, you knew if you didn't show up to a lecture, that was it. You either had to email the professor to see if they could catch you up, text your friends to ask what you missed, or just try to read the textbook and figure it out on your own.\n\nNow, with classes all being recorded, people feel like they have the freedom of missing classes, because \"oh it's just one lecture, I can watch it some other time\". Then come the weekend, they realize they have 16 hours of lectures to go through because of their mismanagement, and then go and blame it on online learning ruining their weekends.\n\nBefore you felt like if you missed a deadline for a homework assignment, that was it, your grade was down the toilet. Now, because of COVID, professors are (understandably) more open to deadline extensions, but that also gives a lot of us that false sense of security of \"oh well I can wait to do this cuz I can just ask for an extension.\" \n\nThose are just 2 examples of how it's less of an \"online classes bad\" narrative and more of a \"I'm mismanaging my time\" problem. Once again, not saying that there's nothing wrong w/ online learning (some professors feel the need to assign way more work purely because everything's online, for example), but having to do work on the weekends is 100% not an online classes thing, it's a college thing, and I'm sorry if I'm breaking any hearts here, but it's a life thing as well.",

I don\u2019t think it can be blamed on time mismanagement if I\u2019ve used all my time towards it and still have more to do on the weekends.

All these factors (and many more) go into determining if the \"online classes bad\" narrative is true or not.   \n\nThere are way too many factors at play here to blame it solely on online classes. If (and only if) you've had the exact same workload for an extended period of time pre and post online classes, and that you've observed your time spent studying and working go up to the point where you're forced to work overtime (i.e. on weekends), can you conclude that it's because of online classes.\n\nThe point I'm making isn't that people work on weekends because they've mismanaged their time, it's that online classes provide students with the fallacy that they can afford to mismanage their time, only to come to the realization that they actually can't, and thus being \"forced\" to work weekends when they otherwise would have relaxed.\n\nWhether or not working on weekends is right or not is a whole other conversation, but the one we're having right now is that \"online classes are the reason why we have to work on weekends\", which I find to be completely false.",

Unless the professor assigns a quiz that opens on Friday night and is due on Sunday night (which also happens during normal classes), that's kinda a mute point tbh.\n\nThe second point I can agree with you on, especially when you have an older, less tech savvy professor teaching online, it can be a pain to deal with. But imo, that's more of a professor problem and not a \"online classes create more work on weekends\" problem. Yes online classes exacerbates those professors' weaknesses, but to blame the extra work on the umbrella of online classes is just plain wrong.\n\nTo your last point, hanging out with friends isn't inherently a bad thing, but are you tryna argue that hanging out with friends helps you not have work on the weekends?

My time management skills haven't changed at all, if anhthing they are better than they were when I worked 45 hours a week and did online classes. Instead of lectures there is a lot more zoom group work where nothing gets done, or it is redundant, and then there are mini lectures to watch before class (two to four 3-5 minute videos) because my professors dont like lecturing on zoom (their words, not mine). My professors maybe spend twenty minutes lecturing before telling us to discuss our (usually already  completed) homework assignments with our small groups. I honestly feel like my zoom classes take up too much valuable time to do assignments and readings. I would much rather be doing my actual work than spending 6 hours a day watching professors struggle to use technology and discuss already completed assignments with 2-3 other classmates who probably didn't even do the work.",

                  "text": "Oh yeah I took art history... that was a lot of reading and writing you\u2019re not wrong. Kinda gives you perspective that a lot of majors aren\u2019t all easy as they seem. But those are really tough classes. My advice would be to section out your workweek with goals based upon what is due. And start studying 3 weeks before tests because that helped me get ready for my tests especially with other work I had to do and sometimes you may get 4 hours a week of studying for that test but it all adds up in the end and then you\u2019re doing review. Outlines also are helpful. Precalc is all about doing a solid hour or 2 a day of practice problems (I\u2019ve done all classes up to calc 2 and have found this is the best approach to math). The organic chem professor and Kara king math (I think is her name) are great videos to help you. Bio i would say your best bet is to make an outine of your notes putting in blank spaces (fill in the blanks) for definitions or words so that you\u2019re actively studying while filling out your outline. There\u2019s also videos for processes you can watch to help you understand stuff like glycolysis. Spanish, I would recommend practice problems (there\u2019s a site that\u2019s really helpful but I can\u2019t recall the name but it has a red and beige color background that\u2019s all I can remember) and also watching Spanish videos (there\u2019s gringo Spanish and senor James or something Spanish videos. He\u2019s really helpful and has practice at the end with songs too). I made an A in art history through extra credit so if your prof gives you that option def look into it, but the tricky thing about art history is that your prof has a level of what they think is sufficient and they don\u2019t really help you improve upon that (mine didn\u2019t really. Would look at advice, do that, and it would STILL be missing something). I have dropped 2 classes my entire time in undergrad and I haven\u2019t been upset about them. I will say, one semester I ended up making a C in gen chem 2 because I had a similar load to you, I also ended up having to go to the hospital for medical issues right before my final so that sucked... but I got through it. If I could go back, I would\u2019ve dropped another class though to free up time to study for that class (I had bio, bio lab, calc 2, English, gen chem 2 and lab, and martial arts. I ended up dropping martial arts, but should have also dropped bio 1 because that\u2019s a lot of reading on top of my English reading. I would be behind but I would\u2019ve made an A or a B in gen chem had I had more time to study). It\u2019s really up to you though, but I hope this helped and I do truly wish you the best!",
