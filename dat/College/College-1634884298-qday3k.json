  "title:": "Considering dropping out of Industrial Design school",
  "text": "1. So, two nights ago I stayed up until 5:30 in the morning drawing assignments for the class I had in a few hours. I was miserable. I wasn\u2019t proud of my progress, I loathed that I had to do it. After realizing I wouldn\u2019t have the drawings done by 9am, I walked back to my dorm and slept through the class. I had heard that \u201cDesign school is hard\u201d but regularly staying up until 3-4 in the morning to get work done is just miserable. These projects are partially done (the expectation is having them all done or nothing) and my professor moves a class too quickly, just enough for me to be eternally behind. It feels like my school saying \u201cit\u2019s hard\u201d is an excuse to abuse their students. I\u2019m already not very mentally stable so, an expectation of not being given enough time and expected to stay up late is not something I\u2019m going to adhere to. I still want to do Industrial Design but this process I\u2019m not going to go through with. Because one of these nights I will harm myself.\n\n2. M18 I\u2019ve been single my whole life. I haven\u2019t even been close. People say I\u2019m an attractive guy. In high school I was really insecure about being single. I told myself it would get better. At this school, I\u2019m not into the girls. Like, next to none. It\u2019s legitimately off putting. I know if I moved schools it would be better. Drunk blonde girls aren\u2019t for me and it\u2019s hard to find others who aren\u2019t.\n\nSome possible options:\n\nA. Drop out, buy a car, move far away and try to get a job in design\n\nB. Transfer schools despite my grades not being great and the possibility of encountering old problems\n\nC. Change Majors but, be in the industrial design studio for personal projects regularly and build up a portfolio\n\nD. Continue doing Industrial Design with the risk of self-harm\n\nSo, any help/advice is appreciated.",

      "text": "Imo I believe it\u2019s best you talk to your instructors about your overwhelming experience in their class. Kindly let them know you\u2019ve been working XX hours per week on these projects, and if this is the amount of time they expect students to spend. Most universities have an hour per unit ratio. For instance, my school sets the baseline at 3 hours per unit, so a student need not work more than 12 hours per week for a 4 unit class, 15 hours for a 5 unit, etc). Your school likely has a similar rule in place. So, you can share with your instructor the amount of hours per week you\u2019ve needed to work, without attacking them, and just see what they say. They\u2019ll have to consider your experience. It\u2019s an often occurrence that instructors need to adjust their curriculum or speed, but it can never happen if nobody gives feedback. So it\u2019s worth a shot, worst case at least your professor knows you\u2019re trying your hardest.",
