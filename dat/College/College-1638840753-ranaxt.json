  "text": "Hi,\n\nMy winter break is starting in about a week and it is extremely long (Month and half).  I don't really have any plans yet and I was wondering what I should do during this time instead of sitting at home.\n\nI was considering finding a job and I was wondering if many places hire me knowing that I will leave in a month. What are some jobs that don't require too much experience and would be a good fit for this break?\n\nThank you for any suggestions!",

      "text": "If you're looking for a job, most places with high turnover rates (grocery stores, retail, wal-mart) will hire you. Just be warned, when I got a job at a grocery store it still took like 2 weeks to actually get started working.\n\nOther than something like that I would personally just relax academically. I don't wanna burn myself out before even starting the next quarter.",
