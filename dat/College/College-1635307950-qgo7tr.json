  "text": "Generally speaking, I have a very nice roommate. He\u2019s easy to get along with, considerate for the most part, and genuinely kind. I do find a few fatal flaws that I desperately need advice on handling, however. The main one is with his hygiene and general cleanliness. His side of the room is a disaster and I think I\u2019ve seen him go to shower maybe 5 times at the most since we came here in mid-August. It\u2019s getting so bad that the room is starting to stink and get a very musty sort of vibe to it, but I\u2019m not sure how to bring it up without hurting his feelings.",
