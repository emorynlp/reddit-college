  "title:": "Im literally losing my mind over this dumb 10 person group project.",
  "text": "My prof had the brilliant idea of making us do a group project with 9 other people, nothing can go wrong right? Given it is a 200 person class, bigger groups mean less papers to read, i get it, but come on you really expect 10 college age people to cooperate on it with no problems? Ive had roommates who can\u2019t even throw the garbage away let alone do something thats worth 60% of their grade in a timely manner! \n\nOne month into the semester we\u2019ve chosen a topic already and are supposed to turn in an outline. Easy enough right? Just come up with subtopics and assign different parts to different people. Ha, of course not why would it ever be that easy. Came up with the outline on a Monday with two other graciously responsible group members. Annoyed that the other seven haven\u2019t said anything but whatever, benefit of the doubt given because we all have stuff to deal with. All we asked was for the other seven to pick whatever subtopic they wanna do and we\u2019ll take whats  leftover. Wednesday comes around no response, message them again using any method possible nothing. Same thing continues till Sunday, the day its due. Half respond around noon making my life less stressful knowing at least they\u2019re just procrastinators or just too busy. Cue the medical excuses because i guess we\u2019re all just bedridden apparently. 2 of them say they\u2019re sorry and were bedridden last 3 weeks i guess and are now ready to work ok it. Annoying but fine at least they responded so now theres just one person left. 11:59 rolls around, nothing. Take it upon myself to cover two subtopics because they cant be asked to respond. Heres the fun part. One week AFTER it was due, the dude has the nerve to message us asking if theres anything he can do otherwise he\u2019s gonna fail. My man must\u2019ve told the prof we weren\u2019t responding because an hour later the prof messages us asking if he can participate because he was bedridden as well. As passive aggressive as i could be i messaged him which subtopic he wanted to do because im about done with this project right now, i have other things to work on too. He chooses and we\u2019re all happy and have a topic we\u2019re responsible for.\n\nFast forward two months to today and I\u2019m fuming. Every other week since the outline we\u2019ve been having meetings to see if anyone needs help and if they\u2019re working on the project. Only around half show up while the other half filter in and out. Two of them never show up, including the guy who didn\u2019t reply to the outline. My dumbass didn\u2019t notice this obvious red flag and just thought, oh they\u2019re busy they\u2019re probably fine. I finish my part of the project early because its not the only essay i have to write this week. I put it in the shared doc and ask everyone to submit it by Sunday and I\u2019ll proofread it. Friday comes by one person other than myself has added their part. It\u2019s fine right? The group is probably just working or procrastinating they\u2019ll do it on Saturday or Sunday. Saturday, no changes to the doc whatsoever, i nag the group again just to relieve some stress building up. Sunday oh look at least half have now added their parts. I read it and you can tell it\u2019s shittiest piece of writing I\u2019ve seen. Whatever, at least they turned it in i guess, as long as it explains what it needs to. 9 pm rolls around all but 3 have added to the doc. One said they\u2019re working on it and the two that havent been to the meetings are dead silent and haven\u2019t posted anything yet. I do get worried but hey its three hours before i have to submit it. 11 pm i email everyone that im proofreading and that if they NEED to add it now. 11:45 Nobody has added anything since, missing three whole sections of the paper, fml. Me still being optimistic email them once more asking if people still need to submit, if they do, do it now before i submit. No response. 11:57 i go to post this shitty paper and fuming because i know for sure its a shitty piece of work i just turned in. Hey nothing i can do right, its about the Experience even if its 60% of my grade just gone. The only experience I\u2019ve gained from this is doing a group project sucks. Absolutely ridiculous prof\u2019s still think group projects are a great idea, let alone one with 10 people.",

I already told the professor about these kids slacking and have saved the screenshots. But Profs really need to stop assigning work that depends on lazy students not dropping the ball.",

I would never have handled it as well as you did; I would have been emailing the professor every single day a report on who isn\u2019t participating and what\u2019s going on just to annoy him for assigning such a stupid project. What a lazy idea and honestly I do not see how he thought it could have possibly worked given the attendance rate of zoom classes in general. \n\nI do know how it feels though. I got assigned a group geology presentation with 3 other people and had one person that was literally unenrolled from class on day 1; all the professor said was \u201cthanks for letting me know\u201d and I was left to pick up the slack. Another group member was unresponsive the whole time but would show up in zoom classes leading me to email the professor and getting essentially a \u201cdid you email them?\u201d answer. And the third group member shot me an email on the first day and the last day asking if it was done. I did the whole thing and told my group members to add some shit or I\u2019d legit email the teacher. They add some photos or something and eventually a week later I get an email from the professor saying we plagiarized and this is going straight to the college board. I sent them a log of everything and was instantly cleared and got an alternate assignment. \n\nI hate group projects.",

I try to be upfront about wanting an A grade on this paper so that my group mates who may be okay with just passing know that they\u2019ll have to put in more effort than usual on this project. But, then I also like to come up with a plan as a group so I can incorporate their ideas into our group outline for the project so that it\u2019s not just \u201cmy project\u201d that everyone is working on. People seem to be more willing to put in the effort if their ideas are represented too. It takes a bit of humility and sometimes you may have to add things into the project that you don\u2019t like, but when everyone feels like they\u2019re influencing the group\u2019s activities, you have a better outcome. Sometimes I like to take charge without it seeming like I\u2019m taking charge, especially if I\u2019m working with other outgoing people. That can help, too.",

In business and in NGOs, for example, a company/agency will often form a group to tackle a certain problem or project.  \n\nIn high school or college, though, a few good students often wind up doing all the work.  If they don't their grade will be in the barely-passing range.  Meanwhile, the goof-offs share in the high grade earned exclusively by the good students.  \n\nThe best solution is for one of the serious students to informally take over as a group leader.   Again, that is very career related.   Continuous gentle prodding (reminders of deadlines, etc.) to the poor students will usually get them to do work.  If there are still poor or no results from them, follow up conversations with texts telling what is needed by what day.  Those texts can later be taken to the professor if the unmotivated student still won't cooperate.  \n\nA pre-emptive technique can be taken when a group project is first assigned.  Ask the professor in open class if there will be a procedure by which those who are lazy can be removed from the group.",

In a true work setting that uses groups (think corporate settings) the moment someone shows to be weak/slacking the issue is immediately addressed as the leader has the true means to motivate/encourage the slackers, either through reward, punishment or pressure bc they know their boss in that group is watching. I argue that these do not simulate real group work.

They don\u2019t care about \u201cevidence\u201d or \u201cproof\u201d. They just want the assignment submitted. \n\nHowever, I have had a handful that were willing to consider docking points from a group member who didn\u2019t do much if we shared the group Google Doc with them so they could see the edit history. That always very clearly proves who did what and how much they contributed. Giving them a timeline of texts and responses and time stamped stuff from our own private group chats (or anything that requires lengthy reading/making assumptions) is something that most of them are generally not interested in, in my experience.",

The only reason I didn\u2019t have a 4.0 is because my work quality took a dip one semester because I was going through the wringer at home and couldn\u2019t suppress my emotions to pour hours into my schoolwork anymore. It was my one and only B. But, at the end of the day, employers don\u2019t care about your grade in college, so as long as you get the degree from an accredited school you should be fine. \n\nI just wanted to have a really high GPA because I felt I had something to prove.
