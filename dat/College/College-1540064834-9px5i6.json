  "text": "I finally began to take higher engineering classes this quarter, and wow...it is hard. \n\n\nI noticed that whenever the weekend is here, I always take a one-day break from all the school stuff and relax, despite how much I need to study or how much homework I need to finish. \n\n\nAm I the only one? Am I being lazy?\n\nEdit: Wow! You guys are awesome! :D",

I wasn\u2019t any more employable after graduation despite the fact that I sacrificed way more fun than any of my friends.\n\nNow I\u2019m back working on a certification and while I still get everything in (on time), I am actually focusing on mental wellness this time around. I make sure I get enough sleep regardless of how much I have to do, I don\u2019t overcommit myself, and I try my best to give my friends and family an adequate amount of attention.\n\nI have Saturdays off of work so I use Saturday as my \u201cfree day.\u201d I don\u2019t do anything for school (unless it\u2019s an exceptionally busy week) and don\u2019t feel any guilt if it\u2019s a super lazy day. Sometimes I\u2019ll clean and grocery shop, sometimes I\u2019ll watch movies all day and order pizza, other days I\u2019ll go out into town my my friends and drink too much.\n\nEither way, I think it\u2019s very important to have a day for yourself once a week if you can manage it. You will do much better in school if you\u2019re well rested and less stressed. ",
