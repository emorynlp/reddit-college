  "text": "So basically, my friends and I are all about 23 years old. Two of us are still in college, me included, one graduated, ones in the military, the other I have no clue about. We all hang out at least once a week. When we\u2019re not together, some nights we\u2019ll play video games together. \n\nWhen we hang out we just go to each others family homes. None of us own a place yet. Because I\u2019m still in school I can\u2019t pay for a place. I don\u2019t want to work full time and be a student full time. My mom has no issue with me staying home. Similar situations with my friends. \n\nWhen we hang out we still avoid parents and rip nicotine sticks and get high. It\u2019s fun but it\u2019s getting repetitive and old. This morning my friends mom made us breakfast. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about it. We\u2019re 23 and still having sleepovers and having moms make us breakfast. Is this normal or should we be concerned? \n\nI guess with COVID nothing is normal. Even without COVID I feel like this would still be a thing.",

      "text": "At 23 I was getting ready to get married, we had met our freshman year in college and we had already traveled all around the world, lived in Africa several times, seen Europe and Asia. I found a partner much younger than most of my friends, were 29 now and we are one of the only few that has a kid (2 yr. old).\n\nIts no problem living with your parents, just make sure that you have something that gives you purpose and makes you feel confident. We don't really have a rite of passage in our society, something that tells you when you have become a man. So you have to decide for yourself that you want to be a man, and then do the things that good men would do.\n\nDoing things on your own, such as paying your way through school or paying your own rent, make you feel confident in yourself. I had to do it at 18 because I grew up with my grandparents and they could not afford to put me through school or pay my rent. I went through a lot of rough times making sure I saved my money and had enough for bills, but at 29 I now know how to do it and I know that I could make our situation work no matter what. I also got a bit of a head start on life. We started working young and now we are further ahead in our career and finally making \"good\" money, even through the pandemic. \n\nFind a good girl (or boy). They will make you want to have your own place, be able to buy nice things and become more of an adult. It sounds like your situation is pretty comfortable. Put yourself out there into some new situations and force yourself to be uncomfortable. It will make you grow quickly. When you grow quickly and realize how much you can do on your own, your confidence will grow. Then go visit home when you want and on your terms. \n\nGood luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMelissa",

I\u2019m only 21, but I\u2019ve been simultaneously fortunate and unfortunate enough to have endured a lot of life experiences that people my age have yet to navigate.  Don\u2019t stress yourself out about maturing just yet, because I just purchased my first house, have traveled the world (for work, no way I could afford that on my own), have my own vehicle paid off and have spent a lot of time investing towards my retirement. I\u2019m not trying to stroke my own dick or anything, what I\u2019m getting at is that on paper I look solid.  But even though I \u201chave my shit together\u201d, I experience the same angst as you, and I constantly worry and stress about whether or not myself and my friends are doing the right thing/progressing at an appropriate rate. All I can say, is as long as you continue to progress, and always take the opportunities you\u2019re afforded, there\u2019s nothing to seriously worry about. Plus, what fun would being in our twenties be if we WEREN\u2019T constantly stressed. \n\n\nBest of luck friend",

I know people in their 20s with jobs and houess, who still do this. Why stop worthwhile friendships over a preconceived notion of maturity? Soon you will be working, starting families, and being more \"adult.\" Things will change, and you might not have as much time for each other.",

Once you lose it you\u2019ll never get it back so don\u2019t be in a hurry to get rid of it. Just my advice, but there are worse things than this situation. Also, many parents enjoy taking care of their kids and their friends especially if all of their kids are gone. Just make sure you\u2019re all being appropriately respectful and grateful and it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nPractically speaking though, you could offer to help with breakfast or offer to do other chores while breakfast is being made like taking out the trash or cleaning up from the previous night.",

It won't be like this for that much longer (a year or two at best), so I'm savoring it. I will miss it when it's gone. As long as you're making progress in your educational or professional life, as long as you can do things for yourself, there is literally nothing wrong with being at home, and hanging out with friends in their family home. There is no rush to move out at this age. The mom making breakfast is just her being nice, and I wouldn't make a thing about it! My mom does that for me sometimes too even though I don't ask, and it's just a way of expressing love for others!",

      "text": "Maybe my story will help you get more comfortable with your situation. I\u2019ve been in both situations: moved out at 18.lived  across the globe for 2 years, came back to my country and studied for the past four years, while switching my major once. Lived with roommates for the whole time and I had to work A LOT to pay for rent and food and clothing and university expenses. I completely worked myself into a burnout. I am now 24, quit my job and moved back home to my parents because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay rent. I am now back working a small job And the amount of money I am saving is NICE! I am a bit angry that I wanted to be independent so much, so young. I could have saved so much more money and my studies would have been so much easier. Working night shifts definitely affected my grades. It is hard to be on your own while also studying full time. And doing laundry, going grocery shopping and cooking takes so much time off of your hands, too. I was almost never able to study. So my advice: treasure it while you can.  I am glad I got all of my experiences but I am still sad that in order to be independent I had to sacrifice my mental health. \n\nI hope you find a solution that works for you. Good luck!",

I remember leaving the bar at midnight to go home and have Mario Kart Double Dash tournaments. When the Wii came out, got damn we had parties at the pad and were up until dawn. Football weekends were insane because I lived 3/4 a mile from the stadium, so I\u2019d have anywhere from 5-12 people crash afterwards. \nNothing like waking up on a Sunday to find a guy making 80K passed out on your couch, and someone you don\u2019t know but was a friend of a friend halfway in kitchen and dining room. \nAnother time, at fucking 28, I had a buddy come over for a while to play games, then we\u2019d head out to the bars. His wife wanted home at 1, when they closed. At 4:30 we woke up to his phone going off nonstop. We both got so drunk at home we never made it out. He passed out on the floor and I had the pause menu for Mario Kart on for probably 3 hours.\n\nPoint is- enjoy these times for a little bit, because they will go away as guys get married, have kids, move away for work.

      "text": "An adolescent is a person who is in that in-between stage between childhood and adulthood. Typically, it starts around age 12 and ends when the person has matured and is mostly independent from their parents. Traditionally, adolescences used to end when someone was about 18 or 20. But that was way back when people left home, found a job, and got married at an earlier age. Now, it\u2019s not as easy to leave that adolescent stage for several reasons. Most young adults can\u2019t afford their own place to live independently without having a job -and a full time job isn\u2019t easy if the adolescent is a full time college student. \n\n\nYou might feel like you\u2019re maturing faster because you\u2019re mentally preparing yourself for your next stage of life: adulthood. Well, that stage will hit you sooner than you know it, so I recommend just enjoying the youthfulness of your friend group. Soon enough, you and your friends are gonna be all caught up with your careers or focused on growing a family or doing whatever you guys aspire to do with your future",

I am now 29.\n\nMy husband was living with his mom at 17, got his first job at 20, moved out when he was 22, jumped around a lot of minimum-wage jobs for six years before finally finding his niche. He is now 30.\n\nDespite having vastly different starts to our adult life, we both have steady well-paying jobs, have two children (my first, plus one more together), own a home, and have similar income in our bank accounts.\n\nThe early to mid-20s are so strange because people's life paths will take vastly different paths. Some people will mature quickly and throw themselves into adult life, even if it means just getting by with low financial resources. Others will ease into it, focussing more on their social life, or their education. If you graduate and don't contribute to the household finances and chores and aren't saving for the future, I'd be telling you that it's time to grow up, but because you are focussed on school, it's not that strange. Everyone is different at your age, just focus on your studies. :)",

The other half lived alone / rent their own apartment. The former group is mostly Americans and the latter group is mostly international student. I think it's probably because many international students who stay here either have well paid career or just have wealthy parents ( I know one girl whose parents paid her $4000/month to live in a luxury hotel downtown). Me personally, I moved out since 18 and have never looked back. My parents had drilled me about independence and being self made since 8th grade and I appreciated them a lot for it.",

I moved out, went to college in a different city for 4 years (6 hours from home), lived in the dorms for 2 years and in a different shitty living situation for years 3 & 4, and now I\u2019m on my own at 22 with a full-time job (well, full-time\npaid intern, but making decent money). \n\nI\u2019m proud of myself and everything I\u2019ve accomplished, but it\u2019s been a struggle. It was a slap in the face when I realized that hard work is rarely rewarded anymore. If you work hard than they just give you more work to do. I\u2019ve been an intern for a year and a half, and they keep extending instead of hiring me as an employee because of COVID which is understandable, but at this point I do the same work as everyone else does for a fraction of the salary. I lived in shitty situations because that was the best I could afford, and even that was $1000-$1300 a month. I\u2019m extremely jealous of people who still live in a nice house with their parents. I went months without eating much due to a lack of money. \n\nI wish I appreciated the time I had at home more. I wish I accepted my friends for who they were and not what I wanted them to be. I wish my mom still had the house so I could move back in. But I don\u2019t. I decided it was best to be independent at 18. It wasn\u2019t a bad choice, but don\u2019t let any boomer talk scare you. Moving out at 18 nowadays is stupid and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Don\u2019t be a lazy bum, but enjoy what you have and try to do the best you can in this fucked up crazy world.",

The trades are not a good idea for most people, but work for people who aren\u2019t necessarily the brightest but still want to make a livable wage. Growth generally stops in your mid 20s unless you found your own business.

I\u2019m planning on going to grad school (which will pay a stipend) but if I wanted to jump into industry about 90% of my program is employed by the end with an average starting salary of $70,000. For that pay off my chemE degree is significantly better than trade school. MechE, EE, etc, all see similar payoffs even if they\u2019re being eroded by predatory practices.\n\n\nYou seem to live in a fantasy where everyone is as sheltered and spoiled as you, but that is sadly not the case.
