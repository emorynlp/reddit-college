      "text": "A gap semester could be awesome, both for your mental health and for your career. If you have any connections at all at a facility somewhat in your field, you could get a job (they might even be willing to call you an intern), and get a keg up on your peers who are all fighting over summer internships. In my experience, most anything related to Manufacturing gets you brownie points for learning processes and safety, and it gives you lots of good interview answers for the future.",
