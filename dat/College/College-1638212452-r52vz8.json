  "text": "Like you have guesses and hopes but you still don't really know if it will all pan out like you want it to? My boyfriend never went to college and now he's 23 with a painting business and he's set. Great income, job security, stability.\n\nMeanwhile I'm graduating in 2023 and then I'm going to desperately apply for grad schools and I don't know if I'll even get into one in my state, or at all. And even though I have ideas of what I want to do after grad school who knows if I'll even be able to land a job. I might just end up back in food service like who the fuck knows. I don't live with family and I have to support myself and I just think it's stressful not knowing for certain what my future looks like.\n\nI love what I'm studying and I wouldn't change it for the world. Sometimes I just see the alternative and I wish it all could settle down faster.",
