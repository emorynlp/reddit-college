  "title:": "Does submitting your first draft make you a cocky person?",
  "text": "Whenever I do any type of writing assignment, I always only make a \"rough\" draft and submit it. Of course I actually edit it along the way, so I'm not submitting wrong syntax or grammatical/spelling errors. I'm not good at writing in general, so if I were to even revise it, I wouldn't know what to revise. Every time I have ever written a final draft, it ended up just being a copy and paste of my first draft. Using this method has gotten me perfect scores on every DWA (district writing assignment) in school and other various writing assignments.\n\nI was working on my college transfer applications with someone and they were astonished that I was going to submit it without getting it checked by professional help at school. I told them that I always submit my first draft, no need to stress out about it. They called me cocky and told me I'm so self-centered to think I don't need it revised. Is that actually a thing where you're considered cocky if your first draft is your final draft?",
