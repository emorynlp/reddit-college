For example, my school has a \"General Business Studies\" major which is what they call BA, but then they also have Accounting, MIS, Economics, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Global Business Management, HR, Management, and Marketing under their Business faculty.\n\nDo your research into those more specialized fields and see what interests you + what has solid career options after graduation. You'll be set.",
