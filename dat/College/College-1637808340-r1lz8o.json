If I don\u2019t write things down I forget about it so I\u2019m just wondering what the best way to go about all of this is. Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "Get yourself a calander or planner. I use a calendar for long term planning (test dates, paper due dates, breaks) and I do weekly check lists for short term planning (assignment due dates, classes, work, etc). If you plan things out you'll be much better off. \n\nAs far as notes go thats up to you. Personally I write all my notes put. As such I have seperate notebooks for all my classes. I know some people who print the PowerPoint slides ahead of class and will add notes to them. Really its about finding what works best for you and then replicating it (it may need some trial and error).",
