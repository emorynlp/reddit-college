  "text": "Today\u2019s a review day in class before our final exam, and a couple of my friends who are also doing well in the class have decided to skip. I was thinking about going out to lunch and studying a bit with my friend. I\u2019ve never skipped a class before so idk if this is okay. What are your thoughts?\n\nUpdate: I went to class and the professor offered me a job lol\n\nEdit since you asked: my teacher asked me if I was interested in being a writing tutor basically. Not the most exciting job in the world, but I am only happy about it because it\u2019s something I was thinking about trying one day (this is my first semester in college though, and I certainly didn\u2019t expect to get this job so soon). Thanks for the likes and comments! I appreciate the good advice! I\u2019ll try to think more responsibly in the future lol :)",
