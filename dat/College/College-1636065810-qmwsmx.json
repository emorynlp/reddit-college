  "title:": "What to do with Professors that are difficult to Understand. And why are they even hired in the first place?",
  "text": "So me and my friends have taken 2 classes in a row with Professors who aren't good at teaching. We've gotten through these courses using Youtube/Other Internet Resources/the Textbook.\n\nBoth of these professors are very smart in their field (based on research papers they have published and other impressive stuff they've done in their careers), so I guess they help the University by doing great research...but they are just not good communicators.\n\n1. Does the University just hire them because they are good researchers?  Did no one try to judge their teaching skills before hiring them?\n2. Why would they hire someone based solely on half of the job (research)?\n3. Can they not find people who are good at both (research and teaching)?",

They just care about money.\nIf you noticed the trend, university\u2019s care more about making money and prestige (which gets them more money) than actually teaching",

But...if you could have both, you grab it.  Then you end up with Christian McAffrey (he's good at running AND receiving, and is possibly the best RB in the NFL overall).\n\nSo why not find someone with both skills (research AND teaching)?  Is it that hard?",

Faculty are usually selected after a search committee reviews CVs, interviews candidates, and makes a recommendation up the chain as to who should get an offer. Accents don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t disqualify candidates who have exemplary research records - good scholars are good scholars no matter where they come from - and anyway, students should become accustomed to listening to and speaking with people who speak English as a second language because we live in a globalized society with people from all over the world working alongside each other in a variety of fields.\n\nWhen you say you can barely understand their accent, is this because you aren\u2019t used to people with accents? Many of us work with folks from other countries, and of the scores I\u2019ve talked to/conversed with/worked with, not a single one was difficult to understand. However, some students would complain about some of them having a \u201cthick accent\u201d because they weren\u2019t used to hearing it.",

In the former case, the jerk is making a choice to be a jerk and can easily just not be a jerk.\n\nIn the latter case, someone can\u2019t just snap their fingers and stop having an accent, nor does having an accent mean that they don\u2019t care about students or aren\u2019t good at their job.
