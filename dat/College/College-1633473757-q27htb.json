  "text": "So in my Theatre and Western Culture class, the whole thing is literally just the teacher talking. There\u2019s not even a PowerPoint or anything. I can\u2019t really focus like that. I can pay attention to what he\u2019s saying for like 40 seconds at a time, and I can\u2019t take notes while also taking in what he\u2019s saying, so then I can\u2019t take notes and then I have nothing to study. I\u2019ve talked to the professor about it and he said he won\u2019t change it because nobody else has had the same problem, so what do I do?",

Given a) your teachers stonewalling and b) your anxiety with other people and c) your inability to absorb the content in its current form, there's really nothing else you can do. There are drastic measures you could take but we won't go into those.    \n\n\nThe optimal solution would be to see if you can overhear anything about a class groupchat, or something and ask about joining, or arrange some note sharing arrangement.  Eventually you're going to have to address your social anxieties, and college is probably one of the best times to do so. How you go about that is up to you, but it seems clear that steps (even baby steps!) should be taken. Maybe mention to someone near you that the lectures are difficult to follow.
