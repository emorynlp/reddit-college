  "title:": "So\u2026 How do I explain to my parents, who both have high level degrees, that I want to be a first generation dropout\u2026.?",
  "text": "For reference, I\u2019m a junior pursuing a UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) degree. But more and more of my classes I\u2019m realizing are just manned aviation classes and I have no interest in those. I talked with my advisor/professor, and she think it would definitely end up better for me to drop out and go work, learning more in the industry than I could in classes. Following with that, I have nearly 6 figures worth of student loan debt because of the price of my school combined with the manned aviation classes I\u2019ve had to take. I definitely would rather work, doing something I love, learning and making money. Rather than continuing to go to school taking classes that I hate, and paying more for it. But, here\u2019s the massive problem, my dad has his PE (Professional Engineering) license, and my mom just completed her doctorates program at 43, and they have big expectations from me, and I don\u2019t know how to tell them that this is my plan.. I am definitely going to be getting a job with UAS before I drop out, so that might be able to help, but I\u2019m just so damn nervous to let them down, especially to disappoint my dad..\nSorry for how long this is, I\u2019m just so nervous about this..",
