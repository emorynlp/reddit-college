  "text": "I live in the dorm near my school. In the common area, there is a hole in the wall. According to my roommate (who is an RA), someone (who was an RA) in the past punched that hole due to stress and anger. She heard this from someone else. I tried to put in a maintenance request form through my dorm website. It is marked as complete but the hole is still in the wall. What do I do? Has this ever happen to anyone (and what did you do)?\n\nBTW: I put another maintenance request form for a shower issue a couple days later. It was fixed the next day.\n\nEdit:\nI put down that the walls might have asbestos even though I wasn't  sure about it.",

They should also have an asbestos inventory of all buildings to rapidly determine the presence of asbestos.  Stay safe.\n\nr/asbestoshelp",
