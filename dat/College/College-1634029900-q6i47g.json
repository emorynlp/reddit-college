  "title:": "Can An English Literature Major Get A Masters Degree In Linguistics?",
  "text": "So some context, I\u2019m in my sophomore year of college studying English Literature. In my college, my major is English and Translation, and I can choose a concentration in either Translation, Literature, and Linguistics.\n\nThey recently removed the Linguistics track (rip) which was the track I originally wanted, so I chose Literature instead.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m taking Translation, Linguistics, and Literature courses, my track is \u201cLiterature\u201d.\n\nIs there any way I can specialize in Linguistics after I graduate? I was hoping I\u2019d get a Masters degree in it instead of Literature because it isn\u2019t really what I want.\n\nDo I need to take a certain amount of Linguistics courses in order to qualify to specialize in it? Or do I have to start all over again and get an undergrad degree in Linguistics for that to work out?",

      "text": "I reckon it would probably be possible. Like I said to some other guy sometime ago, in most cases masters courses don\u2019t tend to recruit from people who did bachelors degrees in the subject, and in most cases they\u2019re too niche to turn down enthusiastic students from slightly different academic backgrounds. And IMO English Lit really isn\u2019t a bad foundation for a linguistics masters anyway, since you\u2019ll be familiar with analysing how language is used in texts.",
