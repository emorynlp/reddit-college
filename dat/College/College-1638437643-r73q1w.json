  "text": "Im in my third year of an engineering degree and there are so many courses that I'm not interested in. I feel like the only course I actually enjoy is thermodynamics. I wish I could somehow only take thermo. How does everyone manage to stay motivated in courses that are not that interesting?",

I use a Pomodoro timer and aim to have no weekdays where I've done no work on that particular subject. There will be days where you are more motivated and energetic than others, and those are the days where you get more done than usual.\n\nAlso, try to understand the appeal of what you are learning. Gathering interest sometimes takes some thought as to why you are learning it and why other people enjoy it.",
