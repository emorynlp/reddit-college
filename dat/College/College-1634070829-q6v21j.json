  "text": "Lol, gotta love it when the professor returns feedback on your essay and all they say is \"your essay is a little bit ambitious\".  Sir, please elaborate on that. I'd rather you tell me what is wrong with my essay so I can revise it for the final draft rather than just giving me a vague sentence. Gosh, I'm paying $1000+ per class for this???",

      "text": "Just throwing this out there as someone who knows nothing about your prof or the essay you wrote, but what your professor might mean is that you bit off more than you could chew and made an argument that deserves more attention than can be reasonably be given within the page maximum constraints of the assignment. \n\nIt can be either a complement or criticism (or both) depending on context. Like it can mean \"good or you for taking on such a challenging task\" or \"this is a bit much, please try to simplify this.\"\n\nObviously, though, you should go to office hours and ask your professor what he means, since clearly he didn't elaborate.",

      "text": "The scope of the essay is too broad, and/or you're undertaking more than you can effectively answer in an undergrad paper. \"Gender in human history\" is an 'ambitious' topic because it's too big for you to do it justice in 8-10 pages.\n\nAlso, just email your professor and ask what they mean and if they can help you.",
