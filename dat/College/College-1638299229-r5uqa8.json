So I just want to ask y'all what courses wil/didl you choose in college, what do you do in there, and what jobs can you get in there? TIA!",

      "text": "At my college, usually majors have required courses. For example, as a ce major, I'm required to take discrete math, and programming and data structures. I can technically take these whenever I want, but since they are prerequisites for my later algorithms class, it's better to take them as soon as possible. Same with calc ii, because that leads you to a number of classes CE majors are required to take. You can always look at the course guide and major requirements for choosing classes.",
