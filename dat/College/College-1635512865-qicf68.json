  "text": "I currently go to a top 50 school and I\u2019m looking to transfer to my state school. However my grades at my current school are not great I will probably being ending this semester with 2 C\u2019s and 2 A\u2019s and I also might have to withdraw from one of those classes if I did not pass the midterm. I\u2019m currently a freshman and I\u2019m hoping to transfer for fall 2022. I\u2019m involved in a few activities here and was very involved in high school. I was accepted to my state school my senior year but I will have to re-apply this year. I was wondering how bad my grades will impact my changes of getting in again, and if coming from a higher ranked school will make up for my this. Thanks for any help :)",

      "text": "Sounds like you have about a 3.5 GPA. Keep in mind a 3.5+ GPA is considered \"good\" at the college level, and is much better than a 3.5 high school GPA. That'd probably be good enough even if you were transferring from a low ranked school, tbh. \n\nThe actual classes you got the grades in might matter though, as will the programs you're applying to. I mean, if you took a super easy schedule your grades look worse than of you took a tough schedule. You don't have many undergrad credits yet, so UConn might look at some of your high school records too.\n\nChances are you'll be fine. I'd say there's only a slight chance you don't get in. \n\nGenerally speaking, good grades at a low tier school is always better than bad grades at a high tier school, but I don't think your grades are \"bad\" enough to be much of a problem.",
