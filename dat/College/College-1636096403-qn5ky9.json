  "text": "I just received the news literally 5 mins ago via email. 7:10am here so I have no clue who to talk to first. I just feel so..drained. Like, in one hand, made me question if it's my fault but on the other hand, it's not like I can control covid lockdowns. Anyway, I'm a failure now so why not tell reddit about it. Cheers, everyone.",
