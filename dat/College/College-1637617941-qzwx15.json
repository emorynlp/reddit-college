My professors were really accommodating and allowed me to work at my own pace with the stuff I was behind on but even with their understanding, I just constantly felt pressure. So, it just feels soo much better to not have that feeling anymore.",

If you'd compare your mental health before and after finishing your assignments, how do you feel? \n\nI feel like young people attribute not being able to get their assignments done to anxiety and depression when it's the other way around. The anxiety and depression comes from not getting assignments done.",
