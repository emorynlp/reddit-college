  "text": "I've never been decent at math. Not even okay at math. I'm not even sure what to do next. I'm going into a medical field, and luckily only have to take one math..but I can't even pass it. Halfway into the semester and I've failed 2 math tests so far. And have two more to go. All my other classes I've made A's in. But this..I feel so down low and depressed because I can't do this simple stuff. I already go to tutoring weekly. I study this material daily. But I'm retaining none. If I fail this, I won't make it into my program on time..what can I possibly do to pass this? Should I reach out to my professor and say anything? I'm at a loss.",

      "text": "This is going to sound harsh in writing but: tutoring for current material only is often not super helpful for someone who always struggled in math. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard \u201cmath builds on itself\u201d before, and to a large extent that\u2019s true. For example, people often struggle with calculus not because of the calculus itself but because their algebra is weak. (Or fractions, the number of calculus students I\u2019ve had that are losing points because they never learned how to add fractions by hand is astonishing.)  If there is anything missing in your background skills - and if you\u2019ve always struggled with math, then there is - THAT is what needs fixing before you can layer your current classwork on top of it. \n\nIf you have a good relationship with your prof/TA/the school tutoring center, you can ask them to help you figure out what background skills you\u2019re missing. HOWEVER, be aware that that\u2019s a specialized skill that not everyone is trained in (it requires a lot of inside knowledge on diagnostic assessment and K-12 curriculum), and they may not have the materials or the time to work with you one on one long-term. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend Khan Academy. Go all the way back to the beginning (the beginning-beginning, I mean it) and take a run through. You\u2019ll probably fly through material at first, and that\u2019s great, but the second you\u2019re not sure about WHY something works, never mind the HOW, that\u2019s when you slow down and start watching the explanation videos. \n\nYou always have the option of finding a tutor to speed up the process, either by itself or as a supplement to KA (shameless advertisement side note: yes this is my specialty and yes I am taking new clients), but everybody\u2019s timeline and budget are different and doing it yourself is also totally fine. Best of luck!",

You can't memorize a bunch of crap at the last minute and spit it back out for math.. \n\nYou gotta do math. You learn math by doing math problems AND understanding \"why\"? Every single time you solve a problem, ask yourself \"what if it was this?\" or \"why doesn't this work?\"\n\nUnderstand math, don't memorize it.",
