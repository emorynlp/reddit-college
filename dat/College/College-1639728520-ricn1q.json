  "text": "Hi y'all, \n\nSo I have been attending community college and was told after this semester I would be able to receive an associates degree by the end of the semester. I submitted my application back in august and was told that in a few weeks I would have my answer. Well, I got my application denied and was told that if I thought there were any mistakes to have the evaluation specialist to re-look. So she did, and after reviewing she told me that I am done but missed the deadline and can not graduate this semester. At this point I don't care if I commence, I just want my diploma at this point. Is there anything that I can do to dispel this dispute? I honestly think it's BS because I've worked so hard to get this and am moving next month and won't even be in town next semester. Thank you!",
