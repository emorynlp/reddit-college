  "text": "I am currently in the final year of my BSc, with a major in psychology and a minor in biology. My current GPA is 2.967. I want to apply to some master's programs or any programs that would allow me to get in a job that pays at least 70k a year (prefer health care). Any ideas on what careers path/programs I can take. I am a Canadian student, so I would like to program/career path to be in Canada but would not mind going to the States to do my studies.\n\nThank you",
