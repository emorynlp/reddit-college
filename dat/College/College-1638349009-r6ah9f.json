  "title:": "I've decided I'm doing a personal political hard reset",
  "text": "I had a realization recently.  I don't really know very much.  What I do know could likely be very wrong.  Right now I'm in my 20's, I've lived independently for only a handful of years and hardly have any world experience.  I don't even have my own life figured out yet, let alone have the capacity to try to figure out my country.  I haven't read enough books that are challenging and complicated and are written by intelligent people.  My passion heavily outweighs my knowledge.  \n\nSo, I'm resetting.  I'm not voting, I'm not talking about it because I don't want to speak what could be a lie or comment on things I don't know enough about.  I have a lot to do.  Maybe once I get a bit older and wiser and read a lot more I can manage a couple of political opinions.\n\nEDIT: If anyone is interested, I think my first bit of self educating is to read up on Soviet Russia.  At least then I will have a good degree of information on what NOT to do.",

      "text": "By not voting, you're basically shifting your power to other people to make an informed judgement on your behalf. That is not necessary a bad thing, but it does require that you have faith in your community to do the right thing and they may be just as uninformed as you are.\n\nThat being said when people vote that can indirectly affect politics as well. Senior citizens tend to vote in larger numbers than people in their early twenties, and so politicians will cater more government resources and attention to senior citizens. If more young adults voted, then there would be more political effort going to address the needs of young adults since they would be a demographic worth courting.\n\nThat being said, as a voter you're hiring a person to be your representative and there are elements of that which do not necessarily require a strong political opinion. Voting for a candidate to fulfill a non-partisan role, like sewer, may boil down to choosing the candidate who actually appears to care for doing the job and has credentials that would help in that regard.",

But I really agree with you on the rest. I studied politics and wanted to work in the field, but I got very burnt out from everyone shouting their ideas as facts and arguing all the time even if we agree on things. It\u2019s draining and turned me completely away from politics. Now if someone talks about it I just smile and agree with them, or politely ask to change the subject. I still have my opinions ( just like everybody else) but they don\u2019t fit into the average persons norm. Sometimes I agree with a person I don\u2019t usually like, sometimes I think the other party has a good idea, sometimes I think \u201cmy party\u201d is doing something dumb\u2026 and I find that people in my life absolutely can not handle opinions like that lol",

I don\u2019t vote unless I have time to educate myself first- which as a college student is basically never because we\u2019re so busy. Voting ignorantly is wasteful. I don\u2019t want to contribute to the already ridiculous amount of uneducated voting.",

I say this because over the past few years I've come to understand how much I *don't* know, and it's been a better attitude to have than the teenage mindset of thinking you know everything and are \"so mature for your age\". Good on you for wanting to figure out your own path!",

Voting with your feet gives you absolute control. Of course there are also people that, whether they admit it or not, actually enjoy having stuff to complain about and don't truly care enough to go somewhere else that has less of those issues.",
