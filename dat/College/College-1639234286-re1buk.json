      "text": "Just stop filling out ones with broad qualifications. The pool of applicants is too large and you would actually have a better expected value (EV) buying a scratch card. Over the last ten years everyone has started using the internet to find scholarships. 10% of them, the ones that come up first on Google, probably get 90% of the applications.\n\nLook at local organizations like rotary clubs, social clubs, smaller non-profits, your parent's employers and anything they are a member of. Also anything that limits applicants to a minority (disability, race, LGBTQ, single parent, etc.) because those will naturally get far fewer applicants.",

      "text": "Scholarship committees lie or are secretive and never tell you why they give students the scholarship. The reason I won my scholarship back in 2015, and boy it was a lot of money,  is because somehow they knew I helped out my classmates with a computer programming assignment for AP computer science, I did bug fixing. Yeah it has nothing to do with my grades or my essay. I live with intp lunatics and ego maniacs.\n\nIf you need a scholarship I would advise you that people who wins don't always deserve it, life isn't fair.",
