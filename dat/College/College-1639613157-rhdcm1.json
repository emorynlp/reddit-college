  "title:": "Feel like I am missing out on college experience",
  "text": "Hi there, I am currently a freshman at a 2 year college and I am looking to transfer to a 4 year institution next fall. After the first semester I am exhausted and I absolutely hate the college I am at. I have zero friends, I am still stuck at home and everyday feels the same. Just go to class go home do work and repeat. I see all my friends from high school looking like they are having great times at 4 year schools and I am just stuck here. \n\nI am ready to transfer, but I feel like even after I transfer I would have missed out on many opportunities. Many friend groups would have already been made already. I was hoping to live in dorms to meet people next fall , but they might not even be available to transfers students depending on spots available.\n\nEveryone tells me college is supposed to be this great time. But it feels absolutely terrible. I absolutely hate my current situation and I may end not having any friends the next year. \n\nI could have gone to another 4 year school, but I really wanted to go this specific one so I went to a 2 year school, but now I absolutely regret it and missed out on so many things.",

      "text": "I really feel you bro and a lot of college freshmen at 2 years feel this. If you are able to transfer next semester or next fall I assure you you\u2019ll be able to find friends and integrate into a group. As adults friend groups aren\u2019t as rigid as high school I\u2019ve noticed. There\u2019s always gonna be that fomo but eventually it won\u2019t be as strong of a feeling. You\u2019ll get there",
