  "text": "Honestly I am stressed I really dislike not being financially stable. I literally only have a dollar in my account credit cards are maxed. I have to pay for my car note and car insurance, pay off an old apartment, phone bill, and pay for tuition that wasn\u2019t covered by loans. My credit isn\u2019t good enough to get a small loan. I don\u2019t have a job right now because I thought I was supposed to start next Wednesday but that changed. I am so stressed right now and it\u2019s not going to get any better because I\u2019m pre med so I have a long road of being broke. Does anyone have any advice or tips how to get out of this situation.",
