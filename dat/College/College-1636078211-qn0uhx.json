  "title:": "Should I go to school in Hawaii or Texas?",
  "text": "I'll get GI bill benefits starting next year and was wondering if I should go to which place to finish a Master degree?\n\nI'll get paid more in hawaii in benefits and my parents are there but texas also has free college for veterans when my gi bill expires for the bachelor degree so I plan to transfer to Texas after undergrad school.\n\n\nBut the main problem is that this whole China Taiwan drama got me  scared that Hawaii might not be the safest place to be in when a conflict arises and with what I read online it could happen by 2025 and I don't wanna be stuck in a 40 mile wide island when missiles start getting launched but then again finishing undergrad in hawaii will take me to 2026 so I was wondering if it would be smarter to do 2 years community college in hawaii and then go to Texas school for 4 years but I would also get paid less in gi bill benefits and font have the luxury of living with family at Texas",

Both countries are too financially dependent to directly fight each other.\n\nTalking about Masters and job opportunities post college, Texas trumps Hawaii though if you're only focusing on that.",

I would definitely say you gonna have a lot more options and a lot more opportunities for career development. Also the cost of living in Texas is less expensive than that of Hawaii. I also did my entire undergrad at the same university as well and I just enjoyed it so much I decided to continue my masters with my school. But definitely just give it some thought I can\u2019t tell you much about it for the point of Hawaii.",
