  "text": "Neglected math in high school , but still good at it , though not the highest scorer. And well, I really enjoyed biology (highest scorer too, literally published a paper) but things change, and now I wanna study economics.\n\nBut I feel that my high school will come to bite me back and there is no way I can ever be a great student at economics and math double major in college. Should I drop the idea? College for me will start in August I think?",
