  "title:": "Should I just not take the midterm?",
  "text": "My mental health has not been the best this year, and finding any motivation to do even the most basic tasks is difficult. I just started the process of counseling, but it's too early for it to have any improvement. I have a midterm in a couple of days, and I'm absolutely dreading taking it. I don't feel confident about the subject. I don't want to put myself through 2 straight days of non-stop studying, and I know that in order to pass it, I'll basically have to physically exhaust myself. My professor is dropping our lowest exam grade, and I know I'm more confident about the later test subjects (I've learned them in a past class). I know it's probably not the smartest thing to do, but it's very tempting to email my professor and ask if I can just not take the exam. Any advice?",

Even a 5% is better than a 0%, so you should still try to take it if the grade gets dropped.\n\nThese are the moments where you really have to push yourself in college even if you have no motivation. You don\u2019t want to let yourself fall into bad habits.",

I spent maybe half an hour total skimming the PowerPoints/notes, and then took it.\n\nI wrote what answers I thought I knew, scribbled in what I didn\u2019t, and just let it all go overall. I knew if I skipped I would already have a zero, so it was almost guaranteed I\u2019d do better than that.\n\nSo knowing I\u2019d do better than expected regardless, I was able to let myself not stress, but also help myself just a bit more than I wanted to.",

      "text": "Absolutely still take it. If he's going to drop the lowest mark, then it doesn't matter if you bomb it. Study only as much as your able to. Just learn the basic ideas. I don't agree with skipping tests even if they drop the lowest mark, because profs still make mistakes. Sometimes one can be far easier than the others. You might be able to get more out of it than you think. And you're not the only one feeling overwhelmed. I am constantly surprised by doing average on tests I thought everyone knew more than me about.",
