  "title:": "A Former Student\u2019s Top Tips for College",
  "text": "As a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven\u2019t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. \n\n1. Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. \n\nI would say I talked to about 50% of the people in my classes (about class size of 40) and got to know about 5 people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. \n\n2. Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. \n\nPut in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. \n\n3. Learn to read PDFs on your computer. \n\nI didn\u2019t buy a college text book in 4 of the 5 years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still 95% the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. \n\n4. Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. \n\nRight before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board \n\n5. Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. \n\nOver the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. \n\n\nI hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!\n\n\nEdit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn\u2019t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.\n\nSo here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is 10 states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some.",

      "text": "Oh wow this is very helpful! I used to hide behind \"but I have social anxiety!\" (and I do, I take meds for it), but the more I have got out of my shell, the more natural it comes to me, like talking to people and trying new things.\n\nJust one question.\n\n>When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for.\n\nSo, I originally thought networking was connecting with professionals already in the industry (like professors or maybe even GSIs, hiring managers at job fairs, etc.), so is it students too? Even if they are your same age or maybe a year younger or older?\n\nI've actually made a pretty large number of new friends already, some of these friends will be in my classes this week, is that considered networking? I ask because I thought networking was more about meeting people in the industry you want to get into, and connecting with them? How exactly can students help with networking? Also, would joining clubs/organizations on campus (such as radio, newspaper, etc.) be considered networking?",

          "text": "I would consider anytime you talk to some person more than once networking. So yes all those friends are great connections. Make sure to add them on LinkedIn preferable but also add them on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp\u2019s, or whatever the kids are using now days. The more they see you the more they will remember who you are Incase something pops up. I would even argue that students are the most important and easiest connection you can make. So in my case my buddies boss asked him if he knew anybody who\u2019s skills matches this position they had and who was worth a damn. Since I worked with him multiple times on group projects and studied with him though-out college, he knew what kind of worker I was and I would be great for the job. He gave his boss my resume and I actually skips some of the interview steps to go to the main interview. It is also hard to get into some top companies or desired jobs with out a recommendation from an employee. A student who worked with you also will be more likely to recommend you. Also older students who are farther along in their studies than you would be better because they will be working at that company awhile before they graduate so their recommendations would mean more. \n\nNow I\u2019m not saying professors/industry contacts/hiring managers as connections are not important, because they can also help you get a good job. My point is that you know/come into contact with a lot more students than professors/industry contacts/hiring managers, which means you have more connections in much more locations. \n\nI could go on so much more about connections but I may just have to make another post.",

Just add as many people as you know on their so when you do have something to put on their they will see it. \n\nI had that mindset and I didn\u2019t create one until grad school and there were so many people I forgot about and many people who forgot about me. The sooner you have one the better. College students are more likely to add you when they first create a LinkedIn then when they have a job and never check it.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in my senior year and I have a few tips that have helped me to maintain a 4.0 with as little stress as possible.\n\nOnce you have the syllabi from all of your classes make an excel folder. In this folder you will put each day of class on the left and then you\u2019ll list the class names on the top row. Fill in all of the important things like assignment due dates, tests, and projects due. Make sure you look at this at least once every few days so nothing creeps up on you.\n\nI always schedule my classes Monday through Thursday which gives me a 3 day weekend. I use my Friday\u2019s to an advantage as I use this day to do all of my homework for the upcoming week. This means I don\u2019t have to worry about doing homework the night before class. All I have to worry about during the week is studying or reading etc.\n\nA way that I\u2019ve been able to maintain my grades is by keeping up with my grades. I calculate my own class grades with my assignments and tests. This helps me to focus as a semester goes on. If I see I have such a high average that I only need a 80 on the final to get an A then I study less on this class and if I see I need a 95+ then I study much harder for this class.",

Back in high school I barely talked to anyone and my freshman year of college I was the same way. I would literally go to my classes and not talk to anyone. Funny story: I didn\u2019t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy. Now I know you will be asking how did I get to this point. Well I was told by someone close to me at the sophomore year that to be successful you must be able to communicate and network with people. So at the start of my sophomore year I started my attempt to network. I started small like sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class. I would ask them how there weekend was and how there other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we talk every week even though he is 10 states away. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some. \n\nAnd clubs definitely help. I joined my first club in my masters degree and I wish I done it sooner. I met about 8 guys that I hung out with all the time.",

          "text": "Don\u2019t worry I have been in that position before also. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys peace and quite and I committed an hour to school everyday. Back in high school I barely talked to anyone and my freshman year of college I was the same way. I would literally go to my classes and not talk to anyone. Funny story: I didn\u2019t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy. Now I know you will be asking how did I get to this point. Well I was told by someone close to me at the sophomore year that to be successful you must be able to communicate and network with people. So at the start of my sophomore year I started my attempt to network. I started small like sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class. I would ask them how there weekend was and how there other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we talk every week even though he is 10 states away. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps.",

There\u2019s definitely a lot of rush and pressure for me to find a career, especially since I\u2019m still only 17. Have you felt like this at one point? What mindset should one have after finishing college?",

I wanted to take the summer off to do a learn some other non career related skills. I also took this time to find a job that I was not stuck in a cubical and I would enjoy doing. This is where the networking came in. I contacted my friends and asked them what there job was like and if there was any open positions they could recommend me for. Since I stayed and got my masters, my friends from undergrad had been working a year so they were really helpful. My advice would be do as much as possible to give you leverage when looking for a job. I did study abroad, had outstanding recommendations, had a masters degree, and had a high gpa where I could look for a job I liked and they would want to hire me. I have felt down and lost before when college started but when my classes started I figured out what I liked to do and ran with it. I hope this helps.",

Make friends, go out, have yourself the best time. College is a once in a life time choice and I noticed you said you were only 17. I\u2019m graduating this semester and if I could do undergrad again I would 10 times over because I loved it so much. If there\u2019s opportunities like free lunch in the quad or tours definitely take them. Like OP said, connections, connections, connections. I also can\u2019t stress that enough. The more people and friends you meet the more pleasant the next 4 years will be. Leave your room, get out, and just have fun. It looks like your excited and have a positive outcome already so that\u2019s awesome. \n\nAgain, don\u2019t worry too much now about jobs. That will come later.",
