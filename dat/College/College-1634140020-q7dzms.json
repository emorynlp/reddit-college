  "text": "So I am a freshman anthropology major taking a poli sci course that doesn\u2019t matter for my major and I despise it. I already withdrew from the course but I\u2019m just wondering if that was a big mistake? Will it affect job offers in the future? I withdrew in good standing and just despised the class. Any advice is appreciated but I am freaking out about it lol.",
