  "text": "I wrote a 20 page honors thesis to graduate with honors in my major, but based on this semester, I doubt my grades this semester will still be above the gpa requirement. This is my last semester. I\u2019m so frustrated that this paper will have to go to waste. It only took me 3.5 years to graduate, but I really don\u2019t want to stay another semester. At least doing this paper did count as a separate class, even if I don\u2019t graduate with the honors in my major, but still\u2026",

Once you're in, if it's like my school, that means you attended seminars with your cohort, got to know professors one on one, worked on research, and wrote a thesis. Those are huge accomplishments!",

If graduating with an honors degree is a definite goal of yours, you say you're super close to the requirements, would you be able to take a couple elective classes next semester and boost your GPA, then graduate in the spring?\n\nI'm sure you could speak with your academic advisor and explain.",
