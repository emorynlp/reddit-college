  "text": "Hey, y'all!\n\nI'm currently enrolled in an online (**DO NOT DO ONLINE STUDIES**) CDI Cyber Sec course (Was labelled as self-paced, but it's not) and I'm really struggling. I started off great, but recently, I've been very overworked at work 60hrs a week, and it impacted my studying.\n\nI'm really really struggling to focus on the coursework, staying motivated, or even just retaining the info. I am understanding the material (most of the time) but then when it comes time to doing the labs, or taking the tests I can't remember a damn thing. It's almost as if I didn't learn anything (Legit can't recall anything if you asked me to set up a VLAN or what OSPF is I wouldn't be able to tell you), and it's really discouraging.\n\nIt has gotten to the point now where I have deferred/change study cohort my studies three times to catch up, but now I'm reading the material and I just don't understand any of it, its seriously like gibberish to me and very demotivating, it makes me feel so incredibly stupid.\n\nI reached out to the TA and they gave me a tutorial session on a subject, but it didn't really help.  \n\n\nAlso, is it normal to only get a % back on exams with no indication on what questions you got wrong, or what you lost marks on? We legit do get no feedback (See pic below). I asked what I got wrong, and what I was missing, but after two months, I've given up. (How do I got from high 80s to failing the project?)  \n\n\n[results from my last coursework load. This was before I started working so much.](https://preview.redd.it/p7ud6qaudvr71.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=212c5f4c43c7c6a327c5ccf26e57856b8836aee8)\n\nI guess I'm asking for some support really, some tips or suggestions on how to cope with the mountain of incredibly boring technical reading, or just staying focused?",

      "text": "Quit your job. 60 hours a week isn't even sustainable if it's the only thing you're doing. I don't give a shit how 'good' the money is. \n\nYour job will only be worth it if the money outweighs the cost lost to failed courses. It's like super duper crystal clear that it's affecting your grades. \n\nTell your boss it's not working. Refuse 60 hour weeks. Quit your job. I absolutely hate jobs that routinely rely on overtime and poise it as an employee benefit.",
