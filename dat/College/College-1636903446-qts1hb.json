  "text": "Hey! So I want to go to college for an associates (later bachelors) in early childhood education. The thing is I am HORRIBLE at math\u2026 could anyone tell me just how much math is involved and how difficult it is? Also I plan to go 100% online since I work full-time. <\u2014 yes I copy pasted my old post lol. But this time I want to know specifically about GMC! \n\nI currently have a college in mind but it doesn\u2019t hurt to keep searching right? And GMC was my first choice but I\u2019m still unsure. If anyone who has gotten their early childhood education degree (associates or bachelors) and preferably 100% online could dm me about the math involved and just how difficult it is, I would appreciate it greatly!\n\nSorry if this is all over the place I\u2019m kind of rushing for something rn LOL \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "I know this is a little it late but I currently go there 100% online and I think the math courses are very good as long as you get a good professor. Stay away from Professor Angles if you can. She is the worst professor I have ever had. The math classes I took always provided video examples for the material and I never even had to open the textbook. There is lots of homework and practicing it too. I am not good at math either and I got 90+ in both pre-calculus and algebra. Overall I like the program and it is quite easy for the most part except for the science courses. They are brutal. You are given a textbook and told to read certain chapters and then you have a lab and a quiz due at the end of the week. I am taking physics right now and it is so hard that I am going to have to withdraw from it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",
