  "text": "Hey! So I want to go to college for an associates (later bachelors) in early childhood education. The thing is I am HORRIBLE at math\u2026 could anyone tell me just how much math is involved and how difficult it is? Also I plan to go 100% online since I work full-time. <\u2014 yes I copy pasted my old post lol. But this time I want to know specifically about GMC! \n\nI currently have a college in mind but it doesn\u2019t hurt to keep searching right? And GMC was my first choice but I\u2019m still unsure. If anyone who has gotten their early childhood education degree (associates or bachelors) and preferably 100% online could dm me about the math involved and just how difficult it is, I would appreciate it greatly!\n\nSorry if this is all over the place I\u2019m kind of rushing for something rn LOL \ud83d\ude2d",
