  "text": "Hi my college people. I have come to seek advice. Has anyone of you ever worked full time while working on your bachelor's thesis? My classmate is doing his thesis on control systems or something and said it is very tough. He advised me to concentrate solely on my thesis. I, however, received a job offer and I really do feel like taking it up for the experience and most importantly, the money. So before making any decisions, I would like to seek the advice of redditors in this forum. Thank you.",

But if the offer is really good and you are ready for the difficulties and lack of sleep (most likely), then you should at least try.",
