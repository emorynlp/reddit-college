  "text": "My weight was going up and down before college due to my ED. This is my second semester and the number on my scale is determining my self worth. If I am in binging period I feel pathetic and withdraw from socializing because I feel like I am not good enough. It\u2019s so hard to deal with it. My weight loss goals are dramatic and I am afraid I will never feel good about myself. Or feel confident to meet more people :(",

      "text": "You aren\u2019t pathetic. First off, college alone is so damn mentally, emotionally and physically TAXING. I could only imagine trying to cope while sorting through an ED. My best advice is seek resources on campus so you can receive professional help that can actually make the difference. This isn\u2019t to compare at all, but when my mental health and ADHD took a turn for the worse last fall I felt hopeless. Grades trash, brain trash and I felt worthless. Seeking out places on campus to assist I think was my biggest turn out. Shit is still hard but I am managing. You can do this and much more than what you see on the scale.",

It\u2019s really destroyed my confidence and my relationships with friends and others too. \nOn top of that I\u2019m in my final year of college, graduating in 5 months and all the stress is just exacerbating my bulimia \ud83d\ude2d",
