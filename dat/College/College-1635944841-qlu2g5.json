  "title:": "Is 6 classes per semester (14 weeks) doable for a STEM student?",
  "text": "So some background information: I am a computer science student, 5 out of the 6 classes I want to register for have mildly good teachers. With that said there is supposed to be a substantial amount of work to be done in all of them. However, I do not have to work or support a family, but I do have a lot of interests outside of school that let me learn way more than I would by taking the 6th class that I could attach next semester. Should I just take 5 classes or will 6 be doable?\n\nEDIT... These 6 classes will be 18 credit hours: 1 python course, a more in depth C++ course, 1 Statistics, 1 UNIX course, 1 excel course, and a web development course.",

A lecture-based class that meets for about 3 hours per week (typically three 1-hour classes MWF or 2 1.5-hour classes T/R) will probably be 3 credit hours. Lab time generally only counts for 1 credit hour per 2 hours in lab. Homework and outside of class study/work load is not factored into the number of credit hours a class is worth.",
