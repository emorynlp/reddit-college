  "text": "I met this girl in college and at first we seemed to hit it off really well but these last months she only reaches out to me to ask for help and doesn't even answer my texts. Today she asked me for help with a project and I told her I'm busy so she should just text me what questions she had. She said she'll wait for me to be available (she obviously wants to video call me for hours and tell her the answers like last time).\nWhat do I say? I'm not going to waste my time in helping someone when she never helps me. Any advice is welcome \u2764\ufe0f",

Good luck!\u201d \n\nOr even just a:\n\n\u201cHey, I know I\u2019ve been able to help before but I honestly can\u2019t help you with this class anymore. I know that you\u2019ll be able to figure it out, good luck!\u201d \n\nNo is a complete sentence and you do not have to give a list of reasons to justify your decision to not help.",
