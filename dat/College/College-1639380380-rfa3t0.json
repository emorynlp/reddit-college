  "text": "I have been going to community college the last year and half and have been paying out of pocket to avoid loans, but recent financial change has made that impossible for the upcoming school year. In addition to that I will no longer be at a community college, I will be transferring to a university to finish my degree. \nDoes anyone have any recommendations for students that do not have the option to utilize parent plus loans? I\u2019m not sure how everything works because I\u2019m a first generation student and I would appreciate all the help I can get. I had to take this semester off because I was basically panicking about what to do for the amount that was due for out of state tuition.",

      "text": "Federal subsidized loans. Which you should have been using in the first place.\n\nIf you have cash to pay tuition then you should take the federal subsidized loans and put the same amount of cash in a high yield savings account. Makes financial sense to do this for at least years 1 and 2. Maybe 3 depending on the HYSA rate you can get. When you graduate you pay it off before the first month of interest. The interest from the HYSA will cover the 1% disbursement fee and give you a few hundred dollars of extra cash.",
