Depends who you are as a person, if you got other interests or not, those aren\u2019t my interests so if those are your only two interests then I probably won\u2019t find you interesting. Depends who your talking to as well. Some people might judge you tho.",

I didn't end up joining (I wanted to but I had literally no time for it) but I was pleased as punch that they asked me, and probably still would've been even if I hadn't been into anime. Anyone who judges someone based on their interests or what clubs they're in is a garbage person who should join the garbage club, you do you.",
