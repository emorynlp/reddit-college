  "text": "Hello.  I am looking for impartial opinions on whether or not I should transfer back to my old school\n\nFreshman year i went to school A.  It was located in a great area, had more academic programs and was very cheap.  I found that the social scene was selective and it was very boring most weekends for me but I found amazing friends that I still am in contact with.  I would also have people to live with off campus junior year.  They have a BA and BS for my major as well.  \n\nI am now a first semester sophomore at school B.  A smaller school with a much better reputation, closer to home, with a much better social scene.  I don't have as many closer friends but I fell into a living situation for junior year but I still don't know them that well.  I have a great job on campus here and can get an internship much easier here.  The price was a bit more but nothing extreme but I HATE the town that the campus is in.  They also only have a BA for my program.  \n\nMy concerns are that people will think I am quitting before even giving it a chance and that transferring twice will hurt my grad school application.  I know it is just a blink in time and I should know which aspects of college I value most but I don't.  Therefore I decided to take it to reddit lol.",
