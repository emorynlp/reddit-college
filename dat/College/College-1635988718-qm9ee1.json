  "text": "it made me so happy when i met with my chem advisor today and she could tell immediately from my majors and minors what career im aiming for. it was just this little throwaway part of our entire conversation but it made me feel so reassured that im headed in the right direction.\n\nshe also mentioned that she's advised forensic chem majors that wanted to be medical examiners before so it was nice to know she has prior experience and can be like this primary resource i can check in with every now and then \n\n(she also has a really comforting and positive energy which isn't like a requirement for a good advisor but it made me feel relaxed)",
