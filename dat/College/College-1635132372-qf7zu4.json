  "title:": "Lonely student living off-campus: should I DM freshman students to make friends?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently an international student (freshman) living off-campus. I\u2019m almost two months in, and I barely have any friends. I feel super lonely and depressed, I honestly don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, I hung out with a group of friends but I quickly realized we don\u2019t have a common ground. They quickly picked up on it and stopped inviting me to their hangouts. Even when I suggested to do things like hiking, they\u2019d completely dismiss me. I feel super lonely seeing them meet new people everyday, living the dorm experience. And before you say it, I tried getting to know students in my classes but that\u2019s the only time we talk and though they\u2019re sweet, they don\u2019t seem interested to hang out. I\u2019ve also joined a club but haven\u2019t found luck yet; most of the people I met were sophomores who have already formed their social circles.\n\nI\u2019ve been occasionally hanging out with my sisters friends but they\u2019re graduating soon anyway, and it doesn\u2019t help my loneliness either. I hear them recalling instances of their freshman year, the funny encounters, and it saddens me that I don\u2019t have any stories to tell (sorry if this sounds cheesy). Now halloween is soon, their schedules are packed with parties, and i\u2019m embarrassed to say that i don\u2019t have any plans or someone to hang out with.\n\nI wish I could live off campus but I don't want to overwhelm my father with the dorm fees + tuition fees.\n\nI found some cool freshman students on instagram that I feel like I\u2019d get along with and thought of dming them and telling them that I live off campus so I\u2019ve been trying to meet new people. I feel like now is the perfect chance since we\u2019re only 2 months in but I don\u2019t want to come off as creepy. I\u2019ve told my sister the idea and she called me lame for it, and that we should at least have something in common. I honestly don\u2019t know how to go on about it, and as embarrassing as it sounds, I\u2019m desperate for friends. I don\u2019t want to spend the next 4 years of my life like this. There are just so many things I want to do but I don\u2019t have friends to do it with and it just depresses me.",

Just introduce yourself and say how you are trying to meet new people and if they would like to grab a coffee or something.\n\n\nBumble also has a friends mode if you want to try that out too.",

Just introduce yourself and make the message have some substance (I'm <name>, I live off campus and am looking for friends. I like doing <things>) The way you write here makes you come across as pretty friendly. Just be you and don't worry about saying too much.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "It\u2019s kinda hard to introduce it without sounding odd too, you should probably lead with something like \u201cHey, you\u2019re from my __________ class right\u201d and then lead into questions you may have (or make up just to keep the conversation going). That\u2019ll probably come off as more natural than \u201cHello, I am ____, I do _____\u201d if that makes sense. Good luck to OP either way",
