  "text": "I didn\u2019t even know this was allowed. I wasn\u2019t doing well in a class so I put my psychology extra credit points (we got 1point for each study we participated in toward any psych class) towards her class. She even reminded us to do it. She said she didn\u2019t understand the website or something so she just didn\u2019t accept anyones extra credit points. Didn\u2019t bother to tell us. I could\u2019ve distributed them to go up a letter grade in my other classes but I wanted to make sure I passed hers. Now I have a D in her class(68%) a 78 and 79 in two of my other classes. I\u2019m pissed.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a Prof, and I have a few thoughts about this situation. \n\nBut let me preface this by saying that unless there is a VERY GOOD REASON for not honoring an assignment, I STRONGLY disagree with what your professor did and am always careful with the battles I pick. If it helps my student, I\u2019m usually happy to do it. That being said:\n\nTL;DR - Only escalate if absolutely necessary, be respectful, remember that you have a reputation too, the syllabus is very important, extra credit is a grey area, you\u2019d be surprised by the consequences of not following directions, and you\u2019re likely being paid to be there, not paying to be there\u2026 but I\u2019m rooting for you!\n\n1. Only escalate if absolutely necessary, and if you have an airtight case. Escalation should be a last resort, because depending on the higher-ups you\u2019re dealing with, it could backfire on you, and unless you\u2019ve exhausted your other avenues, you may be sent back to the instructor. The higher up will document everything as well, and if it\u2019s a program that you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time in (I.e. a major rather than just a GE or elective), such documentation can be used against you in the future, should you encounter another situation\u2026 reputations do swing both ways. \n\n2. I\u2019m not sure if a syllabus would hold up in a court of law, but unless you actually end that far up the ladder, it is, for all intents and purposes, a contract\u2026 the syllabus is the king document\u2026 the (TW: I mention an asshole here) \u201cTrump card,\u201d of all things. It\u2019s like the terms of service of the class, and unless there is something in it that directly violates college policies (as outlined in your college catalogue), expect to be held to it. Your continued enrollment in the class is your acceptance of those terms, regardless of if you read them or not. This also goes both ways too\u2026 the prof is expected to hold their side of the bargain, and can\u2019t just change it Willy-Nilly\u2026 in my syllabi, I do express that, if necessary, I reserve the right to make adjustments, but only to benefit the students (such as cancelling an assignment, making my grading scale more lenient). But again, if what your prof did violates the syllabus, you have a leg to stand up on. \n\n3.  Extra credit is always discretionary on the instructor\u2019s part\u2026 it sucks to admit, but the terms and conditions governing extra credit might be different than other assignments. For example, while your teacher may have a late policy for all \u201crequired\u201d assignments, they don\u2019t have to adhere to that same policy for extra credit work. Even though your final grade rides on it, a higher up might not see your complaint as valid because the work was extra credit. Sucks, but true.\n\n4. If you decide to pursue fighting this situation, please do so very respectfully\u2026 going in \u201cguns blazing\u201d (sorry for the analogy) will NOT help your case. Ask for clarification, try to understand your profs side of the story, and make a plea that while you know it\u2019s always past the term, that your request should be considered. Going in with an accusatory term, crying \u201cthat\u2019s not fair!\u201d (NEVER use that phrase, unless the prof damn near are your firstborn!), and threatening to take it up the chain of command won\u2019t help you\u2026 being humble, willing to understand their side of the story, and respectfully requesting leniency almost always works. \n\n5. Contrary to what another person on here said, most colleagues I know give a HUGE CARE about their students and only want to help. You\u2019ll encounter the old, crusty, boomer-prof who has been there 20 years too long, but most seriously want to help. But we also need to hold you to a standard because that affects all of us (a schools reputation even), so while hard work is recognized, it must also be accurate and demonstrate your knowledge of the course subject. I\u2019ve actually seen teachers lose their jobs for not adequately covering material/assessing a students understanding of said material.\n\n6. If you want to talk about myths, the whole \u201cI paid to be here\u201d one is the biggest myth out there, and a common joke in faculty lounges across the country. I even made a flowchart once, but let me sum it up here: unless you\u2019re attending a private school, without any financial aid or scholarships or parental support, your education is HEAVILY subsidized\u2026 oftentimes many multiples of what you actually pay out of pocket. I\u2019m sure there is some direct tuition money that goes towards my paycheck, but it\u2019s pennies on the dollar\u2026 meanwhile, local, state, and the federal government is picking up most of the tab\u2026 I\u2019m just as obligated to their whims as I am yours. \n\nAnd finally,\n\n7. Be prepared to come out the other end without success. My sincerest hope for you is that, after calmly and rationally discussing the situation with your prof, you\u2019ll prevail. If they blow you off, definitely escalate, but even then, don\u2019t expect to win unless you have an airtight case and can prove that you followed all directions. I don\u2019t have all of the information, so I can\u2019t say for sure, but based on my own experience, the issue probably lies in the directions not being properly followed\u2026 if they weren\u2019t clear, then it might not be your fault, but they are a critical piece of the puzzle. In the real world, many otherwise well qualified job candidates won\u2019t be successful simply because they didn\u2019t follow directions on their application. \n\nWow! That was a lot for a comment likely to be downvoted into oblivion.",
