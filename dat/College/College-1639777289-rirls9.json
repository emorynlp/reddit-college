  "text": "I didn\u2019t even know this was allowed. I wasn\u2019t doing well in a class so I put my psychology extra credit points (we got 1point for each study we participated in toward any psych class) towards her class. She even reminded us to do it. She said she didn\u2019t understand the website or something so she just didn\u2019t accept anyones extra credit points. Didn\u2019t bother to tell us. I could\u2019ve distributed them to go up a letter grade in my other classes but I wanted to make sure I passed hers. Now I have a D in her class(68%) a 78 and 79 in two of my other classes. I\u2019m pissed.",
