  "title:": "Damn. I predicted the TOD of one of my old professors",
  "text": "Second semester of my junior year I walked into my first Phil 101 lecture. The class began a couple minutes late as the professor limped into the room wheezing. He was a big guy who moved slow and couldn\u2019t stand lecturing for longer than several seconds, during which he would sweat profusely. \n\nI told my friend after the class that I didn\u2019t think he had more than 3 months... He died 3 months and 2 days later from a cardiac arrest. \n\nIt\u2019s horrible and surreal, as most deaths are from someone you\u2019ve known. \n\nWhat\u2019s peculiar about this case is is that it felt creepy, like some devilish intuition whispered into my ear the read of his death clock. although it\u2019s probably just zemblanity\u2026 it was it?..",
