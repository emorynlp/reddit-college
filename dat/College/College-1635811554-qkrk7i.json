  "text": "This might not be the best place to post this but my brain told me there is someone on here who has been down a similar path. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for me. I can\u2019t do the work. I don\u2019t care to do the work. I do not want to work towards something that I can\u2019t envision an actual ending with.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m working towards nothing. I have no passion for this.\n\nI have no idea where to find what I should be doing, how to start, and what I\u2019m capable of. I believe I have the ability to do almost anything I put my mind to but it\u2019s making me even more uncertain of my next step.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine myself finishing college this let alone starting again.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the right path to take is.\n\nIs there anywhere to start? My only concern is having money someday and I would like to have a hobby. Work is considered a hobby in my head. I don\u2019t know where to begin or even find what I like.",
