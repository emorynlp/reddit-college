  "text": "i had an essay worth 20% of my grade, im rlly passionate on the topic, spent a lot of time on it, got personal feedback from the prof, and I only got 78% on it. \n\nin another class, we have a bunch of small biweekly assignments. this assignment was literally to hand in a paragraph abt a topic we had covered that week, my paragraph answered the question, was concise, had relevant examples/evidence, and I got an 80%. My TA said it was \"a very impressive paragraph\"??\n\nim genuinely confused about what it would take to earn a 90%+ on a written assignment. does anyone have any tips or advice or ANYTHING",

      "text": "Have you ever read a really good academic article before? You read it without taking notes but still remembered the arguments and points being made? That\u2019s the kind of writing you\u2019re aiming for in college essays.\n\nShort graphs might be great because you\u2019re not contending with 5 different sources of info, having to analyze each source, or prove a thesis over 20 pages or 5 pages. It\u2019s not the amount you write that makes writing harder, but the complexity that the writing has to convey.\n\nGood writing in college is about clarity despite the complexity; not the idea, not the way it\u2019s written, not the tone, but clarity. Your favorite article was so great because it was so easy to understand what the author was conveying clearly. In fact it\u2019s a joy to read alongside some witty comments\u2014the author understands their topic so well they can even have f u n with it. \n\nSo what does it take? It takes being conscious of your writing process, and being organized when you try to clarify your complex thoughts into the written word. There are ways of approach and different strategies to develop depending on the kind of thing you need to convey. But I general: Do you need to outline, or just start writing and then reverse engineer an outline from your initial brain storm rough draft? Does your thesis actually address the assignment prompt? Did actually really closely read the assignment prompt and completely understand how and what your professor is having you do? Do each of your body paragraphs accurately represent their topic sentences? Do those topic sentences feed into the thesis, and vice versa? Once you answer the bigger questions, then you can worry about tone, grammar, run-on sentences, and MLA or APA or Chicago formatting.\n\nAll those questions above are to clarify what you have written to match what you have thought. \n\nI don\u2019t know if that helps, but hey there\u2019s that for ya anyways! Go to a writing center at your college\u2014they\u2019ll have tons of help!!",

Even with less harsh graders, they should have *some* feedback for you if you're below an A. Sometimes, scoring well is just learning what \"quirks\" each instructor has and what they're looking for. \n\n\nOther times, it may be learning different conventions for writing. Things like whether an argument is clear, and whether your points flow cohesively into that broader point. Sometimes profs want to see you flesh out topics more, give more specific examples, use sources more actively, things like that. If there's an issue there, you could still have a decent paper but a lower grade.",

What I think likely happens in these cases, is that the professor ends up taking a extra critical look at inflammatory papers or papers that argue against the main ideas of the course. They're more likely to double check accuracy, and will be more strict with coherence/flow. It can be a subconscious thing, I doubt the professor wrote that points were deducted cuz she disagreed. There wouldn't really be any concrete things to report then.",

Teachers can deny the fact they are biased....but they are only human. \n\nJust try to act like you care about the class, talk to them in office hours, and get them to LIKE you. Every professor who liked me gave me higher grades than I deserved, extensions, and praised my average work.  \n\nI also pissed off one professor mid-semester and my grades suddenly started to drop (He took it really personal and started to actively ignore me in class- even when I had my hand raised.
