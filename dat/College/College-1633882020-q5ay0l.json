  "text": "I have no motivation to study. I can't get anything done and I forget to do almost every assignment. I'm studying what i love so it shouldn't be this hard to be motivated. I'm so stressed. Is this just normal in college? Should I contact a counselor or someone? Does anyone have any tips to be motivated?",

      "text": "Seriously, working on something is like going to the gym. If you only do it when you\u2019re motivated, you won\u2019t get results. You need disciple to work on anything seriously. But you also need to know how you work. By example, I can\u2019t work with agendas, but working with bullet journals help me get my shit done because I know what\u2019s up the next week. Also, stress has a huge impact on studies. If you feel stressed all the time, chances are you won\u2019t have the desire to continue your major. So try to find the source of it. Personally, I wanted to apply for a scholarship for my master, but it required a huge c.v. with involvements everywhere and high grades. It put so much pressure on me that every time I worked 1-2h on homework I went to sleep/took a nap because it drained all my energy. Since I decided to not take the scholarship too seriously, the pressure fell, my stress levels fell, and my discipline got up. I\u2019m also doing more. \n\nBut really, what can help is a reminder \u00ab\u00a0why do I do it?\u00a0\u00bb and outside goals (something you wouldn\u2019t like missing such as a party/trip in the forest/etc.) as a reward for your good work.",
