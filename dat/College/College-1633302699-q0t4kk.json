  "text": "Alright so I have a group of 8 friends (including me), where we met up at a gaming club since the beginning of September and made a group chat ever since. I\u2019m a transfer full time student as a junior so I had a lot more assignments/work and have to work at my job also, where I spent less time hanging out with them. In the group chat, it seems like everyone just ignores me and they have someone to click with. I\u2019m introverted and shy but I try my best to crack jokes and make conversation. This past Friday, I met up with all of them since it had been 2 weeks since I last saw them all (I couldn\u2019t attend the last two gaming club meetings) and they didn\u2019t seem excited to see me, except for maybe 3. We were just walking on campus and everyone already seemed to get along very well with each other while I\u2019m trying to get to know everyone still. Everytime I talk, no one pays attention. I worried that they\u2019ll most likely make a separate group chat eventually and then I have no group of friends to mess around with. Also, I\u2019m the oldest (22) while most of them are 19-20 with one being 18 and the other being 21. I hope it\u2019s not an age thing where the 19-20 year olds are getting along better and doesn\u2019t see me as a loser who\u2019s trying to fit in with them. I do have a mature mindset but also can goof around. I regret not hanging out with them more but I\u2019m just so busy and out of all the clubs I\u2019ve been in, this seems more my type but recently I feel like I\u2019m excluded",
