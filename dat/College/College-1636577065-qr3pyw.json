  "text": "I don't know why but I can't bring myself to do any work. And this was supposed to be easy. Because of this semester I'm probably not going to get into the major I applied to and I'm probably gonna be on academic probation. We have 5 weeks left in the semester. I've wanted to throw myself off a cliff for months now. Is it too late to salvage a passing grade? I'm failing everything I'm pretty sure. I'm a sophomore.",

      "text": "It really depends, how bad are you failing? Do you have 60\u2019s? Or like a 30 or something?\nYou could potentially get a C if there are large assignments or exams you can do to bring up your grade (you\u2019ll have to study your butt off)\nFor example, I have A\u2019s in all of my classes but human anatomy. I have a 80 in lab but a 65 in lecture (due to my own lack of effort honestly). So I have a couple of quizzes left and two exams and one final exam to replace my lowest exam grade. This means I can potentially bring that 65 to a C (or if I\u2019m really dedicated, a B). So it really depends what assignments you have left, how they\u2019re weighted, and what your grade is so far.",
