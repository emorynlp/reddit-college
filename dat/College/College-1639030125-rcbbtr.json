  "title:": "Can you avoid math all together in college?",
  "text": "Hi I am really poor at math and barely know how to do basic high school algebra and I just suck at math no matter how many hours I look at the computer trying to learn it.\n\nI am about to start college and I have no intention on studying a degree related to math. I am interested in maybe psychology, business, or marketing. Or something else I may like before Im supposed to start in August.  \n\nI am not too familiar with how the US college system works for the 4 years but I heard in the first year you take the general subjects, english, math etc etc. How hard is the math? Can I avoid the math if my degree doesn't really use such a high level of math other that arithmetic?  If I am forced to do it, what is the lowest and easiest one to just pass? I would really appreciate it.  Its just so weird because in my home country, if you are studying something in Uni, you dont need to bother with all these other classes at the start that aren't really related to what you want to study (unless its that degree like math, engineering etc.), you just study your chosen topic/degree for four years.\n\nThanks :)",

The main thing about college, or at least mine because it\u2019s so big, is resources. Tutoring is available at multiple locations and online. Semi difficult classes come with supplemental instruction in which students who\u2019ve taken the class before do review sessions on the content a few times a week. Very difficult classes have resuscitations and you have to go in once or twice a week and work on homework with someone there to help if you need it. Again this is all sort of subjective because I go to one of the biggest universities in the US. However, I really think in college there\u2019s a lot of benefits to reap if you just look into it.",

I've kind of forgotten about algebra as I haven't done it for ages but apparently its very similar to high school, so I'd basically be learning and re-establishing it in my brain again, which isn't too bad if I get all the help I need whilst at college (of course I'd reach out to people if I need it as well). I am pretty good with all other classes that I did in high school like English, social studies, etc etc so it pushed up my GPA where I can get into college without having to do the SAT tests. Its just the math part I am a little worried about as I've forgotten quite a bit (hence why I am trying to avoid it) but if its true about college algebra and stats etc, and that its not too difficult and I can get all the help I need, then I should be fine I reckon.",

The minimum math requirement will probably be College Algebra. To avoid any further math classes, you\u2019ll really have to pay attention to the requirements of the majors you are considering at the university you will be attending. Many require more math than you would think.\n\nAny business related major will have math, including marketing. There\u2019s a lot of analyzing data to make strategic business decisions. Psychology will also likely require additional math courses because you\u2019ll have to conduct experiments and be able to analyze the data for them. \n\nHonestly, your options are fairly limited if you want to avoid math as much as possible. Your options are probably going to be in the humanities. Language, art, history, etc. Another option though is look at certificate programs instead of degrees. Certificate programs don\u2019t have all the extra classes. You just study exactly what you need to know for the job/subject.",

It is the easiest college level math course. Some colleges do offer lower level courses for students that don\u2019t have the necessary math skills expected at the college level, but normally they wouldn\u2019t count towards the general education math requirement. Most schools will have a specific math course that is required. You don\u2019t get to choose. Like I said before, College Algebra will probably be the requirement. You\u2019ll need to double check with the requirements for your school though. You should be able to find the requirements somewhere on their website.",

Most colleges put the required classes for each major on their website, so I recommend looking at that to see if the majors you\u2019re interested in require math.\n\nNot wanting to take math classes limits your options, so I recommend using Khan academy or some other resource to learn more math.

Supply chain what I majored in requires complex problems that have equations that determine reorder points for example. Every class I had 1-2 Harvard businesses cases that I had to solve and part of that was using excel and formulas. Grad school supply chain there was a lot of math as well. The inventory class was brutal. Finance was a difficult class in undergrad there was a lot of formulas and knowing when to use them too. Business is kind of a analytical field of study so it does take a problem solving mindset.
