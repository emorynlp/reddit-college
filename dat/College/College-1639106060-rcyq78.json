  "text": "I'm writing an argumentative essay for English & Composition, the topic being why certain psychedelics should be legalised for medicinal purposes. I've found a couple of diagrams while researching that I thought did a really good job of helping back up my point (e.g. there was this one that had a circle of dots showing a normal, sober brain's connection between parts/neurons versus the connections between neurons when the brain is on shrooms). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this'll result in a point deduction or something like that. Prof's office hours are over and the essay's due pretty soon, so I'm not sure if I should include it.",

      "text": "It mostly depends on the type of English class. I haven't taken an *English & Composition* class, so I'm unsure what the expectations are (I took an AP equivalent in high school that satisfied that requirement for me, but I assune it's quite different). It's probably best to be safe and not to include it if you're unable to confirm with the professor. I took a technical writing course that revolved around the use of data, research, and graphics (diagrams being a large portion of them), but I made a lot of them myself anyway (using data fron cited sources, of course). If you *do* include it, however, make sure you cite it correctly",
