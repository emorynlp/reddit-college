  "text": "Isn\u2019t it fun when you put hours of effort and passion into an essay thinking you\u2019re going to get an A or B but end up getting a D? \nIt\u2019s so annoying. My professor tells me that my essays are well written but I\u2019ve failed some of them because I didn\u2019t indent (I guess using the tab key is wrong now) my paragraphs the way he wanted or I didn\u2019t put a period in the right places when citing my sources.\nLike I know this is my fault for failing, but it\u2019s so annoying because I\u2019m trying my best at writing and I think my work is really strong yet I fail because of some minor grammar mistakes.\n\nI think it\u2019s insane that my grammar is more important than what I\u2019m actually writing but whatever.\nI expected this first year seminar class to be a lot better.\n\nI\u2019m so angry at myself.",

      "text": "I teach first year writing at a university. I will start by saying, formatting, grammar, punctuation and mechanics are things you shouldn't neglect. They are ways you show you know the genre in which you're writing, in this case, academic writing.\n\nThat being said, giving a student a D on a piece of writing with the only feedback being fixing grammar stuff is absurd, unless the grammar was so bad the essay wasn't readable (this doesn't sound like the case with you).\n\nMy advice is to go to your university's writing center, and have them help you with formatting and mechanics. Also, you now know how much value your professor puts on these aspects of writing. Part of learning to write in college is learning to write for an audience. Each of your professors will want something different. Pay attention to what they value, so you can write better for them. This is a skill that will help you far beyond college.",

      "text": "Next time after you write your paper, take it to the college writing center or lab (if you have one) and they will help you proofread it so that you don\u2019t get points taken off for things like that. Also as far as the indentation goes, does your professor have a rubric with the exact margins that he wants you to use? If so that\u2019s on you, if not I would take issue with it. \n\nGrammar is really important. It\u2019s college. This is a higher level of learning; you either buy into it or you don\u2019t.",
