  "text": "Flirting fly\u2019s over my head usually, I\u2019m oblivious when girls flirt with me, I have had past experiences.\n\nI went to the library yesterday and it was packed to the brim. I sat in front of an attractive girl whom I noticed kept staring at me. She also waved towards me and kept looking in my direction.\n\nIt turns out she had friends who say behind me so at the time I believed she was waving at them. \n\nMy friend who saw them later said they were talking about how a lot of attractive  dudes are gay. \n\nIn that moment it clicked because girls in highschool always thought I was gay.",
