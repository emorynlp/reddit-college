  "text": "Friday night at 1am (technically Saturday) a student went to the bar as part of a frat party and got into a fight (only one of his life). He was kicked out of the bar and told to go home, his friends leave to the frat party and he takes a common shortcut through the woods to his house. Yesterday he was found dead by the swamp\nwith no wallet keys or phone, no cause of death yet.",
