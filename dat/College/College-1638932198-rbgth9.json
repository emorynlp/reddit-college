I did bad in the beginning because we came back from online, then did okay in the middle. Then a major life event happened last week and I haven\u2019t been able to focus on school. My parents pay for my comm college classes and this is going to put me back a semester :/ what do I do?",

You might be able to pass stats and chem, but you're most likely to pass chem. Put most of your effort into chem first, then stats next (depending on how your finals line up). \n\nAlso, before going through the effort check your professors' syllabi to see how much each final exam is worth. An exam worth 10% will have much less weight to it than an exam worth 20%. Study for the final that is worth the most points/that you feel you can do well on.",

Also, you need to take into consideration all the money they'd be paying just to repeat those courses, so if the pass, even with C, I'm sure their wallet will be happy; it's one less thing to worry about. You know, my dad uses to say that the best time to actually learn the material is over the break because the semester flies by so fast and we pretty much do what's needed in order to pass, but once we are on our own schedule without worrying about time/semester length, that's the best moment we learn because we're actually studying to improve ourselves and not to get a grade. And I agree with that. OP can study to pass and use the break to catch up",
