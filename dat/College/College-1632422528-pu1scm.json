      "text": "I was over physics after spending an entire year trying to ace Calculus 1 and 2.\n\nSo, I almost really didn't try. But I really enjoyed how easy the lab portion was. The putting  numbers into the formula , getting fast answers  , that was relieving. But I'm so happy you've got such a high grade ! What's your major? My midterms are coming up, so I hope to have the same results as you. Good luck!",

Then when I enter physics II (electrical physics) shit hit the fan and nothing made sense lol. My professor made physics II more theory based and it sucked. Barely made it out with B in the class and lab",
