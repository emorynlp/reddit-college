  "text": "Hi! I am a senior in high school who hopes to major in chemical engineering. I have been offered a guaranteed Honors position at Texas A&M (College-Station) and am now finding trouble deciding between TAMU and UT Austin as potential university options. UT Austin is well recognized for their chemical engineering program (#5-7 in the nation); however, I would not be qualified as a freshman for their honors program. Which option is (generally) better?",
