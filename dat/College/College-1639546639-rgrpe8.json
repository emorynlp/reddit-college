  "text": "I read well and can write fast. I do read a little slowly because of my autism but I can still clearly understand and read what is presented with almost no issue. I love analyzing things. I\u2019m especially good with nonfiction essays and analytical writing. It\u2019s also easy for me to plan a paper given a premise days before I write it. Here\u2019s the one concern I have: I can\u2019t write fiction well. My autism makes it hard to write storylines creatively. I\u2019m better with the technical and formatting side and forming opinions and arguments than being creative. Do you think a bachelors in English may be possible for me?",

      "text": "I\u2019m not in the U.S (Canada) but I am an undergrad in English Lit. I would recommend looking at the mandatory courses required for an English major at the universities you\u2019re interested in. In my case, most of the courses that I\u2019ve taken have revolved around exactly what you\u2019re saying you\u2019re good at: analysis, forming arguments, etc. The only fiction assignments I\u2019ve gotten were either in elective creative writing courses, or could be substituted with an essay. I definitely think it\u2019s possible for you, so long as you\u2019re passionate (which it seems you are). Hope this helps!",

      "text": "Yes, it is. Look into professional writing/technical writing programs. Mine is a lot of writing just like you describe. I had to take one lit course and one creative writing course for my degree. I also had to take one design course. The rest are nonfiction writing. I really enjoy scientific and medical writing, so that\u2019s what I tailor all my class to, but there\u2019s a lot of different angles to take my degree.",
