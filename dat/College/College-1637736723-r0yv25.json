  "text": "I feel like I\u2019m the only one not getting the college experience and by that I mean partying every weekend. I don\u2019t live in the dorms I commute everyday to my university and I haven\u2019t made much friends at all this semester. Granted it\u2019s my first time ever being at university in person but I feel like I\u2019m missing out. Does anyone else feel this way?",

We'd walk up to houses, shoot the shit with people on the porch and go in and meet the rest of them. Don't wait for people to invite you. People didn't know they wanted to meet you until you meet them.",

If you want to really experience college and the social scene, get a place nearby campus. I honestly think it\u2019s worth it if you can do it for a year at least to get a fun experience.",

      "text": "On the other hand, if your friends spend on average 4h partying every weekend and you spend 4h on preparing for classes, you got an average of 480 hours of work done on top of what your friends are doing. That is 3 months of a full time - 40h/week job.\n\nTo me, that significantly increases the odds of success if, for example, you want to graduate sooner to get going with your own startup.\n\nYou can also spend 2 full time weeks partying out of the 3 months which is: pick 20 weekends and go party.",
