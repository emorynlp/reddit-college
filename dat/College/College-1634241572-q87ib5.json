  "text": "Hi there!\n\nI'm a freshman in high school and have been wanting to have a law-related job in the future. Although, it's still really early for me to be studying college-related things right now, I want to get ahead so I'm not rushing during the last two years of college. Do you guys have any tips on what major/minor I should study so I am well prepared for law study? Thanks!",

However, a degree in criminal justice or criminology may be some of the few degrees most related to law. \n\nBut really, if you are 100% about going to law school then major in something that you like. However, if you\u2019re still unsure the major in something that will be useful by itself.",

      "text": "Law schools generally don't care about your major (much less your minor). It's simply not relevant.\n\nHowever, most of the time you'll find that people major in the sort of area they plan on practicing in. If you just want the law degree as an obligatory entrance into politics, you study political science. The law library nerds study philosophy. Degrees like finance would lead you more towards doing that sort of work.",

      "text": "Overall it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nHowever some law specialities like certain backgrounds when you begin your career. I.e. intellectual property law likes to see STEM background. \n\nYou have time to decide. Don\u2019t just decide what\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d. When it comes time for you to choose reflect on what type of law interests you and what backgrounds current attorneys have. \n\nAlso make sure you talk to current lawyers, law students ( r/LawSchool ), and retired lawyers. Also sometimes law professors at small institutions are willing to talk. They can give you an idea of what it\u2019s like being a lawyer",
