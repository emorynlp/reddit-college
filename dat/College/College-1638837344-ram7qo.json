  "title:": "Final test if the semester tomorrow and I'm not ready, what do I do?",
  "text": "I have my 4th and last test tomorrow (besides the final in 2 weeks) in Calculus 1 on Integration/antiderivatives and I'm nowhere near prepared for it and I have no idea what to do. This class has been rough since the beginning with my highest test grade being a 58% and lowest being 21% and I already missed the 3rd test the day it was assigned in order to get an extra 2 days of studying which landed me the 58% and right now I have an average of about a 57.5% and I am terrified for tomorrow. I don't think I can miss this test like I did with the last one or else the professor might think something is up with me or that I'm ditching the test. \n\nThis professor teaches us the material as if it's something we already know and I've been to tutors and extra help but nothing has really seemed to work, I barely made it out of pre-calc last year in highschool with 2 marking periods ending as a 60% for me (I just couldn't stand online learning) and i am just lost at this point. If anyone has any suggestions on what to do that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
