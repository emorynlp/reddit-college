  "text": "If I am no matter what going to fail a class and I cannot withdrawal without me having to pay for the class because it would be a late withdrawal. Can I just stop showing up? Can my professor end up reporting my attendance to the dean and get me withdrawn from the course and I\u2019d be forced to pay or will I just fail the class?\n\nMy Spanish class is on zoom and I have too take a test which involves having a conversation in Spanish, another grade which involves a slide show presentation and another exam. This class gives me so much anxiety and I am just done.",
