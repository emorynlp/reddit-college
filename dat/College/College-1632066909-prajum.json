  "text": "I, 19F, am so behind on my chem module. Exams are in a month and a half and I'm still 8 weeks behind class. This is solely because of lack of effort on my part because the past week has been really chill and I have had very little assignments due yet I have been wasting my time. I am fucking myself over for no reason and I don't know why. I KNOW that I have a lot to do and that I should be studying but I completely disregard that. wtf is wrong with me I can't even effectively study because I don't know how to. I am constantly miserable and sad and hate myself because it isn't that difficult to start yet I keep putting it off I can't stand this",

      "text": "Have you tried doing school work at the library on campus? I find that helps me stay focused since there\u2019s people around also working/studying and there\u2019s less at home distractions. Also have you tried study groups? Those are helpful as well and if you don\u2019t know something, you can just ask someone in the group. After you catch up on everything, to avoid getting behind again try to make it a thing to study in small amounts every day rather than waiting to do everything the last minute. I\u2019m a terrible procrastinator and it sucks but this normally helps me. Good luck on everything!",

      "text": "mood. I\u2019m procrastinating a bit rn. currently a sophomore at Purdue and I find my best way to actually do work is to just get on my computer and do it. I\u2019m a gamer so it\u2019s super easy to be on the computer and lose focus. I put on some music and start singing to it or whatever background noise I need and I get some water and I basically do everything I can to make the studying as fun as possible (even though it\u2019s not) and I don\u2019t take it super seriously at all. The worse you make it seem for yourself the worse it will be. I\u2019ve stopped dreading school work as much and turned it into more of a necessary burden to lift to get more time doing literally anything else.",
