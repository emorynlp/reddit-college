  "text": "Hi all, i'm a CS major in CSUSB, for a while now my parents just have been getting in the way of my education, I tried getting a job at Target but they didnt support it and just basically told me to quit, They took down my room door and basically any form of privacy I had is just gone. Sometimes they even lock me out of the house preventing me to attend online school. Its really a pain in the ass and now im worried I wont even pass Calculus 1. Im thinking of maybe retaking it but it would just be a waste of time so im just trying my best to study hard while in the middle of this mess.\n\nI tried asking for advice in the University and basically one the CARE team advisors ignored everything I said and just insulted me, saying its my fault my family hates me, and that I need to grow up and move out of the house. I havent gone to IRL school since because of that for a week.\n\nHonestly as of now im just planning move out with my girlfrind of 2 years soon because, anyway my dad is threatening to call the police on me, Its kinda of funny that they do this to the only person that goes to college in the entire family line because they dont agree with me and my girlfriend's view on life...  \n\n\nDo you guys have any advice? Would taking a semester off be benifical to myself? Im just honestly confused rn, juggling my part time job in editing, studying for school, and family issues all around.",

      "text": "It seems like you are in a toxic environment at home and I\u2019m sorry for that. \n\nSince you are going through a lot currently, it wouldn\u2019t hurt you to take a semester off and straighten everything out. It\u2019s common for people to take semesters off due to mental health or personal issues. Alternatively, if you do think you could handle school, you could always enroll part time just to keep the momentum going.\n\nJust do whatever you feel is best for you. You want to be in a situation where you can really focus on your studies without the stress of stresses of your personal life or college.",
