  "text": "28 yr old male, non citizen,\n\nI really want to go back to college. I am currently in a stable relationship and my gf wants to fully support me in this. However, my education was unexpectedly halted due to a psychotic episode in 2013. I was arrested for arson and hospitalized and spent the next 6.5 years in the nuthouse. It would even be accurate to say that I grew up in the nuthouse. I am voluntarily providing this otherwise sensitive info in case it might somehow make me eligible for something, don't know, just brainstorming.\n\nMy GPA prior to the incident was surely dropping with the increase of paranoia, and, unfortunately, the majority of my 'paranoia delusions' were deeply entrenched in the academic context. After years of therapy and thanks to big pharma I am now sufficiently functional that most people wouldn't notice anything off. Gf says I'm \"very well adjusted,\" but I think she may be biased. We have both agreed however that \"its time,\" esp. since we have good financial stability.\n\nMy gf is the most important thing I have and I really wanna show initiative here. I speak fluent English/Spanish, creative french, and live inside computers. Linux to be specific. Right now I'm studying for Linux-related IT cert, however if colleges are willing to accept me without causing a ridiculous financial burden, I want that experience. I'm thinking small course load to get my bearings first possibly for Comp Sci or something. Really don't know how degrees translate to income... which is relevant bc government doesn't provide me any assistance (see non-citizen).\n\nNot sure if I could tackle something like engineering (more money?) although i do know some calc. So far all my technical experience is Linux. If you have any advice that could help me close some of these 50+ firefox tabs, it will be greatly appreciated. Muchas gracias (I don't know latin).",
