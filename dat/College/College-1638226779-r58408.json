      "text": "Clubs or activites are a good way to meet people and therefore hangout in smaller or larger groups. \n\nIf you have social anxiety, you could consider attempting to start a study group in a class. Rather than needing to awkwardly introduce and find common interests, you already have a common goal of learning the specific course material.\n\nGoing to the gym has been measured to combat general anxiety induced from stress. If you're new to an athletic enviornment, try and take it slow otherwise you'll quickly hurt yourself. Seperate your workouts into different muscle groups and learn form reduce risk of injury.\n\nAnd then finally, a lot of people are in your shoes, especially freshmen/sophmore year. Its okay to be slow to open up, just go with what makes you comfortable.",
