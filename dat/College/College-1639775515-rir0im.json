  "text": "Hi, What would you guys think is a better investment for an international premed, going to Stony Brook's biomedical engineering program wich is 40,000$ a year. or starting at a communiy college that transfers me to UCLA as a biology major (tuition is 9000$, 28,000$ a year total living expenses.",

      "text": "Well, in addition to cost, an important question is if you decide premed is not for you (not saying you will or won\u2019t) which of the majors is the one you\u2019d be happy to do for career and getting which one is the work you would want to put in. As a Biochem major, I think it\u2019d be a shame to do biology if you don\u2019t like it and aren\u2019t interested in it except as a stepping stone to med school. Same for engineering. I was premed coming in. I\u2019m not anymore. My roommate came into engineering thinking premed. They\u2019re not anymore either. We both chose majors we felt suited us and we were interested in. We are happy where we ended up. Even if you\u2019re dead set on premed (and I\u2019m not trying to discourage you here), you still have to spend 3-4 years doing the work for a major. Choose the one you will enjoy too and at the school you think matches you. As for investment, consider how much your earning potential is when you graduate (as a bachelors) and which has the most opportunities available for a premed student and would set you up well to be a doctor/med student. If you plan to stay in the us for med school, you would want to max out your resume as best you can (that\u2019s why I realized I didn\u2019t want to go to med school. I didn\u2019t want do all the work to be premed and med school wasn\u2019t attractive enough to make me) to make you a strong applicant to med schools.",
