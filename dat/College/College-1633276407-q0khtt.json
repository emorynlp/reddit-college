  "text": "Im giving a speech and am setting up my outline right now. It is an informative speech on the hero's journey and i have plenty of cited information but am stressed out over what to cite oraly. Do i have to find a citation for pretty much evey sentence i say or just on big stuff. I dont know what is self explanitory and what needs someone elses word to back it up. It feels weird to start every sentence in my speech with \"according to\" but i dont want to be branded a cheater and getting thrown out of college and having my career ruined over something so small.",

Second a good rule of thumb is to cite how you would if you were writing a paper. You may start of with your topic sentence, add a cite, and then further explain in your own words.",
