  "text": "The college I\u2019m going to currently has all of its assignments and books online, but we still have to come in for class. A lot of the time the teacher doesn\u2019t even tell you about an assignment or a test they just assume you knew from the website. I get that it\u2019s supposed to make it easier for the kids in quarantine but I\u2019m really struggling especially since I live at my house that has terrible internet, and I have a job.\n\nSorry about the probably terrible punctuation, and probably just as bad grammar I\u2019m in between classes and super frustrated.",

      "text": "I am a professor. I\u2019ve taught similar classes for many years. I cannot remind students about the assignment because I do not remember exactly when it is due. It\u2019s like trying to find your car in a parking lot when you park in a different space every day. Class is for discussion, activities, and questions. Your professor made a calendar for you and presented it at the beginning of the semester as part of your syllabus. It is your responsibility as a student to keep up with the calendar. Mine as the professor is to plan interesting things to talk to you about. I tend to check the syllabus no further than to make sure I\u2019m on approximately the right topic.",

So you write the paper in word and you only need internet to submit it\n\nMost classes don't have physical submissions - there are exceptions, like math classes with problem sets, or painting  etc - but most the course info isn't handed out and you don't turn in paper things",

      "text": "The reason for going to class is to listen to the lecture and ask questions if you have any.  Very few profs are going to baby you and tell you that there's an assignment due or an upcoming test.  They figure it's all online or in the syllabus and it's your responsibility as an adult to keep track of it.  You should be able to set up notifications in your schools online platform for when there's a new assignment created or an announcement.  You can also set reminders/tasks on your phone or computer so you don't get behind.",

Your in class to basically go over some material and for you to ask questions on the reading/material you were suppose to cover before class.\n\nAlso few remind students about dates. You should be keeping dates of exam and assignments yourselves. Some professors will be nice and remind you, others will just expect you to be responsible and stay organized.",
