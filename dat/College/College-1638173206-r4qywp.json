  "text": "I\u2019ve seen so many posts about people dealing with nightmare partners in group projects but have never seen any response or posts by said students themselves. I\u2019m just curious if you guys are out there, just observing and laughing maniacally. If you were this student in a project before, what happened and how did you end up becoming it? Just curious about hearing your thoughts because I\u2019ve never seen any of you post online before.",

I barely helped my partner and I felt horrible about it and of course our group was one of the first to present. I was just not in a position to do much at the time. it was one of the worst periods in my life and I hate that it affected how much work my partner had to do.",
