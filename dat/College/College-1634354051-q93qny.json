  "text": "Hello! I'm Currently a First Gen Immigrant, I graduated high school with a 3.7 GPA but unfortunately I couldn't really apply to any colleges due to my immigration status, recently I've just received some great news, 6 months from now I will be receiving my green card which will allow me to file for Independent Status under FASFA. I'm currently self-teaching myself CS and plan on going the Pre-Med route, would it be better to enroll in a Four Year or complete two years of Community College and transfer to complete the last two.",

      "text": "Congrats! \nIf you\u2019re gonna go pre-med, may I ask why you\u2019re training yourself in CS? Going to community college and knocking out intro classes and gen eds would probably be a financially wise move. However, I do know state schools love to give first gen immigrants lots of scholarships, so you might end up paying the same thing.",
