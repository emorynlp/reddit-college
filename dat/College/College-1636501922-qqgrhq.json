  "text": "I\u2019m currently a high school student and I\u2019m dual enrolled for math at my local community college. I\u2019m getting ready to register for the next semester, but I\u2019ve encountered an issue. \n\nThe only math classes that I can take are Linear Algebra and Diff EQ. However, between these two classes, my community college only has one night class scheduled for the next semester, and the professor has a whopping 2.2 on RMP. \n\nHow bad would it be to sign up for this class? Is a 2.2 as bad as it sounds or do all the dissatisfied people go to RMP to complain?\n\nI would just skip the class but unfortunately my school says you need math credit for all 4 years of high school in order to graduate.\n\nEDIT: For comparison, my current professor has a 4.6.",

When I was choosing my classes, I\u2019d carefully read rmp and thinking back I don\u2019t think I had any professors who were below a 3, even on the harder stem weed out classes (like intro chem intro physics etc). One semester, I really needed to take a particular class but the only class that was open the professor had a 2/5 on rmp and there were concerns about favoritism in the class. I saw this as a red flag and instead looked at the same class offered at my flagship state university and took the class there. Ended up being one of my favorite professors ever. Basically, is there any way you can attend another college for the same class? Usually schools have dual enrollment agreements with more than one college. Hope this helps!",

Make sure you check the dates of the reviews, and only consider the bad ones if there are many similar types of comments from multiple different semesters/years. \n\nOften what slacking students will do after they fail the class or don't get the grade they want is they will coordinate with each other and leave a bunch of bad reviews for the professor. If there are many students in separate years/semesters giving similar feedback, then you can consider it, but again, with a grain of salt. Remember that these sites are biased towards the people who perform badly or dislike the professors. If you get a good grade and have good experiences, rarely will you bother to go and leave a good review. If you have a bad experience, you will feel more inclined to leave a bad review so you can affect the professor in some way.",
