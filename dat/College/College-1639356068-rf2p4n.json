I found a professor teaching a science course online and basically used her videos. As soon as class starts for me, I realize I\u2019ve seen 80% of the exact material and it comes way easier! I didn\u2019t even need to take many notes. I treated studying like a part time job where I had to get x amount done every week or day. So brush up on your hardest classes next semester over winter break and you should go in with an advantage. I thought learning would be harder when I was 30\u2026 it\u2019s really because I have the drive now and don\u2019t want to screw up. I treat school like work basically.",

Just this semester, one of my professors recommended me to the honors program, and I didn't even ask because I never thought of myself as an \"honor-class-capable\" student.
