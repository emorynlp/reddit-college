  "title:": "Is it weird to ask if my roommate is ok?",
  "text": "i don't interact a lot with my housemates since they're friends to begin with, which i'm honestly fine with - my priority is good coexistence. we're also very different people. there's been some friction since they're more extraverted and like to have people around. i've told them off for being so loud at i can't sleep at night. i'm also dismayed by their lack of cleanliness, as they never wipe down the kitchen and cram the fridge full of old takeout and moldy foods. it's heavily impacting my own ability to feed myself since i don't feel safe using the kitchen and there's no room for fresh food in the fridge. i don't think of myself as difficult to cohabitate with, and i can't care less what they do as long as it does not start impacting my own wellbeing (sleep, food, health, ect).\n\non-going conflicts aside, one roommate has been having academic difficulty (presumably due to some personal issues i'm not privy to) and spends all day in their room with their alarm going off for hours at a time, probably sleeping in. as far as i can tell, theyre coping with having friends constantly over, but their lack of action in doing simple chores despite being the one who's at home the most can be pretty serious depression (which i know b/c i've had similar bouts in my past). i'm legitimately concerned if they're doing alright, and would like to shoot a text asking if they're ok, but am also worried about coming off as condescending or like i'm out to get their ass again for being unclean/loud. to be clear, i do not intend to tolerate their continued negligence and disruption, just ask after this particular guy and see if there's anything i can do to help.\n\nof course, maybe they're just a lame ass party animal at heart and actually super duper fine mentally, in which case i'd look like an idiot.\n\ntldr; having on going conflicts with roommates but suspect one of them is going through some shit, how can i reach out and see if i can be of support without them thinking i am attacking them, condescending them, or furthering some agenda?",
