  "text": "I feel like my HS teachers didn't really explain good essay titles to me? I know it's comparatively a little thing but for like literature/English essays what are profs looking for? I like to be creative with mine but I don't know how to balance that with whatever the regular expectations are.\n\nAny thoughts?",

      "text": "I think the ideal title for an academic essay both states the topic and employs some kind of rhetorical device to attract the readers attention. If you can't think of anything clever, then either a short version of the question your essay seeks to answer or a short phrase which represents your thesis statement will do. \n\nAlso, I always had an easier time coming up with the title **after** writing the whole essay.",

      "text": "There are generally three ways to do titles.\n\nFirst is to simple title it what you are writing about, how you are going about it, and what you discovered, or some combination of those. Popular in STEM but often frowned upon elsewhere.\n\nSecond is to come up with something terrible clever. There is a book about cannibalism I read in college titled *Insatiable Appetites*. If that's not a great title, I don't know what is. A little joke or wordplay also works, but you might need to pair it with a subtitle. A prime example would be this title of an article: \"Elephants in the Music Room: The Future of Quirk Historicism.\" Joke on elephant in the room saying with an explanatory subtitle.\n\nThird is to do a simpler method. Take a simplified couple of words about your paper, or a related quote from something you talk about in the paper, and pair it with a subtitle. An example would be this article: \"\"Straightening the Paths\": Inductive Divination, Materiality, and Imagination in the Graeco-Roman Period\". A quote related to a source the paper utilized with an explanatory subtitle. An example without a quote would be \"Cleansing the City and Creating Communism: Fitting Ethnic Cleansing of Vilnius into Michael Mann's Framework\" Word play with alliteration in the beginning with explanatory subtitle.\n\nGenerally, if you can come up with a clever title, (unless for a STEM class) professors would be more than pleased. If you can't come up with an amazing title, then try for an intriguing one. Baring that, at least chose a title which indicates some thought went into the title.",
