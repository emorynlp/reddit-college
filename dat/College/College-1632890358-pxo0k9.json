  "text": "My class had a discussion board due. After we wrote a response we had to reply to a couple. I noticed one person did not write a huge portion of what was asked of us. I sent them an email giving them a heads up that they missed a required portion. I just want to make sure this isn't considered cheating. I didn't tell them what to write I only copy and pasted the assignment and basically said \"heads up you might want to add the missing portion before midnight\"",
