Something has to give, and if it's your sleep, you'll wind up with other things suffering, too (your grades, your job, and your mental health being the most likely things to slip)",

It's crazy to think that I was often working more than I studied and I too complained I didn't have enough time to finish school.\n\nThen I quit my stupid part time job and focused entirely on studying. I suddenly found school to be 100000% less stressful now that I spent the time I would've been working on studying. \n\nI don't understand your entire financial situation but if you want my honest recommendation whatever job you have is probably not worth it. Unless you're working in something compsci related you're better off focusing on school. Whatever job you find after graduation will pay orders of magnitude more than a part time job",

But I couldn't keep up and my grade started crashing in one class (that is the most difficult). I always get 4-5 hrs of sleep but I am going to only work 2 days a week (16-20 hours) so I can still pay bills. I spend anywhere from 6-10 hrs on school a day. It's ridiculous lol.",

Generally speaking, you should be aiming to spend 2 hours or so studying for every hour in class, so your work commitments, your classes, and your studying should only take about 70 hours or so of the 168 hours in a week. \n\nNow, I know there are weeks when that 70 hours is low, and it's natural to want a social life on top of other family or life commitments, but if you're only taking 13 units and only working 25 hours per week, you should be able to get enough sleep.\n\nPersonally, when I was in college and I felt like I needed to cut back on sleep as much as you are, what I really needed to do was to get more efficient at studying and to say \"no\" more (to my friends, to my SO, to my bosses, and to my hobbies).
