  "text": "I have an exam tomorrow. I will not do good. I hate the class. I hate the professor. She did not teach. She enjoys making things unnecessarily difficult. For a class with an insane amount of research material we had to read in addition to general course content, she is proud of providing absolutely zero guidance as to what we need to know for the exam apart from the fact that she will ask us directly about certain authors' works. Our exam is tomorrow, and we had our \"review\" here at 6pm the night before. There are many other things I'm not mentioning as to why she raises my blood pressure on the regular. \n\nI'm not going to do well tomorrow because I simply cannot remember the volume of information she wants us to remember. But I'm still going to get mental hives taking the thing because I hate not knowing answers, and I can already feel myself getting driven up a wall in rage thinking about it. How do I disconnect myself from that anger and just accept that it? I can't get sick during finals week.",

I don\u2019t beat myself up because I did my best my only options are to accept the judgement or question the judger. I tend to just accept and in unique case warn the next student on rate my professor and rate poorly on class evaluations.",

      "text": "Okay, if you haven\u2019t been doing well and hate the way she teaches why wait till the final to realize you won\u2019t be able to pass the exam? Don\u2019t blame the professor when you failed to prepared for an exam that I\u2019m sure it was on the syllabus since day one. I\u2019ve failed many exams and I blame nobody else but myself\u2026 even if the professor could\u2019ve done better. There\u2019s nothing you can do, but move on. It\u2019s not the end of the world.",
