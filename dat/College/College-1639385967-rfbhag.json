  "text": "My finals start tomorrow but I'm absolutely exhausted from this semester.  I have bipolar 2 so getting depressed halfway through the semester made it feel like I was working 10x as hard to do good. I have 3 semesters left, idk how I'm gonna do it.\n\nMy rooms a constant mess, I can barely scrape myself together for basic things, and I'm always exhausted.\nIs anyone else feeling this way?",

I have depression, and I don't take medication, so i know how it gets. kinda sucks having to try to put your depression on pause just to get assignments done. just try to be lenient with yourself over the next few days. and when break starts, that's when you can clean your room and relax. you got this!!",
