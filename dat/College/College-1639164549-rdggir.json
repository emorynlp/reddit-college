  "text": "I have finical aid, and at my university for the longest time they only paid for 12 credits max. Anyways, for the first time in 5 years (I had brain surgery, so I had a year long medical leave), I\u2019m taking 15 credits. Most of them are my 300 level class and a 400 level class (plus one quantitive literacy 100 level math class). \n\nDo you have any tips on how to handle 15 credits? (5 classes).",

No matter your needs, don\u2019t feel bad if you feel like you have to work more to achieve the same success, we are all different. Do what you need to do to set up a schedule that works for you.",
