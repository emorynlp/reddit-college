      "text": "I interchange between the two. I\u2019ll use a tote on days I have fewer classes. But if I have classes where I need my laptop I\u2019ll bring a backpack. My backpack is a North Face but the tote bags I use are cheap. They were two for $20 on Amazon. \n\nI say invest in a more affordable tote and interchange them with your backpack based on your needs.",
