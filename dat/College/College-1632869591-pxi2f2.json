  "text": "Earlier this afternoon, I received a letter in the mail saying \"Congratulations! _____\nIn recognition of your outstanding achievements at \n___ \nyou have been selected for membership in the Nation Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS)\n\nJoin online at www.nshss.org/join\"\n\nI went to the website to join and I saw where it said something about a $75 membership fee, which is one of the main reasons I thought it was a scam.\nAnother reason is because it's blatantly stealing the name of the National Honors Society (NHS).\n\nIs the NSHSS a scam?",
