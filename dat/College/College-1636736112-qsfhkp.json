  "text": "The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit newsroom in D.C., is looking to hear from college students who\u2019ve faced or are currently facing eviction. If you\u2019re a student who has been evicted from campus housing amid the pandemic or who has experienced homelessness, we want to hear your story. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve reported on housing or the eviction crisis: Earlier this year, we revealed that more than $425 million of the $2.6 billion set aside to prop up struggling renters amid the pandemic didn\u2019t make it to tenants or landlords.

And don't worry, your identity will remain confidential unless you give us permission to name you. If you want to share your story, you can reach out to me at [aeichenstein\\[at\\]publicintegrity.org](mailto:aeichenstein@publicintegrity.org).",
