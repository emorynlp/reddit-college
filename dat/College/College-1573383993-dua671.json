  "title:": "Lying to my parents about grades and major",
  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I have been facing tremendous depression and anxiety problems for the past couple of months due to hiding and lying to my parents about my college major. My university is one the best in the world for its computer science program and little did I know it's extremely competitive to get into the core program. In my first year I began my journey in computer science thinking I had to maintain a 60% in my courses to graduate. However, my school requires it's students to apply at the end of the first year to be admitted in the actual Cs major. Meaning there are internal requirements I must meet in order to get into CS. Some include a minimum gpa of 3.3/4.0 and mid 80s in my first year courses. I didn't get in my first year, so I tried again in second year and again failed to get a high mark good enough for a CS major. In my third year right now battling tremendous depression and anxiety because cs has always been my dream major. My parents think I am in cs and have good grades which I don't. I have been lying to them and forging my transcript everytime they see my marks and I am honestly exhausted. I have lost my appetite, lost roughly 8kgs and now have insomnia problems, diarrhea and other health issues. My mom's mental health is not stable to handle this and my dad has been juggling work and taking care of me and mom. I feel like a total scum for lying to them. What should I do?",

      "text": "I go to UofT and it\u2019s hella hard to get into the CS program, i have many friends that couldn\u2019t get in so I feel you. But it isn\u2019t the end of the world man. There\u2019s always a few other options like:\n\n1) the math program at UofT is so damn underrated it\u2019s crazy. There\u2019s amazing opportunities out there for quantitatively skilled graduates. Plus the major is ridiculously easy to complete and is nothing like the specialist (which in my opinion is a different beast, but one that would set you up nicely if you want to do CS on the graduate level). \n\n2) UBC has a program for uni graduates where someone with a non CS degree can get a CS bachelor in 2 years. That\u2019s a great program, UBC is a great school and in a nice location. If you get your shit together now and graduate with any other major, you can always come back to CS via this route. What\u2019s 2 extra years? People spend 2 years getting worthless masters which don\u2019t even come close to this program. \n\nTelling your parents is obviously the correct and decent thing to do but you already knew that didn\u2019t you? If you can\u2019t tell them, that\u2019s also fine just whatever you do make sure to pull through for you and for them. \n\nI had less than a stellar first couple of years at UofT. Honestly, accept that it will be stressful af but it\u2019s worth it at the end when you come out with a degree from UofT and a perseverance only UofT students with dark academic histories can be familiar with. \n\nGoodluck OP you fucking got this!",

      "text": "Damn, sounds like UC Berkeley. Definitely not easy going there for CS. If it's really freaking you out you can try transferring to another math-related major such as Applied Math/pure Math or Physics. If you could do Mechanical Eng or Electrical that would be good enough too though I'm not sure how competitive those are. If you do a major along those lines and have personal projects to show your chances aren't really hampered so much when trying to get a CS job, especially with that school on your resume.",

I basically in your situation first year, I just lied about school and grades as I was failing most of my classes. I figured I\u2019ll just do better next year and it would be all good, but the stress starts to pile up of failing and lying to my mom, eventually I fell into depression. I remember coming home for summer after finishing first year, gpa was awful, horrid and I said nothing about it. Eventually my mom figured out about it and was hurt, not that I failed but I lied to her and didn\u2019t even ask for help when I needed it. It truly felt awful.\n\nThe best thing to do is to let them know you\u2019ve messed up. If they love you they will understand, it\u2019s not a hop and a skip going into college it\u2019s really difficult. Hiccups are bound to happen just let them know and do better next year. It hurts a lot more when they have to figure out on their own.",

Put another way--if I saw my son putting everything into running track, I would certainly be telling him that I was proud of him and that I love watching him compete.  And that would be true.  But it would be wrong for him to think that I love him *because* he's good at track, or that there would be a hole in my life if I couldn't root for him anymore because he chose not to compete anymore.",

But once I got in, I found out the courses are pretty fucking hard, and I struggled to keep up, failing half of them and barely passing the rest. Ashamed, I lied to my parents and pretended everything was just fine, but the pressure only kept building up. Eventually, I had a mental breakdown and fessed up about my grades. They were pissed at me for a while, but decided to help me work out what I was supposed to do next. I withdrew from the college, took a break for a year during which I worked on my mental health and sorted my life out, and luckily managed to get admitted into another schoo in the same major. Things are way better now. Though it's gonna hurt, I think you should tell your parents about it, maybe break it to them gently. They want you to succeed, and will do what they can to help you.",

College can be hard and CS is one of the harder programs. It is okay to discover your limits and then respect them. Like going to the gym and discovering you cannot bench press 150 pounds the first time you try. Reduce the weight until you work up to it. You can go back to CS later if you truly want to.\n\nComing clean with your parents will allow them to be supportive and I hope after they get over any emotions of being lied to they will. Keeping this in is harming you and you know that. I know you don't want to disappoint them, tell them that too. \n\nIt is possible you AND the therapist can tell your parents together?\n\nI hope good things for you OP - you can get through this, it may not be the easiest thing but you will be better for it in the long run.",

They were your age once too and understand the pressure to succeed.\n\nI want to talk about you and academics. From your writing, it seems that you feel like a failure for not getting into the program.  Just know that that is not who you are.  It's not your identity.  This sucks right now, but you'll learn from it.  It's pretty common for people to do their worse in the early years of college.  Best now to find a way forward. \n\nSo what if you didn't get into your first choice of programs?  Does your school have a related program?  Does another school have a program with higher admission rates?  Find out and research their entry requirements AND ENTRY STATISTICS!  Let's say XYZ college has a 3.0 minimum GPA to get into their QRS program.  Most colleges publish their stats from year to year. You can see admission and graduation rates. You can see the minimum and average GPA's of those admitted.  For example, UF's veterinary medicine program has a minimum GPA of 3.5 to apply.  If you look at the stats for those admitted, it's actually closer to 3.66.  Knowing this early helps you plan.\n\nA final note, since you are going for a CS field.  There are countless programs to pick from and most people seldom work in the exact field of their degree.  It just gets your foot in the door for a job.  For CS in particular, your field cares a whole lot more about certifications and competency.",

When your overall health increases, your grades will increase too (speaking from personal experience). Also, you have a choice as far as what to be honest about, but they should know you are struggling in school and your health is taking a toll. Let them know of your plan to succeed is, they will most likely take that as a sign of maturity and you wanting to do well. \n\nMaybe find a tutor (depending on the school, they might be expensive but you ultimately end up spending less than retaking the course). What always helped me when I was failing CS classes was trying to come up with a mini \"personal project\" that uses the same content.  This way, YOU are forced to think and you have complete understanding of the material. If there is something not being understood, go to office hours. I wish I would have gone more, it would always come back to bite me at exam time. Professors, Instructors, and TAs really do want you to succeed. When studying, doing homework, project, or lab, sit with people in your classes. I always understood content more when just being in a similar environment. You can also ask them questions because of the pool of knowledge. \n\nYou got this, best of luck!",
