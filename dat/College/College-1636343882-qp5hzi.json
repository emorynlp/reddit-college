  "text": "    So I practically got kicked out the moment I got my hs diploma. My mom insisted on me going away for school because \u201cthat\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do\u201d so I started fall 2020 at a big, D1, public research university and was miserable. I took spring off and started this fall at a tiny public liberal arts college and I hate it here even more. I live on the floor with student athletes who constantly scream and run through the hall like middle schoolers and are just awful and inconsiderate people in general, I\u2019m broke because I\u2019m only working 3 hours a week, I don\u2019t have my car and can\u2019t go any where, I literally had to move dorms because my old roommate was annoying and I couldn\u2019t get sleep,my new roommate is only slightly better, I\u2019m not making any friends here and losing connections with my old ones because of the distance, my physical and emotional health are just plummeting and Im overall just not happy here. My mom finally decided I can come home and commute to the local university there. Part of me really did want the \u201ccollege experience\u201d but at this point college just seems like literal hell on earth. If I go back home, I don\u2019t have my own bed room and I\u2019m gonna be living under my moms rules again in an already very crowded apartment. Is it worth it to try to transfer one more time and hope for the best or just give up and go home?",

      "text": "Best advice I can give would be to go back home. Take your basics at a local community college to ensure a high GPA upon transfer. This will help to ensure your odds at landing a scholarship since your high school GPA will no longer be considered since you will have an established college record.  \n\nSave money from working and from left over fafsa funds to help you graduate with less debt at your local college.",
