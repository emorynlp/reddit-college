  "text": "I\u2019m a senior graduating this semester and I have been helping out some of the newer students in my major. There is an unsettling number of them that have opened up to me about how bad their mental health is right now due to the stress they are under from their classes. Today, a girl told me how she spent the last two weeks in a psychiatric facility because of how bad her stress has been. She told me how she\u2019s been vomiting every morning due to her fear of failing, as well as considering hurting herself so she wouldn\u2019t be able to go to class. A transfer student told me how she had a similar experience and was considering dropping out after being treated awfully by several of our professors. They talked to her as if she were a child just because she expressed how confused and stressed she was about classes. Rather than helping, they ridiculed her and made her feel as if she wasn\u2019t welcome there. And then the other day, I saw a whole group of them bawling about how the school is changing requirements for the major and stopping people from going elsewhere for one of the more difficult classes. They had apparently told the chair that the class was too difficult for a 200 level, and he told them they don\u2019t belong here if they can\u2019t handle this class. Yet, this same Professor suggested I take that class elsewhere as everyone failed it. I\u2019m just so sick of this school. The professors are incapable of showing sympathy or addressing the fact that we just came back from a really difficult period of our lives. My roommate lost both of her grandmothers to covid. One of my (genius)friends dropped out after a month when a professor told her she\u2019d \u201cnever make it in this field\u201d. She had missed a couple classes as her dad was in the hospital. The utter disrespect that I myself have encountered here has made me dislike this school. But after seeing what it\u2019s doing to these other people, I just absolutely hate it\u2026\n\nI need to figure out how to address these things. I know trying to talk to the dean is hopeless as she doesn\u2019t know how to communicate(literally just email back). I\u2019m not sure if it would be better to contact our new president, or if that would fall on deaf ears as well. There\u2019s just been so much tension and emotion lately from everyone and I want to help them, and I want the school to help them too.",

      "text": "This is such a big problem. I\u2019m struggling with it myself a bit, and I\u2019ve started asking why is it even like this.\n\nIf it were a few odd people every year, you could say they just don\u2019t manage their schedules, priorities well, but it\u2019s such a common problem almost any student can relate to it.\n\nSchools, faculty, admin, and society in general like to use the argument that dozens of classes have gone through this before, and it\u2019s normal to deal with this stress.\n\nMy counter question is does something being normal make it right or ok?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Something seems fundamentally broken about it all to me. Nothing that\u2019s supposed to be as good for you as college is advertised should cause mental breakdowns and the crazy habits people take up to get through.",

          "text": "Exactly. My freshman year the other professors were like \u201chey look, you are all struggling. You aren\u2019t alone in your misery\u201d. Like\u2026okay but this is no way to live. I shouldn\u2019t be vomiting everyday and sacrificing my health just for this. Now all these other people are dealing with it and worse. I just can\u2019t watch this anymore.",

      "text": "I feel like college is definitely a balance. You have to find that balance between whatever is going on in your life and school. This may require cutting back on the number of classes taken per semester, seeking out an easier major, etc. Finding the balance is obviously much easier said than done. However, being in my last semester, I have no idea how I put up with all the stress and anxiety during each semester. I also have no idea how I put up with all the awful professors. College is really just a hard thing in general. You\u2019re broke, tired, stressed, etc on a regular basis. However, I found it helpful to take time to yourself and go do something to blow off steam. Find a hobby that\u2019s cheap or get some good exercise on a regular basis. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to seek out a counselor. You\u2019d be surprised how much just talking to someone helps.",
