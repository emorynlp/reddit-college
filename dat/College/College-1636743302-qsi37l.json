There are limits bc you have to start working to find out which areas you do really well with but you won\u2019t ever have access to free career counseling after college. Like I said, they are marginally useful and understaffed but it\u2019s a resource you won\u2019t have after graduation. And all those student fees pay for it, so you are paying for it already. Utilize it. Researching for a museum or similar are really hard to get. They go to PhDs and there are hundreds of PhDs for every position. Middle or HS history teacher would be most reliable job.",

I say switch to History if you both enjoy it and do well in it, and if you're still feeling insecure about your major then, then add on a double major or minor in another complementary field.\n\nHistory teaches you how to critically think, read, and write, skills widely applicable to a number of careers. Just with any other major, you'll need to put work into it - take advantage of the opportunities your school offers in it to strengthen your skills and CV, or alternatively market yourself with your History skills for other kinds of positions. \n\nI myself am now pursuing a PhD in History, but I know others who've gone into law school, teaching, government consulting, and other careers not directly related to the subject. If History is interesting to you and you're doing well in it, by all means switch to it. Just make sure to acquire additional experience along the way, which is of course the case for any major. \n\nSee [this page](https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/why-study-history/careers-for-history-majors) curated by the American Historical Association for articles that practically break down the benefits of majoring in History and [this article](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/april-2017/history-is-not-a-useless-major-fighting-myths-with-data) that addresses the statistics of History major employment.",

While an Econ degree with undoubtedly make you more financially stable in life, money isn't everything. OP said they aren't doing well in their classes rn, sure it could just be tougher classes but you have to think about the degree that they picked over Econ, that means they probably enjoy doing and/ or can see themselves in a career related to that field in the future. OP said he'd probably wanna work for or with a government, a history degree is perfect for that, literally perfect. A American history professor here at my University only began teaching after about 40 years of fieldwork, military contracting, and lower level government contracting. I'm not trying to argue that an Econ degree isn't the way to go for everyone, if you love Econ than that's would you should do and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, but if you really love something, for myself it's Ancient History, then you should try your best to make a career out of it so everyday of you're working your dream job. With that being said, if OP really just wants to make money and doesn't really have a love for history or anything, a history degree is a slow burn, you will have to work very hard and long, most likely, to make what is considered good money.\n\nOP, go to your student advisor, that is literally what they are there to help you with. Your advisor can help you find a career path, give you more information about majors , and also tell you whether or not all of this Is a good idea or not.",

                              "text": "I still think that the prospects on a history degree would be abysmal. It's cool that you can love it and go into it and hopefully get into jobs but from what I've heard, history degrees aren't exactly the most useful for businesses. \n\nI know you keep mentioning how money isn't everything but it sure is something. Living on a low wage fucking sucks. Just enough to pay the bills and go to work the next day. An average wage is around 55k for History majors. Considering getting the degree could rack up probably about that much money in loans, it'd be hard to see the return on investment. 55k is okay money, it's definitely not great. With a partner making about the same you can live comfortably but nothing extravagant. You'd be able to build a savings very slowly but unexpected housing expenses would hurt pretty bad.\n\nIf you really really love it, go for it. Just know that you're not doing it for money and probably won't be able to get rich doing it no matter how hard you try. I think it's important to talk about how it won't pay off as well as other majors. Econ has about the same average but can cover more industries. I have a feeling climbing the corporate ladder with an econ degree would be easier than a history degree.\n\nI'm going to have to say, that the longer I make this post, the more I think that money is a large portion of 'everything'. It sure would make it easier to live. On more money, I can pay some poor sap to mow my lawn and change my engine oil. Hell, I could even pay somebody to clean my house for me. You won't be able to afford that on 55k a year.",

I just feel that we shouldn't discourage them from pursuing what they want to do, and I love they are committed to it and they really like what they do than honestly making a lot of money isn't that big of a deal. Granted studying for an additional 6+ years with little money will be difficult. But if you enjoy your studies and make the most of the experience than it is worth it, impo. Also if you are able to do higher education such as MD and PhD in Europe or something it would be exponentially cheaper.",
