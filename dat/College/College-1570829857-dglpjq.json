  "text": "I happen to keep seeing a few people around on campus. I don't know that person, never spoke with him/her and never took the same class together.\n\nBut seeing someone over and over again kinda makes me curious. I like making new friends and I think to myself whether I can be friends with that person. Considering talking to them sometime but I don't know what to say haha.\n\nBy pure chance, I happen to be in two classes with one person I have been seeing around. Maybe I will have a chance to talk to her and make a new friend.\n\nAnyone got a similar experience in college?\n\nedit: I talked to her and now we're friends!",

It was super coincidental but I didn\u2019t want to seem like a creeper so I just kept to myself.",

Wonder about people all the time. I like to craft little stories of what their lives might be like based on their clothes, backpack, what they\u2019re eating on the way to class, that kind of thing.

      "text": "Sure, it is curious. Not everyone is brave enough to make the climb, jump that gap. Go and talk to them, who knows what might come of it.\n\nStorytime: I remember there was a girl I had seen in some of my classes. Then I started noticing her whenever I was returning from my workouts. I've lost about 40kgs and was exercising pretty hard those days but she was sort of overweight but still a cute girl. I remember her looking at me whenever I came out of the running ground, pretty much every other day.\n\n Well, one day she started showing up to exercise. She started running, I would run a few laps and go rest for some time and she would rest after a single lap in the beginning. My resting spot was a few feet ahead of her, slightly diagonally. I used to feel her eyes digging holes in the back of my head all the time. I could tell that she wanted to talk to me but was being shy and having a hard time coming out of her bubble to do so. But so was I. Also, I had just lost my grandmother that month and was just sad in general. \n\nWell, one day I ran - hard - and when I was pumping from all the adrenaline, I walked over and introduced myself. We made small talk, I didn't get her number - I did that the next day. We started running together soon. Well, today she may not like me or admire me or anything but she is my crush. She's also the most beautiful girl on my campus. My story doesn't have an ending as of now, but my point is that just a small, tiny moment of courage can give you a story, and maybe the other person is afraid to make that leap, but you always can.",
