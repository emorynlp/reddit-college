  "text": "So I don\u2019t know if this is considered an \u201cadmissions\u201d question so I apologize if this isn\u2019t allowed in advance. I am currently at a 2 year community college with my major in business. The more I have researched I am wanting to change my major to Account, finance and banking or economics. When I spoke to my advisors at my school they basically kind of said it didn\u2019t matter what my major was now because I can just choose what I want when I transfer to a 4 year. I have done some research and know that doing so could potentially make my graduation date prolong. My question is should I figure out exactly what is it I want to major in for sure now before I transfer to avoid that possible problem?",

      "text": "You should figure out what you wanna do now, but it depends on school. Lots of schools will admit you as a business major and you can choose your concentration, like accounting, finance, etc. later on. A business major focusing in accounting or finance isn\u2019t really different from an accounting or finance major. It\u2019s treated more or less the same by most employers.\n\nI\u2019m also a business major having transferred from community college. I\u2019m at a top uni now, ask me any questions you have.",
