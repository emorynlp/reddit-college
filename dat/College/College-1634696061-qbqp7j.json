  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI am struggling to find enough people to answer this survey out that I had to make for statistics class. I have to get 100 people and since I don\u2019t use a lot of social media its hard getting people to do it. Then I have to use the data I got to do a chi-square test and present the data and all that. If you could please help me I\u2019d really appreciate it, I just don\u2019t want to lose points for not having enough. Then survey is only two questions that asks your gender and how long you take to get ready in the morning. \n[2 question survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdz0Zs2h6D4p2P-Vn6tAILaoKYUo28XJXIr_w65pxdnFz1i3g/viewform?usp=sf_link)",
