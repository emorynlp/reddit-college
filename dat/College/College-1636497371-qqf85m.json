  "text": "I'm considering reaching out to the disability services and seeing if my severe auditory processing disorder means I could have the requirement altered or waived entirely.  Has anyone had experience needing any gen ed requirements changed due to a disorder or other issue? I was officially diagnosed and have all the paperwork. \n\n\nAPD makes it almost impossible to understand what the German speakers are saying, let alone even attempt to say it myself. It's week thirteen and I couldn't tell you how to say hello in German. I'm passing the class because it's alot of written work, which I can do. But everything speaking, I can't really do.\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention I need three years of foreign language because I didn't do it in high-school. I can't see myself passing those classes.",

      "text": "I have auditory processing issues, so I also suck at languages. Fortunately my school offered Latin, which doesn't require speaking/listening skills, and I took it and passed. They also offered sign language, which should also do the trick for someone with auditory processing issues. \n\nI have known people who are deaf to get language requirements waived, but I don't know if they'd do the same for you. If your school doesn't have something like Latin or sign language, see if they're willing to allow you to take one of these types of languages at a school that does offer it and accept the credits. \n\nIn the end, you'll have to discuss it with disability services-- different schools have different rules and are more likely to work with students than other schools are.\n\nAlso, not all schools/majors require a language, so your worst case scenario might be to change majors or transfer, but you should certainly try the other routes first, of course.",

      "text": "I was diagnosed with APD and it affects me a lot. However, I taught myself German when I was a kid and became half fluent. Was pretty good at reading and writing, but speaking was more difficult since I have a hard time processing that to begin with. I had a really hard time listening and then forming responses on the fly in conversation. It always took me time. \n\nI wonder if anything they could modify the requirement so that everything you had to do was reading and writing, since then it\u2019s all visual. German is pretty easy to learn spelling, since it\u2019s very phonetic.",
