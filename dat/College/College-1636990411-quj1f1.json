  "text": "I\u2019ll try and keep this post short. Essentially I\u2019m in a high level (400) French course this semester (I\u2019m a senior) and my professor has, all semester, been pretty late with uploading the homework we do for the week. Over the semester, we\u2019ve only gotten a few days notice for the homework (due on Wednesday nights at 11:59, we have class on Thursday afternoons). This isn\u2019t usually a problem when the homework is just reading or watching a film and answering critical analysis questions, although it was irritating one week when we had a podcast assignment we had to do with a partner and approximately 3 days heads up to do it. \n\nToday, she uploaded instructions for an assignment worth 15% of our grade that will require at least 4-5 hours of work (if not more). It\u2019s an iconographic analysis in which we must collect 7 images and critically analyze each one within a certain context. She uploaded these instructions at 10:55 PM Sunday night, for this deadline of 11:59 PM Wednesday. No warning in class, no email giving heads up, etc. I\u2019m so frustrated about this; I have meetings planned for group projects Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night for other classes, plus a group presentation this week on Thursday. I feel like if I had more of a heads up I could have somewhat reorganized these to make sure this project gets done, but now I\u2019m just panicked about where the hell I\u2019ll fit this project into my schedule now.\n\nI\u2019ve asked her for a recommendation for a program I want to apply to next year, and I\u2019m scared asking for more time on this assignment will reflect poorly on me. But this is an unfair assumption to put on her students I feel like, to give no warning for a assignment that\u2019s such a huge part of our grade. Should I go to office hours and ask for an extension? If so, how should I go about phrasing it? Advice would be greatly appreciated.",
