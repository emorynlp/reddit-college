      "text": "Depends on:\n\n* Whether the exam is generally curved\n* Whether the class is generally curved\n* What the current grade distribution looks like for the class\n* What the grade distribution has been for the class in previous semesters. \n* Whether the purpose of the class is to teach upper-level concepts, weed out bright-eyed and bushy-tailed freshmen, or to serve as an elective. \n\nIt's completely possible that an exam average of 58 is fine and expected for the class. This can be true even without a curve, if the rest of the course is balanced appropriately. It's also possible that something's weird with this particular semester: new prof, new material, weird class distribution, whatever. If so, you might have better odds if you complain.",

If they were all in the 50s to 60s then yeah, involved the dean or dept director cause there\u2019s clearly a disconnect.\n\n if the rest of the averages were decent 70/80/90 then it\u2019s quite possible a lot of ppl just said F it for the final, cause they knew they would pass even if they bombed it.",

      "text": "If an exam has an exceptionally low average, the professor will curve it. If a lot of students fail, but a lot also did well, then you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nA lot depends on the course and professor. The school won\u2019t admit it, but every class has a target grade average. If the professor misses the average by a lot, it reflects poorly on the professor. Some classes are weed out courses, while others are not. The professor will do some adjustment if the class gpa is off by too much.",
