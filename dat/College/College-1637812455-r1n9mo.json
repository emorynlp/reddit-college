  "text": "Hey guys! I'm in 9th grade right now and I was thinking about going to college for CS in the future. I was wondering how hard it is assuming this is an average person at an average uni (I.E: Not Stanford or Harvard) who works hard and has common sense, but isn't afraid of the occasional party or day out. \n\nI've heard everything from it being like 1000000X harder then HS and that every teacher is the biggest hard-ass imaginable to college being *easier* then HS because of greater freedom and generally being less tracked along 1 path. College students, how hard is college, *really*?",

      "text": "College freshman currently, I'd say the main difficulty of college right now is the fact that there's alot more accountability. You need to make sure you have good habits and that you find a way of studying that works for you. In highschool a  portion of your grade is usually homework which is due, but in college alot of your grades will only depend on tests and projects, so homework is optional but it is up to you to choose to do it and to study. Also often classes will have maybe 4-5 tests making up your grade which can get stressful, my physics class has 3 midterms and 1 final, no partial credit so you have to be very careful and prepared for exams. It's also alot less of hands on teaching, I get readings or videos I have to watch before class, and then class is kind of the wrap up any questions, so they don't really teach you, it's alot of teaching yourself. I will say there are alot of office hours, and if you need help understanding something, professors or teaching assistants can help, and if you ever have an issue come up, professors will usually listen to any concerns.",

Math actually gives your partial credit though, we take exams in a computer lab and you get about 3 tries for long problems although you get less points for each attempt. Physics doesn't do partial but that's also why it's longer, since you have to triple check stuff.\n\nThe freedom of college is definitely nice though, definelty gotta get used to time management, but yea while tests are stress-full, I don't think college is awful lol, you'll be fine as long as you take advantage of the resources college provides, like office hours or study centers!",

It takes a little bit to wrap your head around this and learn how to learn like this, but you'll get there in time. Because of this, I would say that college is harder than high school. It is much less \"grind work\", but for the work you do have, it will be hard, and you will spend a lot of time on seemingly small amounts of work, ie. my calc midterm.",

I can personally say that besides a couple of classes, my HS AP courses were harder than almost any lower division college course I took. Most of my upper division classes are a joke as well, and pretty easy. As it stands though, my HS was decent and when I tried, I was an excellent AP student and didn\u2019t struggle much with the AP exams.\n\nI\u2019m also a community college transfer, and CC was just straight up easier as a whole than my AP courses, and it wasn\u2019t even close.\n\nFor CS, it really depends on how tech-oriented you are and how your quant skills are. You\u2019re probably gonna die in algorithm analysis, because everyone dies in that class at every uni I\u2019ve seen, but beyond that everything is pretty subjective.\n\nAlso, you grow. I am significantly more intelligent now as a senior-standing college student than as a high schooler, and as a result, things that were difficult for me back then are an absolute joke to me now. Just have a hunger to learn and grow, foster that hunger, and you\u2019ll be fine.",

      "text": "Easier than high school for me, because high school was all day every day the same thing, the same people, and just about all of my classes were classes I HAD to take, not ones I was interested in.\n\nOf course, some classes in college aren't necessarily the most interesting, but at least I don't have to suffer through them daily.\n\nA lot of high school age students struggle with things like organization- remembering due dates, breaking up assignments into manageable parts, keeping and reviewing notes, etc. Some of my tougher classes have been the ones with very little homework, because there's that much more studying I need to do on my own for the exams.\n\nMy teachers since elementary school have been telling me that once you get to [next level] its going to be so hard, the teacher's won't take any crap, etc. But that wasn't really my experience. \n\nSure, if you tossed 9th grade me into a college class (even if the material was on my level) I would have struggled quite a bit just because the professors don't always remind you every day to do your homework or break up your projects into manageable pieces for you. Some professors are really caring or easy, while others are unusually strict and mean. \n\nIn college, there's not really anything the admin can or will do if a professor decides your entire grade will be based off of one 20 minute exam that included 60 minutes worth of questions, but I've had very few professors like that, and still not to that extreme.\n\n Using ratemyprofessor and talking to people who took that class/that teacher before can help you pick the better professors.\n\nMy freshman classes (including when I took freshman level classes as an upperclassman) were some of the most difficult. Either because the prof still treated us like high schoolers or we had huge amounts of weekly homework (like a math class). As a senior, my classes require less homework, but at the same time, I'm on the hook for a lot of material and I have to study without having a lot of (or any) examples of what we might see on the exams.",

I went to some crazy college prep school and college this far has been a breeze with most of my classes being way easier than high school. However, I would say that the hardest part has to be getting used to living by yourself. You instantly become more responsible for things and are in charge of yourself. This is not a bad thing though. It just makes classes feel more overwhelming because everything is changing. I think the biggest obstacle people face in college is time management. If you can figure that out, school will be just fine :)",

The work load is much larger: You will definitely have to cut out a lot of the homework and try to learn the most efficient ways to study because there's so much reading and homework that it's impossible to do all of it.  I guess it also depends on your program though, and which school.  Some aspects of it may seem easier than HS at first (e.g. way less class time and depending on your program not very many and assignments), however, having a midterm and a final make up most of your final grade combined is a way more difficult thing than having several tests like in high school.  This is because you don't get many opportunities to fix your mistakes, and if you slip up on one exam you could definitely be fucked for that course.  Time management is also very difficult because while you may think that you'll be spending your weekends partying, you'll quickly realize that going to parties takes up a lot more time than you think (hangover the next day leads to being unproductive), and that you can only party once every few weeks if you want to actually focus on school.  \n\nKeep in mind that I am only listing the reasons for which University is difficult, and there are a lot of ways in which University is more enjoyable than high school.",

I think the people it's really hard for are those who coasted by in high school and then had a wake up call when they had to take more advanced classes. The best investment you can make for your future self is to take high school classes seriously and develop good study habits. Then, the college classes you take will be difficult, sure, but you will also be much more prepared to handle them.\n\nFor CS specifically, I would also point out that I feel like there is an initial \"hump\" period when it comes to the classes. At least, this was my experience, since I took my first computer science class in college, with zero knowledge of how to code before, and it took me a while to get good at programming. If you start programming in high school, I think you'll be able to overcome that initial roadblock a lot easier.",
