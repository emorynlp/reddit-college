  "text": "I currently have a 92% overall in my junior seminar. I have a paper due Thursday that's 5% of our overall grade. I also have a project to finish and an important exam to study for for a class that I'm really struggling in and need to do well on (both are bio classes for my major). I've started writing it a bit but need to spend more time studying and working on the project, so it may be a day late (-10% per day). Will losing 10% on an assignment that is worth 5% of my overall grade hurt my grade that much?",

      "text": "No, and you can do the math yourself. Assuming you have a 100 in the class, doing what you said would result in a (100 * 0.95) + (90 x 0.05) = 99.5. Whatever your grade actually is sub it into where the 100 is. And you can use that to calculate any grade, multiply the grade for say homework by its relative % of your grade in decimal form, if you have an 85 in something worth 20% of your grade then its 85 * 0.20. Then add together all of the terms",
