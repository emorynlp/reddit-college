  "text": "To begin, I started attending courses at the Community College in my area immediately after my high-school graduation in 2017. I was working 2 jobs at the time which in-turn caused me to slip up in 2 courses, thus repeating the 2 courses which added onto the time spent at the Community College. \n\n(Also portions of the statements were derived from my appeal letter)\n\nUpon entering the Community College in the Fall term of 2017, I was unsure of the initial process of getting started in my first year of college. I was instructed by my mother (former student of College) to seek out an academic advisor to guide me through my enrollment & to assist me in setting up my schedule for each academic term. When I met with the academic advisor, I was given a transfer enrollment course equivalency guide for courses that would transfer from the Community College to the local University for my intended major, Biology. Given each passing semester from Fall of 2017 to the Spring of 2020, my mother had accompanied me to each academic advising meeting to assist in any difficulties that I may face.\n\nAt the end of the 2020 Spring term (assumed final year at the community college), I began to finalize my transfer to the local University and set up my course schedule for the following Fall term. Upon meeting with the University advisors, I was informed that if I intended on taking my upper-level Biology courses pertaining to my major that I would need to complete the Physics and Chemistry pre-requisites prior to being able to take the Bio III courses. These pre-requisite courses were not referenced in my meeting with the Community College advising meetings, which in turn led to the delay in my enrollment for my 2020 transfer. \n\nPrior to learning of these additional pre-requisite courses during my intended final semester at the Community College, I had met with the Academic Advisor at the \\*Beginning\\* of the 2020 Spring term to review my course transcript & to see which courses were left in order for me to complete my Core requirements. My Advisor informed me that the only core course left to take was Bio II and if I wanted to remain eligible for Financial Aid, I could opt to take elective courses to satisfy & meet the Financial Aid credit hour policy for Part Time/Full Time students. The Advisor also offered to finalize my \"Graduation\" in order to receive my Associates degree. When offered, I had asked the advisor questions regarding my concerns of opting to receive the associates & consequently, completing my degree plan as my mother had warned prior.  My Advisor had reassured me that there would be no issue or price increase if I were to take a course in the future after opting to receive my associates. What failed to be mentioned was that upon completing my degree plan, (even though I have no yet exceeded 150% of my credit hours), I would have to opt for a new degree plan in order to receive my financial aid. I am now indicated under the Community College as \"Not Making SAP\" due to taking unnecessary electives in place of the pre-requisite courses that led to additional year at Collin & limiting the credit hour limit.\n\nMy Question, is that is the following information suitable for an Appeal? I have looked online and other situations that individuals find themselves is Loss of a Job, Unexpected Medical expenses, etc. Yet these are all circumstances that have tangible evidence/proof. The Financial Aid office requires Documentation proving my extenuating circumstances yet all communications were done in person (I may be able to find the course plan the advisor created for me), How would I be able to prove my circumstances? OR should I just fall back and write a BS letter that I do have evidence of due to losing a job during COVID to just streamline the hassle (I feel that I have been let down by the advising office & now am forced too prove it, Id rather not have to use the loss of my job for an appeal but would it be more efficient in the people of Reddit's opinion?).",
