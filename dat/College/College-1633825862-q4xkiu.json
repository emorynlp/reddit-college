  "text": "I mean, of course, we are all tired of college in general I guess. But does anyone else feel exhausted due to this pandemic? We have more in-person classes now and with only some online, yet it's still hard. Some things are just more important than school. Personally, compared to a few months ago, I have been feeling better, but I guess I have been worried about the future in general. I do have a few career plans in mind despite of this though. Anyone else feel something similar here? ",
