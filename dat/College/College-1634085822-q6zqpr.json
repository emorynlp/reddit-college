  "text": "I keep getting emails to become a member of Phi Theta Kappa. Its either a one time $90 fee or yearly, I can't remember. Is it worth it? They promise access to scholarships, but my community college already puts me in a pool for those. I didn't see what else they could offer.",

Served in leadership roles, traveled for free to conventions across the country, won awards, transferred with a full ride scholarship because of them and will graduate next semester with a bachelors debt free. \n\nEven if you are not into getting involved, they still have a lot of opportunities, most scholarships are automatic anyway and stackable so yes you might get a pool of scholarships from your cc but you can add to that.",
