The burden of Financial Aid and GPA to keep my tuition debt free has ruined college for me.\n\nPlease do not stress grades and just LEARN! As a Computer Science major I am going back and relearning code because my professors relied our grades on midterms and finals and not the projects we did in class.\n\nCollege is a scam.",

I dropped a class (Bio 113 also known as Principles of Biology II) I thought I was going to fail, but would've ended up as C- in my freshman year (I want to smack my freshman self for doing the WD). Then, I retook the class and failed it in my sophomore year. I plan on retaking it next semester in my almost senior year(I'm a junior now, but will become a senior next semester). I also got a few D's in Calc 1(retaking that this semester with a better professor), Gen Chem 2(this one was twice and still got a D), and Bio 230(D+, then C- that became a P due to COVID policy in colleges).",
