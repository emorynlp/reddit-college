  "text": "I only do college part time, and I try to give it as much time as possible. However I have had a lot going on this semester, deaths in the family, a break-up after a long relationship, and moving because of that break-up which didn\u2019t let me devote as much time as I wanted leading to my failing grade in the class. I know that no matter what I do, or what strings I pull theres no way I can turn it around. So should I just give up and focus on my life and then give the course my all next semester?",

You are suffering from extenuating circumstances, which definitely can warrant one.\n\nIf it\u2019s grades, still talk to the prof. See what they can do. \n\nWorst comes worst, you take it again. Not such a big deal really.",
