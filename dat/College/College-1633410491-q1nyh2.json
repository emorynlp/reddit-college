  "title:": "Professors: Have you ever written a bad letter of recommendation?",
  "text": "I had only online classes last year and need a recommendation for a scholarship this semester. I asked one of my current (face-to-face) professors and he said he would love to. The turnaround is quite quick\u2026 like, less than 2 weeks quick. But I told him that and he said it was no problem. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is: Does the short timeframe look bad on my part? Would he write me a bad recommendation? Have you ever written a \u2018bad\u2019 recommendation?\nInfo: I found out about the scholarship maybe 3 days before I asked for the recommendation",

If they've written for you before it's not as big a deal because they can reuse all or some of what they've written before.\n\nAs others have pointed out, it's not really ethical to write a bad recommendation (no matter how much some of us may fantasize about it). If a student that I'd write a bad letter for asks me to write, I would tell them that I can't write them a good letter and suggest they find someone else.\n\nThat said, there's a huge difference between a good letter and a glowing letter.",

They don't need to be my top student, they just need to have put in the effort.\n\nIf they weren't the best at assignments I might concentrate on another aspect of their work:  \"*Student X was always engaged and I could count on her to create a discussion.\"*\n\nObviously the more time the better for the professor, but the prof should tell you if it's not enough time.  If they said that 2 weeks was no problem, I'd believe it.\n\nEmail them with 2 \\*days\\* notice... now that's a problem.",
