  "text": "So right out of high school I attended college and was not at all prepared. I worked full time, didn\u2019t have reliable transportation, and was severely depressed. Long story short, I was academically dismissed. This was 8 years ago. I think my GPA was in the 1.5 range. In 2020, I decided to go back To school at a community college. I\u2019ll graduate this December and have been able to maintain a 3.98 GPA. Once I graduate, I plan on attending the same school I was dismissed from before. I recently received an acceptance letter and an email saying I\u2019ll be part of their \u201csummit program\u201d for students who were previously dismissed. When I looked at my degree works none of my current community college credits were there- only my crappy grades from 8 years ago. So now I\u2019m having an anxiety attack. I emailed the program coordinator and my advisor but figured I\u2019d ask online as well. When my credits do transfer, is my 3.98 GPA going to automatically lower because of the stupid mistakes I made 8 years ago? I\u2019ve worked hard and am ready for college this time around. But now I\u2019m panicking over the concept of my GPA becoming too low to even enroll in my major of choice. Has anybody else experienced a situation like this before?",

      "text": "As correctly stated by others, your new GPA does not transfer to the 4 year school. \n\nHowever, you stated none of your CC credits were appearing.  That could be a problem.  You want to verify how many (and which) of your CC credits will transfer to the university.  That is information you can obtain from the university.  You don't want to discover after starting that you are still a freshmen, rather than a junior.",
