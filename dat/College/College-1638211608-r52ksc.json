  "text": "I recently bought an echo dot but with the encrypted wifi I can\u2019t get it to connect, does anyone know a way around this? I know my university has a secret network for gaming consoles but I\u2019m not sure if it will work with the Alexa because I can\u2019t manually connect it to the wifi",
