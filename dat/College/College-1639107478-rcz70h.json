  "text": "Waiting for my professors to send my grades in so I can get my diploma but I am done. I got nothing else to do except talk to a professor for a ten minute final about my work and leave next Wednesday. I keep feeling like I\u2019m missing something, I can\u2019t even believe my graduation is next week. I thought I\u2019d be excited and immediately no longer stressed once I graduated, how long did it take to feel normal again?",

A lot of people graduate and kind of have an \u201coh shit\u201d moment as it hits them they\u2019re are finally \u201cindependent adults\u201d in the work force.",
