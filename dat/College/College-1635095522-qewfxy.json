      "text": "If it is not AP or AICE, it generally will not appear as a credit on college transcripts. And, those only appear if you send the transcript from the organization (not FLVS,) to your college. Honors will count towards hs GPA. Not sure what liberal arts math is, feel free to check with an advisor at FLVS, but I know they're hard to get ahold of. Anything on your transcript will be considered by a college admissions office when looking at your application.",
