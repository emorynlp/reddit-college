  "text": "Hi, I'm a senior now in college and feel very stressed on what to do after graduation. I'm so lost and confused and don't know what to do with my life. I have absolutely no plans and am not even sure what I'm going to do in my career. I have no experience, internships, or research experience so I doubt anyone would even give me a job anyway. I hate going on LinkedIn and seeing everyone post all their internships and jobs that they're getting while I'm over here with literally nothing. All of my friends have their lives planned out and know what they want to do. I don't even know what field I want to go into. I'm way behind everyone else and feel so dumb.",

              "text": "The great thing about engineering is that it generally qualifies you for a broad range of positions. It sucks to not have internships because you're probably not going to attract some flashy big name company, but you can still find a great job.\n\nSome thing you might try would be to look into Project management. That's a little more on the business side of things, so you wouldn't be doing design work, but you need to have the technical knowhow to understand the process and talk intelligently with customers. But the day to day is more about schedules and working with contractors and suppliers to make sure your company's project gets executed correctly. You also could look at field engineer positions. It can be rough because you usually have to travel a lot, but that does mean there's less competition for those roles.",

You mentioned your in engineering so you really shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble, but remember you shouldn\u2019t be comparing yourself to others. Once you have some stability and some safety money, then consider making a career change if you really want to.",
