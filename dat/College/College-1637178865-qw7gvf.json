  "text": "How did you defy the odds? How did you manage to pull your GPA out of the gutter the Spring before graduation? How did you get a 20 page essay done the night before? Craziest all nighters? \n\nI need to get a 95 or above on my Calculus 3 final to pass the class or I'm fucked beyond belief, but the good news is I have a month to study. I feel like I need to hear other damn near miracles people pulled in college to get the confidence to do this fucker. \n\nWhat did you do to defy the odds?",

He said I had improved after tanking the first couple tests, and I could probably swing a B if I did decent on the last exam and homework assignments and the final, but an A wasn't in the cards.\n\nFast-forward a couple weeks and he's giving us a review for the final. Working through old tests, answering questions, typical final review stuff. After finishing up we all got to talking and he said that if anyone got a 100% on the final he'd give them an A in the class. We all just kinda laughed it off, because the class was really hard and none of us really considered it realistic to ace the final.\n\nTurns out, I got an A in the class.",

That talk gave me the confidence to not only redo the assignment and boost that grade from a 40 to an 80, but I was also able to pick myself up from rock bottom in that class and get As for the rest of the semester. So basically I went from a failing average to a B+ in 2 months.",

That teacher loved me because she thought I put a lot of effort into her class.. nope I just took AP lit in highschool.",

I ended up dropping the class to take it again later.  After failing out of school and coming back 3 years later, I got a professor who's style clicked.  I had one teacher in high school math that I could just not learn off of.  It made me realize that for math, my learning is really dependent on the teacher as opposed to almost any other subject.\n\n\nWhat I loved about the second teacher I got is that he had homework, but he assigned the numbers on the pages that you see the answers to in back.  He also didn't collect it.  He would start every class by asking everyone which problems we had issues with.  From there, he would write the number on the board and we would give a show of hands who struggled with it.  The ones with the most votes he would walk through and answer questions about.  It was a much better method for teaching math than I had ever had.  He did give us small quizzes about every other week as well as chapter tests.  No one test had enough weight to cause some one to fail is you struggled with a unit. \n\n\nI still think about that professor from time to tim when I am working with my kids on math.  I hope they get one like him when they get older.",

I made sure to get a minimum of 6 hours sleep, though got 8 when I could. I got \u2018er done the day it was due, and got an A. Cum laude with honors ayy\n\nLesson: Discipline puts stress and anxiety in check, so just start doing whatever you need to do as soon as you can, or say \u201cI will do it at this time on this day for x hours,\u201d and then do it no matter how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nLesson 2: Ask for help when you need it and don\u2019t feel like you should know how to do whatever your professor gave you, because you\u2019re learning it for the first time! Wish I asked for help way earlier and was more honest about my insecurities to my advisors and mentors.",

Something just came over me (I literally felt like I was possessed and having an out of body experience) and I wrote for nearly 16 hours straight each on Thursday and Friday.

I convinced myself engineering was right for me and needed to meet transfer requirements to try and get into Uni. I decided to take Calc 1 because I was going to need it and it would be a lot cheaper at community college.\n\nFirst day of class we take an exam to determine our understanding of algebra. I completely failed it and the Professor even approached me a couple days later about it expressing concern. I told her that I would work as hard as I could to stay in the class and turn things around. I spent the next two weeks teaching myself algebra every chance I got. Between classes, in my car, during lunch. I filled an entire 5 star notebook with algebra equations by the end of the two weeks. I proceeded to score A\u2019s and B\u2019s on every exam after the fact and ended the class with a B+ and a love for math (a Subject I originally despised) I also ended in getting accepted to the only University I wanted to go to. \n\nI grew as a person a lot after that",

This was the one course that I actually needed to transfer to my school in the US, so I needed to nail the final if I wanted to graduate on time. \n\nI was also the only native English speaker in the class, and all of my classes were in French. I\u2019d had a few years of French under my belt before this, but six months of university-level lectures really pushed me out of my comfort zone.\n\nThe final was going to be a blue book essay on a single painting from the early Renaissance. I\u2019d had some talks with the professor about my French language skills, and he said as long as I knew the content I\u2019d be fine, spelling and grammar mistakes wouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nThe issue was that I\u2019d spent a good chunk of the semester drinking wine and traveling instead of going to class. I realized a week before the final that I knew exactly jack shit about the early renaissance, certainly not enough to fill up a blue book in French.\n\nThe professor sent the class a PowerPoint  of 80-90 works of art that could be the topic of our final essay. Realizing exactly how fucked I was, I decided to take the \u2018inch wide - mile deep\u2019 approach, pick one work of art at random and learning absolutely everything I could about it, at least enough to fill a blue book with as much French as I could eke out.\n\nI chose [The Holy Trinity](http://www.masaccio.net/holy-trinity/), a 15th century fresco by Masaccio, and went balls to the wall learning everything about it. The plan was that if I could transfer enough material from this painting to another one from the same time period, I could skate by and pass the class.\n\nThe exam rolls around the next week and we all receive a printed handout \u2013 face down \u2013 and a blue book for our essay. From the different dark patches on the back of my neighbor\u2019s handouts, I noticed that we each got different paintings. Kind of like a tarot card reading or something. \n\nThe professor starts a timer at the front of the classroom. I flip over my handout and, lo and behold, Masaccio\u2019s Holy Trinity. \n\nMy essay wasn\u2019t good, but it was enough. I ended up getting full credit and graduating on time thanks to one of the wildest coincidences of my life so far.",

I remember going to bed one night realizing that I had a physics test at 8 AM the next day. I turned my phone on and started to watch a couple of lecture before I shut it off and accepted my fate. I winged Test 2 and got a 50%. Halfway through the class I was sitting with a 60%. I asked my professor if, hypothetically, I got a 100% on every single assignment from that point onwards, could I still get an A in the class to which she said possibly. And I did just that. I studied every single day, grinded every assignment and topped the class on Test 3 and the final. Finished with an A.",

      "text": "My Calc III class was entirely asynchronous. I was hospitalized for part of the quarter, worked as many hours as I could to pay for bills, was suicidal for most of the quarter, and the last week mark came up at the point that I had not done any work in the class. I hadn't even finished the \"introduce yourself\" assignment. I was unfamiliar with all of the course content, because there wasn't even review from Calc II to Calc III. I worked through 25 hour-long assignments (some were longer, as long as 3 hours for an assignment), wrote 3 academic reports, scheduled 3 exams and the final, and passed the class with an A- all within the final week. I was less than 1% away from an A, but I'd talked with my professor, and he didn't want to bump my grade up because, to be fair, I put a huge amount of grading work on him in the last week of the quarter and I should have done it sooner.\n\nDuring the quarter before that, I wrote a 3,000 word technical report for my final in the span of 8 hours when I hadn't yet done *any* of the research, and I received a 100%. If you'd like to know what I mean by \"technical report\" (including graphics and specific formatting, as well as exhaustive research), I don't mind sharing my completed report (I'm actually fairly happy with it). They're technically public anyway and have been entered into plagiarism checkers already.\n\nWhile it may not be *as* crazy, I skipped almost every period of my AP Human Geography class in high school (most of the times I didn't skip I was high during class), and still managed to pull a 4 on the AP exam.\n\nAlso, since you're worried about your Calc class, I've been very ill (I'm immunosuppressed and caught a very bad infection) for a month and a half. I've just started to recover recently, and hadn't had the chance to work on any of my Calc IV content (Multivariable Calculus) the entire time. I've been emailing my professor about it the whole time, so he's been giving me the opportunity to make up for my missed work (I haven't been able to turn in a single thing the whole time). I failed my first exam while I was sick, but I just took my second exam on Monday and scored a 96% after learning a month and a half of content in about a week. Not as impressive as my Calc III stunt, sure, but I was still quite sick while studying, and the content is much harder.\n\nYou can absolutely get a 95 on your test, I believe in you OP!",

I was basically having a full on anxiety attack in the middle of the exam and had no choice but to sit there and finish the exam to the best of my ability. Walked out completely destroyed and really upset.\n\nI ended up getting a 91 on the exam with a 99 on the programming part, despite the grading sheet actually listing my performance as in the mid 80s. I knew the math didn\u2019t add up but I kept my mouth shut and was able to get an A in the course. Still don\u2019t understand to this day how that exam resulted so well.",

Eventually one of the other students told me about a website I could go to, and since our classroom was a \"computer lab\" I could access it on another tab. The professor was old and not tech savvy so as long as we were looking at our own computer screen he didn't care. I managed to pass the class with a B, which was way better than failing.

We sat in the classroom straight for over 3 hours at a time. Felt so burnt out and we had exams every week. Worth it though, two As and a B+. Doing it again this summer to get my certificate.\n\n2. I got a 4.0 last semester while taking on 18 credits, which included Biochemistry and a class who's final project was to write a 12 page paper single spaced. Had all term but I only knew what I needed to do halfway through the semester. Procrastinated a fair bit to the point where I had about 3-4 weeks left to write it. I spent about 4 hours each week cranking out 3-4 pages at a page, basically a literature review so reading and summarizing journal articles with the same concepts. Finished it a couple days before the due date and got a 98%.",

You need your mind to be sharp for a test and 7+ hours of sleep the night before is the best way to guarantee that.\n\nOne ritual that helps me is going to bed at 8 and waking up at 4 the night before a test or the night before a long day of studying.

I held a meeting with my professor, and the quality of my work on the assignments I did do on time, the fact I did the assignments knowing I wouldn\u2019t get graded, and the fact that I was the only person in any of his classes all semester that held a one-on-one meeting with him showed that I cared about the class and professor let me turn them in for full credit. Now I\u2019m sitting pretty at an A.\n\nBefore anyone asks why I did them knowing I wouldn\u2019t get graded, it\u2019s a class with a semester long project where each assignment builds on the previous one, so you\u2019re pretty much screwed if you miss even one.\n\nMoral of the story: always show your professor you care. If nothing else, it\u2019ll make their day. And sometimes your professors are your most valuable connections when you graduate, since many of them have industry experience.",

It\u2019s not about being smart or being born with natural talent it\u2019s about the work you put in and your goals in life.
