  "text": "$100,000 pay raise, a contribution to 415(m) account, and a $25000 bonus annually. And a lump sum payment. I'm trying to make sense of it all.\n\nFor the record, tuition goes up around 3% annually at the school before the pandemic, don't know what it's like now.\n\n*This is written from the perspective of a student*\n\nEdit: I can understand how hard it is to run a college moreover get the funding. A bonus is justified, but a $100,000 pay raise on top of the bonus is mind boggling (to me that is).\n\n\nEdit: after reading all these comments about people's experiences and the impact of this pandemic on everyone's lives, it does pain me and it weigh heavily on my heart. Please please please take all the time you need to heal. I apologize if this post caused trigger, anger, resentment. I know I can't do much, but I pray things do get better. Hang in there.",

There is nothing indicating people in those situations don't generally put students and faculty first.

Virtually no universities are lowering tuition right now, it's not reasonable to expect a president to be able to just cut tuition in half without taking away stuff from your campus.\n\nThey didn't just *decide* randomly to raise tuition. Enrollment, student-requested services (i.e. counseling centers and all the other stuff we didn't have 50 years ago), or some other factor made it necessary. If the school is dipping in enrollment or donations, there isn't a lot of other stuff they can do in the short-term to keep things solvent besides change tuition or fire people.\n\nYou misunderstand Ayn Rand like the other commenter said.

The bar for hiring is extremely high, almost no one in the field actually wants to do it because it's so demanding, and you need stellar management experience along with the educational background. When they hire this person, they can spend months on a search just to pick them. Most jobs want two-weeks notice so they can find a replacement -- people in these positions could be giving 6 month notices.\n\nAnd it's really not about \"what is enough to compensate\". If a person can bring in $10m more worth of benefit compared to someone else, then a $700k salary is not a waste. It's not like a manual labor job where everyone provides comparable benefit.",

      "text": "It's rather simple when you actually break it down financially. Those positions getting bonuses/raises are a lot different than most faculty positions in the sense that they are more performance oriented and based on creating value. The school pays well for a head of marketing or university president because they expect that it will pay itself back and more via enrollment and alumni donations. So you have to consider it in terms of what they are getting back from the investment and not just what they are paying to keep those people. The net benefit is generally supposed to be positive even when they pay them a ton of money. It might not always end up like that, but generally that happens if the board is picking good people. They might get paid $300,000 more than a faculty member but they might also bring in a few extra million to the university each year compared to other people they could have hired (this is the goal when they look for a president, at least).\n\nUniversities have a board of regents or trustees and those people oversee the hiring of university presidents. They are tasked to do what is best for the university in the long-term and that often includes paying more for a certain person when it makes sense as an investment. Think about it this way: would you rather hire a $50 accountant that projects $300 in tax savings or a $500 accountant that projects $1200 in tax savings?",
