  "text": " hello guys, I am sorry to bother you, I would like to have your advice on something, I had an exam in statistics and I learned the whole content of the class, all the material from a to z even the little details and i am 100% sure i didn't miss anything,  however, i didn't get the max grade, I really don't understand and I have the impression that they were questions on things that we didn't cover in the material, maybe my methods of studying are bad? i really don't any methods since I only began working hard in June of this year, any advice or ideas to improve my study methods ? thanks 1000 times!",
