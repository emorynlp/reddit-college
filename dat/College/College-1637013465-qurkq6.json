  "text": "Currently doing pretty poor in one of my classes due to my mental and physical health, as well as a part time job that\u2019s kicking my ass. My prof messaged me about my grade asking if I was ok and I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m generally anxious when talking to my profs anyways. Thoughts?",
