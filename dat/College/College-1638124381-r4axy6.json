      "text": "It depends what you want to do, how good you are at political science, and where you live/want to live.\n\nWant to be an analyst for a political organization/think tank and live near D.C.? Plenty of jobs! Some pay well, others do not. Regardless, the connections would open new opportunities.  \nWant to become a diplomat and are academically talented in Poli-Sci? That's possible too (but be prepared to move across the globe), and pay is pretty decent (I have many friends who went into the diplomatic service).  \nWant to work for an NGO and live near D.C. or NYC or are unafraid of living in 3rd world countries? That's also possible. You won't be a millionaire but you will live an interesting life.  \nWant to aid politicians, be they local, state, or federal? Make the right connections and it's possible, pay varies.  \nWant to work in policy and live near D.C. or a state capital? Those jobs are also in constant demand. Again, pay varies.\n\nAre there those Poli-Sci majors who end up in completely different fields? Absolutely, I know unemployed CS, IT, and Engineering majors though also. Is Poli-Sci a quick way to be a millionaire? No. If you love it though, it might be worth it, putting a value on passion is famously impossible.",

      "text": "My original degree was in Political Science.  I had wanted to work in the public sector, and after graduating I worked for 13 years in a large state social services agency.  Consequently, it was a good degree for me.  I did return to college in my 30s, however, for a mid-life career change.\n\nBased on your message, I would have to say its not a good degree for you.  Political Science has very little to do with current issues or political campaigns.  Rather, its the study of government and its related institutions.  Students who expect \"liberals v. conservatives\" or \"Democrats v. Republicans\" style discussions are often disappointed.",
