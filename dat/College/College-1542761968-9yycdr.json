  "text": "I remember last year I was so excited and a little homesick to fly back home and it just felt really good and comfortable being with my family. But this year\nit just sort of feels like I\u2019m an outsider at times. My younger sibling is already getting ready for college and my parents are low key getting old which sort of makes me sad. Even little shit like moving random boxes in my old room or forgetting where the new spot where they put the car keys makes me feel strange. \n\nEven when i go to certain local spots I used to go to all the time, home in general, just feels like another place....i told my dad how i felt and he just said it\u2019s part of growing up and finding yourself but idk how to feel rn lol. \n\n***edit*** : i didn\u2019t know so people could relate lol. Thanks y\u2019all...bless up \ud83d\ude4f",

The feeling is never going to go the other way.\n\nAs you form new relationships and new places become home to you, your childhood home becomes less and less of a home. \n\nIn the last 10 years or so mine has gone from a place where I wanted to go back for a week at a time, to a place to visit on the weekend, to a place that\u2019s really best for a day trip.\n\nAs another poster said, you\u2019ll feel this way about college eventually as well. What you think is nostalgia for a place is actually nostalgia for a place in time that you can never go back to. I\u2019m not nostalgic for my college apartment, I\u2019m nostalgic for the time I spent there with three close friends and my girlfriend in 2006.",

Before coming to school, your life revolves around you coming home to your parents and immediate family. Over the span of 3-4 years you\u2019re away from all of that, so the few times you come home, you start to realize the change as if it happened abruptly. I just drove home last night from my university, and you can see this mall from the highway when I\u2019m a few miles out from my neighborhood. They changed the sign that was visible to oncoming traffic, after it literally being there since the mall was built. It made me reflect like hell, all of a sudden with no warning this personal landmark of me being home was demolished and replaced with something new and a bit bizarre looking. We\u2019re getting old, our family and friends are too. It\u2019s just life lmao.",

To figure out exactly what you have missed. And I know it's hard to keep in contact with people because our lives can be so distracting and busy.

Those spots you used to hang out aren't usually going to overnight change clientele.

Then another year goes by and the rest of the people you know have moved on. It took two years to happen, but because you weren't there, the change seems drastic. Also, if you hadn't left town and kept going to that place, you'd have just befriended the new regulars and it would still feel comfortable.\n\nAlso something you'll notice at your age is, you are still evolving as a person. You'll start to find that when you spend time with people from an earlier era, you'll kind of slip back into your old persona when you're with them. Part of it is that our roles change depending on the social situation anyway, and part of it is, people are really resistant to their friends changing and unintentionally force you into your old role.",

Also, your parents will love you for visiting. ",

Home will feel more and more different until you realize it's not really your home anymore, or your room, it's your parents. But by that time, you'll have your own place (dorm, rented with friends, etc) that will become home. Eventually, I came to realize that home is where you spend your time the most and where you feel loved. And that you can make your home anywhere you choose. Things will never be the same, but that's life. It's all part of that beautiful, melancholic transition into full on adulthood.",

The novel covers the span of time from Eugene's birth to the age of 19. The setting is the fictional town and state of Altamont, Catawba, a fictionalization of his home town, Asheville, North Carolina. Playwright Ketti Frings wrote a theatrical adaptation of Wolfe's work in a 1957 play of the same title.",

No one to say \"you are doing this tomorrow night\" without regard to my prior plans. No one to harass me about my homework grades if I'm struggling with something.\n\nWeek long breaks like Thanksgiving and Spring Break are the easiest for me to cope with, because it's short lived and everything stays relatively amicable. Winter break is volatile, as it's just long enough for their old tendencies of treating me like a high schooler start to pop back up. Summer breaks can be pretty hellish for me, because they reinstate those controlling rules like an early curfew (that's like 4 hours before times I come home at college lmao) and wanting to know where I am and who I am with at ALL times and how much money I'm 'wasting' and why I'm friends with certain people that are 'going nowhere in life'.",

But when you go back you're faced with your old life, but also the prospect that no-one else is changing, growing, or becoming anything other than what they were a year ago, two years ago, ten years ago. \n\nThere are times when I have returned \"home,\" and notice I might fall into an old habit or old way of thinking and then catch myself and all I can think is how disgusted I am by everything.\n\nThese days I can only put on the mask so long with my family that I usually burn out after 3 days.\n\nI once tried hanging out with my old friend from highschool and it was just like highschool. The contrast made me realize how different I had become, and how much better my friendships were in gradschool. I actually hung out with people I liked, and who were nice to me, and liked the same activities I did. I realized that what my old friend thought were \"friendly jabs\" was just him being an asshole, and sorry bro but no I don't want to sit around smoking cigarettes and getting drunk playing cards against and listen to your racist jokes -- I have a literal mountain to go climb and a Geeks Who Drink quiz night with nice people.\n\nThey thought I went to college and left the community. \n\nI did.\n\nRight now I'm trying to figure out how to convince my mom to leave too, because I don't want to return anymore, but I don't want her stuck there either.",

I can physically see my parents getting older every time I see them and my dad is getting closer and closer to retirement.  \n\nI think what really gets me though is the lack of good friends around. I've drifted from my high school friends a bit. I've been home for break since Saturday and I haven't made plans to hang out with anyone. At college I have many friends within a mile radius: In my dorm, in my classes, at clubs, at dining halls, all within a short walk away but now we're scattered about. This is somewhat my own fault, but I feel isolated whenever I'm home.  \n\nIf your hometown doesn't feel like home to you anymore, does your campus feel like your new home? ",

I talk to all my old friends there, and I'm making plans with them for when all of us are out of school, and that's great, but there's a consequence there too. I don't feel connected to my school. The place I'm going to be spending most of my time for the next 4 years doesn't feel like home to me. Maybe it'll be different when I transfer (I was optioned to a satellite campus in a tiny little town, my main campus which has my major at it is in a big city), but right now it just means that even though I have friends and a social life here, I just feel lonely and homesick all the time. What I'm saying is there's two sides to every coin. To agree with what most everyone else is saying, this is part of life. You'll be ok.",

Nobody I recognized. \n\nI then went across to the music building where the other half of my time was spent, and while the layout of the main building hadn\u2019t changed, the people were all new, and seeing my old professors was great, but it didn\u2019t have that same \u201cI\u2019m home\u201d (or occasionally \u201coh fuck there\u2019s a test today\u201d) feeling it had while I was in college. \n\nI like being my own person and having a job and my own hobbies as an adult now, but damn if I don\u2019t miss college sometimes, or at the very least the notion of certain places feeling like home.

As  you grew older you will make your own home just like your parents did and hopefully you\u2019ll have new memories and feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly weird that feeling when your at dorms for a few weeks you go back home and everything has changed. Even your community has changed, you notice so much more and you realise how fast life is moving. ",

I know the feels though, I remember going through it, and every now and again that feeling still finds a way to come back.",

They have problems and flaws just like you do. In fact your parents and siblings might not even be people you would want to spend time with if they weren't your family.  College gives you a great opportunity to really choose a peer group.  Going home that first time, for some, you may realize that you would much rather spend time with those new friends than your family.\n\nI hear some people have normal families full of normal people.  I'm not sure what that is like, but I bet their Thanksgiving arent dreadful.  \n",
