  "text": "Im currently in Junior Year of High School, currently taking 2 APs and last year took 1 AP. My plan is to graduate College as early as possible seeing some of my family members did it in 3 years rather than 4. My mom recommends I go to community college for 2 years then transfer to a UC for Business (which is the degree ive wanted since Freshman year) and thats over with. But I was wondering If I go to a community college for 2 years then go to a UC can I still graduate a year early? How does this work and how can I start doing it?",

      "text": "To graduate a year early you need to take roughly 130% of a normal workload. You have some of that covered with AP credits but that likely will only add up to half of one semester assuming you get the required score on the exams. See if your hs does dual credit, I just had to pay like $200 per class and got college credit for classes I had to take anyway in high school. Also look into taking one (1) class per semester your senior year. Thats a lot but it seems you could handle it and itll get you used to the rigor of a college class. Community classes offer a lot of nighttime classes like 6-9pm or something so as long as you can get yourself there it wouldnt clash with high school. \n\nSo once you get to college, a normal courseload is 12 credits. By my mental math, if you took 16 credits each of the 6 semesters (3 years) you would graduate a year early. But. I know youre probably very very smart, but 16 credits means youll be spending 50+ hours a week either in class or studying. Its a huge time commitment. You cant really work more than 10ish hours and you couldnt join 3 clubs most likely. Its just, a lot, is my point. What you could do instead is taking 16 credits your first year since those classes will be easier compared to later on, and take classes in the summer session. Summer classes are nuts, they cover a semesters worth of content in 5ish weeks. Class 5 days a week for 3 hours or so. If you take 2 or 3 classes over the summer then you wont need to take as many credits during the regular semester. Some schools have winter sessions too over Christmas break. The best path forward is probably a combination of everything I've said, whatever works for you is what you should do *but* you dont know what works for you until you do it. There is *no shame* in dropping a class once you realize you simply cant manage everything you signed up for. In my opinion its better to graduate later and do well than graduate sooner but with worse grades. If graduating early is that important to you, just realize it will come at a significant cost and sacrifice of time. While your friends are going out on friday night youll likely have to pass a lot of the time to study organic chem or whatever. Its a tradeoff. \n\nTo answer your specific question \n\n>But I was wondering If I go to a community college for 2 years then go to a UC can I still graduate a year early?\n\nBefore you go anywhere, email admissions at the 4 year school and double check that the classes you plan to take at the community college will be accepted by them. If you have a choice between which courses to take, such as physics 1 and 2 or organic chem 1 and 2, again ask admissions at the 4 year school for advice. The vast majority of your community college credits should transfer, but unlikely every single one of them will. Thats fine. Going to cc first is something I should have done, its usually less intense especially for freshmen and eases you into the college experience and the professors tend to be more engaged since theyre likely only there to teach, not also do research which is the case at 4 year schools. If you have any more questions let me know, hope i helped!\n\nAlso holy shit I wrote a lot lol",

          "text": "Im not sure how well that would work. By dual enrollment do you mean attend both high school and college full time? I dont know how manageable thatd be. And if you mean getting college credit for your high school classes, that really just isnt offered on a scale like that, its a few select classes. And even if you could do that its very unlikely that their high school classes would correspond exactly to 2 years of an undergad degree",

College courses in some states count for a whole high school course so you still graduate from high school with that coursework, but it's real college classes. You could take summer school and pick up more while in high school too. \n\nI've taken some at ea.asu.edu that are open enrollment. Anyone can sign up for $25, some are self paced but most are in 8 week terms so really fast. If you want the credit, you pay $400 at the end after you see your grade. They transfer just about everywhere too. My brother ended up staying at ASU for his degree so these wee in his degree plan.",
