A fucking week, it really kinda sucks because it\u2019s like I legit have to cancel plans so I can study/read/write a paper or oh let\u2019s not forget the robotic basic ass Discussion boards every week that absolutely NOBODY tries on.  What\u2019s up with that shit anyways? It\u2019s always the same: \u201cthis article really opened my eyes\u201d or \u201cI was blown away and now have changed my ways after reading this\u201d like always making some\nBig ass display of empty assertions describing the articles impact on some idea it presented to them. Oh then there\u2019s my personal favorite \u201cnice post today!\u201d *insert complimentary, enlightening detail about the other persons post while using words like: \u201cI, too also think this way\u201d or \u201cSusan, I agree and I must say, great minds must think alike!\u201d*.\nThen you got the professor who\u2019s painfully responding to all this shit who\u2019s probably just as thrilled as we are to be here.",

Because of getting ahead, I only took the bare minimum for full time and was able to graduate a semester early. I promise it's worth it! \n\nMy Master's also required summer classes, as does my next degree. Those kinda suck because they're cohorts and you're not getting ahead; it's the natural progression, not an acceleration. \n\nBest of luck! No one likes taking classes when they could be relaxing, but you're making senior-year you very happy!",

I was originally scheduled for summer classes this year but the other day I finally said screw it and dropped them.

Having no time for yourself is so draining, it\u2019s constantly school, work, more school. I\u2019m taking the summer to finally get my mental state back to where it needs to be.",

If you have units even from other universities or other degree tracks above what your degree needs they put you on probation meaning they refuse to process your fafsa. I caught them giving me conflicting information so much that only their admin is allowed to respond to my emails now, because I keep involving title 9, disability services, and other administration whenever I get two different sets of instructions. It is legal but they should be forced to give the correct info for appeals the first time as to avoid preventing disabled students and people who got their GEDs at a community College from completing their degree. It's entirely descriminatory. If it wasn't, they wouldn't back down every time I bring up how awful their policy is for the downtrodden. )",

Basically, it's one of those junk classes that you forget since it doesn't take any relevance in your life beyond the class & requirement.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and as far as the discussion boards.

      "text": "I\u2019m taking two courses this summer for the first time. I decided to take them now because I\u2019m gonna be studying abroad in France for a year. \n\n\nReason I gotta take the two courses (WRLD 302 and UNIV 200) is because the UNIV 200 is a prerequisite to the senior capstone seminar I have to take when I get back so I can graduate Fall 2020. And for some reason, WRLD 302 is a class that can\u2019t be transferred from another university, I absolutely have to take it at my college. Both courses are online and at least WRLD 302 is fun and easy, don\u2019t know why it absolutely needed to be taken at the college tho. I\u2019m prolly signed up for a similar course in France that woulda given me credit in it. And UNIV 200 is a stupid university college course that\u2019s the last part of a sequence. Basically like a glorified high school English class and being retaught how to write a research paper and shit. This is the one that just assigns a lot of busywork for no reason except to have grades to make the class not seem like a waste of time or a money grab.",

My family doesn't have the money and the money I do have goes to other things like rent, food, and car insurance. Without FAFSA I would not be able to go to school at ALLL and getting a summer loan is challenging.\n\nSome advice:\n\nRATHER, be grateful that you get the chance not only to go to school but get to finish early! Be grateful! How you said you're kinda bitter, I'm kinda bitter at your post. Maybe giving you a different perspective. Maybe your bitterness will fade into gratitude.",
