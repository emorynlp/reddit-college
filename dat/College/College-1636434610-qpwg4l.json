Put on some music or a podcast, and just go. \n\nI have family a few hours from my school, and I have a key to their house with an open door policy. So sometimes I'll drive out there at night with my angry music and can scream or cry, crash on their couch when I get there, have breakfast with them the next morning, then come back to school. \n\nLast option is going to my boyfriend's house, taking our dog out for a run, then playing video games with him when he gets off work.",

      "text": "I\u2019d like to say thank you on behalf of your roommate as my roommate this year does not have this concept of respecting that I\u2019m also in our place so he just yells and says shit like \u201cwe have never failed a class before\u201d to himself over and over and other shit too while I\u2019m over here like \u201cthanks for flexing I guess I failed several classes last year\u201d it is awfully annoying and so irritating. He also bangs on the wall and slams doors, again fucking annoying. I feel for him but also I can\u2019t cause we don\u2019t talk and I try to talk but it goes no where like 90 percent of the time. I wanna care but he doesn\u2019t give me many reasons to in short. (Might be selfish but I can only do so much) \n\nON THE OTHER HAND I feel ya and yeah you gotta let that frustration out. You can vent just like I did I\u2019m all ears or you can get a journal and write about deep feelings and all of that. I do that and it does help. For crying in private I don\u2019t know I\u2019d say do it when nobody is home if not then maybe in your car if you have one or maybe a private area in a park that is SAFE. (Please make sure it\u2019s safe lol) maybe do it in the day too so that sunlight can dry those tears of yours and boost your mood from that vitamin D your getting. \n\nThis is hella long but I truly hope you find what works for you cause you deserve that relief of pent up emotions in a comfortable way. I hope you have an overall good semester and be able to see all the good you do no matter how small and see self improvement no matter where you are in life.  Have a good one and much love to you.",
