  "text": "I really dont know how to frame this so bear with me. I'm a junior in college looking to transfer soon. Like some people I didn't really know what I wanted to do out of high school so I took the community route and chose psych as my major. Some time passes and I now have enough credits to transfer. However, I don't really think I want to do psych anymore and I really didn't think I ever wanted to tbh. I don't really know what I like to study. I have no burning interest that I would like to dedicate my life too. It's a long shot, but frankly, I'm stuck. I'm still young at 21 but I want to get started on my path and I was wondering if a time hd any advice or life experience about this kinda stuff? Maybe even help steer me in a direction? \n\nIf you care:\n3.2-3.6 grade average. Some things about me is I think alot. Often trapped in my head. I'm introverted but don't mind talking to people. I prefer working alone or with a small group. I'm curious. I like the general concept of science. I don't hate math but I wouldn't say I'm great at it either,\nbut it's probably because I haven't had any personal drive to. My goal is for my career to be mainly self fulfilling, I'm not trying to be super rich in my career I'm just trying to make enough to get by yet not having to constantly worry about financials. \n\nAny help is appreciated :)",
