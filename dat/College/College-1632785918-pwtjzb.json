  "text": "So I\u2019m on my second week of college. No friends yet. It seems like everyone has already made groups and I just feel like an outsider. I also witnessed my dorm neighbor  already get laid with his door open like bro common I really don\u2019t need to see that. I\u2019ve tried leaving my door open but no one has stopped by to say hello. I even gave the rest of my cookies away for FREE to some girls but that didn\u2019t really go anywhere besides them being very appreciative. I introduced myself to some people in class but yet again, It went nowhere further than small talk. Is it going to be like this for the rest of college?",

      "text": "Join a club and keep going back. A lot of people won\u2019t make friends after the first meeting but you will if you keep going! Not everything can be accomplished after a few impressions. I am not someone who gives amazing first impressions, but I am the person who keeps showing up and that in itself is my impression on others.\n\nTalk to table mates or your neighbors in your unassigned assigned seats. If people switch it up regularly, try to sit by people you admire in the class. It elevates your learning ability if you can ask your peers questions sometimes and if they are smarter in the subject and can help raise you to their level. \n\nIt is not like that for all of college. The more you get into your niche classes for your major, the more personable it gets and the more you\u2019ll share classes with the same people. If you focus on excelling in your subject and your career goals, others will certainly take notice!",

      "text": "I can\u2019t give you the best advice Bc I\u2019m a freshman and most of my college friends either knew me from home or we went to the same school. But what I can give you is, just go with flow and keep being friendly and just chill. College won\u2019t be like this forever just because you don\u2019t have any friends right now doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t tomorrow college is what you make it. \n\nAnd on small talk, if you want to go farther than small talk you gotta take the lead and ask questions that dig deeper be like one of those annoying reporters and just ask questions until the ball gets rolling, people LOVE talking about themselves. One good question that works is asking about hobbies and following up with why they enjoy it you\u2019re getting deeper and more into their lives which not only shows interest but makes them talk about themselves more and be more open and possibly develop a friendship and if you can even ask to join them next time if it seems like something you would like. \n\nAnd don\u2019t leave your door open most people are going to mind their own business they got better things to do than go into some random persons dorm not trying to be rude just being honest. \n\nBut here\u2019s the best advice I can give you man just relax enjoy your free time and remember to be yourself I\u2019ve seen people change in a week because they wanted to fit in and it always went south.",
