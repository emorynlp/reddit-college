I wrote my papers & studied on my phone while nursing my son to sleep. Because of the breastfeeding I could only have 1 cup of coffee a day. I also had to take the bus to campus with my son, the handicap section was often full, so no stroller, just baby wearing & took all my school stuff & his stuff with me leaving a water bottle to put all the food in I could eat that day until I got home at 6pm that night.\n\nI had started my degree 12 years prior and it is not something I practiced or studied for most of that time. (I did take 1 term when I was pregnant, then 1 term a couple years before that).\n\nDuring my 300 & 400 level classes I had no idea what people where talking about 50% of the time. Was it the hunger, sleep deprivation, or lack of vocabulary on my part that was causing this? Lol. It\u2019s been 2 years and those last two terms were a complete blur.\n\nI still audit one class a term now (my husband works on campus & its free). It\u2019s amazing how exciting and interesting a class is when you can get okay sleep, are interested in it, and won\u2019t be tested.",
