  "title:": "As much as I love chemistry and biology and would love a double degree, I don\u2019t think I can do chemistry anymore. I need advice",
  "text": "I think I have to stick with just biology, which is my main passion anyway. I just cannot do the math or remember the formulas required for chemistry (or even the precalc class I had to drop just because I couldn\u2019t get it). With biology it\u2019s one of the most interesting things to me and I know far beyond what I\u2019ve learned in class because I\u2019ve learned on my own time. I want to keep learning more and I\u2019m really great at retaining information when it comes to fields where it\u2019s all about making connections, and I\u2019m good at this with chemistry too, until it gets to the math. Then I\u2019m lost. It\u2019s crazy how I can skim through chapters from my bio textbook once and I can retain and understand nearly all of what I read, but I can\u2019t even a remember a couple simple formulas from my chemistry class. I love the written portions of chemistry, like gas laws, balancing equations, properties of elements, etc. but I can\u2019t do the math that goes along with it, and it sucks because I\u2019d like to keep up with it but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s within my ability. I would just hate to drop this course after dropping precalc already because it\u2019s worth 5 credits and it\u2019s a requirement for a bio major. The content won\u2019t change if I take it later and I\u2019m failing and were half way through the semester so I don\u2019t know if I can even fix this, but I think the stress just isn\u2019t worth it. I don\u2019t know what to do. I know I\u2019m not going to do it as a second major anymore but I still need the credits and will probably have to take gen chem II and organic chem as well later on.",

      "text": "Sounds like you need remediation in your math skills. Unless you have a learning disability like dyscalculia, you are entirely capable of learning how to do the math but probably just never learned. Many k-12 schools are absolutely horrendous at teaching math, and tbh I think some kids come out of the education system worse than if they had never \"learned\" anything beyond arithmetic because they get conditioned to believe that math is some sort of confusing \"scary\" thing that they'll never be able to wrap their minds around.\n\nRealistically, chances are you can learn, and that once you learn the basic math, you'll be able to get through chemistry just fine. I suggest using khan academy, as well as going to your school's tutoring center to help you with your current chemistry course.\n\nEdit:\n\n> I\u2019m really great at retaining information when it comes to fields where it\u2019s all about making connections\n\nThat literally describes everything in the field of math. The fact that you don't recognize this is further evidence to me that you've been taught math badly in the past (good teachers should help students make connections, even if sometimes they have to do it explicitly). To be fair, most if not all fields are about making connections, so keep that in mind when you take any class you're not comfortable with, but math is *far* from an exception.",
