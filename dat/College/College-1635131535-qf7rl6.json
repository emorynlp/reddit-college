  "text": "Hey, a class I'm in has split up the class into many 2-man groups for a paper and presentation. My groupmate (a phenomenal individual, taken many classes with them) made a schedule of who does what and when for the many parts of the project. I've been trying my best and have been finishing my work by the scheduled time, but they've been jumping way past the schedule and have been doing parts of the assignment they assigned to me. With how much work I have plus other classes, I've been trying to keep up but I can't.... Should I just let them do their thing? Thanks.",
