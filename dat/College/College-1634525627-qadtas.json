  "text": "So there\u2019s a first year social event at my school, and I want to go as I haven\u2019t made any real friends so far (small college, not living on campus).  But I also doubt that attending an officially organized \u201csocial\u201d (on campus during the day, so no alcohol) would be too conducive to making friends.  I already have social anxiety, so under the contrived conditions of just being in a room with a bunch of random students with the expectation of us sparking up conversations with each other, I doubt I\u2019d have a great experience.  My suspicion is that it\u2019s being held this late in the term, as people will have had enough time to make friends and are expected to know many people already.\n\nHave any of you attended a similar type of event, and what was it like?  Would it be awkward to go alone? (Like who exactly is this type of event designed for - people like me who haven\u2019t made many friends yet, or people who have lots of friends who they\u2019d be going with?)  And are there generally activities which facilitate social interaction with people you haven\u2019t met?",
