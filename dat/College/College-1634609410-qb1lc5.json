  "title:": "why is it acceptable for college professors to do the bare minimum in teaching?",
  "text": "as a freshman, professors often say that students shouldn't take it out on other professors that don't teach the lesson fully (some don't even teach at all), because college students should be the one responsible for what that.. basically we're all just here to self-study our way in to get that degree\n\nit just boggles me how that is normalized! i get it if the students are from state universities, but as someone that's in a private college ? like, students pay to learn, just as how they pay for their highschool education, then why is it okay for professors to do the bare minimum?!?! \n\ni get it that these are \"lessons\" to adulthood, that we're not children anymore that needs to be spoon fed to understand whatever's being discussed, but what, some college profs just read the textbook out loud especially in this online setup (reading the text that's being presented), not even bothering to explain the textbook terms etc.\n\nand i also understand that as college students, we should definitely strive or learn on our own, i just dont get it how professors use this as an excuse to not teach efficiently.",

It takes too much time to explain basic concepts in higher divisional courses to cover all of the material. Introducing concepts is also the goal, not comprehensive (all-inclusive) teaching, as this only presents the information and requires very little critical thinking (produces students who just regurgitate facts and figures, and typically struggle answering questions on critical thinking in an independent manner).",

There's literally not enough time for your professors to cover, in class, everything you need to know.\n\ni didn't say that i need to know everything, just what's being discussed. usually they tell the class the learning competencies and what lessons will be covered. back in highschool of course i do my own research as well, but my professor really just spewed out that they shouldn't take the blame, for literally not teaching everything or not teaching what's supposed to be taught 'fully'. now that we're online its easy to search off the internet in real time for terms that we don't understand, but when in actual classes, altho i haven't experienced them yet, i think it'll be hard to catch up in class for others who don't have the resources (like cellular data during class) and must only raise concerns during class or consultation hours as you said. \n\nits true that there are highschools here in my country that have no tuition, and it's true that i did not pay for my highschool education either, because i studied in a stem / science highschool, but with those, highschool teachers are much more efficient compared to some college professors, even though their salaries differ by a whole lot. (only considering that their in public vs private institutions)\n\nall im saying is, i don't get how some professors just sit there and act like they did everything they could do to teach, and some even use the 'if others can do it, then you can do it' encouragement. \n\nidk where this is going i just needed a quick rant \u3160\u3160 some of my blockmates have no background of some science/math subjects (bc they are from different strands) and so listening to class and not being able to understand basic and general terms would definitely be frustrating at least, + when ur prof just reads the ppt.",

Your school will have WiFi, accessible computers, and a library. People had to do this stuff before wireless internet. You're not being tasked with any new challenges. \n\n>highschool teachers are much more efficient compared to some college professors, even though their salaries differ by a whole lot. \n\nIn high school you were a child and it was expected that your teachers would feed everything to you. This is no longer the case. You are responsible for your education. The reduced contact hours of a college class, and the increased scope of what needs to be covered, means you need to do more work on your end. It's *supposed* to be different from high school. \n\n>all im saying is, i don't get how some professors just sit there and act like they did everything they could do to teach,\n\nYou need to change your thinking. In high school, in-class time was *the whole course*, besides just doing homework. In college, this is no longer true. The time you spend in class is *part* of the course, but not all of it, or even most. It's a common rule of thumb that you should spend 3 hours of independent study for every one hour of class time. This is mostly true. It's on you now.",
