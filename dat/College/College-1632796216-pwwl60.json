  "text": "Hello,   \n\n\nI've been debating on changing from my associate in CIT at a local community college to an associate of science. My first and foremost question is, what can I do with each degree? I live in rural KY, so the job market isn't very competitive for STEM fields. (To my benefit.)    \n\n\nI plan on taking the CompTIA A+ on my own, and earning some more certs on my own as a safety net so I can get an IT job. But what can I do with associate in science? I love ecology and would love to work with nature. I've considered getting a bachelors in the future, but I just want to make a two-year plan for now.",

      "text": "An Associate of Science will prepare you for transferring to a University to pursue a 4-year degree. Most other 2-year degree types I've seen are simply there to get you job-ready in two years. This is great unless you are planning on getting a 4-year degree as most classes from those degrees aren't transferable. So, if you get one and then end up pursuing a Bachelors, then you'll likely end up having to retake most classes you thought you could transfer.",
