  "title:": "Should I quit my new job",
  "text": "I've recently got a new job, but it's hard to keep it since it does overlap with my class schedule, and it's stressing me out. I've only been working for a few weeks, and I'm really considering quitting. Not only that, but I also don't want to quit this soon in the job, since it will probably look bad in the future. So should I really quit my new job? \n\nEdit: I know it's kinda funny asking the internet, but I like to see other people's opinions.",

      "text": "Wait is this a full time job?  Or a part time while in college job?  Because if the former, I get it it's tough to quit.  If it is part time while you're full time college, definitely understandable to quit and also you don't need to list the job on your resume.  Seems like you worked there for a hot second anyway if you quit now.",
