  "text": "Hey guys, I'm curious about how students and younger people generally feel about social media and the role it plays in their lives nowadays. When I talk to my peers, it seems like most people understand the negative impacts that social media and tech can have, but no one really does much about it. I took about a year hiatus from all social media recently, and have found it hard to incorporate it into my life in way that feels useful and healthy.\n\nWhat are your general thoughts about social media and what role does it play in your life? Do you like it? Dislike it? Do you find it to be a big distraction, or are you able to manage your usage?\n\nI'm researching this topic as part of my degree project for my Industrial Design BFA (and I'm also just curious about this for my own sake), so I would appreciate any input . I also have a quick survey you can take [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffWyvUBH-3iTmKdcrd66vcc_ATkh37IkmzHKMKuZ-HVYNKDA/viewform?usp=sf_link) that briefly touches on remote work and time management as well. Any responses will help (I'm not sure if including that link is against the sub's rules so if it is pls lmk and I'll remove it)",
