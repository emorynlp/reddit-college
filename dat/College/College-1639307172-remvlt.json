      "text": "Hi! Accounting & MIS double major here. I\u2019m not graduating yet but this upcoming summer I have an internship at the accounting firm Deloitte. When applying for internships you just have to apply to as many as you can and do things that diversify you from others (for example mine is that I am a dual major in ACCT/MIS). As for the pay, it is really well. I have friends who are going into Tax at Deloitte (they have a full time offer upon graduation in the spring). Pay varies by location but they making 65k and 75k, directly out of college!",

Of course I\u2019d like it to be well paid. I\u2019d be happy to learn management, marketing, perhaps something related to psychology since I know it helps with managing people, and some analytical skills be it business analytics or big data and quantitative marketing. What are your opinions? I\u2019m keen on knowing how people think so please feel free to be completely honest.",
