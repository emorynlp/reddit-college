  "text": "Hey, I have two undergrad degrees in supply chain and management. A masters in supply chain and currently studying masters in project management. All my gpa's are 3.75+\n\nMy work pays for unlimited education for anything that pertains to the employer. I'm thinking about studying STEM for my next degree but can't decide on a major.\n\nThe options I have thought of so far are:\n\nBachelors from Arizona State from an ABET accredited Information Technology Degree\n\n[https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-information-technology/](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-information-technology/)\n\nBachelors from Arizona State from an ABET accredited Engineering management Degree\n\n[https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/engineering-engineering-management-bse/](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/engineering-engineering-management-bse/)\n\nBachelors from Oregon State in Computer Science, It's a post bacc\n\n[https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc)\n\nMasters in Systems Engineering from Embry Riddle\n\n[https://erau.edu/degrees/master/ms-systems-engineering](https://erau.edu/degrees/master/ms-systems-engineering)\n\nMaster of Engineering in Quality, Reliability, & Statistical Engineering from Arizona State\n\n[https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/graduate/master-engineering-area-study-quality-reliability-and-statistical/](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/graduate/master-engineering-area-study-quality-reliability-and-statistical/)\n\nMasters of Cyber Security from Georgetown\n\n[https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/484/master-of-professional-studies-in-cybersecurity-risk-management/](https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/484/master-of-professional-studies-in-cybersecurity-risk-management/)\n\nDo you have any other online STEM degrees that you would think would be best? Or maybe some perspective for me?\n\nThis is all for personal challenge so I wouldn't work in the field, I could potentially use some of the learning in my field which is program management. Maybe if I learn how to program I could automate some of my job or use shortcuts. I think also learning a STEM degree will help me understand more when engineers go into the details.",
