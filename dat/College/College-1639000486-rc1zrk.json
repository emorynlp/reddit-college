  "text": "I'd like to take an online beginning Spanish class spring semester.  I was going to take it at Modesto Junior College but the course is full.  MJC has no tuition for spring 2022, which was appealing.  I also looked at College of Marin which also has free courses, but they don't offer it online.  Does anyone know any other community colleges that have free tuition for part-time students next year?  (I'm aware tuition is free for full-time students, but I just want to take the one class.)  Thanks!",
