People are getting scammed on Indeed applying to online positions that are linked to real companies but not actual recruiters.     \nFor some reason, people think text interviews are legit.

Some people even get hired by scammers who use your bank account to transfer money through (money mule) or ask you to be \"quality control\" and repackage and send packages (parcel mule) all of the money and stuff are stolen and you never get paid.",
