  "text": "As the title says, I am extremely nervous to take A&P 2, as I barely passed A&P 1. My final grade with lecture and lab combined was a 71%, so a C. Lab is what saved me, as I did okay in memorization. However, I am terrible with the physiology aspect of it. And I've heard that A&P 2 is very physiology heavy. Anyone find 2 easier? Harder? Words of encouragement? Haha",
