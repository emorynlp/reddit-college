  "text": "Hi all. Next semester is when I really have to try hard, and I'm really nervous about it. This semester I only took 3 classes, with a fourth being only half a semester. So, for the most part, it was only 3 classes I had to take this semester. During the finals, which are this week and next week, I thought it was the most difficult thing I've done, with only 3 finals. Next semester I'm taking 5 classes. Do you guys think I'm over-exerting myself? Should I drop one? I'm just so nervous about me failing. I only go to a community college btw.",

I\u2019m also thinking about taking five classes, and I asked previous students what they thought about those classes, and their response made me drop one class because the workload is challenging. If it doesn\u2019t affect your graduation date, and you know you can handle it, then take 5.",

      "text": "If three felt like too much, you should drop classes 4 and 5. It's better to get good grades in a couple of classes than to overwork yourself. I think it's better to just take your time and enjoy it. Some classes are going to be harder than others but overall they are all time-consuming. College, in general, can feel mentally draining. It's best to take it slow.",
