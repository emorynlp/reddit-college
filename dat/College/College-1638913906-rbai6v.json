  "text": "Hi, \n\nI did an assignment that I had my TA look over a bunch of times before submission and he said it was great you did good. I get the assignment back and I did poorly. I\u2019m really disappointed in myself for the bad grade and I don\u2019t want to seem like a dick going to prof and blaming it all on the TA. I accept some of it was my fault but I think a lot of it was the TA for misleading me. I don\u2019t know if I should just accept the L or what. \n\nI\u2019m writing this pretty upset so this was probably poorly written so if anyone needs me to clarify just ask.",
