  "text": "Okay so for a class we have to work with another person for a final project due at the beginning of December. At first it was fine and she even helped me complete a section on time but since last week she's stopped responding to my emails about the next stage in the project. I even sent her text (which I know she saw) earlier today which she hasn't replied to yet.\n\nMy parents told me to tell my professor and move without her but that feels really rude. I would like to wait more but the next part is time-sensitive and I don't even know if I'll be able to wait another week. Any help?",

I know it feels bad to do that, but it's not on students to make another student do their job, and your teacher may not make it a vocal issue but instead just give you credit for the assignment and not them \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

We're meeting on Zoom rn for Covid-unrelated reasons but it could go to being back in person any moment and she's present in every class.",
