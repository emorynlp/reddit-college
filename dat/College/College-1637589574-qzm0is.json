  "text": "I think I want to go to college for accounting or something in finance ,but I\u2019m not 100% sure yet. obviously I want to make sure I like it. So I think that maybe watching some lesson would be a good way to see if I like it or not. My question is there any free resource that has some filmed lectures like on YouTube or anything? Thank you for any help!",
