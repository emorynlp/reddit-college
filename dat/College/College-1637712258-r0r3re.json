  "title:": "Professor Failing me for my Absences despite a Good Grade in her Class.",
  "text": "Today, my writing class professor emailed me with a bombshell that I cannot no longer \u201ccontinue\u201d her class but can still complete the current assignments that are due. She made this decision on behalf the fact that I missed more than 6 classes for the semester which is the maximum of absences she allows. Once over 6, she will drop/fail you from the class. However, I\u2019ve probably accumulated at least 10 absences. Despite that, I\u2019ve done all my work and currently have a B in her class which I can easily turn into an A. We\u2019ve had a meeting before just her and I discussing my absences. I promised that I would show up to class but that promise obv fell through. And I will admit, in recent weeks, I\u2019ve also been slacking and turning in a few late work but they\u2019re still thoroughly completed. \n\nNgl, majority of the time , I learn little to nothing in her class and I feel as if I\u2019m wasting my money on a useless course (course class) which is one reason I don\u2019t show up. Another reason is my horrible sleep schedule.\n\nDo you guys think this is a fair decision? \n\nIf so, what\u2019s the reasons?\n\nIf not, what should I do?\n\nAlso, do colleges charge you extra money to retake a class esp if it\u2019s a mandatory core class?",

      "text": "It\u2019s fair. And honestly that\u2019s a pretty generous number of absences. I\u2019ve had some professors who start dropping grades after 2 unexcused absences. She can grade her class how she sees fit and she sees attendance as important. \n\nIf you had kept your promise and gotten better at attending she might have cut you some slack. But by making a promise and breaking your word, you\u2019ve sent her the message that you don\u2019t care about her class. And if you don\u2019t care enough to show up and turn your work in, then why should she care to grade it? \n\nI understand classes feeling useless sometimes, but if it\u2019s for the grade then it\u2019s worth it. It might be worth it to take the L and drop the class to retake it later with a different prof. Or make a detailed plan and stick to it with how you are going to make her class a priority for the rest of the semester. That\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to work out with her though. \n\nCore classes can be annoying but they\u2019re part of the process \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Learning is more then just doing good on assignments. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s rude to your professor that you wouldn\u2019t show up or turn in assignments on time. Most of my professors don\u2019t accept late work.",
