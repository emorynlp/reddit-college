  "title:": "My Professor played an EPIC prank on us for finals [Help]",
  "text": "My professor said several times the past couple weeks that we had four hours to take our final in a 400 level circuits class. Anyways come finals time today two hours in he walks up to me and says, \"the reaper cometh\" and starts collecting finals. Me and everyone else are like wtf because we thought we still had two hours left but he said he was 'joking'. Now all finals are scheduled in 2 hour slots but we all thought he was giving us extra time to be nice if we needed it. Not once before or during the final did he say we only had 2 hours instead of 4 and never warned us our time was almost up. This man has been teaching the course for years and is tenured, how the hell do you get this far as a professor acting so childish and unprofessional? \nWho can I contact to file a complaint about this, me along with several other people may have failed the course because of this.\n\ntl;dr my professor said we had 4 hours for a final in a 2 hour time slot but collected finals after 2 hours saying he was joking. No one finished because we thought we had extra time. What should I do?",

Let's say this *was* all a joke to your professor and he was planning on giving everyone A's on the final. You go to the chair/dean/etc complaining before you ever get your grade and they might make the professor grade the exams a certain way or make the class retake the exam or etc. Now, you're all getting lower grades when you would have gotten all A's. \n\nOf course if you do get your grade and its bad and everyone else in the class did just as bad, that's when you go up the chain",

There was a guy who had a 4.0 GPA and didn\u2019t want to mess up his GPA so dropped it right before the final (dropping didn\u2019t affect GPA at my uni). Another guy didn\u2019t know how to drop the class and was shitting his pants before final, but he ended up with an A while the 4.0 guy ended up with a W.\n\nEdit: this was also the most rigorous undergrad course and the prof was the most high profile prof at the uni, so when it was time to apply for grad school, I\u2019m ashamed to admit that that A helped me a lot lol.",

At a certain point grades are expected to be finalized and you're just burning your own runway by waiting to submit complaints.\n\nI would immediately reach out to the professor, and depending on his response, decide whether to escalate the issue to higher-ups. My assumption is this guy is going to \"set things right\" with a curve, not a bunch of free A's. If that's the case then complaints need to be submitted regardless of how the curve affects you as a student. Because really, this a botched exam. You can't intentionally mislead students about how much time they have on an exam. If this happened to me and I knew no matter what I was getting an A, I would still complain out of principle. Professors shouldn't be using their students as punchlines for a joke, especially when the joke adversely affects *final* *exam scores*.",
