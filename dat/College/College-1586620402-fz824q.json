  "title:": "I fell asleep in online class and two students went off on me. Is it their business?",
  "text": "So essentially I fell asleep in my 10am camera class Saturdays on zoom while the mic was still on. I am in an ACTING CONSERVATORY/COLLEGE (I get some credits for it too yeah) I only kept the mic on thinking I would get called on and I heard him talking the whole time I was like half asleep. I\u2019m surprised the professor didn\u2019t mute me. Anyways during our 5 minute break (everyone turned the cams off, audio on). I woke up and this one girl went off on me about how I\u2019m rude, I need to leave the chat ect. I apologized and said I won\u2019t do it again my bad. And she continued to go on later once few people joined back. After this matter is it still her business to go off and keep talking about it?\n\nUPDATE : \nShe just tried throwing shots at me with another one of my \u201cfriends\u201d in the comment section. I came off mute and said \u201cit\u2019s not ur fucking business, look btw sir I\u2019m sorry for falling asleep it was uncalled for. I already just apologized to y\u2019all earlier so quit (I was even going to email him!) Student 2 : well then don\u2019t fall asleep in class \u201c Professor : it\u2019s okay guys please let\u2019s do this privately next time, thank god this isn\u2019t recorded\u201d Btw Thanks for advice everyone\n\nUPDATE : \u201cI appreciate your email. As I said before, it's behind us and we're moving forward. I'm eager to see what your group has planned and am looking forward to seeing you next Saturday.\u201d - professor",

I ended up being a very loved or hated individual so I never cared by senior year, but I get it. I'm an online college student now and staying awake can be VERY hard at times. Don't let it get you down, I find the best thing to do is just have a one on one with your professor.",

Now I'm not going to make any harsh judgement, nor did tell him anything about it (because well, it wasn't my business)  but gD was it annoying as hell. I could barely hear the prof despite being in the front, but it was worse when he snored.\n\nAnyway, she could have asked the prof to mute you if it was bad, but to continue talking in the chat after you apologize is pretty bitchy.\n\nThis sounds super immature btw, ignore her next time if she makes snarky comments and mute you shit until the professor wants you to answer, or as needed.That's what I do. All of my shit stays OFF, so I have no mishaps. If he forces you to be on mic, and he doesn't make a comment about it (or mutes you) then you're fine.",

I apologize for the inconvenience but this classroom setting isn't the place for that conversation.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't be too hard on yourself for not \"letting it go,\" though. We're all human and even the most mature adults aren't perfect. :)  You're still in college. I'm assuming you're legally an adult but that doesn't mean that being 18 and older will make you the perfect adult. It's hard to switch that behavior when you're growing up because our brains don't fully mature until the age of 25. You can always improve and change your behavior anytime you want. The important thing is using these experiences as a form of learning and improvement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe in you, OP! Stay strong. :)",

The only person with any reason to be annoyed is your professor, but it sounds like they weren't upset anyway (not surprising, students fall asleep in class all the time in in-person lectures, I can't imagine how bad it is online). The rudeness to disrupt class to \"call you out\" is far above the rudeness of falling asleep.\n\nI do agree with the other comments though, best practice is to mute your mic unless you want to say something. If you're using Zoom, unmuting is as simple as hold space.",
