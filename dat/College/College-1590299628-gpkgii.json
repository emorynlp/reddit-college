  "text": "I just feel stuck. I don\u2019t qualify for financial aid or FASFA (parents make over $200,000 a year). I\u2019ve been applying for scholarships and saving up my money. Yet, I still don\u2019t have enough to provide for myself while at college. I\u2019m so sad, and lonely, and I want to give up. But most of all. I\u2019m angry. My parents make all this money, buy all these expansive things, but yet decided not to put any money down for college. My parents told me that they\u2019re not going to help. That I have to pay for my own tuition. Yet, they can afford it, but refuse to. And I just want to know...why. Why don\u2019t they want to help their children? My brother had to drop out of college because he couldn\u2019t afford it (even with getting loans) and now he\u2019s working two jobs trying to pay off his debt, provide for himself, and save up for college. And when I see him he just looks so sad. My sister is the same. Lost when it comes to college and all 3 of us are just tying to figure it out. My mom told me \u201cWhen you leave you\u2019re not going to make it. And you\u2019re not going to succeed in school either\u201d. And it hurt. And being in your early 20s has to be so confusing. Please some words of encouragement would be nice.\n\nEDIT: I want to say thank you for every single one of you that has responded. I appreciate the tough love, and also the ones who are understanding. Thank you all for the encouragement.\n\nEDIT2: This support is amazing. I\u2019ve learned so much from everyone and I wish I could thank you all 1000x. The motivation y\u2019all gave is more than my own parents! (Btw. I\u2019m a girl, for the ones saying \u201chim\u201d and \u201che\u201d).",

Which made it really hard for me to go to school especially since my parents wouldn't help watch my kiddo either. (Not that I expected them too, to be clear.)  \n\n\nI'm now 35 and finally transferring to Oregon State to finish up my degree in Horticulture, and  my dad is still floating through life with the free house his mom gave him and has never offered me a dime, despite me working and homeschooling my kids while attempting this education thingy.   \n\n\nIt is what it is, and we make the best out of it, but my motivation to finish school now is to make enough to help my kids through college if they decide to go. Life doesn't need to be made even harder by selfish boomer parents IMO.",

I'm a sophomore in high school (junior this august) and for years my parents have been heavily pushing college onto me and my siblings, but also saying that they won't pay for it. I totally understand your frustrations because my parents also make close to what your parents make. It is absolutely frustrating seeing 2 to 10 amazon packages a week which are usually useless things. It sucks seeing my parents buy random and useless stuff that is expensive when they wont even put money towards college. My mom even asked me \"how do parents even pay for college?\". They're either rich or saved money to do so.... like what?? Anyway, I totally understand! I plan to pay for college by joining the military (most likely air force). I've had multiple teachers ask me why I'm going to the air force before college and it's like.... because I need money for college in the first place, lol. The air force/other branches offer the Montgomery GI Bill to veterans; it basically pays for your entire (or most of your) college tuition, and I believe it can also include housing and book costs. I know that joining the air force or any other branch may not be for everyone, but it might be good to look into it? I'm not an expert, but if you have any questions you can DM me, I've been planning on joining the air force for as long as i remember, so I may be able to answer any questions. Of course, this is just a suggestion, and I hope that everything works out no matter what you choose to do! I really really hope that everything goes well for you and your siblings!!",

Colleges also have ROTC where you\u2019ll go to school and take military science classes. There\u2019s a lot to it but after your four years you\u2019ll be commissioned as an officer. ROTC will pay for your school and will pay for your books. Idk a lot to it but it\u2019s a good program. \n\nI wish you luck girl!",

While all the comments about going to a community college are incredibly valuable I have a different path if it applies to you. I was able to get my EFC (expected family income) decreased to 0 because I was able to earn my status as an independent student with the school. I did this through a form called the Dependency Override Form. In my situation I was able to use CPS reports and a letter from my therapist to prove abuse. I don\u2019t have enough information about your parents but if this is your situation then please push your schools financial aid office to provide you with this form so you can make your case. It was unreasonably hard to find this information when I went through this process so I hope this can help you. Good luck my love.",

I lived with them and moved out recently to go to a different college and got married. I have $15k in loans from two years (I worked and paid the difference) and now get paid a little bit each semester to go. It's only $700 per semester, but getting married and getting that much of a difference in aid is insane.\n\nI agree with all the advice here, pay as you go, community college, some loans, and consider waiting until the FAFSA actually cares about your income and not your parents. Your parents sound toxic and I sincerely hope you can get your shit together and shove their low expectations in their faces.\n\nGood luck OP, I believe in you. :)",

      "text": "Why do people think they have to spend so much money they don't have on college? \n\nThe simple solution: Get a two year degree from a CC that transfers to a uni. Lots of them have programs that go right in without skipping a beat. Try not to take off any time between, but do what you have to to keep moving forward. That two year degree will open a lot of opportunity for you to get into a company that may help pay for school. Pick a direction and keep working toward it.\n\nThis is on you for sure and you need to realize your parents did well for themselves and they should not be vilified for that. They want you to do well for yourself so you appreciate it. They are doing what they think is right. This sounds like a total failure on the part of the high school teachers and councilors. To be fair, I didn't understand the game when I got out of high school either. They make you sign FAFSA paperwork every year. It's real money you will have to pay back. If people treated that like it was their money, and not just a number, they would never go 6 figures into debt for a useless degree they will never pay off.",

It takes a little research and it's sad that high school counselors don't talk about it.\n\nMost 2 year colleges have arrangements with Universities that do transfer close to 100%. You can't just take x number of random classes without making sure they transfer and complain when they don't. You have to do a little digging on their website or ask a department head.\n\nAlso, and you don't see it as much, some schools that have these arrangements can provide the CC tuition price for the University for 2 years.\n\nJust a few things you can find if you look:\n\nhttps://www.communitycollegereview.com/blog/2-2-programs-going-strong-at-community-colleges-nationwide\n\n\nhttps://www.utdallas.edu/enroll/transfer/comet-connection/\n\n\nhttps://www.se.edu/grayson-college/",

I actually go to a state with 2-2 agreements, but in my case that just means the 4 year school has to credit you the 60 or so credit hours you took as official credits, and the tendency is to take off some prereqs and all your electives. It definitely helps if your CC program was very inexpensive and it very much depends on your degree program how much it can knock off, but people should still do more research before just hopping off to CC imo. For most schools with 2-2 transfer agreements they\u2019ll still be lenient on transfer credits without the 2 year certification, so it might be more worthwhile to stick to 1 year of CC classes. I\u2019d never heard of the CC tuition pricing at 4 year schools, that\u2019s really interesting! And definitely something that should be researched and considered. \n\nImo, for people concerned with money, 2 year CC -> state school transfer is definitely a great place to start your research, but it isn\u2019t always the end-all best solution to the problem.",

The Uni could give two fs about students in debt. The students are too busy saying everything should be free and agreeing to insane loans under the impression they will never have to pay it back.\n\nI don't have any real complaints.

I've been there, my parents made enough money to send me to school but decided not to support me because I wanted to pursue a career they didn't approve of (medicine of all things). I took the community college route and it was best decision I ever made and now I'm transferring to my dream school.\n\nLike others have pointed out, this is probably your best bet. It will be a much cheaper than a university and you may qualify for some help like the California Promise Grant. Use these two years and apply to as many scholarships as you can and get involved in school to build your resume. Work study is also a good option, I did that at my school and the hours were flexible and I mostly got paid to sit and do my homework. Some schools also have programs where you can do other activities such as volunteer at the hospital and have that counted as work study. Going to school fully online is another option if you're working full time.\n\nMoving out and getting distance from your family would give you greater peace of mind but will be a lot harder financially. I chose to live at home because I knew I couldn't support the cost of living and my education even despite my parents actively putting me down every opportunity they got. It was really hard but I tried to keep myself busy to avoid going home. If you choose to do this, it's going to be hard but the time will pass and you probably won't even be home that much with everything you'll be doing.  \n\nMy heart goes out to you and I know it's painful to be screwed over by your own parents, but don't give up.",

It's difficult and discouraging but I can only pass along what others have told me.\n\n Just like many others in this thread have recommended, **go to community college first, get the general education courses done, and then transfer**. I would also advise planning four years ahead in terms of your academics. Make sure your credits would transfer to a four-year institution and work you hardest in your CC courses. **GO TO A CHEAPER INSTATE SCHOOL** because in the end, no one cares how prestigious your school was because they won't know how much effort you put in, It only matters that you made it. One last thing is **MAJOR IN SOMETHING WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY**. \n\nSave your money and research what adulting is like for the purpose of becoming completely independent of your parents. They may seem like horrible people but consider this as a challenge in your life in which you had to build from the ground up without their help. **YOU WILL MAKE IT AND YOU WILL SUCCEED**. Just be thankful for your first 18 or so years of life and what your parents have done for you and be ready for the next 18+ years. One day **YOULL THANK YOURSELF** for the hard work and persistence you put in and that will feel satisfying. I too feel sad and discouraged at times considering all work I put in highschool but this is only a small portion of my life and things don't stay bad forever. So just do what you can and hang in there. People like us will get through this, its only a matter of time, and as Ron Swanson once said: **\"Nothing beats hard work and determination\".**",

      "text": "Why did your parents decide to have children? Got pregnant the first time because the father didnt wear a condom or the mother didnt take pills? Still doesnt explain the 2nd and 3rd child. The moment you have children, you no longer live just for yourself. You begin to prepare everything to pass the torch onto them. Even if the parents were aware of their bad parenting that led to the children becoming spoiled and taking everything for granted, putting them in debt doesnt solve anything. Suddenly forcing them to live a destitute live does nothing. Either they're sick in the head or not your parents.\nMy father scraped every bit of money he could after the divorce after coming to the states. What little money he made while attending community college to learn english and get a degree, was all sent as child support. He ate from homeless shelters at either a low cost or for free so he could send as much as he could to help. That's what a real parent would do. Unlike my mother, who never spent any of that child support on me, let me walk around in tattered clothes, buying top ramen and Vienna sausages for food while eating pizza or other sorts of fast food. No school supplies, no kind of toys or investments in hobbies. Instead, leasing 3 bedroom houses for a single mother and child, unable to finance correctly and gambling the rest away at a sick attempt to bring back her days as a child. Addiction to multiple things, never on time, never fulfilling promises. Hell she even took a knife to her son a couple of times. She was sick, very sick. So yeah, either there is something fundamentally wrong with your parents or they're just not your parents. Any sane parent would go to great lengths for their child(ren). What's messed up is that they might be like this because their parents treated them the same way..\nBut, fuck em. I wont say to hate them. It gets you nowhere, I know. But stop thinking about them and focus on your own life. Some big goals and many small goals that will help you achieve the big one. You're lucky, you have siblings, stick together. Rely on each other. For school, community college. Universities are overrated. You can transfer later after doing well and securing a scholarship or three. Schools that have a high tuition, you're not paying for the education, you pay for their connections. Right now, you just have to focus on standing on your own two feet and stabilizing. If you want to access a network, that can come after you get your basic needs in order. Also, take breaks. I get it that you want to get out of the situation as soon as possible but sometimes, being too hasty results in defeat. If school is overwhelming you, take a breather. Take a semester off and find a part time job (or full time, only bite off what you can chew). That way you can give it your best and get good grades, gpa, scholarships. What's your dream? Is it feasible? Do you yourself truly want it? Does it make you happy? Dont be rigid, be fluid. What you want right now might not be what you want 3 years from now. Be open minded and take every opportunity that you come across. Also, search for these opportunities in addition to the ones that present themselves to you. You will never truly know until you try for yourself. Like reading a book or trying a dish.  One man's trash may be another man's treasure. USE COMMON SENSE, for most things. Most things are what they seem. But do trust your instincts as well. Your body is set so self preservation. When your gut tells you something is wrong, it's because it is. Unless you're just an untrusting, paranoid, looney who has some kind of trauma and is constantly restless. Then I would seek help before anything else. Also, speaking of help, last but not least! Dont be afraid to ask for help. The worst anyone can say is no. Humans, we aren't perfect. There are many things that most of us cannot do on our own. We all have our own situations and circumstances. And by helping one another and making those connections, life will become easier. It's the little things in life you should enjoy.",

They certainly didn't have to fund the investment. The capacity to afford it doesn't really change the expectation. Some parents paid their way and realize the hidden benefits of having to work to attend college. All this comes down to is parenting style.\n\nCollege is beyond basic educational needs (because you really can get a decent income without it, see trade school or freelancing) and I'd consider a parent paying for it more equivalent to a parent giving you money to start a business.\n\nYou can get a dependency override in certain scenarios, I would look into that. Start at a CC and transition to a public four year. Consider the economics of your major and field, because that's one thing you have to think about more when you are paying for it yourself.",

I didn't know my options, and I wasn't motivated to find out. You have quite a few options. The first thing I would suggest you do is contact the financial aid department at your school of choice. \n\n1. Check your local community college/trade school and the university for what credits transfer. My community college is only $1500 per semester, full time.  Nearly all of the college level courses transfer. For pre-nursing, the only class that I have to take at the university is Spanish. If you can live with your parents and work part time, $1500 a semester is doable.\n\n2. Look into other scholarship options. My state has a WOIA \"Workforce Enhancement Act\" that pays for up to 80% of all expenses of a vocational or associates degree in high demand fields, such as nursing, welding, computers, etc. \n\n\n3. Wait until your 24. When you turn 24, you are eligible for federal student aid without counting your parents. If going this route, about having children. If you have children, you have chosen the 10 year graduation plan. \n\nMy parents make good money, but refused to pay for college. I decided to go to cosmetology school. I worked, had kids, and took a class here and there. As a hair stylist, I made around $60,000 per year. I'm now 30, and I'm finishing up my BSN prerequisites. I always wanted to be a nurse and worked towards it over the years. If I had known what I know now, I would have used WOIA to get my ASN years ago instead of attending cosmetology school.",

Community college is affordable and just as good as 4 year schools, too. \n2) apply EVERYWHERE. Apply to schools you are way overqualified for. Apply to schools in other states. Apply for small schools. Look up schools that are very generous with financial aid/ scholarships. Fill out the FAFSA even if you don\u2019t qualify for aid. Tell the schools that you are paying on your own (small schools take this into consideration a lot of the time of you tell them). I went to a very small private women\u2019s college and only paid $3,000 per semester, plus had an on campus job that I got a weekly paycheck for. 98% of students at the school were receiving scholarships, and tuition plus room and board was under $30,000 a year.

      "text": "I worked in higher ed for 15 years and I now work at a high school.  I saw and still see many students in similar situations to yours. Parents like yours mostly infuriate me. They have enough money to assist their children but just refuse to do so. Why have kids if you aren't going to support the kids right through college or trade school?\n\nThere are numerous ways to pay for college - paying for it yourself with cash on hand, financial grants or aid from colleges, federal and state grants, federal student loans, private student loans, scholarships, tuition reimbursement, participation in ROTC and the GI Bill. Let's go through these so you completely understand your options.\n\n**Paying for it yourself** - This is probably the most difficult option in today's climate. If this is the route you take, then start at community college. Community colleges are less expensive. You can take \"the basics\" there along with learning a trade or skill. I encourage you to visit your local community college to see what your options are there. \n\nAfter you have taken 60 credits, you can transfer to a state school. 60 credits is usually the maximum a university or college will accept so don't take more than will be accepted in transfer. Also many community colleges now have academic advisors to help students plan their schedules to prepare for transfer to university. Shoot for the best state school in your state. If you can't leave your city, then go the state school closest to your home. \n\nAlso, if this is the route you take, plan to take 2 - 3 classes a semester and go year round. You will need to work close to full-time to cover all of your expenses. It will be difficult to attend school full-time and work full-time. 3 classes a semester is better than 2 classes a semester for making progress to your goal but doesn't overwhelm you so that you feel you need to drop out. Going year round also gets you closer to your goal. In addition to traditional semesters, many community colleges have \"mini-mesters\" during the gaps between semesters. \n\nOnce you've finished at community college, do the same at the college or university you attend, go year round, take 3 classes a semester, take advantage of any unusual scheduling options available. Just keep plugging on and you will get your degree.\n\n**Financial Aid or grants from colleges** - This is usually known as institutional aid. It is almost always reserved for students with financial need based on the FAFSA. At this time, it does not sound like you would qualify for this based on your parents income. Once you turn 24, you can apply for aid based on your own income and this category may open up for you. \n\nThere are other ways to qualify as an independent student. You can google them. Those that are feasible for you all require huge life changes that I would not recommend for a college student such as getting married and having a child.\n\n**Financial Aid or grants from federal or state sources** - Federal grants are all based on financial need and would not be available to you in your current circumstances. However, some states do have grants for students that are based on merit and not need. Without knowing your state, I can't tell you about any specifics for you. You will need to do some research to see if there are any in your state.\n\n**Federal Student Loans** - Federal student loans are available to ALL students in the United States regardless of financial need. Even if your parents will not pay for any of your college education, you can still qualify for federal student loans. I know student loans are not popular but if you only take out federal loans to the maximum allowed, it is still less than $30,000 over four years. This is a monthly payment of somewhat less than $300 a month. Where students get into trouble is when they agree to pay back their parents' ParentPlus Loans or when students take out private loans as well as their federal loans. Then the loan burden gets too high. \n\nIf you do take out federal loans, don't do it for community college, if you can help it. Save your federal loans for university. This will keep down your loan burden and, I believe, you still qualify for four years of loans even if you have some credits already. You would need to speak with a financial aid officer at your school to better understand this. \n\n**Private Student Loans** - Don't, just don't. There may be some truly unusual circumstances where someone needs a private student loan but they are few and far between. Avoid these at all costs. Most loan horror stories involve private student loans.\n\n**Scholarships** - They are out there but can be hard to find and harder to get. Start looking for smaller local scholarships. Many community organizations give scholarship. Try local Chambers of Commerce, service organizations like the Elks Club or Kiwanas or American Legion. Churches, synagogues, and other religious organizations sometimes have scholarships. This is where asking your high school counselor can be helpful. Community colleges also should have a good sense of local scholarships. You just have to keep looking.\n\n**Tuition Reimbursement** - There are companies out there that reimburse their employees for college classes. I know UPS is such a company. There is at least one major grocery store chain in my state that also offers tuition reimbursement.\n\nBut the employer most likely to offer tuition reimbursement is, no surprise, a college. Colleges have many different kinds of jobs, many of which require no more than a high school diploma. Start now to apply to all of the colleges, both community colleges and four-year colleges, in your area for administrative positions, clerk positions, janitorial positions, grounds crew, whatever you think you might be able to do. Colleges don't always pay as well as other employers but they do provide decent benefits. At the college where I worked, there were numerous people who got their bachelor's degree from our school and then went on to get master's degrees paid for by the school. \n\n**ROTC participation** - this route does not necessarily pay for all of your tuition. If you went this route, you would need to investigate exactly what the program would provide you. However, ROTC programs have advisors devoted specifically to their students to help them navigate both the academic and financial aspects of college. Obviously, only go this route if you have an interest in military service after college.\n\n**Military Service and the GI Bill** - and that leaves us with going into the Armed Forces then using the GI Bill to pay for college when you leave the service. When I worked at the college level, many of my former students were former military. Their tuition was paid along with receiving a monthly stipend to pay for living expenses and other costs related to school. Military students were also considered as independent students so they could also apply for financial aid on their own income, if needed.\n\nMany of my current high school students are considering this option since even with the extensive financial aid many of them could receive (I work primarily low-income students), they just feel it is a better option so they can begin to make money to help their families while also getting the benefit of the GI Bill after they leave service.\n\nSome of the services also offer extensive educational options. The Air Force has their own community college system. The Navy will provide extensive training for some of their jobs with some of the credits for that training transferring after  leaving the service. I don't know about the other services. You would have to do the research. Again, only pursue the military option if that is something you can truly see yourself doing for at least four years.\n\nI hope you find this helpful. I believe strongly in the power of education to transform lives. Unfortunately, our current system can make that difficult for many people. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to send me a message. I'm happy to help.",

I am lucky though because some of the wealthier people in my town give every kid $4000 if they go to college or a trade school. Keep your head up, keep working/saving and tell your parents to f#@k off if they won't support you emotionally. I can see not wanting to pay for your schooling but they should still help you in some way. Good luck!",

Test out of your gen ed courses for cheap or even free! \n\nModern States has a program called Freshman Year for Free. Go here: https://modernstates.org/\nSign up for an account. Take their courses one at a time, complete all of the questions and once you pass, you can request a free test ticket to get three college credits for free per test! \n\nYou can find out if / which tests that your college accepts CLEP by going here: https://clep.collegeboard.org/school-policy-search\n\nYou can also find the information on their website.  DSST doesn\u2019t have a list like CLEP does of transferable credits, but your school\u2019s website should have the information. \n\nIf you need help with this, I might be able to help. Just private message me. This is what I did for my Freshman year and I saved about 15k. I can\u2019t make any promises, as it depends on how transparent your school choices are, but I might be able to track down info and help you build a cost effective game plan. \n\nAfter you finish your testing, take one course at a time. Sign up for a payment plan to chunk up the payments across the semester so it doesn\u2019t drain a huge chunk of money up front. Save a little more each semester because of the reduced course load up front so that you can afford to take more later. \n\nAlso look into Competency Based Education like Western Governor\u2019s University. You pay one lump some for a six month term and complete as many courses as you\u2019re capable of doing. This is cost effective for some. They also offer a lot of scholarships. It\u2019s insane how many they offer, to be honest.",

      "text": "Community college is golden. If you play your cards right, You can get a job at a restaurant or something to make money. One of my friends goes to a community college right by my house. Classes are about $500 each and they are wicked flexible when it comes to schedules. You can take night classes, weekend classes, morning classes. Whatever you need to fit your schedule they have.\n\nThe reason my friend is doing community college is because the university that I go to and the community college she goes to has an agreement/partnership together. She can go to the community college for 3 years, transfer to the university for year 4 and graduate with a diploma from the university, not the community college. \n\nOther simple things like not buying lunch from a restaurant or whatever can also help. A pound of lunch/deli meat from the store and a loaf of bread is $10-15 and that can feed you for about a week. A single meal alone at a restaurant could be $10-15. \n\nAnother fantastic way to cut costs is by commuting to school. I dont know where you go to school, how far away you live, or if you're staying on campus, but commuting can save a ton of money. The parking pass at my university (most of the students commute) is about $200. If I fill up my gas tank sunday night for $40 (gas prices were a bit higher lol), I can go to school 4 days a week plus work about 2 times on the weekends on a single tank of gas. Even though the price of gas adds up, it's still cheaper than the room and board costs at my school which is about $10k a year.\n\nYou can figure this out. Just keep applying to scholarship wherever and however you can. There are some really dumb scholarships out there. I'm sure one exists where you have to make a meme to get it. I've seen a zombie survival scholarship where you have to write a paper on the apocalypse and it was like a $5000 scholarship if you were chosen. \n\nYou can do it. We are all rooting for you!",

Since FAFSA doesn\u2019t like undergrads to be independent before they\u2019re 26, I had to go through a longer process with my school to explain why I wanted to be counted as independent. I explained that I moved out because of toxic parents and faced homelessness (which was true). I got counted as independent, and then received the Pell Grant, which gives you over $3,000 per semester. I would definitely suggest doing the same thing.\n\nAlso, some states make it free for their residents to get an associates degree, if you stay in the same state for a certain number of years after graduation. Definitely look into this to see if your state offers something like this. You could get a free associates degree, and then do two more years at a university to get your bachelors. \n\nGood luck!",

I\u2019m probably a little hypocritical since I have some help from my mom(tho she makes far less than ur parents and I wouldn\u2019t blame her if she didn\u2019t want to) but it\u2019s mostly on me cause my dad didn\u2019t want to help me at all. Tips community college or online so you don\u2019t have to pay for housing and you\u2019ll get cheaper tuition rates. Apply to every scholarship I have a friend who applied to over two hundred she only won 6 but it was enough. Wait until your older and get government help once ur an independent. Or go to trade school this is kinda a shitty option if your dead set on University but most trades get paid more than most degrees anyway and are cheaper.",

They told me to go fuck myself because I didn\u2019t go to the same high school all four years (because I literally moved to a new foster home every year). So I said fuck it and went in the army for a while because they told me the GI Bill would pay for school. I did my time and now I\u2019m 1 year away from a B.S. in mathematics. It\u2019s not an easy way to go but it will get you to your goal. Not only does the GI Bill pay for college, you get housing money while in school. I literally am paid 2k per month to go to a school and don\u2019t have to pay tuition. The other thing is that your pre existing loans are on hold while you serve and all of your loans can be reduced for just being a soldier. I highly recommend that you and your siblings seek this route. You can even do a program where you and your brother can be stationed together so you have support.",

They told each of us kids how much they could afford to help and we had to figure out the rest to pay for school. I definitely took that for granted until now at 27 as I\u2019m paying for my own education. \n\nI would also like to say that your parents don\u2019t have to help you out. It may be their way (though they\u2019re going about it the most shitty way possible) to teach you to fend for yourself. Yes your parents can afford it but it also should not be expected of them to pay for your education. It may be what they also had to do get where they are now. \n\nEvery parent is different but there are solutions to your problem. Start off going to community college. You get what you make from those classes just as much as you would at a university just cheaper. You still get the college experience without the high price tag. Work part time or during the summer to save up some money to help pay for what you need. \n\nIf a cost that\u2019s making it tough to go to a university is housing, don\u2019t live on campus unless you\u2019re required to. The cost of housing is one of the most if not the most expensive expense going to a university. Skip it and cut down your cost that way. \n\nIt\u2019s doable and I know it\u2019s frustrating especially during a pandemic. Just breathe and find solutions and alternate plans for higher education.",

So they were basically starting as a Junior with no requirements. My advice? Start out part time maybe 6 credits a semester at a small satellite school NOT a community college if you plan to transfer. Theres nothing wrong with community colleges in my opinion but that's plainly the way it is if you plan to go to a bigger university some day. Work full time. Itll take longer but you dont sound like you have much of a choice here. If your parents will allow you to live home, do that, if not get the cheapest apartment you can find. Some landlords will go easier on you if you can prove you're a college student. Cut costs wherever you can.",

People often don\u2019t look into the transfer credit policies of places they\u2019re interested in, and that screws them over when it\u2019s time to leave. CC is a wonderful decision for those who can\u2019t start out at a university. If it wasn\u2019t, so many people wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nAlso I\u2019m going to have to challenge the idea that landlords go easier on college students. It\u2019s been my experience that the exact opposite is true. They see them for what they are\u2014naive first-time renters\u2014and they exploit that.",

There\u2019s TAG for UCs, ASTs for CSUs, regular transfer admissions too, the ability to take courses at any CC in your district and even afterwards. Things are very flexible here. So a CC in California is worth it. Not sure if OP is in California though. Big name schools like UCLA, Berkeley UCSD, SLO would gladly take those transfer credits as articulated. \n\nBUT a CC in a different state from where you\u2019re applying to.. say NYU will have a lot more issues transferring courses most definitely.",

They did not save any money for me or my sister to go to college. They genuinely couldn\u2019t afford to send me to college. I knew this growing up. I was always told I had to make good grades so I could go to college. I had to give up going to the school of my dreams and ended up having to go to a local university. I got a decent academic scholarship, but I have to live at home to avoid paying any money and I have to work to pay for my car and gas and food. It\u2019s all working out fine. I just worry about my sister who is in high school. She doesn\u2019t care much about her grades and doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re serious when they say they can\u2019t/won\u2019t pay for her to go to college. I hope you are able to figure something out! Good luck!",

Guess what? You\u2019re supposed to feed and house and love your kid. That\u2019s not done out of the kindness of your heart. That\u2019s just what you have to do. And if you make enough money to give them the one gift no one can take from them\u2014an education\u2014and you choose not to, you\u2019re a bad parent. Cut and dry.

But at the end of the day it\u2019s their money and they get to choose how they spend and invest that money. \n\nI think one thing to note is that if OPs parents have a history of not helping, why would it be expected for them to help now? OP shouldn\u2019t have expected nor still expect their parents to pay for school. Many people don\u2019t have that luxury even if parents can afford it.",

There were so many interesting people from every walk of life at my CC in Chicago. \n\nOP, also consider finding a job first to save up and get a cheap apartment walking distance from CC to become independent from toxic family and be able to focus on yourself. I started school when I was 19 and had been out of the house for 2 years at that point, I would not have been able to focus on school work if I was still living with my parents. \n\nSorry if you already said you would do that, I'm on mobile and don't want to exit out of this reply to double check bc im human trash F",

So as an adult I\u2019ve had to figure out how to pay back over $100K of debt from undergrad. However, I don\u2019t regret going to college at all and I\u2019ve been able to start 2 educational companies and now help students with their college prep strategy. But, if you can avoid massive debt, please so. I had part time jobs all throughout school but that just covered my expenses. If you can get core requirements out of the way at CC and then transfer somewhere where you get in state tuition that would be ideal.\n\nGetting away from your parents will help. It\u2019ll be hard in college because a lot of parents fully support their kids, but believe in yourself and know that you can and will succeed!",
