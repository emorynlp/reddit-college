  "text": "I didn't party whatsoever in high school but have become a lot more extroverted in college. My roommates and I throw one fairly large (40-60 people) party a month, and every time we get people either complaining about the playlist or asking to queue random songs that end up being out of place. \n\nWe've tried everything from sticking our heads together and coming up with a rap/trap heavy playlist with a lot of pretty well-known songs (Drake, ASAP, Cudi, Uzi, etc), indie rock heavy playlists (Killers, Strokes, Arctic Monkeys), mid/late 2000s pop playlists (Pitbull, Kesha, etc), and trap/pop EDM hybrid playlists (take the poppiest songs from the first but add some Zedd, Porter Robinson, Calvin Harris, etc). \n\nWe're having another one this weekend. Anyone have ideas on how to reduce complaints/improve vibes? We all listen to a lot of EDM and were thinking of just having a full EDM playlist but some of our closer friends don't listen to any.",
