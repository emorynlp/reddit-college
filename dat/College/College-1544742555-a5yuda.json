  "text": "So finals just finished and I am waiting for my grades to come in. I feel confident in my finals, nothing too shocking and come to realize I am going home and getting a break. And I don't want it to come, I want to continue classes and learning rather than being bored at home and doing nothing besides working. \n\nAll through the semester, I wanted to not have anything and be on break to relax but right now I want to go to class and do work.\n\nAm I alone in this feeling?

      "text": "oh God yes, I'm the same way. our winter and summer breaks are long af too. My finals end next Friday and then I don't start the next semester until March 1st, and then we end in June and start September 1st. What to do for 2 and a half months besides work, if i'm not enrolled in the winter/summer semester course? I have to really motivate myself to study on my own and stay busy and not fall into lazy habits. Working a lot to save a ton of money helps, but it doesn't feel like a break. And during the semester all I want to do is sleep and hate going to class. And i think it's because I never really get a \"break\" from everything, ever. I'm too broke to go traveling or take on unpaid internships and I have my rent and tuition to pay on my own, so it's pretty rough. But sometimes I really like some of my courses, or the fact that maybe i didn't do so well during the semester in one course motivates me to want to be more studious or do my own side-reading on something. I feel like i'm not getting the education I'm paying for usually, which doesn't help motivation, and I'm constantly burnt out and sleep-deprived and improperly fed lol.  \n\n\nDuring the breaks too we can't always be around our friends so easily like during the semester so it's easy to feel bored or lonely.   \n\n\nWhat's worked best for me under these circumstances - I'm in my 5th year so i've had a lot of time to figure some things out - is getting into a routine. If that includes a part-time job, set a schedule for yourself and try your best to stick to it. Make time for yourself too, like for exercising, meeting friends, self-study, reading, Netflix, other hobbies you like to do, and try to get into a normal sleep schedule so you can recharge and start the next semester off on a good foot.

                  "text": "I wish I could do this! But we don't register for classes until the month before the semester starts, and we don't know if we're in or not until the week before, and then have the first week for add/drop. The professors all suck at uploading their syllabi too so there's no way to know for sure if they are teaching the same course or using the same textbooks or materials. But I definitely think that doing some reading up on a topic, or reviewing material from previous courses that would be relevant to the course is a good idea. In my case I have a lot of foreign language courses, so brushing up on my vocabulary and grammar and such is important. ",
