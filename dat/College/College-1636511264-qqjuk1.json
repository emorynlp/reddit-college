The drive is 50 miles one way every day of the week so 500 miles a week next semester getting 31 miles a gallon\u2026so 16 gallons a week so about $50 a week in gas\u2026times about 16 weeks = $800 in gas throw in oil changes and maintenance let\u2019s say +$400 =$1200. So I\u2019d say definitely worth it  am I putting a lot of miles on my car? Yes. But I just bought this car for 12.5k with 46k miles with the intention of putting a lot of miles on it. Luckily 90% of the drive is highway sooooo",

              "text": "That's only looking at a small portion of it though. \n\nGranted, your time doesn't *cost* money but it could be making you money. I always look at my time driving as a cost and generally value it at about 10 bucks an hour. \n\nCar maintenance costs won't be trivial. That much driving will incur quite a bit of cost. If you aren't doing your own mechanic work, it'll be much more expensive to get anything done. For what it's worth, I spend about 3k a year in parts alone for my car. That doesn't include all the work I put into it. Considering that ignoring some car repairs can get you killed or junk your motor, it's a necessary thing to keep track of. Without doing my own work, I'd easily be looking at closer to 5 or 6 thousand a year on maintenance. My car is a 2009 with \\~150k miles on it and it's in excellent shape. \n\nIf you're not driving a car that's well kept, it's going to cost you a ton of money. If you haven't been keeping up on the maintenance, it'll all start piling up very quickly. \n\nMy girlfriend drives an hour and a half to work 3 times a week. It's a drain. I notice that it's something that greatly affects her. That amount of time stuck in a car sucks. Not only that, her Subaru Forester 2014 has around 60-70k miles on it and a year or two ago both rear wheel hub bearings went to shit simultaneously. It wasn't more than a month of replacing the first one that we had to replace the second one. Either way, rear wheel hub bearings are about 120 bucks a pop. We spent around 2 days replacing them. Without handling the labor, I think the quotes she was getting for replacing only one of them was above $1000. \n\nEven simple things like a ball joint going bad (as they inevitably will) can cost 100-250 bucks. That price goes for tie rod ends as well which wear out also. One day my car's gas pump died while I was coasting down the highway. Cue a 150 dollar bill to tow it home, another 50 for the CHEAPEST pump available and about 3-4 hours worth of work to get myself back on the road. It would be much more expensive if I wasn't able to cut a hole in my car to access the tank. Otherwise I'd have to drop the tank and shit. I had to replace a brake caliper that ceased up completely, that was over 100 bucks with 4 hours of work. \n\nI think it being only 1 semester is a good thing. I think it'll be fine for that. There are a ton of other associated costs with using a car that much though. They aren't cheap to maintain but they are even more expensive to have to replace out of nowhere.",

Everyone here is trying to convince me to not do it but it\u2019s not really my choice. I\u2019m not too bummed, I feel like 24 hours worth of driving a month for like 3.5 months isn\u2019t that horrible. Saving 6k just makes sense in my situation. \n\nI should also add that I live in a small town and the nearest college is 1 hour drive so this isn\u2019t too unheard of in my area. The nearest Walmart is about 20 miles away also lol",
