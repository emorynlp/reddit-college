  "text": "In my science class with a lab, a 4 credit class, I am worried I\u2019ll get a D or C. I can\u2019t have that happen. Currently in community college, to transfer to my state school I need a 3.8 or higher. If I fail to do this I\u2019ll probably have to go out of state. I wish to stay in my state. I have asked for extra credit. Any advice?",
