  "text": "I am currently a freshman in my first semester at college and am majoring in business currently with a minor in administration and management. I have found business far less interesting than I thought it would be and have started looking at other majors.\n\nI am pretty average at mathematics but am really good with logical thinking and problem solving, and computers have always interested me. I just want to know how difficult computer science is if I were to switch and how math intensive it is.",

Don't confuse it with being unable to do it though.\n\nThe algorithms class is also heavily math and logic based.\n\nComputer Science is essentially a math degree that teaches you programming. If there is a Computer Programming or a Software Development degree at your school, you'll probably be happier with that one.",

It\u2019s great that you want to get in early so you have time to do all this stuff, but you are going to spend a lot of time outside of class coding if you\u2019re shooting for a high salary.

My last semester I would see students browsing BMW and Audi websites during lectures because the end is near and they're about to go from bring broke to high income.

Obviously doing well helps your odds of landing your first role, but the point stands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany, many people do it exclusively for the money and they're doing fine.

Calculus is just getting good at recognizing the problem and then not messing it up. It\u2019s all practice and with enough of it you can easily ace every one of the three classes. It\u2019s just a matter of putting in enough time to succeed. Also don\u2019t be afraid to ask your professor questions and go to office hours or get help from TAs for anything.\n\nI found the classes after calculus to be easier as well, linear algebra and differential equations were not too tough and by that point you should be really good at learning math.\n\nThe harder classes for me were the physics courses. My school requires 4 science courses so I took physics 1-3 and bio 1 and struggled in those much more than I ever did in any of my math classes. \n\nIf you love computers and/or problem solving then CS is awesome. Math and CS are very much related and intertwined so if you love one but not the other, you\u2019ll learn to love both anyway.\n\nGood luck!",

It is math heavy - computer science could be considered a branch of mathematics. Software engineering is the more practical/business application of computer science and is what most end up doing. My school had two computer science paths: theoretical and software engineering, yours may be similar. The math is difficult, but certainly not impossible. Don't forget that few people are just \"good\" at math. It is a learned skill that takes time and practice. Do not let it deter you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously the pay ceiling is so damn high if you choose to maximize income. Even if you get average grades (or even les than average) and get an average job at some mid size company, you can expect about 70k to start in most cities. With some internship experience and willingness to relocate to a tech hub, 100k+ is not uncommon. Mid career salary at big tech companies is easily over 200k. Recent work from home culture is an added bonus if you want that sort of thing. You struggle for a few years, but it pays off massively\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you decide to pursue business, an MBA is still on the table. I know several (mechanical/chemical) engineers that are getting theirs and having their employer pay for it. All the benefits of a business major with the massive bonus of domain knowledge and skill. Business degrees are a dime a dozen - an engineer with an MBA has much more value to a company. And more value to yourself if you choose to start your own business.",
