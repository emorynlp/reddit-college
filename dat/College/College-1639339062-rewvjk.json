  "text": "I have my final for accounting on Tuesday (currently Sunday), and there\u2019s 59 questions in which we get an hour and 40 minutes to complete (most questions are concepts but there\u2019s also analytical ones too). I currently have a 93% in the class, and even if I got a 0, I\u2019d still pass the course with a 70%. To get an 80%, I\u2019d need to pass the final with a 41%. My question is, should I feel bad for not studying sooner? I\u2019ve been so incredibly burnt out; I spent most of the day today sleeping and I\u2019m still exhausted. Do you think I should study my ass off these next couple days?\n\nEdit: I should probably mention that the exam is on respondus lockdown browser",

I'm really struggling with my courses right now, I'm hoping I'll improve. At this point I'm not expecting to get a particularly high grade, I just want to pass  I think my college just accepts a lot of people, but then there's a high drop-out rate .",

Is it the professors that make the content tricky or is it just the content in general that\u2019s hard? I know mental health can get in the way with work as well. College is really just about passing and getting a degree IMO so as long as you stay positive and study you will be in good shape. Don\u2019t forget to give yourself breaks though cause that\u2019s vital",
