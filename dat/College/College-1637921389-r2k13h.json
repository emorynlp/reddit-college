  "text": "so i\u2019m majoring in english, but lately, i\u2019ve been contemplating whether or not to change my major out of this feeling that pursuing english isn\u2019t worth it.\n\ndon\u2019t get me wrong, reading and writing are one of my passions. i\u2019m just not sure how to go about it in terms of pursuing those for a career. idk if that makes any sense, but any advice will do.",

      "text": "I was an English major. After graduation, my first job was in advertising. I had hoped to do copywriting, but instead got pushed into the account rep/sales side. Long hours, low pay, doing sales which is rough for a bookworm introvert \u2014 do not recommend. So I ended up going to law school. Long hours, but better pay \u2014 I recommend it only if you can do it without incurring a lot of debt.\n\nMajoring in English was good preparation for a law career, but looking back I wish I had taken some basic accounting and business classes.\n\nIf I were to do it again, I think I would have combined English with another degree (either a double major or make one of them a minor). I would have pursued a degree in Business, to prepare me for versatile business careers \u2014 or in Biology, to prepare me for a research and/or grant-writing position.\n\nUnless you want to teach English. Then you should look at Education programs.",

The reality is that the majority of college degrees aren't actually of much use and don't teach you much of any real use. For most students, the value in college is everything *except* the academics - building connections with other people and having time to explore what you want to do with your life.",

      "text": "I got a degree in English 10 years ago and never used it. Now I'm back in college to get my Accounting degree because everyone needs an accountant, so it is easier to get a job. \n\nHOWEVER - English degrees are great for any job where you need to read, write, or communicate a lot. For example - lawyers. They read a TON, and it is a great degree to have for Law School. If you want to write, you can do technical writing or get into editing. \n\nSo if you want to finish with your English degree, think outside the box of what you can use written communication for, and maybe do a minor in something more specific that can help you stand out when applying for jobs after graduating. \n\nYou can also get into teaching with an English degree.",

          "text": "As someone with both an English and a foreign language degree, English is much more marketable.\n\nEDIT: Tried to respond to now deleted comment questioning the point further.\n\nEnglish is a required course/subject in every K-12 classroom, and it is a required general education subject for pretty much every associate and bachelor's degree. Also, ESL as a field is growing every year in America, requiring a larger number of English teachers to teach those courses. There is also a common misconception that English only studies literature, but the field is rather diverse in its interests: composition, rhetoric, literature, creative writing, education, et cetera.\n\nRegardless, I'm well out of my undergrad and used my English degree heavily in my Masters and now PhD program (lots of reading, synthesizing research, and analyzing original data for publication).",
