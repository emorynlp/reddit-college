  "text": "Sorry if formatting is weird I'm on mobile lol\n\nHi everyone, I'm a 1st year commuter student and so far I'm just pretty disappointed about college. I go to a nice college with a wide variety of people but I just don't know what to do to find some people to fit in with. I've met a couple nice people here, but they're roommates in the dorms and they hang out with other dorm friends so it makes it difficult.\n\nOn top of that, I just don't feel any of the \"freedom\" that people always talk about in college. Living with my parents(not really close with either), I can't really do anything fun. I'm not a party person, not interested in anything crazy like drinking or sex, I just wanna be able to go out with friends in the middle of the night and just hang out get food shit like that. I'm 18 close to 19 and my parents still treat me like a 16 yo half the time.\n\nI'm not super social. I was \"cool\" with a lot of people in hs but don't talk to almost all of them anymore. College is harder to make friends because for the most part everyone is doing their own thing. By nature I keep to myself as well. \n\nMost people who talk to me only talk to me cause we're in a group project. Ive hung out with people outside of a class setting a couple times but that's been it, I didn't really fit in cause these people already knew each other from the dorms and had shit to talk about. I'm exhausted or just don't have time to 90% of the time so that on top of my social anxiety is too much for me most of the time. This is only my first semester so should I expect it to only get worse from here? \n\nI can't stay at school after classes because both my parents work and we only have 2 cars. I don't have time to go to clubs or hang out at events or gatherings around campus because of that and also because of my coursework (Stem major). Maybe that'll change when I get my own car, but I'm not confident in that because again I'm not super social.\n\nPretty sure nobodys even gonna read this\n\ntl;dr I'm a commuter and it sucks\n\nAny suggestions and not just armchair advice? Does it get better? How?",

      "text": "I was about to suggest clubs and activities, but not being able to stay after school is a pretty big obstacle there. I would 100% focus on getting your own car. When people talk about the freedom of college, they\u2019re talking about how they don\u2019t live with their parents, or get to reinvent themselves, or have more opportunities to take advantage of. If you\u2019re commuting to class and then home, then it\u2019s really just an extra responsibility. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that, getting an education and improving yourself isn\u2019t always gonna be fun. But if you want the life-changing \u201ccollege experience\u201d (which is often overstated, but can be true to an extent) then you\u2019re gonna need the freedom of your own car or your own place.",

      "text": "I would get your own car, but I feel you. I have always been a commuter because my old college transitioned to a 4 year in 2017 (I started in 2018) and the semester covid started they opened their first dorm which ironically can only be used by students there on athletics. Which kind of sucked.\n\nNow I'm a full fledged commuter, driving 40-50 minutes each way to my new college with essentially is a satellite of UCF at this point. What sucks is this college has pretty much nothing, they have a lot of clubs but they all are on the other side of Orlando which is more like a hour and a half without the i4 construction project, the other one is in Winter Park and that is still a hour each way. \n\nSo it kind of sucks because in my current class almost everyone lives in Orlando, so I only see my friends in class. If gas prices weren't 3.30 I would go get a job at Sea World cause my friend works there. \n\nThough it looks like next year I'll be living on campus if the nursing dorms are completed, currently the school owns some houses and rents them out to students.",
