  "title:": "How do you prepare for online open book exams while also actually learning the material?",
  "text": "Probably like everyone else I had online exams a few months ago. Now we're back on campus full time, but our exams are gonna be online because of the covid situation in my country. I didn't learn very much last year. I passed all my exams, but if you were to quiz me on any of last years material I probably couldn't tell you much. I'm in 3rd year of a 4 year degree and I don't want to graduate not knowing shit about biology. I need closed book exams as a motivator to actually sit down and memorise.\n\nBut I'm not going to have those. The plus side is, I'll be able to pre-write all the essay plans I need and I'll have those in the exam with me in my bedroom. I'll be able to get very good marks with fairly minimal work.\n\nThere's no need for me to memorise any of my essay plans. It would be a waste of time too, because I could be making other essay plans instead.\n\nSo how did/do you guys prep for online exams? And do you remember anything? I want to try to balance good preparation with actually learning.",

      "text": "All my exams/quizzes are online now - but they are not heavily proctored (they are essentially all open book/open note tests). So when I take notes, I type them up in a word document instead of writing in a notebook, and try to be as thorough as possible. I also feel like I'm not learning as much with these types of tests, but my process seems to help:\n\nI read my textbook, highlight, then type up my notes after I finish the chapter (just what I have highlighted). I make sure that I'm not just reading it, but slowing down my reading and trying to actually understand it. When I go to type up the highlighted sections, it's like I'm reading the text twice, and the repetition helps me.\n\nAlso, when I type up my notes, I'll write when a new section begins, so if I Ctrl+F in a document during a test for a key word or topic, and it's not in my notes, I quickly know where in my book I need to look for clarification.",
