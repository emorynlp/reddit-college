  "text": "**Roughly, cloth masks let in ten times more viral particles than KN95/KF94 masks.**\n\nCloth masks are roughly 50% effective at blocking viral-sized particles, but high-effectiveness masks (e.g.: KN95, KF94) will block more than 95% of such particles. 50% of particles get through cloth masks, and <5% through KN95/KF94.\n\nAn FDA-approved mask of either type costs at most $1.3 in bulk, and can likely be worn for at least two days. With \\~110 days in a semester, this makes for \\~$72 per student\u2014 or **less than the cost of a single covid test.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is your college distributing high-quality masks?** (*Mine isn't. Currently trying to convince them to give quality masks, at the very least, for covid-testing volunteers and low-income students.*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\"Why Aren't We Wearing Better Masks?\"](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you're trying to get your college to do the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any ideas to steelman this idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n# KN95s, not N95s\n\n* And there doesn't seem to be a shortage\u2014KN95s for example are abundantly available on amazon for cheap, and elsewhere in bulk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Just because college students don't tend to die from covid doesn't mean that the virus doesn't do considerable harm.

If you want a different mask, get one.  Do you expect your college to provide you condoms ?\n\nNot everything is some giant conspiracy.  Some things are personal responsibility.",

      "text": "The thing with disposable masks is they're gonna cause a TON of waste. Properly using any disposable mask is going to make them, at most, a one-day mask.\n\nI leave my dorm EVERY DAY because I have a DAILY meal plan. I can't bulk shop because my plan gives me 2 daily meals/$8 each in specified food (milk, certain frozen meals, etc). Yeah, i can stretch my 2 credits into about 1.5-2 days of food, but I'd be wasting my own money by skipping days of meal credits. There was no option for a non-daily plan.\n\nThat's, minimum, 7 masks a week. I'm in school for approximately 33 weeks. That's MINIMUM 231 KN95s into the garbage for a 5 minute trip where I don't get within 6 feet of more than maybe 2 people, and only for at most 2 minutes. That doesn't include masks that get wet or dirty before the end of the day, or if I toss my mask then realize I have to run to the library to print something, or if I drop my mask on the floor by accident.\n\nCloth masks just get tossed in with my laundry every week. There's virtually no waste until they wear out. The concern with cloth vs KN95 is that KN95 stops 95% of particles at a certain size vs cloth stopping, your number, 50%, but covid isn't generally spread by those tiny particles. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but it's spread via respiratory droplets. Think of when someone sneezes and you see all those specs fly out of their nose and mouth. You can see those. You can't see viruses. A cloth mask stops a significant amount of those droplets, enough to make the mask well enough effective.\n\nEven if my school offered free disposables, I still wouldn't use them. There's no point in generating that much waste when a reusable option exists for only a slight decrease in effectiveness. My school gave us 3 layer cloth masks with a soft inner layer and a tightly woven thick outer layer. Those KN95s can go to someone who really needs them, like nurses in the ICU with aerosolized covid from the ventilators that ARE at that tiny, non-visible size that KN95s are meant for.",

          "text": "Yeah, a lot of waste for sure. But I wonder if the expected value of waste of treatment and spread of less people wearing effective masks outweighs this. It might be that more KN95s = more KN95 waste, but more KN95s = less people sick = less medical treatment, resulting in less overall waste than excess masks. I'm not sure.\n\nAlso you can probably wear one mask for many hours of exposure. If it's really just 5 minutes, perhaps you can wear on mask a week\n\nYou can also cover your KN95 with a cloth mask so it doesn't get dirty. And I believe there are fairly effective ways to reuse and disinfect used KN95s, though I haven't looked into this.\n\n* [Empirical study on cloth vs medical mask](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.full)\n   * \u201cThe rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm \\[compared with the medical mask arm\\].\u201d\n   * **\u201cPenetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.\u201d** (and they were using lower-quality masks than KN95/N95 I believe. )\n      * This isn't a slight decrease in effectiveness\n* Or look at [CDC tests of masks](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html): some are 30% effective, some are 99% effective. I don't think cloth masks are good enough",

              "text": "Both of those studies seem to be aimed at ensuring that adequate protective equipment for Healthcare workers can be found in times of N95 shortage. Healthcare workers exist in a VERY different environment than students. They intentionally expose themselves to sick people, and depending on where they work, intentionally expose themselves to people diagnosed with COVID. Healthcare workers exist in an environment SATURATED with illness causing particles. The average college student simply does not.\n\nAt it's peak, my school had a 5% infection rate for its weekly breakdown. On top of that, I have a friend that was counted as a positive case when all she had was a bad allergic reaction; they never even tested her. My school's doing too well with student responsibility. Up until that spike to 5%, we were averaging less than 1% infection rate of on campus students and staff since August. This is while we're less than 10 miles from a hot spot; a hot spot that was, at one point, something like 60% of all new cases in the state in a ~5 mile radius. \n\nMy school also offers free testing to any student that is worried, and requires testing periodically to all students who live on campus, again for free.\n\nThis is while students are wearing almost exclusively cloth masks. We're social distancing, we're not going to parties, we're hanging out with the same friends every time, and we go to the health center to get tested at the slightest sniffle (ok not really but we as a school test ourselves a LOT).\n\nCloth masks are fine if students act like the adults they're supposed to be and do all the OTHER THINGS that make masks effective. Its just like you can't rely on your insulin to make your diabetes better, you have to ALSO exercise and eat better. Masks are not the miracle cure. They are a single part of a several step fix.",

We're not allowed to leave campus (except to walk into the adjoining town), we're not allowed to have guests on campus, and many interior common spaces are closed.  Campus is at 1/2 capacity, only a few classes are in person, and everyone lives on campus in singles. You can only eat in your room or outside with members of your \"block\" aka the 5 people you live next to. And use of some common spaces (kitchens, for example) requires \"supervision.\" They've kept covid cases near-0, which is great, but it has some of the strictest/most paternalistic rules of any campus I know about. But I agreed to live on campus this spring, so there's nothing much to do about it, and I'm glad I don't go to a school full of frat bros partying without masks.",

I'm not positive though -- they are probably something students can get if they are in poverty, they just aren't given out in the thousands on-campus anymore.\n\nHonestly, some of the N95 masks are much more constrictive than the cloth ones or blue ones that have 3-ply construction. I think that a lot less students would have used the ones provided by the university if they were N95, they would have bought ones that were easier to wear for the full day.\n\nMost of our students don't even use the university ones anymore. They have just bought a pack on Amazon, at Walmart, Old Navy, etc. If you go for value you can a pack of 3-5 cloth ones for under $10 which is approachable for virtually all students. It's been a whole year so at this point it's almost the same thing as being responsible for buying your own clothing.",

If we gave students enough masks to cover a full year, which gives them some leeway if one gets wet (and so has to be replaced half-way through a day), that's over 800 million masks.\n\nHow on Earth is the UK supposed to provide 500-800 million more masks in a short period when it normally provides only 35.5 million over any single week? And if we all bought masks independently then it'd affect supply chains here and around the world, driving prices back up like last April. Importing PPE from a poorer country isn't any better.\n\nCloth masks are recommended because supply chains simply cannot handle large numbers of people all buying up N95/KN95 stock. Do you think the cost is going to stay low if ~20 million people (number of college students in the US) are all provided with enough masks to last a semester or year?",

The general public should not be wearing n95s\n\nIf everyone does what they're told, social distancing and everyone wearing masks correctly is sufficient.\n\nYou have to be fit tested in order for respirators to work.  I've tried several n95s before I landed one that fit my face, with an hour of testing.  If you aren't fit tested, there is a good chance the n95 is as useful as a type 1 mask, maybe even more dangerous because people assume they can't get it from wearing it.\n\nYou also need to know the correct doffing and donning procedure, don't touch the inside of the mask, wear the mask properly, can't just take it off for a drink when you feel like it, etc",

Only a couple of medics and I knew just how serious this thing was going to be. Everytime a patient came to us with pneumonia like symptoms, I knew it had to be covid because NO one came to us for pneumonia like symptoms before that. We didn\u2019t have any kind of masks either, blew my mind. I don\u2019t doubt I had covid that entire February, though it really didn\u2019t bother me.",

My instructor was active duty and got shipped out to NYC halfway during the semester and I remember him telling us about it how it would become a pandemic early on.  I remember when he told us someone had covid like symptoms at the hospital in like February and everyone was sorta freaking out.  Sounds like you also knew what was ahead.\n\nLast semester we were working in the hospitals with only a type 1 which sucked, being with a lot of patients who weren't required to wear a mask.  So thankful I didn't get it or get sick (same to you).  Luckily this semester we were given n95s and the option to receive the vaccine (I took that asap), as I'm doing covid testing right now and might start giving vaccinations at the prison in the upcoming weeks.",
