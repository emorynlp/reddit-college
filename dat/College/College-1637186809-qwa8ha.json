  "text": "Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post to, but here's what's up:\n\nI am a third-year computer science major, and just this semester I have realized I do not want to be doing computer science any longer. The thought of making it my career brings about a sense of dread. Now, don't get me wrong, I think computer science is a great field to get a degree in. However, I have found my true passion while in college, and that is music. I want to be involved in music any way that I can, and so I have opted to drop out of my university at the end of the fall semester and transfer to a junior college in the spring to get a two-year certificate in Music and Recording. I have spoken with advisors who say that I have already learned most of what I need to know if I ever wanted to get a job as a software developer. I have done my research, and I know that if I were to go into the music industry, no one is going to look at my time at the university as most professionals in the field are concerned with showing what I know, and not where I went to school and what my grades were like while I was still a computer science major.  I have absolutely no plans on ever returning to complete my computer science degree. All of the classes I am currently in bore me to death and I see no reason why I should keep submitting assignments when I will not be needing most of this knowledge in my future career, plus it adds more stress in my life as I worry about due dates. Lastly, I know that this must sound like I am a hopeful and naive young kid, but I really do care about music, and I devote far more time towards mastering my skills as a music producer than I do with my assignments for school. With that being said, would it be foolish or wise to completely stop turning in assignments for the rest of this semester before I change majors in the spring to something completely unrelated to computer science?",

      "text": "Foolish. Just because you don't plan to pursue further education now doesn't mean you never will. What if you decide that you want to continue studying music at a higher level? Any college you apply to in the future is going to look at your transcripts, regardless of your major. I really don't see the point in limiting your future options so dramatically just to save yourself a few weeks of work.",
