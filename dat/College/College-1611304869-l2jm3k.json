  "text": "This is kinda weird y'all. But i actually love them. No going to class, no getting dressed. Talking about the material we learned. It's not bad. I feel like I still have a connection with the teacher.\n\nI'm a nursing major and our school is doing the hybrid thing where they do half of the lectures in person and the rest on zoom( we still have to go to labs and clinical in person). I'm like i feel like it's more better if they do it all on zoom. But apparently alot of people like going to the lectures???? Im just not understanding.\n\nI don't know how learning online is unmotivating. I guess it's just me. \n\nFor my next major, I'm doing it online. I'm gonna become an art major. It's just more comfortable to learn from your own space.",

If they offer this in the summer I\u2019m gonna take a full load or more and move out of town and do online school while I live somewhere else for a few months. I love it I honestly hope they continue to offer online until they correct this COVID situation. I can work and not be stressed I hate sitting through lectures of shit I already knew. I read the text book thoroughly the beginning of the semester and just show up to take tests.",

I rarely stress about school because I just get ahead early so I can actually enjoy my life. Im not the type thats gonna study all night unless its like calculus 3 which is going to be a battle for me next semester.",

Most of the pre-engineering courses are only offered at a campus an hour away, in an area with some of the worst drivers in the state, whereas my local campus doesn't offer any courses further than Calc 2 and Chem I.  Right now I can take these classes at my leisure, the move to online hasn't affected my learning in the slightest, but probably starting Fall 2021  I'll have to be crisscrossing the city for several hours a week on top of working full time and I don't think I can manage.",

It's familiar to me, it's comfortable, and it spares me the stress of being away from home and dealing with circumstances I don't want to deal with.\n\nStill, it has its drawbacks. Professors and classmates don't respond to emails or hold conversations like they would in person. Other than that, I don't really feel like I'm missing much, because I was dreading college anyway.",

Since I started online lessons my grades went up, but that's not just it. I feel like I'm learning a lot more than ever, I'm assimilating things instead of justing memorizing them for the test. And to put the cherry on the cake I'm enjoying learning more than ever before.  \nAlthough I find myself in a very good situation I can understand that most people have often a hard time fitting the online education system.

I'm an art major, so practically all of my classes depended on being in the studio classes, but now all of them are virtual, so there are some cons where you don't see live demonstrations because seeing art on a computer screen has a different effect than seeing it in person. I'm moving towards animation, so that's less of a problem, but there are still some studio classes I'm taken as well. Honestly, I have social anxiety, and it's a blessing, where I'm less stressed out having to live with random people in dorms. I used to panic a lot, and stayed trapped in my room, to the point where I was afraid to come out if my suitemates invited their friends over, or I cried a lot, so I'm thankful there isn't stress coming from that aspect. Although, at the same time, it's a con, because I have less exposure to other people, meaning I have less practice with my social skills so there's that. But, overall I really like online classes, mostly due to financial reasons.",

But that's not necessarily because of online classes, more like the consequences of them (and the whole situation).\n\nIn theory, yes, studying from your own space is more comfortable, but my uni does full online with live classes. And with my workload that means I've been sitting here in this 3m\\^3 of space for two semesters now and I'm sick of it. My days were get up early, stare at the screen for classes until afternoon then start working on assignments on the same screens until past midnight then sleep. Rinse repeat because time has no meaning and all structure is gone from your life other than the grind.\n\nAnd this is the same space where I - theoretically - go to relax and unwind. That means all my personal projects and crafting and tinkering is here. Things that by week 4 I'm infinitely more interested in than my streamed lectures which just further erodes my focus. There is a reason most of my uni work is separate on my laptop and my home pc is mostly dedicated to gaming/free time stuff. \n\nIn-person classes meant that I had to move around all day and I had a clearly defined me space where I could relax. Especially since I did most of my studying camping in my friends' dorm rooms. \n\nI'm not an extremely outgoing person. But I need the social interaction. I live in the capital, my university is in the capital an hour of public transport away. Most of my uni friends do not live in the capital. So from home online classes also means that I effectively didn't meet any of them for months now.",

I spent literally more than 12h on each of my past exams. Stressful, but okay. The thing is: eventually you get more than one exam the same day... So it gets super stressful/tiring. \n\nI understand that it's a bit tricky to assess students online, but damm they could be a bit more creative...
