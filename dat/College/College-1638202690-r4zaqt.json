You gotta research your fields of interest and if your network can get you a job. I have a 3.8 and it took me probably 400 applications to get a job, but my buddy with a 2.8 got one with zero issue because he knows the company owner and is a hard worker (and smart at what he\u2019s good at).",

So I would focus on local companies, smaller engineering firms, etc and network as much as you can. With a stellar resume, networking is the best way to get a job, with a less than stellar GPA it is absolutely essential.",

              "text": "You could try putting your major GPA on online applications and your resume to at least get you past the online systems or first pass HR resume review, but you should be prepared to talk about it in an interview because it's better to be up front about it than to have them find out when they verify transcripts and wonder why you \"lied\". If they like you enough, especially if you have some relevant work experience, they might be willing to bypass the requirement, or give you a conditional offer that you bring your grades up.",
