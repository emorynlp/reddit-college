  "text": "Hello. I'm currently on the first semester of my second year taking civil engineering. I made the Dean's list the last 2 semesters. Long story short, I went downhill hard. I'm about to fail in two subjects, well basically three since one of them has a lab and lec separated. Engineering used to be my \"dream job\" but lately I'm an absolute mess, I don't even know what happened to me. Right now, I just know that this is not for me. I want to shift to Education. Also to transfer schools since my last one has Engineering as their forte and doesn't offer Educ.\n\nHere's the thing. I plan to drop those three classes that I'm failing, those are my major subjects so I won't be taking them again. But I'm thinking if I should drop the other class where I'm basically 50/50. I don't think it will be credited to BSED as well anyway so idk. Maybe it can make me focus on my GE classes that will be credited after shifting. Thoughts? Will chances of me getting accepted to a new university be affected if I have 4 dropped classes?",
