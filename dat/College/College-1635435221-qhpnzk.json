  "text": "So I recently mentioned that I'm almost done with my A.A. degree, and only have 6 credits left in foreign language. But to be able to transfer to the university of my choice I need 25 credits in other classes to even get into that program. So my school has this online self enrollment thing where you can see what classes you need to graduate and self enroll, which saves alot of time, and my previous advisor added the university prerequisites there as well. But recently, this new advisor deleted the option that let me enroll in the university prerequisites and is just trying to push me to take what I need to graduate. She keeps saying that the only way I'll complete my university prerequisites is if I do it as a non-degree student. But as a Pell grant recipient I really cannot afford to be a non-degree student, especially for 25 credits! What do you think I should do? Do you think this is sketchy that she removed that option from self enrollment?",
