  "text": "I'm applying to college for Anthropology, and I have to write a personal statement and an essay about why I want to go into Anthropology and what sort of career I'm hoping to get with it. There was no given word minimum or maximum, and I think because I really want this, I'm freezing up on it. I've read examples online, but every time I go to write anything, I just got blank. Any advice is helpful, thanks in advance!",

Keep in mind that the admissions committee members might have to read dozens or hundreds of essays like this, and they will not thank you for writing 20 pages (they likely won't read it all, either).\n\nBasically, write enough so that your motivation, plans, and career objectives are clear, but resist the temptation to write down every single thought about anthropology that has ever come into your head, etc.\n\nGood luck.",
