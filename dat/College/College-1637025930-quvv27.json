  "text": "I am super depressed and lonely in college . My first semester was going good at first, then I had to change floors because my roommate was never respecting boundaries and would always ask for my weed or used my shavers and stuff like that without asking me. So i changed floors, and when I changed floors I feel like i lost all my\nfriends since they were all friends with my old roommate. I feel so alone at this school and only feel \u201chappy\u201d when I\u2019m high, and that\u2019s not even real happiness, just feeling numb. I don\u2019t know what to do , I really love this city (San Francisco), but I am super homesick and will be closer to some of my friends that decided to go to community college. Is this the right decision? I feel super lonely here",

      "text": "Hey just wanna say your feelings of wanting to go home are totally valid and the roomie situation sounds like it sucks. Literally, people touching your stuff is an invasion of your privacy and not ok in any scenario. I'm struggling to do it too, but you can and will make friends. I'm trying to figure out the best ways to do that on my campus too, but tbh the best ideas i've heard are just (ik it sounds dumb but hear me out) joining clubs, getting an on-campus job, or doing other stuff you enjoy off campus. Even tho its awkward to do it, making study groups with people in classes is an easy way to talk to people bc you have something to talk about (and share in the suffering of a hard class) and then you can branch out and potentially hang out with them outside of study groups. idk if any of these things work, I'm lonely and trying them too, but I think it's worth a shot. < also with that, though you do need 420-friendly friends, its good to have friends who don't smoke too, so that you're making friends that have common interests with you beyond \\*just\\* oui'd",
