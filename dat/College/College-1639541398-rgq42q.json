  "text": "I know it sounds weird but basically in my history class there\u2019s like two finals or two final projects. So like one of them is that I have to watch and then write about a classical concert. I just don\u2019t feel like doing that so yea. On the other thing, I have to write an essay. So like my school uses canvas and on canvas you can put in grades for assignments to see how much it would affect your grade. When I put in a 0 for each assignment I still get a C. If I don\u2019t do the classical concert but I do the essay, I need a 62/100 to get a B. So what should I do? Should I just settle for a C or should i try to get a B?",

Plus when you start to BS it it might come easier than expected and it seems like if that happens then you could get an A which would be nice",

I turned it in with a note stating that it wasn\u2019t my best but that someone was better than nothing. I got a 92 just because my ideas were sound and well rounded and the paper was whole.
