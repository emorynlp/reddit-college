  "text": "Has this every happened to anyone? My economics professor still hasn\u2019t sent an email explaining what to expect on our final that\u2019s on saturday morning. I\u2019m still studying regardless, but it just seems really strange to me that a professor would wait this long to sent any kind of email regarding our final exam. Also to add more clarification, he sent emails about a week in advance in the 2 midterms we had earlier this semester.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve emailed him already and he didn\u2019t say anything.",
