  "title:": "I skip class because of my social anxiety",
  "text": "I used to attend my financial/accounting class every morning until I notice a routine that my professor does and that is calling on random people. Whenever she picks on people to answer the question, my anxiety goes through the roof and I start sweating and every sound just blurs out. It\u2019s not that I am too dumb to answer the question, but it takes me time to figure it out but having that much pressure on me with 30 people in the class waiting for me to answer doesn\u2019t really help. (This first started happening when I was in 5th grade when my teacher knew I didn\u2019t know the answer and proceeded to call on me every time and it carried on with my life). So now I don\u2019t attend my accounting class anymore but I try to keep up with the recorded lectures and online assignments however attendance is being graded on and my professor recently sent out an email to students who have been absent and she will start to cease the recordings which I cannot watch anymore. How do I tell her \u201cnot to call on me\u201d or how bad my anxiety gets? When I attended her class, I would focus on her lectures and take notes, so it wasn\u2019t like I was slacking off but when it came down to her calling on me, I just freeze and everything just dissolves.",

Being put on the spot will likely continue in subsequent classes and probably in your work life, too. It would be a good idea to try to work through this and figure out how to cope with it.",

      "text": "Would it help to know that no one really gives a shit? When someone answers a question in class and needs a moment to figure it out, says the wrong answer, or straight up says \"i dont know\" do you judge them or think any bad thoughts about them? Of course not. It might be comforting in some way to know its all in your head. You can remind yourself \"thats the anxiety talking, it doesnt really matter\". Sort of how like if youre tripping on acid and start to freak out, if you tell yourself \"its just the acid, im fine\" you tend to calm down. Try to see the bigger picture and overcome your intrusive thoughts",
