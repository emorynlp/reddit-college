Which is a medical reason, which could constitute an accommodation which could prevent your professors from being as strict about deadlines. I\u2019d really do some searching into accommodations for ADHD if you\u2019re actually diagnosed. After taking meds, I realized how much ADHD has fucked me over through the years. It fucks with your daily function.",
