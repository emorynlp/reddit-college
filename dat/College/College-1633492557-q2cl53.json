  "text": "I had this really awesome professor last semester who is also really high up there in terms of her position and accomplishments who, unfortunately, I\u2019ve never met in person bc her class was online due to COVID.\n\nI\u2019m wanting to reach out to her now bc I\u2019m applying to grad school after I graduate and I\u2019m hoping to get a letter of recommendation from her and I was really active in her class. I was going to bring her a small gift, which is something we\u2019ve talked about in class but she\u2019s probably never seen in real life and I happened to have some in my basement (legal, not wanting to say too much to keep her privacy) that i think she\u2019d really appreciate to show her future classes in person and also maybe make her think of me every time she shows a class like \u201cthis was given to me by a student on mine in a past class\u201d.\n\nI was planning on emailing her asking when she was available for me to drop by and say hi but idk when I should ask about the letter without it seeming like that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m talking to her. Like should I mentioned it in the initial email or meeting or should I make it a routine visit thing (prob not feasible since she is very busy).",

      "text": "Just be upfront about it, it\u2019s surprisingly more casual than you\u2019d think. \n\nYou can want to reach out because you genuinely liked her class/teaching and also because you want a recommendation from her. I chose the profs I personally liked best as recommenders and it seems like a lot of people do, so I think it\u2019s nice for them to be asked as reminders that they\u2019re making a positive difference in students lives.",
