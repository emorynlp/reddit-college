  "text": "Hey, I\u2019m a freshman 6 weeks into my first semester at university. I\u2019m a commuter and I am having a damn hard time making friends. \n\nI\u2019m not struggling with confidence, fear or any of that stuff. I\u2019m mainly just new to approaching others and trying to get to know them. The main questions I have is when is it a good opportunity to approach someone and what exactly should I be saying?\n\nI\u2019ve been going to events at college in hopes to meet others, so far it hasn\u2019t worked out that well either. Not really interested in any of the clubs that are offered, I also work so my schedule is tough. \n\nAny recommendations as to:\n\n1. How should I introduce myself to others?\n\n2. How to respectfully ask for there contact info; snapchat, IG or number?",

Even if you\u2019re not really \u201cdoing\u201d anything, at least go out and do nothing where people can see you and approach you. Try to strike up a conversation on something mutual. If you see them wearing a shirt for a hobby/band/organization that you like, bring it up.",

Like I typically study in silent room, but going to library gives me a lot of people to see and hopefully meet. Gym is one area I haven\u2019t tried yet but I\u2019m sure it will be a great social spot too. I typically workout at home. I\u2019ll try to spark convo\u2019s based on things people are wearing should be simple enough!",

Major, where they\u2019re from, what high school (if local), etc. ask to form study groups or like \u201chave you done the homework yet\u201d. You can get contact information that way if you\u2019re gonna do a group or study later. Try to find people with the same major you\u2019ll probably be seeing them again. I met one of best friends from college while I was commuting for community college. I literally asked him about a quiz or hw and hes been a gaming buddy and school carry for 3 years now.",
