  "text": "Seriously. You\u2019re a grown up now and free bailouts aren\u2019t a thing. Hangovers suck. blacking out isn\u2019t fun and you can get in some serious trouble that you won\u2019t even remember in the morning. Watch your drinks, slam a glass of water before bed/right after waking up, and keep your hands to yourself. Lastly DO NOT DRIVE IF YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING. Even if it\u2019s one beer. Not-a-drop laws will screw you and you will deserve it honestly.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna scare anyone. It\u2019s important to have fun when at school. Just be smart, you\u2019ll thank yourself later on.",

All in all he almost had an entire bottle of vodka. \n\nI had to stay up with him all night so he wouldn't choke on vomit or fall over and concuss himself. He couldn't walk,, he had to crawl everywhere. When he stood up he would immediately fall over and multiple times almost hit his head.. The longest 6 hours of my life. He vomited until there was nothing else coming out, and then he dry heaved for q couple of hours. He couldn't drink water without throwing up. Took him to the ER in the morning when I'd sobered up. Doctors said he could very well have died if we hadn't taken him there. He need 2 iv bags of water. \n\nHe wasn't able to eat for nearly 2 days before he could finally hold down food down again. One of the worst days in my life.\n\nWatch what you drink, drink with people you trust, don't give your already drunk friend more than they need. And drink water.",

It's about telling people the safest way of going about it. Like OP said, you can get drunk but try not to drive while you're wasted. \n\nbtw, I had a similar experience to you and my limit is also around 4 shots (of something about 40% alcohol). Since I found this out the first time I got drunk, I didn't get super fucked up since either.\n\nWhere the harm reduction part came in is that when I got drunk, I did it around people who I knew and trusted with people who were there and could watch me to make sure I am safe. There was someone there to make sure I don't do 10 shots and end up doing something really bad. \n\nGetting super fucked up to the point you black out will teach you your limits. But harm reduction tells you that if you do it (you're first time when discovering your limits) at a place where you don't know anyone and there isn't anyone there to watch you, then this might be a bad idea. Especially for women where they often times get taken advantage of in this state.\n\n>HOWEVER, taking 10 shots and landing yourself in the hospital is dumb and should be discouraged\n\nWow, it seems like you fully agree with me that we should spread some harm reduction information then",

It's a good thing I never said that the best way to approach this issue is to get an authoritative figure to just tell them \"no\".\n\nThere's a difference between teaching someone harm reduction and teaching abstinence (being the \"no\"). I supported the former not the latter.\n\nThe difference is that when it comes to harm reduction you're giving someone information on how to go about doing something in the safest way possible as oppose to abstinence where you tell them not to do the thing at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example if we take the issue of teen pregnancy, someone who teaches abstinence will just tell teenagers to not have sex. Someone who teaches harm reduction would educate teenagers about protection and how to do it safely. Based on the data we have, teaching harm reduction (in this case) works better since in schools/areas where sex education focuses on teaching about protection generally tend to have lower teen pregnancy rate.\n\nThis is just one case study in how harm reduction practices do work. Will teaching and giving teens access to protection completely eliminate teen pregnancy? no. In the same way that teaching people who to party safely won't prevent unsafe situations entirely. But that doesn't mean that teaching harm reduction is something that just shouldn't be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Unpopular opinion here, but blacking out and hangovers can help teach teenagers their actual limits.\n\nSure, that's one way to learn your limits but this isn't necessarily the best way lol. Yes having a hangover could suck but you won't die. However blacking out at a party with a lot of people you don't know can actually be unsafe (particularly to women but generally to anyone).\n\nSo if you can learn your limits in a safer way then why should you subject yourself to this unsafe situation to learn your limits?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I mean, to someone who\u2019s never been drunk, what does a limit even mean? By the time you\u2019re drunk past your limit, you\u2019re not thinking \u201cyep, this is my limit, here it goes, let me stop.\u201d And let\u2019s be real, being drunk is fun for most college freshman, so no one cares to stop while they\u2019re in the moment anyway.\n\nWell obviously I'm not saying you should never get drunk (look back at my first paragraph about harm reduction vs. abstinence). You can get drunk and start learning your limits without putting yourself in an unsafe situation of blacking out around a lot of people who might not be interested in taking care of you. Believe me I know that being drunk at a party is fun af, and I've approached my limit before (getting to the point of throwing up multiple times). So what you're saying doesn't really address the point that I'm making because I never said that people shouldn't get drunk",

You can almost assuredly find a peer mentoring program of some kind though at your university or in the community. Ultimately, all I am to students is someone they have rapport with who can help them figure out where to get resources and support, and you can find that in a lot of people outside of formal programming.\n\nAs for drinking, there\u2019s a lot of advice, so just take this as adding to the chorus, not some kind of authoritative knowledge. Realize that your drinking habits is a relationship between alcohol, your body, and mind; not one of those things are the same between different people, so you just have to learn how your body and mind reacts to alcohol. My honest recommendation is to find a beer and/or wine and/or cocktail that you enjoy. Personally I drink PBR\u2019s and Gin and Tonics always. By doing this you can get a sense of where you normally are per drink (for me 2 g&ts I\u2019m buzzed, 3-4 I\u2019m drunk, never pass 5 unless I\u2019ve been drinking for more than six hours), and doing this gives you an idea if your drink was poured strong or not and you can adjust accordingly. Learn how you handle shots. If you\u2019re new to drinking ease into it and learn your limits. Drink water throughout the night and after you\u2019re finished. Always drink with friends and keep checking in with each other. Plan ahead with your friends and make sure everyone knows what to do if something happens, or when you want to be cut off, if you plan on going home with anyone, coordinate safe words, etc. Sleep on your side. Make your own drinks or leave it to a bartender. Don\u2019t accept others drinks. Don\u2019t leave your drink. Acknowledge and address the disparities in unwanted drinking incidents between different identities. Don\u2019t mix booze with drugs. For those that will inevitably try to get crossfaded, don\u2019t, but get high first and then sip some beers until desired effect is reached, but don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Ever. Drive. After. Drinking. It\u2019s ok to ask others if your drinking habits are healthy, a lot of us had to relearn what healthy drinking habits are in quarantine and checking in with trusted people is ok. Acknowledge that anyone can be susceptible to alcoholism and alcohol abuse. It\u2019s not a reflection of someone\u2019s character and it should be treated with empathy. If people are reaching out to you about your habits be empathetic of their intentions, if you\u2019re reaching out to someone about their habits, be empathetic of their position. When in doubt, ask questions. Just be mindful.",

More importantly, I was raised by Southern Baptists and I can tell you that blanket bans on drinking can be harmful in encouraging an all-or-nothing, black and white mentality around alcohol.\n\nI'd certainly advise anyone with a family history of alcoholism, substance abuse, or addictive personalities to steer clear, but for the rest of us, it seems impractical.",
