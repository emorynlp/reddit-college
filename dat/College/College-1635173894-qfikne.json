  "text": "So, I\u2019m a sophomore student and I\u2019m currently really struggling with a class. The teaching style isn\u2019t something I\u2019m able to follow and it\u2019s just overall a lot to handle even with my academic accommodations for my learning disabilities. I have enough credits where I can drop the class without my financial aid being affected. I feel like academically the best thing for me would be to drop it and take an easier class the next semester as it\u2019s pass the add/drop period and I can only drop a class.",

      "text": "Do you have limitations on how many Ws can be on your transcript? I think what you've said sounds like a good reason to drop. A lot of scholarships require 30 hours during the year, including summer. But 12 hours is full time. So I'd drop this one and do a lot more homework before selecting classes in the future... And get out before drop/add is over. Maybe even before you've dropped, go talk to the accessibility people and tell them you need more accomodations than what you have. Do you need transcripts of lectures? Copies of slides? Recording the lecture? They will work with you. Just be sure to drop before the W period is over!",

          "text": "I\u2019m not sure but I do know that this is the first class I\u2019d be withdrawing from and most likely the only one. I\u2019m planning on meeting with the disability accommodations lady who I work with for all my accommodations to discuss it after this class is over today, I have to have at least 12 credits to remain full time and currently I have 18, I talked with my academic advisor about it today and she said that dropping it wouldn\u2019t affect my financial aid. The only thing really holding me back from it would be how my mother reacts but she doesn\u2019t really know how my brain works with school and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d rather me just pass.",

Your mom will be fine with it - you are saving your GPA from a bad professor. And even a couple of Ws won't matter on the transcript, though less is better. You've got this!",
