Somedays I barely eat anything for hours and get really dizzy. I\u2019m also pretty picky and don\u2019t eat from the dining hall and try to cook.",

I was having a similar problem but found some solutions.\n\nSince I\u2019m doing most of my cooking, I reserve it for the weekend. I don\u2019t try to attempt to cook during the week too much because I either have no time or am super busy. You must find time be it the weekend or weekday! \n\nI meal prep **everything**. This is not just for meals, but also ingredients. All the vegetables and fruits in my fridge have been precut by me because I know I will need them at some point. \n\nMake a list of really easy meals and categorize them by how much time they take to make. \n\nMy classes have a no eating policy as well. I started packing snacks in my bag that are easy to eat in between classes and that I can also walk with. Fruits, bread with Nutella, cheese, roasted veggies, granola bars, etc. it will hold you over.\n\nHope that helps!",

You usually can buy meals in the dining hall individually it just isn't as cheap over all as a dining plan.you need to look for foods that are dense in nutrients and calories. Nuts, peanut butter, avocados, cheese, high protein  bars. Smoothies are also a good option you could add protein powder or buy premade drinks. You may also be dehydrated. Eat smaller meals throughout the day.",
