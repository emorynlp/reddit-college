I leave unplanned slots in my calendar just to do whatever I feel like doing that day.",

Of course I'm just part-timing it due to my work schedule, I also try to take some 1-2 day road trips once or twice a month to break up the monotony. Even with a full-on, 15-20 unit schedule I see some kids doing, I think the same could work for them if they were to plan it once a month or every other month.Don't always have to wait for Spring or Summer break to get out of town for a little bit.  \nOf course working out and other physical activities every day or every other day works too. Just be sure you get some tips on how to do it properly. I did my shoulder in pretty bad a few weeks ago and am waiting on the next doctor appointment to get it ironed out. For a young buck, easily recoverable. For a 36 yr old who just recently started to get serious about it again, got to watch myself. Getting old blows.",

They cut it short to switch things up. \n\nYou gotta switch things up. \n\nWhen I say drastic I don\u2019t mean something like switch your major or quit your job or move out or something else that you may not wanna do/msy not be ready for. \n\nI mean pursue that thing you\u2019ve always wanted to do but we\u2019re too scared to. For example if you\u2019re shy, go meet out and meet new people. If you\u2019ve always thought of playing an instrument, pick up a guitar. If you wondered about how the Russian language (3 alphabets) can be translated to English (1 alphabet), learn the Russian language lol\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t know what the fuck to do, some common things that always bring people joy and are gealthy for them physically and/or mentally are exercising, (doesn\u2019t even have to be all out. Just go for some walks, jog, play a recreational sport, etc), community clubs, music like I\u2019ve mentioned before, etc. \n\nBasically any passtime that will benefit you in some way, earn you money, make your mental health better, make your physical health better, and that you look forward to doing. \n\nIf nothing I\u2019ve said interests you then just do anything different. Something new. Anything at all even if it doesn\u2019t quite spark your interests, you never know once you get involved.",

You need to add to your weekly routine and actually try before you get any benefit of satisfaction. The 3 week rule is good in developing a routine.

I didn\u2019t meet people, I ate all my meals alone, hung out in my dorm alone. I had 0 friends. And life got super depressing. I felt like no one noticed me and I just existed in a kind of monotonous purgatory. For a while, I was considering ending it all just because I didn\u2019t see a point to living, as sad as it seems. This year, I\u2019ve worked my absolute hardest to get to know everyone possible. People next to you in classes. Someone you recognize from another class. Even just talking to professors during office hours. Statistically, some of them will become your good friends. And don\u2019t let those friendships stagnate\u2014go do literally anything. Do whatever you have ever wanted! Have fun! Go find a back road somewhere and get drunk with people, or meet for breakfast at Waffle House, or have some people over to play poker. Go thrifting, or have a movie night, or go long boarding in a parking lot night. Just hang out with people and become friends.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you or your situation are anywhere near as bad as mine were. But as someone else who struggled to not be bored freshman year, I want the best for you.",

Slice of Life are a nice change of pace because there is no \u201creal plot.\u201d You kinda just watch scenes that are just enjoyable to watch, and they develop characters through that. This is typically done through comedy. I like this one because it still somewhat has a plot, and it has great SOL elements. Another one thats pretty good is Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid. This one has less plot, more comedy. Literally put, it explores \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios with a bizarre theme; The main character meets a dragon that can transform into a human with a maid costume. Pretty silly premise, but its fun to watch how the dragon has to try to adapt to our world.",

All I would do is wake up, go to class, come back and do homework, watch YouTube, eat sleep repeat. I had to force myself out of my comfort zone in order to find something fun and exciting for me.\n\nAlso, if you think you could manage it, get a job on campus. It won't pay much, but it's a resume builder, gets you out of the house for a few hours, and they're super flexible with hours because they hire a lot of students.\n\nBottom line; you have to put yourself out there and actually find stuff to do. Stuff won't come to you, unfortunately. But that slight discomfort of being in a new place with new people will dwindle away eventually when you finally found your niche in your campus. Good luck!",

Join a martial arts class or ballet or something. You can find loads of classes near you and a lot of the time you'll just naturally make friends in them and you can ask them to get coffee or something to continue the friendship outside of class and then they'll probably invite you places to hang out too. Or if you like being alone there's tons of things to get into at home. Things are a lot more accessible then you'd think.",
