  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman at Florida State University. I\u2019m originally from Chicago, so i basically came here without knowing anyone. I have a group of friends that I hang out with about once a week, but it seems that I found a tendency to want to be alone more than usual. My days are still packed, I workout a lot (actually lost 20 pounds since college started) and I\u2019m currently spending a lot of time studying my third language. My grades are good. Basically what i\u2019m asking if this is somewhat normal/ok. My mom worries that I\u2019ll miss out on the \u201ccollege experience\u201d. I\u2019ve gone out to bars a multitude of times already and just don\u2019t see the appeal because I can\u2019t drink due to my diet. Has anyone had similar experiences?",

What about a loud crowded college bar?\u201d\n\nMy response: \u201cNo\u2026\u201d\n\nOnly way around that is to just do you! Socialize when you feel like it, prioritize the few people you do meet that you *really* think are cool. So many people have tons of \u201cfriends\u201d in college, but really in name only. I\u2019d rather have a few good ones.",

As I mentioned, I think the first girl I dated thought I was lame for not wanting to go to frat parties or whatever big outing with her. She\u2019d always talk about all these people she knew that were going or she met or whatever. That rubbed off on me. The next one thought I was a slacker for procrastinating things, or sometimes preferring a slow weekend where I slept in a bit and cleaned the place, washed the car, etc. I wasn\u2019t \u201caccomplishing\u201d enough. I let that get to me too. Don\u2019t let that happen to you! You *will* meet people who think your lifestyle is cool, especially when you get further along. By Junior/Senior year, some people actually start to think it\u2019s cool when you have hobbies and a life outside of parties and drinking games.",

Since the pandemic I just want my degree and to get out of here. I'm over it! The most social interaction I get is talking to my roommate sometimes, texting/calling family and friends from back home at least once a day, and hanging out with my boyfriend every weekend. That's all I need now.\n\nEdited a word",

Mastering the joy of being alone as a freshman will help you out in the long run, most groups won\u2019t last 2nd year and you\u2019ll find most people you meet want something from you with little return. Doing things alone is a freedom many fear especially at a party school like ours, take advantage of the ease of parties here but also recognize those days and nights you just want for your own interests.",
