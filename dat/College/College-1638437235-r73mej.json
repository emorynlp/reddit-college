  "text": "I feel totally hopeless and lost about my future because I have no idea what I'm doing in school and can't seem to cope or manage myself and my grades. First off, I am a first-year student who is almost finished my first semester, and it's been absolute hell. I was taking 4 classes but ended up dropping physics because I didn't take physics in high school and I didn't have any foundation so I was entirely confused. I'm now just taking human anatomy, calculus and an elective course but I am 100% going to fail math because I have no idea what is going on even though I have been seeking help. I'll have to retake it in the summer.\n\nThis has caused my anxiety to increase tremendously because I am doing so poorly already in my first semester, mainly because of cognitive and time management challenges.  It's terrifying cause I am just in general social sciences right now but my end goal is to go into kinesiology and then physiotherapy but I don't think I can do it. I've completely fucked things over for myself by not taking physics in high school because when I applied for the kinesiology program that's what I was missing so I didn't get accepted even though I had a high average and could've gotten in if I had taken the DAMN course!!!\n\nI wanted to apply for the kinesiology program in year 2 but I don't have all the prerequisites for it yet because I still need physics and math. The program is very competitive and requires a B+ average or a 3.7gpa and at this point, I am definitely nowhere near that. At least next semester I am taking more classes that I enjoy. However, as of now, there's no way I can even think about applying for the program because I don't have all the required courses or high enough grades, so now I am just monumentally fucked. \n\nI'm debating whether I should take a gap semester/year next year or take different courses to switch to another program. I feel so hopeless, I really want to do kinesiology because I love studying the human body and biomechanics. I want to be able to help people and their injuries but I can't even do basic math and physics!! I love biology and English but I still need physics, chem, and math for most majors that I am interested in.\n\nI wish I had taken a gap year this year and just updated my high school credits and reapplied to the kinesiology program with those credits. I honestly didn't know I could've done that till now and I wish I had more direction in high school. I had no idea how unprepared I was going into university and I wish I had more guidance going into it.\n\nMy situation is very complicated and I'm not even sure if there is a solution at all. I feel like my two options at this point are gap year or switch majors (which is also very difficult). If anyone could leave feedback that'd be great, but please don't tell me what kind of idiot I am cause I already know.",
