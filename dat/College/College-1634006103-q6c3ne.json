  "text": "Hello! I have a question to ask about U.S universities/colleges' scholarships toward Asian apllicants.\n\nFirst, I will introduce myself. \nI'm Daniel Oh from Korea. I'm attending International Highschool. My parents income is way below an average for the houshold of 7. \n\nMain Question:\nI'm well aware of colleges that are need-based & need-blind (Harvard, Amherst, etc). Chance for me to get into those schools is low.\n\n1. I'm wondering if other colleges, which are need-based, have chance for me to get in if I claim for financial need because I've heard that schools that are not need-blind are likely to reject international students with financial needs. \n\n2. If there are any universities/colleges that gives scholarships to Asians well, please tell me so...\n\n*I am absolutely worried that I might not be able to study more than Highschool just because of money...\ud83d\ude2d\n\n+ my personal opinion after all these:\nI personally feel U.S universities are such a institution full of nationalism & racist, not providing scholarships to internationals who are way better than U.S citizens and just cutting off because one clicking the financial need box? \n\nFeel free to oppose or discuss facts I got them wrong, please.",
