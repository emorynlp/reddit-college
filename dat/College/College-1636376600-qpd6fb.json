  "text": "Does anyone else feel as if they're working/studying inefficiently or really slowly? \n\nFull time chem student here in my final year of undergrad. I turn in all of my assignments  on time and passing all my classes with at least an 80% currently, but lately I just feel super unmotivated. I feel tired all the time even if I haven't been using my brain much or on days when I don't even go to work. Doing my assignments just feels like it's taking a lot longer than it should. As an example, typing out just a paragraph can sometimes take me an hour and I don't think it should be this way. Music sometimes helps but I'm not sure it actually affects how fast I work. Just to clarify, I'm not on any medication and don't take drugs recreationally either.\n\nAny tips on working more efficiently or maintaining focus? Thanks!",

      "text": "Yes i feel this, i often feel like sluggish and dont want to read that book or type that essay. What I do to help this is i put YouTube on while doing something or I will set a timer for however long i feel I want to go, and put the distractions far away from reach. For example i set a hour to do only math homework on my phone timer, then i put the phone by me bed and go to my desk to work. I often finish before the timer goes off but you could even do smaller increments like 20 minutes of work, 20 minute break. Depends on what u gotta do and what\u2019s coming up tho",

Don\u2019t recall the name of it\u2026 but it\u2019s entirely instrumental and it starts out very slow and eventually it speeds up faster and faster\u2026\nI used it for writing papers when I was in school. You start out kind of writing slowly but you speed up little by little until by the end of the song your fingers are a blur on the keyboard.",
