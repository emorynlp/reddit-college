      "text": "My advice: log off Reddit and do something else for a day. Then you can start to make better, non stressed decisions. Plenty of people don\u2019t go on to medical school and have good careers and lives. \n\nTransferring schools, where you\u2019ll basically be starting over, doesn\u2019t seem to make sense. One way to end up with tons of debt is to have lots of major changes, dropped classes and transferring schools",

      "text": "College can be an overwhelming experience.  Take a deep breath and do some reflection on why this semester was such a challenge.  Many people can recover from a bad semester and still fulfil their dreams.  Have you met with a pre-med advisor to consider other medical careers?  Working towards goals in small increments can help make them more manageable.   Could you work towards a LPN or scrub tech degree to get into the medical field and see if it is what you really want?  I'm in PA school right now but it took a lot of hard work and overcoming MANY challenges to get here.  If it's what you really want don't give up and don't be afraid to ask for help!",

      "text": "hello again and thank you to everyone who responded. i am a bit calmer now lol and i appreciate all that you have said. i also realized that i forgot to mention some important details. one of the main reasons i\u2019m thinking of transferring is because of money. the school i go to is really expensive and my parents are constantly on my ass about loans and money so if i transferred it would be to a cheaper school. as far as my career path goes, i\u2019m still very undecided. i do like medicine, but there are so many other things that i\u2019d like to explore like business or writing. i just don\u2019t know",

      "text": "You did well in high school because you\u2019re smart and life was scheduled for you. Unfortunately, you never learned how to manager your obligations nor did you learn how to study.\n\nJust take a breath and know things will be ok. I was exactly where you were 15 years ago (1st semester gpa of 1.2). I\u2019ve got a house, great career, and big salary. \n\nOnly take 12 credits next semester. Make sure you attend every class no matter what. Don\u2019t play video games. Start eating healthy now and develop an exercise routine - running is usually an easy one. \n\nNext semester, pay attention to how you learn best. Do you learn by listening, by rewriting notes, by reading the textbook, or by working through problems? Once you know how you learn best, you can develop how you study best.",
