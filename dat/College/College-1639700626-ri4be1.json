  "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nI have currently been offered an internship at Tesla within Finance and Accounting and at UBS (swiss bank) within Asset Management. However, I am unsure which one to pick. Any advice on what would look best on a CV and help me land some nice positions in the future?\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Tesla has a more stressful work culture and the pay does not reflect that.\n\nUBS is well respected and it's a Swiss company so naturally they are probably more relaxed with work hours. Also it will give you more connections in banking and the option to relocate to their other offices down the road.",
