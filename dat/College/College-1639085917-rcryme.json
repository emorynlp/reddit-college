  "text": "Hi,\nI transferred to my university after taking a few years off in fall 2020 and had mostly online classes fall \u201820 and spring \u201821. The only exceptions were 1 lab meeting a month socially distanced. This past semester fall \u201821 has been a brutal wake up call. My school took away our option for a hybrid class and made in person learning mandatory. \nHas anyone felt like this semester has been exceedingly difficult compared to online? I failed my chemistry 2 lecture class and got an A in the separately graded lab portion.\nI feel like some of the professors don\u2019t understand the impact this transition has on undergrads. \nAnyone else having trouble with required in person classes compared to the online classes last year?",
