  "title:": "Possible to pay for Uni all on my own?",
  "text": "Hey 18yo freshman here,\n\nCurrently attending community college for my first two years of computer science to save money. And I've been thinking about moving out to university and paying for it *all on my own* after I receive my associates. This might seem a bit of a stretch (and probably wont even be possible), but could I possibly pay for ***all*** my dorm and tuition expenses, while working part time somewhere with my associates? I plan to attend the University of Washington (Seattle) and I've heard its roughly 25k a year. I would like not to even think about taking out loans of any kind, or asking family for financial help. Just me on my own. Is anyone currently doing this, or is thinking the same thing? Hell, is this even possible? I also currently do the FAFSA, and plan to apply for some scholarships when the time comes (if that even helps). I am also currently working part time, and im saving as much money as I possibly can. If this is completely out of the realm of possibility, please let me know. It's my second month of college and I have little to no knowledge on things like this. Thanks to all who reply :)",

      "text": "I've taken out minimal loans and made it the rest of the way on FAFSA and scholarships/grants. I also did all 4 years at a university instead of the much more financially and personally responsible choice of going to community college first.\n\nWith all that and a work study (which in some cases will either knock off tuition or allow the school to pay you with govt money) and/or a weekend gig, you may be able to make it work with a payment plan. Not sure what your min wage is...\n\nI'd reccomend checking the school website for a full cost of attendance breakdown, and estimate what you'd need to pay monthly if you had 0 aid to cover it, 1/4 aid, half aid, or 3/4 aid. Might help you picture it a bit better.",

              "text": "That's better than where I'm at, but the cost of living might be higher in general so who knows. My parents helped me budget when I was headed off for college. My dorm fee included a meal pass so I never worried about food, but it may be different where you are. \n\nAnyways, a good budget is your friend. Remember you don't necessarily have to limit yourself specifically to what's budgeted, it's mainly to give you a prediction and help you keep track of your money - that will be most important if you plan to make it through without loans",

      "text": "Im currently doing this as my father took my money i got from insurance when I was young.\n\nAnyways, ive got 20k in loans, all public, but I started from scratch almost. My father decided to give me a house (one of the 3 he bought with my money) as I went into military to help pay for college. My new college ive been on my own ever since and its doable.\n\nI work part time making about 21/hr (24hrs a week) my take home is about 1600, but I just enrolled in the 403(b) so 4%less) I spend about 750 on living and its comfortable, im doing my budgeting here shortly.\n\nIm also army reserve, I get 600 a month while in school (supposedly) havent gotten it yet. I get about 100 extra a month from that. I plan to use that for medical and have the rest go into retirement. \n\nI do scholarships often. Do them, time/money value is insane when you think about it. \"500 bucks for a research paper? Give me 6hrs over 3 days and done.\n\nIts doable, but utilize your resources and make dont be afraid of public loans, learn about all the benefits, too.",

Using a budgeting app can be so helpful, I use one called Buxfer. Good for you for wanting to not only get your education but not wanting to take out loans. Start looking into scholarships now, if they can pay for your education now, and you don't have to put anything out of pocket then that's even more money you can save today.",
