  "text": "So I need some advice in regards to my units and a job. A little of background first this upcoming spring semester spring 2022 will be my last semester to graduate, and I'm planning on taking 21 units. Thing is I've never taken 21 units before and I'm afraid this retail job will take too much of my time therefore leading to my downfall for my last semester. Now I know it mainly comes down to organization and time but I honestly want to enjoy my last semester not be stressed out going from school to my job back and forth. Plus, this job stressed me out to the absolute limit but the co-workers there is what made it bearable, I guess what I'm asking for is some advice and maybe some suggestions.\nThank You",
