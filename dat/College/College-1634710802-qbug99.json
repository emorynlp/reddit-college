      "text": "I mean the institution is not really meant for online meeting or discussions like zoom, meet or whatever platform they want. Give yourself some slack and acknowledged that first.\n\nTry to have a space in your room that you only study, do homework, or productive stuffs for your schooling. In that way, your mind will pick up easily if you go to that space.\n\nAlso, if you're professor is really really boring, try to follow them by questioning yourself too. It works for me so I guess it might help you too.\n\nTry also to have some ambient noise like some rain shower sound while you're on the meeting to keep you hooked in some way and hear less noise outside of that lecture.\n\nI hope this help, try also to look on the internet, youtube some stuff about this. I recommend Dr. K at healthy gamer since he really help me to keep me going in my first year of college which is still ongoing.",
