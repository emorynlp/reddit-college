      "text": "That very very much depends on your skill set. \n\nI enjoyed biology, especially my anatomy courses. It helped me understand my body better, and as a parent it\u2019s so nice to be able to explain puberty with an actual understanding of what a wild bender your body is on. \n\nI commented on another post about the hardest major, and my opinion is that it is the one you dislike, so frankly, pick the one you dislike least and just suck it up.",

      "text": "I hate memorizing stuff, so if you\u2019re anything like me, then I\u2019d stay away from biology. \n\nI\u2019ve taken both physics and chemistry as a fellow comp sci major, so ik what to expect in those two classes. If you took any high school chemistry class and you\u2019re taking gen chem 1 (or a version of chem 101 at your school), then that would be the easiest option for you. This class goes over things like Lewis structures, the properties within the periodic table, and protons, neutrons, and electrons. If you somewhat remember these things and have had that hs chemistry class, then I\u2019d preferably go with this class. \n\nPhysics is probably one of the hardest classes that I\u2019ve taken so far. I didn\u2019t know any physics coming into this class, and while the first two tests I took were somewhat easy, I straight up failed the third test. Newton\u2019s laws, the topic of work, velocity and acceleration were the easier parts, but if you ever get to rotational motion, then that\u2019s were that gets hard. I managed an A in the course, but since you want an easy science, I\u2019d stay away unless you took physics in hs",
