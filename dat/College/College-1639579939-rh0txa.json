  "text": "I\u2019m going into Spring semester of my Sophomore year of college, and after this recent fall semester my gpa has fallen to a 2.756. I\u2019ve been slacking bc of personal issues, but if I were to grind and get straight A\u2019s in spring, with four courses, do you think my gpa could be a 3.3 or higher? I\u2019m going to try my hardest this and next semester. I need good grades, I\u2019m ashamed to tell my parents my GPA.",

The issues that were there last semester are likely to still be a problem next semester and you'll need to take steps to address them.",
