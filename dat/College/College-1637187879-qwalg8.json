  "title:": "I'm 25, I'm going to be a sophomore in college next year at 26. My 1st time living away from home. Because of 2 serious illnesses that kept me in the hospital around 1/2 the year since I was 16 I missed out on high school, college, and my early 20s.",
  "text": "Is there any chance for me to go back to school and get the typical college experience that American media hypes up so much? Or is it too late at this point and I should give up on ever having the 18-21 experience at school? Also to be clear, I do not mean having this experience with traditionally aged college undergrads, but with people in their 20s.",

I quit and ran a successful business then returned to collage at 31. This was 1985. I knew why I was there and I did okay. I went off to work in my field for a while. I wouldn\u2019t go back unless I had a solid game plan for my major and a career or at least a job in mind first. Best!\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39",
