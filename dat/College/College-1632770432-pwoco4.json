  "text": "I\u2019m just sitting in a random building on campus waiting for my bus and some kid was pulled into the hall 2 doors down from where I\u2019m sitting by the professor.\n\nProfessor: There is a nice way and a rude way to say you already turned I the assignment. \u201cFuck that I\u2019m not doing that shit again\u201d is the rude way.\n\nStudent: ok. But I have it to the sub, I swear!\n\nThis is so funny to me. This is an adult going to college throwing a fit about a misplaced assignment.",
