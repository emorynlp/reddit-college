How could I go from dean's list to C's list? C's don't get into graduate school. I'm loosing hope, and I'm only getting older. \n\nI can't deal with the teasing from my new brainiac boyfriend and my parents will compare me to my younger sisters GPA. I feel like giving up.",

It sounds like you know this already!! \n3) new love interest and family should be supportive but the world is not perfect. Do not let this detract from your future performance. As for the new boyfriend, ask yourself will it matter in five years time? Six months or a year from now? Anyone not supportive of your study efforts is not someone you need around. You got this!! \nI had a rough first semester and ended up improving and going to grad school, but took the first semester as a wake-up call. Good luck!!",

I will definitely try to manage my time better next semester!\n\nHe is supportive of my study efforts, & sometimes he tries to help me which makes me happy that he does go the extra mile to help me.  It\u2019s just that I\u2019m afraid of disappointing him when he ask me my final letter grades.. he\u2019s the definition of a nerd and is extremely intelligent, he clearly has a blessed brain and I\u2019m afraid he will think poorly of me because of my GPA this semester..\n & you\u2019re right I did know this already, but ever since I broke up with my ex I feel like I\u2019m relearning everything that\u2019s supposed to be important to me.  At one point this semester I wondered why was I here in the first place? Initially it was to have a better life with my ex..\nI understand now that my education is for my own personal development, so that I can have a good life too regardless of whom I\u2019m with.\n\nI really did try this semester, I do know that I could\u2019ve done better if I tried harder and managed my time. But I my motivation was gone.. I dragged myself to class everyday.\n\nThank you so much!! I will take this as a warming too and get better next semester!! I won\u2019t let this beat me up!!",

From everyone, of course, but we can't really change our family. But you can change a trash boyfriend. Don't settle just because you're scared of being alone.\n\nAlso, remember that C's get degrees. And you likely still have time to boost your GPA for grad school. This is not the end of the world, even though it may feel like it. We all have our ups and downs, but they don't define us. What defines us is how we deal with them and make it through to the other side. Wishing you all the best for your future.",
