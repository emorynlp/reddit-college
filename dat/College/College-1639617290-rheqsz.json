  "text": "Yesterday and today this morning I was feeling terrible.\n\nLast week of exams and I thought the anxiety was from my dependence on coffee.\n\nI was feeling anxious paranoid and spiteful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt so shitty that I just chose to have a regular sized meal. I usually don't like eating until I'm stuffed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I feel moderately energized.\n\nI guess I just needed to eat...perhaps.",
