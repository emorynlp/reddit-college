  "title:": "I'm a college junior and I'm trying to choose between two majors",
  "text": "So, my college career has been very weird in that I didn't go in with a plan (\"I'm want to go to Med School someday\", \"I want to be an accountant\", etc.). I've taken an extremely wide-range of classes: everything from physical geology and molecular biology to Cultural Anthropology and Intro to Southern Lit. There's nothing wrong with taking a wide variety of classes, but it does mean that it is almost the end of the first semester of my junior year and I am running out of time and options regarding my major. I'm trying to decide between philosophy and psychology. Both are subjects I'm passionate about, and I would consider studying both in graduate school. I think my ultimate goal is becoming an academic. But I don't know if I would prefer being in a Psych Lab or studying/writing about more abstract matters. In some ways I think of psychology as applied philosophy or scientific philosophy. I can ask certain philosophical questions, but study them in a more empirical way rather than relying on thought experiments. I am also interested in learning more about the scientific method. But at the same time I'm not sure how good of a scientist I would truly be in that the lab work I have done in college has been pretty uninteresting to me. I'm also thinking about pressure from my family. My family would prefer that I study a STEM field, but they are also adamant that I graduate in four years. They would be pretty displeased if I get a philosophy degree. They probably won't see a psychology degree as much better, but they will complain less about it I think. They are just against me getting a philosophy degree, but I don't think they would cut me off if I did so. I would just have to have some difficult conversations. Anyway, I'm rambling at this point so let me know what you guys think!  And in case, you're working, I cannot major in one and minor in the other. I have 14 spaces to fill over the next three semesters plus another 1.5 credits to make up somehow either by over-loading one semester or taking summer classes.",

Not \"labs\" that are done as part of classes that you've taken, but actual research outside of class done with a professor as part of the professor's own personal research lab.",

              "text": "Okay-- then my suggestion is to see if you can find a psychology professor that is willing to let you get real experience working in their lab. Doing real research is very different than the sort of labs you do with classes, so I wouldn't write it off, but you won't know until you try it (and you'll also probably have a hard time getting into grad school without any exposure, to be honest, if you go the psych route). \n\nMake sure that any professors you talk to know you're interested in becoming an academic in psychology. Sometimes it's hard to get a professor to accept you as a volunteer in their lab, but sometimes you can get lucky. I'd say volunteering in a psych lab should be your number one goal right now though as long as you're considering psych as a career path, because that's pretty core to 1) knowing whether or not you like it, and 2) actually getting accepted into grad school.\n\nEdit: There are also probably areas of psychology that overlap with philosophy and grad programs that will allow you to engage in one of those areas of study, so keep this in mind. Psychology is an extremely broad field so you'll want to narrow it down for grad school, and a quick google indicates to me that there do exist grad programs that specialize in philosophy of psychology so you should probably look into that area if you can. For now, it doesn't matter what area you get research experience in-- anything is better than nothing, because research experience is one of the first things admissions looks at when you apply for grad school-- but when you're applying to grad school definitely focus on the very specific area of research you want to get into. Again, research is nothing like those labs you do as part of classes so for now just try to get your foot in the door and get a feel for what the experience of doing actual research is like.",
