  "title:": "Should I be worried? (including TL;DR)",
  "text": " I've been staying in a townhouse owned by my university for this semester and I honestly feel like I may have rubbed my roommates the wrong way based off how we communicate with each other. If I meet any of them in public, they will walk by with a cold face. If I meet them in the kitchen or something I'll try to wave or say hi, even though I'm usually a socially anxious person, and they'll nod or give a really short answer if I attempt to start a conversation except for one dude on occasion. Even my classmates, who I meet for significantly less time on most days, speak more to me.\n\nThey were initially a bit more open to me in the beginning but that stopped fast. I moved in at the last minute since it was the only space available and all of the dorms were filled so I don't know if that has to do with anything. Maybe I took a space they wanted for someone else?\n\nAs far as my contributions, it's weird. I wasn't sure how they operated so I used to just buy stuff for myself but I eventually tried to be more interactive so I brought my Keurig machine that my parents had bought me to the kitchen and they seemed to like that along with me buying coffee. I sometimes replace the toilet paper and paper towels but they had tons so I didn't bother.\n\nAs for cleaning, the house is rarely cleaned honestly... One of the guys swept like once or twice and vacuumed once or twice but Idk about the other guys. I volunteered to do stuff but they told me that they were content doing it so I didn't bother. I eat out most of the time since I have a meal plan but I also reuse a bowl and cup I purchased at Walmart. I had my own mug but it has gone missing and I don't feel like asking them about it so I just use one of the mugs in the cabinets.\n\nThe one bathroom I share with another person hasn't been cleaned at all since the beginning of the semester. I'll admit that I am horrible at remembering to routinely complete chores especially with my ADHD but I wouldn't mind creating a schedule or something. I just don't want to make him feel like he needs to do anything since I don't do crap myself.\n\nAnyway, am I overreacting? I suffer from social anxiety but I also know I have a lot of areas to improve in. Would it be worth it to talk to them? I don't actually care if they want to be friends with me or not since I have a solid friend group outside of the house. But I'd be bothered if they didn't like something about be being here but they all just decided to ignore my existence instead of expressing their issue.\n\n**TL;DR:** My roommates barely talk to me and hardly respond when I attempt to socialize with them. Should I be worried?",
