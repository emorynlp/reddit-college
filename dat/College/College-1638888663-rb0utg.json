  "text": "I'm super nervous about sharing this, but I started a YouTube channel aimed at high school and college students, and did a 30 day video challenge in November talking about a lot of my experiences at college. I plan to continue making videos (at a much more reasonable rate) and am looking for more ideas.\n\nI graduated in 2020, I attended two universities including in-state and out-of-state, public and private, I worked several internships, was on a club team, took some gap years, etc. I think I have diverse and helpful experiences to share. Check it out if you have questions about classes, internships, transferring schools, resumes, dorms, meal plans, campus tours, etc.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/channel/UCl0IAvv7PBSViz0k6tpuR1w\n\nLet me know what you wish you could have known/talked to someone about before you went to college. Thanks!\n\nMods: If this counts as too much self-promotiom feel free to take it down but I really do think it will help people.",
