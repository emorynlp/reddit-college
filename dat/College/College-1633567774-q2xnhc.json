      "text": "alright so here's how you boost your confidence. You need to summon motivation with the drive of you will take the time to study, enroll in tutoring, do all the homework, talk to your professor, and anything that ypu can that will me you PASS THAT CLASS. Don't be so down about it, take it as a way to try harder and do better. If ya don't do good on the next exam you, drop it, and look forward to next semester. you can always retake it and do even better than the first. we all fail at one point bro, and it really really sucks. just keep your head up man, keep failure as a stepping stone",

      "text": "Lot's of practice problems and practice tests. Personally I found it helped me feel confident when I'd already been in similar situations and understood the material really well. Simulate the testing environment the best you can. Timed practice tests have also been linked to higher grades in general, so it's a good practice even outside of confidence. (Also don't worry, first calc midterm I got a 50% and the next I got an 86%. It happens to all of us eventually, don't let one bad test drag you down too much)",
