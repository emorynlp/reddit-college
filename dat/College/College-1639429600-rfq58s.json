  "text": "Hello!\n\nI just switched my major to business and technology and I need a math class but I am struggling with which to choose.\n\nI am starting my own online business, and running an online jewelry store (through dropshipping), so I would like to take math that would be helpful and hopefully not too hard. ( I know they are all helpful in some manner to business, but I just want some different opinions). \n\nThe classes I'm deciding between are :\n\n **ACCT 101: Practical Accounting**  \n\n\nAn introduction to the field of accounting that includes completion of an accounting cycle and related bookkeeping for sole proprietorship service and merchandising businesses. \n\n **ACCT 158: Business Mathematics**  \n\n\nThis course covers mathematical applications used in business, such as trade and cash discounts, markups and markdowns, simple interest and simple discount, compound interest, annuities and sinking funds, consumer credit, building wealth through investments, mortgages, and insurance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **ACCT 148: Computer Accounting**  \n\n\nThis course covers fundamental accounting concepts and principles. Students perform the full accounting cycle using computer accounting software (currently QuickBooks) suitable for small business enterprises. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was thinking out of the three already, I should take computer accounting over practical accounting because most things are done through computers anyhow? Computer accounting focuses on QuickBooks and Intuit, and I was thinking that could be a handy skill to learn if I do well with it because I could freelance that skill and help other businesses.",

      "text": "Computer accounting sounds useful, but I wouldn't count on being able to freelance it after a 100 level class.\n\nOn the other hand, I worked for a drop shipping company in the industrial electronics sector and discounting and markup math is one of the most central concepts as a reseller, so getting some actual advice on that may be useful.\n\nTo me it sounds like the question is whether or not you have to do all your own accounting. If so, do Computer accounting, otherwise do the business mathematics.",
