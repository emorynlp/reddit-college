  "text": "Hello, I am a junior and am practicing to go play in college. However, I believe that I can get into a good d3 but I am scared that this might hold me down. I want to go to Yale as a dream school, if I were to get into Yale after I committed to another school, could I drop the school? I am wondering as trainings get more intense if playing in college will hurt me.",

      "text": "As long as you don't sign an NLI its very easy to change schools. When you sign an NLI it gets tricker because the school has to release you from it for you to be able to compete elsewhere. Its been a few years since I was in high school and had to do the same thing so someone correct me if that is wrong. But from what I remember its correct. \n\nI'd definitely suggest that you email the coaches of the schools you want to play at too. They'll know all that information for sure.",
