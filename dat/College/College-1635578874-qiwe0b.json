  "text": "I\u2019ve realized ever since I came to college my energy has been super low. Dining hall is shitty, they give you no protein. So I\u2019ve basically been eating exclusively fast food and junk food and it\u2019s making me feel terrible.\n\nI go to Walmart and stock up on good frozen food every once in a while but I can\u2019t get that much because of how small the freezer is.\n\nWhat do you guys do? I\u2019m about to go eat some Mac and cheese ;(",

      "text": "I don\u2019t live in a dorm but I do have a suggestion. Depending on your budget, you could supplement your horrible dining hall meals by getting carry out from actual dine-in restaurants that serve real food like steak with salad and green beans or grilled chicken with saut\u00e9ed vegetables and a baked potato. Fast food is not your only option for getting already cooked food outside of school.",
