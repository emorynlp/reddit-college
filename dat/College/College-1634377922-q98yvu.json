Yes, a (presumably) high GPA and 1500 with a good essay is probably good enough for you to be at least considered.  But a 1500 alone is not enough. You should also have exceptional extracurricular/community involvement and accomplishments that set you apart from the other applicants.",

What I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s great that you have an extremely high GPA/SAT, but when you apply to ivy league league school you\u2019re competing with a lot of other students who also have really high GPAs/SATs. A higher SAT could be a good thing if you can manage, but you also need to stand out from the other applicants in other ways in order to have a chance :)",
