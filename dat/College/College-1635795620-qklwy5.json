  "text": "Hopefully this makes sense but i\u2019ve been in college 4 years, 3 community college (more like 5 semesters) and 1 in a university. I transferred my credits over from the cc and the university that i\u2019m in now didn\u2019t take 15 of them even though they\u2019re gen ed classes and to top it off i have not declared a major, stupid i know but my gpa was too low to get into the business college inside the university, and when i processed how far along i am i\u2019m only 50% done with the majors im interested in/can do which means i\u2019d have to stay ANOTHER TWO YEARS to get a BA in anything. I feel like i wasted so much time?? i legit feel like dropping out.",

Two years later, you still won't have a degree and nothing to show for these three years\n\nScenario B\nYou stay put, do a major you want to work ahead in. The same two years later, but now you have a degree and these three years signify extra knowledge which may come in handy.\n\nOf course there are other factors specific to your situation, but a comparison of these two scenarios and which one you want for yourself should help you decide.\n\nBest wishes!",

      "text": "In 5 years, the time you feel like you've wasted now won't matter if you get your degree. However if you drop out, there is a higher possibility of feeling like you wasted all these years + even more after you dropped out. I'm not saying you definitely won't be able to achieve anything if you drop out, but you've clearly had a goal in mind for a while and if you give up now, then everything you've planned for is going to be uprooted and you'll have to re-evaluate your future path completely. When you put that option against working hard for another couple of years and getting the degree, it should make your decision easier. Good luck!",
