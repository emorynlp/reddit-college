  "text": "I got my first midterm grade back and it was a 78%. I know that\u2019s not terrible, but I know the midterms will get worse as the course continues. We have 2 that are worth 20% of our grade with the final being 30%. I have also been scoring slightly bad on the problem sets, usually a low B and solid C (they\u2019re 19%). \n\nThis was a class for a minor I wanted to pursue but now I\u2019m nervous I won\u2019t be good enough for this minor. Economics and I don\u2019t get along well and I work hard to understand the content but my brain just never merges well with it. Just need some advice. My next midterm won\u2019t be until the add drop deadline ends, so I\u2019m just nervous to stay in a class I\u2019m doing not too hot in.",
