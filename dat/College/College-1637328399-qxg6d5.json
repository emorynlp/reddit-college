  "text": "In my 5th year of college. I just have absolutely no drive to finish my degree. Currently I\u2019m failing all my classes, and suffering from depression and social anxiety. Tried talking to my parents about it before, but they pushed me back into it and here I am again. Same shit, different semester. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I only have about one more semester worth of classes to get a degree, but I just can\u2019t force myself to put in the effort anymore. I\u2019m just over it, you know? I don\u2019t want to be a disappointment to my parents, but I don\u2019t want to be in school anymore either. It doesn\u2019t help with the fact that neither of them went to college or understand what I\u2019m going through. 2 questions: 1. Should I drop out? Or should I try to tough it out and run the risk of wasting more money if I can\u2019t pull it off? 2. How can I explain this crap in a way that my parents can understand?",

      "text": "If you\u2019re close to finishing your degree, I would say to finish your degree. Mentally I think you\u2019d be in a better place knowing that you\u2019ve graduated, rather than dropping out after 5 years. Talk to your professors, their job is to help you, and if you\u2019re struggling with the material, then even more so. And if you don\u2019t feel comfortable asking the professor for help then I\u2019m sure there are course TAs that you could talk to and get help. Feel free to pm me if you\u2019d like any more advice, but best of luck with whatever your decision may be!",

          "text": "The problem is that I don\u2019t feel like I can talk to anyone for help anymore. I just get too nerved up to the point where I imagine how it\u2019ll go and decide not to even bother because I\u2019m scared that they\u2019ll just turn me down or that I\u2019ll disappoint them by even asking. I\u2019m an emotional wreck and I can\u2019t even talk to my parents because they think I\u2019m faking it and just being lazy. I just feel so worthless. I really think the best thing for my mental health is to get out now. I just can\u2019t force myself to do it anymore",

It might also help with in general figuring out which a kind of pros and cons list\u2026",
