  "text": "Im a freshman starting out this semester and tbh I feel like I don't really know how to study anymore? There's so much less resources for studying than I'm used to and I think I was prepared for that but I don't think I'm used to these lecture classes and I just could really use some tips on how to study in general? It's super vague but tbh any advice is good \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "It depends on your major and your willingness to spend time studying. In general though, for a lot of majors studying consists of paying attention in lectures and doing problem sets, practical assignments, etc\u2026 by yourself in order to understand and be able to apply said concepts. As long as you can manage your time, and get used to studying a few hours per course by yourself a week, then you\u2019ll probably be fine. Also, I don\u2019t believe for a second that there aren\u2019t enough resources for you to study. There are an unfathomable amount of resources online (specially for 100 and 200 level classes, which you\u2019ll be taking as a freshman), it just takes time to find the right ones.",
