BUT, there have been many times where they forget and are harder to work with. \n\nI would appreciate it if you shared your experiences! Thanks!",

      "text": "I have had great experiences so far with using accommodations. Sometimes they are kinda hard to honor, like extended due dates, but my professors always seem to work with me. Especially because I have a case manager that helps with talking to them and making sure that they actually follow it. Reaching out to them and sometimes reminding my profs is needed just to make sure that they remember them though.",
