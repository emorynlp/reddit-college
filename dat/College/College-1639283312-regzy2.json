  "text": "I'm a freshman starting second semester next spring. I originally came to this state school because after applying to all of the art schools, I decided to pursue a career as a nurse or a physician assistant. I needed to attend community college or any in state university in order to take the equivalent classes and eventually transfer to my dream universities ( UW, UIUC, USC Davis, OSU etc) Because all of the community colleges were too far away from my home, I decided to enroll at UofSC and transfer after my sophomore year. I'm now a Biological Science major, and I accidentally took Biology courses (created only for nursing students) that are not equivalent other schools. It's also not guaranteed to get accepted into the nursing school here ofcourse, but it's easier than other schools, and that's why I can't really decide whether I should leave and transfer to another school. If I transfer to one of the schools I mentioned, I won't be able to major in nursing but something like biology or anything else and take the pre req to apply to pa schools. And if I fail to get accepted to the pa schools I won't get the job security that bsn gives and don't have more doors open to other specialties. I wonder if there are prestigious schools that has high acceptance for transfer nursing students, but I never seen one (gotta research more on that) My parents cares about the prestige of the school that I attend and I also need the prestigious in case I go back to South Korea and get a job (hate how they take prestige as a huge factor but that's just how it is)",
