  "text": "I\u2019m 24. Started school in 2015. Took a couple of semesters off, changed my major a couple times. I finally graduate this semester with a CIS degree, and plan to go into Cybersecurity. \n\nAll throughout college, I had to work. Pretty much full-time. I made friends, but all of those friendships faded into oblivion once I transferred schools. No big deal there.\n\nThis semester, I decided it would be cool to join a business fraternity. I have lots of free time now, and I\u2019d like to make an impact on my college career and have one last chance to make college friends. \n\nOnly thing is, I\u2019m starting to feel like this process has become far too demanding. Times are sporadic. Pledges are expected to call off of work and class to come to a mandatory meeting that was announced hours prior. Studying for the business frat + other classes has been tough. \n\nOverall? I\u2019m just wondering if this is all worth it. What are the benefits of joining a collegiate fraternity if I\u2019m graduating the same semester. It feels like I\u2019m putting in far too much work and time for something that I won\u2019t have time to enjoy because I\u2019d be gone.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just seeking advice on whether or not this is something worth sticking with.",

      "text": "Honestly, my go to advice is if you're doing something for enjoyment that causes you not stress/duress than actual happiness, it's not worth it to keep pursuing it. \nIt seems simple, but it's something I've noticed a lot of people don't take the time to figure out for the themselves. In the end it's a personal judgment call you have to make",
