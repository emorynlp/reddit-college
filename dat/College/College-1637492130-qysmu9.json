I usually cry when I feel overwhelmed with my schoolwork, it just helps me calm down and reevaluate everything. Everyone has different methods on how they cope with stress (drinking, taking a hike, cleaning, etc.) Its important to have a good support system too. I live with my fianc\u00e9 now and whenever I\u2019m stressed, he\u2019ll comfort me and talk to me about my problems. It really helps to have someone/something to get you through whatever you are facing.",

Plus it\u2019s likely your roommates hate you and you\u2019re living in such a tiny dorm with so many people that you never have privacy so you just bottle up everything until you explode. \n\nI\u2019m honestly glad OP is smart enough to ask this. My first semester my roommate had study buddies over literally every day of the week until midnight so I ended up crying in the dark corner of my dorm building next to my dorm. It wasn\u2019t private at all, hell even the neighbors and the RA said hi to me walking by when I just wanted to be left alone to cry with my head on my knees. Then when it got too cold I stumbled back into the dorm, they all got a good look at how much of a mess I was and I was embarrassed, and I continued to cry as quietly as possible into a pillow because they literally never leave.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t great. It just made me more stressed and embarrassed because I had to be extra careful to not be seen, but I always was anyways. And that just led to more breakdowns, especially when people decided my crying was their business and they just *had* to know why I was upset",

Get drunk enough to not care if people see you cry. Oooh! A classroom after school hours. They're pretty secluded at night. These are just some of the places I've cried. Hopefully you find something that works for you because I know a good cry can help you feel better.",

Living in a student house with 13 others I would then walk to my room because I feel more save there and also do not like other people around at such a moment. \n\nBut mostly, I do not really cry.

Instead, they are meant to horber all feelings and push them to the side. Guys are provider's and if they don't provide they are consider a loser. Do you see where my statement is going? Mental illness is a serious thing. Statically, man are 3 times more higher to commit suicide than woman's. Their is this stereotype of what a man is and should do. They are suppose to hold doors for woman. As well as be a gentleman. We are told to call women \"ma'am\" as a ploit gesture. Now a days, if a guy calls a woman \"ma'am\"  it' is consider rude. In short, everyone has their breaking point. It is completely natural to cry. It is a sign that you have feelings and are being overwhelmed. If you can't confine in another being. You can always count on yourself too help yourself through the toughest of times. Always remember, NEVER LOSE YOURSELF IN THIS WORLD!\n\nP.S\nI cry at times in my car with the music on lol",
