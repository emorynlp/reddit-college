  "text": "i\u2019m supposed to graduate at the end of this semester but i\u2019ve reached a point of zero motivation today. i keep skipping classes and it\u2019s hard to get through the week with 4 classes, an internship, meetings, commuting to campus which is almost 2 hrs away, still paying for tuition so now i\u2019m basically broke and have to start working again too. and i have to move out in the beginning of next year too. \n\ni\u2019m just tired of everything and it\u2019s about to be midterms. i don\u2019t know how to tell my professors anymore that i am mentally just declining. i know it\u2019s almost over but i\u2019m just so tired. today i\u2019m skipping my class to take a nap. i feel bad but i am also unprepared for class and i can barely keep my eyes open.\n\nidk how to get through this. how are you all doing?",

Because my stubborn ass wouldn\u2019t do it and at the end of the day, it\u2019d just be counterproductive by trying to stay awake versus paying attention.\n\nGive yourself some slack and be kind to yourself, best of luck! You deserve all the rest you need no matter how \u201cexcessive\u201d it might seem.",
