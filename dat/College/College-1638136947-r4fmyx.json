  "text": "why do most colleges put a lot of emphasis on STEM. It has always seemed like a hoax to me. You're being manipulated by the elites to spend money that you don't have to get a bullshit degree you won't need only if you have the money to succeed. I don't mean to be pessimistic, but realistically it is a system made only to be broken. Honestly, what is the purpose of having a paper that says good job you're done. It is a self-fulfillment practice that comes at a high cost. It makes a generation of people that are cocky towards basic human concepts that are relevant to the simple fact of living, and survival. I pass a course for the sole purpose of passing. What is the passion behind nothing? It is almost as if students become infatuated with idols that they aspire to be, but those idols could care less.",

In 50-100 it could be still be STEM or it could be something completely different they're pushing.  \n\nI think the main thing to think of when choosing a major is what one would be happy doing for the rest of their lives and not what's currently popular and being pushed by others.",

Many people fall into a trap of thinking society is conspiring against them, and believing they will never succeed.  Consequently, they have a long list of excuses for their failures.  Get out of that mindset before it becomes totally ingrained in you.",

I don\u2019t ask for pity. I ask for understanding. I am not a traditional student whose way got paid off by mom and dad. My mom suffered and died of cancer when I was 10, and I grew up poor. Not to put any emphasis on that but along the way people have told me I wouldn\u2019t succeed, and I did but I didn\u2019t have the need to brag about anything. I am fighting against substance abuse and raising a child. It is great to make money of a great degree, but is it really all in life?",

People that know me can not tell that I\u2019ve battled addiction, but it\u2019s people that claim to be better than others that make the world much more depressing. The only reason I expressed this in a forum was to see if students were as heartless as assumed to be. I\u2019m not trying to conquer the world, or go to mars. I am a person that thinks  that a degree is not everything but is definitely a money maker. I help a lot of people because it hurts to see so much suffering in the world. I wish I could get in depth into my mental state , but it\u2019s unnecessary when this just made it clear that people are only concerned about their own business. Students don\u2019t want to have children, but complain about how crap their life is in sarcastic ways. Expect salary paying jobs with a 7.25/hr. work ethic. All them kombucha drinking selfish people. Give an indigenous kid the opportunity of free education, and trust me they won\u2019t complain about how the didn\u2019t sleep because they were studying for an exam. Petty stuff that students take for granted.",

You see yourself as more deserving than others, and are willing to trivialize their battles because they are different from yours. You use literally use your child as an example of you doing something positive, when having a child in itself isn't virtuous. \n\nYou lack perspective on this world. There are plenty of people who go to college just to learn. My father goes to college at 50, and my stepmom at 70. Young people like me want to college for economic security. \n\nBut tell yourself everyone who is education themselves to ensure they have e a right future is really just evil. Meanwhile, from my point of view, every battle you're proud of, was a self made issue. You're on the wrong sub for philosophy, and I don't it's intelligent to generalize all college students based replies you got from the internet.\n\n\nAnd then I look at your profile, and you say you did college for years, then dropped out. Had a kid, been on drugs. Which lead to depression. But you think school is for selfish people, and causes more problems than. I solves.\n\n\nI think your lack of education is leading to you not being able to think critically. People want to protect themselves, and they do that by educating themselves, acquiring skills, and working for companies. Regardless of whether you go to college, you'll be benefitting evil corporations or be homeless.",
