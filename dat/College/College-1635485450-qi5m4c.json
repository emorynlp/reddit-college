  "text": "I\u2019m starting college soon and I\u2019m trying to find something to keep my stuff dry when it rains heavily. I can\u2019t find any waterproof backpacks so I figured next best thing is to get a cheap backpack and get a waterproof bag to put stuff in too. Kinda like a ziplock bag but big enough for textbooks,\nnotebooks and a 12.9 inch ipad. Multiple bags are fine.",

I dont know how big/small you want so there's an aspect of you needing a tape measure to get an idea of whats perfect for your use (if you're buying online and cant hold it before you buy it), but i have the jumbo XL size (of whatever brand i chose) and those are like 3 ft x 5 ft. I would be surprised if the ones marketed as small size aren't exactly what you are looking for.",

They\u2019re pricey, but good quality and water resistant (which I\u2019d say is fine enough, as getting a whole dry bag made for kayaking is a bit much)",

      "text": "Truly waterproof backpacks are ugly and not very functional.  \n\n[example](https://www.amazon.com/MARCHWAY-Floating-Waterproof-Backpack-Kayaking/dp/B01N22NA4A/)  \n\nBefore you say *\"I've seen lots that were more attractive/functional than that...\"* I need to point out the difference between a `waterproof` bag and a `water-resistant` one.  \n\nNorth Face, Swiss Gear, Patagonia, LL Bean, Jansport and everyone else all make really nice **water-resistant** backpacks.  \n\nRather than try to make a truly waterproof pack work, I think you might want to invest in a decent water-resistant one, and then reinforce it.  \n\n[Waterproofing Spray](https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-Camp-Heavy-Water-Repellant/dp/B01KZLKN78/)  \n\nYou can find that spray-on product at Walmart and various camping stores.  \n\nIf you buy a decent backpack in the $50 ballpark and then apply two or three coats of that spray all over the sucker (which would empty the whole can) you should be good to go for at least 2 years, when you can hit it again with another $7 can of waterproofer.  \n\nCaution:  That spray **will** slightly darken the colors of whatever you spray it on, and you **absolutely** will want to spray it outdoors.  \n\nNow, if you are concerned about a 20 minute walk home in a torrential downpour and cannot tolerate risk to your laptop & textbooks then consider these two options:  \n\n\n[waterproof backpack cover](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Lin-Waterproof-Adjustable-Traveling/dp/B07M8KCTRV/)  \n\nPull that sucker out from the bottom of your back, cover your pack, and trudge your way home through the storm.  \nYou can also hit it with the same waterproofing spray if you want.  \n\nFinal suggestion:  \n\n\n[waterproof extra-large poncho](https://www.amazon.com/longsinger-Waterproof-Lightweight-Adjustable-Multifunctional/dp/B08QFT54ZM/)  \n\nNot all rain ponchos are large enough to cover a backpack well.  \nIf you have to walk home in a downpour, keeping yourself dry at the same time as your backpack is a nice creature-comfort.",
