  "text": "I am a sophomore at a community college getting my associates degree in precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is type of ag production that uses data collection/utilization and different systems and tools (such as auto steer, automatic shut offs different   computers and sensors) to help control variables in farming. I don\u2019t have a huge background and ag but after working in construction and being frankly bored by the idea of auto mechanics. I found this field my senior year in highschool and started a low level position collecting soil samples and fell in love with the technology, map development and reading and the outdoor work. I developed passion for agriculture and the equipment and technology surrounding it. While it\u2019s always been my dream to be able to have my own small operation to keep me occupied and make some money in addition to a day job I thought a career in precision ag would make that possible. However now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll even be able to graduate. My first semester of college I tried to work around 20 hours a week but after horrendous grades I quickly discovered I need to devote more time to school and took a leave of absence from my job. Second semester was much better academically. This was partially because of time off from work but also because of more classes doing hands on work similar to me job. But I was in poor shape mental health wise I noticed I was drinking a lot, friends noticed me distancing myself and I felt useless not having a job. I was so ready to be out of school and back to work I left without doing vital paperwork for an internship which will most likely delay my graduation and put me on academic probation. Now I am in my third semester and I can barely function with out drinking excessively. I am struggling to find motivation for anyone or anything. I don\u2019t want to leave the field I\u2019m passionate about but with out a degree I have advanced as far as I can in this field. Is it time to throw in the towel and find something else? Should I push through and ignore my mental health to graduate late? Any advice is appreciated.",
