  "text": "Visual learners:\n\n* I'm watching lecture videos and listening to them is not my strength. Let alone a lecture in person. Do you have any tips? I am using flashcards and it's the least I could do, but still overwhelming.\n* For subjects that are very wordy and limited from applying charts/diagrams/drawing, how do you make studying work for you? I'm doing Information Tech.\n* I've read many times that the key is to understand. However, how do visual learners bridge towards understanding when many of the materials life throws at us are not visual-friendly? Lecturer speaking, texts...Do you have any tips?",

      "text": "at a certain point, there is no substitute for the written word. perhaps you have reached that point.\n\ni mean, what's your endgame? what are you going to do when there are no charts/diagrams/drawings for whatever you need to study? or when you're on the job and have to learn something (and you will, because technology changes and you will have to keep up)? if you're going to be limited by the extent of charts/diagrams/drawings, you are probably going to fail the major and have a hard time picking up new technologies.\n\nit is your prerogative to choose how you want to learn, but I am telling you that the majority of information everywhere is written in language, not pictures, and if you want to be successful, you have to deal with it.",

      "text": "I write everything down and use different colored pens and highlighters to organize the notes, so it doesn't look like just a bunch of blocks of writing. I need visuals to keep my interests, especially when just watching lectures and taking notes 'cos that can be quite boring. Sometimes I challenge myself to see how much I can fit neatly on one page to jazz things up, like when making a study guide for myself. All of this helps to satisfy a creative outlet when I don't have time to carve out for creative activities 'cos class work, studying, and working, etc, which I need 'cos helps to keep my stress levels down.",

I don't care if I eff up a whole day 'cos I had to write everything down and sometimes watch YouTube or internet search to re-learn topics I just learned, so I can comprehend the information beyond just good enough. I have a short attention span and need to be doing something to pay attention better. I did it all through hs and currently am a junior in college. These classes are too expensive and my future is riding on this. My hand gets hella sore, but winter & summer breaks let me rest. It's just for a few years for something that will beneficially impact my life forever.",

      "text": "One thing I might do is for certain canned problems, arrange my work in a certain way where steps are on the same part of the page, so I can associate a certain step with its relative position to other things and it\u2019s relation to other steps as well. Also reteaching myself by re-arranging the material in a more understandable/visually pleasing way to prompt understanding. For example speed = distance/time? I always draw that fucking triangle with d = st. Every time. I think visual learning is very good because it forces you to make connections which tend to stick a very long time. My two cents, hope it helps!",
