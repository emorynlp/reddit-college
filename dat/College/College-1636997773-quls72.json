  "text": "He\u2019s had this constant coughing fit for like 3 weeks. He stays up late and the constant coughing keeps me up all night long. He\u2019s constantly blowing his nose. At some point I\u2019m gonna have to ask if he\u2019s even taking any medication, like anything. Take some fucking cough drops or something man. \n\nI\u2019d think he wouldn\u2019t want to be coughing 24/7 and that he would take some medicine. It should annoy him just as much as me. \n\nThe coughing fit started 3 weeks ago but he\u2019s been sick in some way basically the whole semester. I\u2019m not sure how I haven\u2019t gotten sick yet.",

If it\u2019s already been 3 weeks, it\u2019s likely that he would test negative now but the symptoms sound similar to those I know who have gotten breakthrough cases.  Regardless, he should call campus health and/or get this checked out in case it is something else or potentially worse.",

With the seasonal colds going round, it\u2019s possible anyone could catch it. Plus, for those of us with bad lungs, they might last longer than expected, even with meds. Just be a good roommate to him, pass him some hot water and ginger lemonade when he needs it. Anyone can get sick.",

      "text": "Honestly after 2 weeks he should visit a doctor. It's easy to go from cold to pneumonia if he's not getting better. \n\nIt's not your job, but it might be nice to ask if you can pick him up some cough suppressant for night time (Nyqill probably, also Robitussin and Vicks) since I doubt he wants to go outside rn. Expectorants would probably be good too, they thin out the mucus making coughing less painful. That would be Mucinex and some Robitussin variations.\n\nYou can offer to pay if you want, but even hey man you sound like shit can I walk to the store for you would be sweet.",
