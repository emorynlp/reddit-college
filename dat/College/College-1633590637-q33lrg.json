      "text": "I suppose you could look for a job in government or for an international NGO, but I suspect your job options related to your degree will be pretty limited, and it's more likely you'd end up working in an unrelated or only semi-related job. If you decide to pursue this major, I highly recommend you pursue internships while in college to build up your resume, and also consider double majoring in something more in-demand.",
