  "text": "hi. it\u2019s my first semester and i\u2019m failing a general studies class. i\u2019m taking 15 credits this semester and i have all As except for that one class. i\u2019m currently struggling with a chronic illness and constant fatigue and that class was just too emotionally and physically draining plus the prof was living his mean girl phantasy. awful. \n\ni can choose the pass/fail option so it doesn\u2019t affect my gpa, but a fail is still a fail. i\u2019m just very overwhelmed and sad because i feel like im gonna be so behind while everyone else\u2019s moving on. it\u2019s kind of hard to see ur friends handling everything so well and ur just stuck since the very start. does it really matter to retake a class? and does the no pass look that bad on my transcript if i\u2019m not planning on applying to graduate school?",

      "text": "Typically if you fail a class you have the option of retaking said class, and replacing the grade in your GPA calculation. Just look up your school\u2019s academic forgiveness policy. After looking into my own school\u2019s policy about failing classes, it\u2019s honestly not as bad as it seems. Also, if you\u2019re not applying to grad school, it barely matters at all. Jobs and Internships only care about your GPA, if that. Really you just end up wasting some time and money.",
