  "text": "So I'm in a bit of a conundrum here and would appreciate some advice on how to handle this and what I can do to alleviate this situation.\n\nI am a grad student at university, taking an online combined section course (with both undergrads and grad students). Its a junior/senior upper-level lecture course btw.\n\nAnyway, I want to preface this that I have taken this professor before in undergrad, and respect them a lot. They are fairly considerate, very open to questions and concerns, as well as very flexible (they provide extensions to those that need them). This professor also just came back after taking off a year from university, so now they have to adjust to teaching online class--which is understandable because lots of people have had to do it.\n\nThis all started when one student in particular (lets call them \"A\") made a chat for everyone in the class to join, to ask questions or discuss course material.\n\nWhich was fine by me, I decided to join because, well why not. This was at the start of the semester, and the only time I engaged was when one classmate asked when an assignment would be up, and I responded in turn.\n\nI left the chat for about three weeks, decided to check in, and saw the shit-talking that ensued while I was offline. The student \"A\" had started complaining that the professor wasn't teaching clearly enough, that they didn't understand the questions asked during lectures and said they were too \"vague.\" They also got angry about some mistakes the professor made with the schedules as well as some assignment due dates (which were all resolved--the professor sent out frequent email updates as well as extended due dates).\n\nWhich, I understand because I was also in that situation before. However, I didn't go to my friends or my classmates and complain and whine about it to them, even as an undergrad. I just sent emails out to the professor about it, and spoke privately about it with them.\n\nSo that's where the issue lies. As soon as \"A\" began talking smack about the class, the professor's teaching, etc other students (mostly undergrads--there's only 3 of us grad students in the course) all piled on, complaining, whining, making off-topic statements like \"this class is stupid\".\n\n\"A\" also tends to take screenshots of their conversations with the professor and puts them in the chat, followed up by an offhand comment about how the professor perhaps \"shouldn't be teaching online classes\".\n\nThe only reason why I am asking now what I should do about this is because I left the chat again (I took screenshots and saved all the messages on a word document) and I logged in today to find that \"A\" is on the rampage again, saying they will send letters to the dean with complaints about the professor, that they cannot teach the course properly, that they don't communicate well (which is bullshit because the professor is doing one on one meetings for the next few weeks) and that apparently the professor makes too many mistakes with the schedule.\n\nAnd there are about 2-3 students (who I have noticed are the only ones that engage in the chat) who are backing \"A\" up, saying \"I hate this class\" or \"I hate (the professor)\" as well as using profanity-laden statements about the course, the professor, among other things that have nothing to do with the class material.\n\nAt this point I've realized I have come across a Karen student, who is taking really small things out of proportion, because like I said, even as an undergrad if I had complaints I went to the professor--which 99% of the time resolved things. Also, this is an online course, where lectures are recorded, and students can use notes and the readings to take quizzes, etc. And they are complaining that the professor's lectures don't coincide with the questions in the quizzes, which, if they actually do the readings they will find that most (if not all) the answers are in the readings. The lectures are for discussion over the texts as well as the specific topic for the week.\n\nI noticed in chat one of the other grad students (let's call them \"B\") has tried to talk to them, reassuring them that no, the professor is not there to set you up for failure, to ask questions to the professor if they don't understand, etc. But at this point its escalated to where this one student is apparently so angered by the professor that they just want to complain to the dean than actually discuss these issues with the professor (DESPITE the professor talking about this in lecture today, they told students  if they have questions to contact them, to use class time to discuss things, etc). And this student, \"A\" has now formed a small clique where several of the other students just agree with them.\n\nAgain, I originally joined this chat thinking it was going to be basic advice, q&a discussions about the class material, helping with notes, etc. Not a huge gossip-fest about the professor and how hard the class is (which could be improved if students followed the class schedule and did their readings--even skimming them would help them).\n\nI am very tired of this nonsense, and it feels like kids who haven't grown out of high school. To be fair, yes they're in undergrad so there's still room to learn, but that shouldn't matter. I've met undergrad students who are far more mature than this. I can understand if someone is having trouble with the class because of a medical condition, or they have to take care of family at home, even if they have an intense job or something. At the same time, you can handle these things privately and talk to the professor about it---I've taken this professor before and they are flexible especially now that we're in a pandemic.\n\nAt this point I don't know what I should do. Should I just leave the chat for good and just not engage? Should I tell them that maybe they're being too harsh and to remember the professor is a human being too? Should I give them advice on how to take notes, improve their study-habits? Should I ask a fellow grad student for advice? Should I report this to the professor, so that they are aware what \"A\" is saying and what other students are saying about them?\n\nI think the professor is aware the students are saying these things--they've mentioned it in one or two lectures that students have come to them with problems--but the professor is actively trying to fix it and sends out weekly emails (sometimes more than once) regarding due dates, meeting times, even scheduling one on one meetings like I mentioned above.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice on how to handle this. I just--maybe I'm biased because I had this professor before, but I can't stand to see when students complain and whine about things that they can very well solve on their own and discuss individually with the professor about. I would think that in an upper level, junior/senior level course in university students would know by now to do these things.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso going to add that \"A\" put the Groupme invite link in the Teams course chat. Which, really isn't a smart move on their part.",

      "text": "My two cents is to leave the chat and forget it, or at least ignore it. I had a similar situation last semester (admittedly all freshman and sophomore undergrads) and I just conclude that little mistakes on the professor's part are always going to make some students mad, and they're going to commiserate with people who can relate, i.e. their classmates. It's not your job to make them enjoy the class or appreciate the teacher. You almost certainly wouldn't be able to anyway. Also, I expect most threats of reporting things to the department head or the dean are empty, because not only would that require effort on the students' part, but in their hearts they probably know that their complaints aren't severe enough to warrant any sort of action. I would just let them vent and steer clear.",

      "text": "I'm not sure if I\u2019d call you a Karen, but this is kinda the norm at my school so I\u2019m surprised you'd think to involve yourself at all. Professors are constantly dealing with disgruntled students. I mean go look at rate my professor. If you are worried the professor could receive backlash, go to the dean and defend them. Tbh, I always vent to my friends about difficult classes/professors cause they're really the only people I can talk to about my problems. I'd like to think I'm at least reasonable with my complaints though. I've certainly had professors that we're great human beings, but terrible at their job. I've also had professors that we're horrible human beings, but great at their job. And there are people at my school who would either agree or disagree with my opinions of them. People understand/learn things differently and may not see this professor as you do. It's not your job to dictate how they feel or what they say to their friends. All you can do is try and help them if you are inclined to. I'm about to graduate and have been helping a lot of the freshman at my school. They CONSTANTLY complain (some for good reason). But rather than invalidating their thoughts/feelings, I try and give them advice and push them in the direction I went/should\u2019ve went. So imo, help them or leave.",

What they\u2019re saying/ranting about may be dumb but it ultimately has no legitimate impact on you, the professor or anyone else. \n\nReporting what \u2018A\u2019 said to the professor is just unnecessary imo. IThen again, I personally refrain from ever complaining about someone/something in a  group chat because I know there\u2019s always a possibility that someone like you will screenshot conversations and report them to the TA/professor. \n\nUnless they\u2019re actively harassing the professor, just let them rant in a private group chat. No need to gatekeep what can and cannot be said there. \n\n\nI\u2019d just leave the chat as it\u2019s clearly of no benefit to you and just adds stress.",

If it helps, stay out of the chat (I mute mine when it makes me too crazy).

They are not the first to complain and certainly won't be the last.\n\n2.) However, if you want to say something to the whiny students you absolutely can. There is nothing wrong with telling them that their complaints are meritless and that they might not be cut out for the major.\n\nThis is not going to win you many friends but the struggling students aren't going to be future colleagues anyway.",
