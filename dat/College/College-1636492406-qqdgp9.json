  "text": "So, I know this is probably a stupid question and the answer is most likely no, but I\u2019m asking just incase. The reason why is because I found 3 amazing roommates who were looking for one more person to sign a lease for a bed space in their apartment. They still hadn\u2019t found someone so I didn\u2019t worry about it being sold out. Well, literally a few hours before I was going to apply, it ended up being sold out. I messaged them and they had no idea. They really wanted to me to be their 4th roommate and so we were pretty bummed. However, I do want to try to find the person who did sign the lease and maybe try to ask and convince them to let me take over especially since they have no idea who the roommates are while I do. I honestly never knew that people could sign a lease for a bed space in someone\u2019s apartment without the roommates even knowing.. like what lol?! But apparently the off campus apartment leases on a first come first serve basis so that\u2019s probably the reason why.",
