  "text": "I\u2019m currently an Economics major. I have to take some other business next semester like accounting and business statistics. Right now I\u2019m in business calculus and a Microsoft excel. I think economics is cool (or maybe I don\u2019t) but I definitely don\u2019t care for the business classes I have to take. They aren\u2019t challenging to me; I just feel\u2026 indifferent. My original plan was to graduate in Econ and either go to law school or get my masters. Now that I\u2019ve actually had a taste of this, I don\u2019t want to do this for the rest of my life. I mean, I just don\u2019t like business stuff that much. \n\nI\u2019d rather do something that feels like *im actually doing something*. I\u2019ve been thinking about switching to natural resources and ecology management with a concentration in forestry. I LOVE nature, and I feel a personal connection to it as my grandpa was a forester. \n\nI\u2019m just worried about the pay. Money is such an important thing, and I know I would have more/better job opportunities with an economics degree. But is it better to do something that pays less but makes me happier? \n\nThe only other thing I\u2019d have to worry about is that business majors at my school are known for having a pretty easy workload, and if I switched to natural resources it would be a lot harder and more time consuming. I\u2019d have to take a lot of biology and chemistry classes, and my high school classes kinda sucked so idk how I feel about them:/\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so long and rambling, it\u2019s just caused me so much stress the past couple weeks. Side note, I should probably start going to therapy haha",

      "text": "It\u2019s a tough call and financial consideration is so important that I can empathize with your struggle. If you don\u2019t HATE the major, could you imagine your degree getting you in the door of forestry or environmental/sustainability type companies?  That could allow you to get in the door and then work towards actual assignments that would allow you to get more hands on work?  You could do work in the Econ field for the $ and then have sustainability/forestry work be a hobby?",
