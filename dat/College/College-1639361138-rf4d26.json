  "text": "I have been living with my current roommate in a college dorm since September. We have mostly gotten along really well up until now, and I am upset over this situation and need some perspective.\n\nSome necessary context. She is very cluttered and has A LOT of stuff. Her side of the room always has piles of clothing and other items everywhere. It was pretty serious for a while until her parents came and brought some stuff home, and for a time I did consider moving out.\n\nThe current issue is when it comes to shared spaces. Basically, she asked to put a shelf on my side of the counter, which is smaller, so more of her stuff could go there. Her monopolizing space has been a problem and I\u2019ve said no. The third time I said no five days ago and suddenly she started treating me very differently.\n\nUsually she is a talkative, bubbly person who always wants to hang out and is always in our room. She started pretending to be asleep in the morning and only came back late at night to avoid me. The way she talked to me became short and tense. It escalated pretty quickly to her avoiding me in public on campus while also purposefully making it obvious to me by walking right past me.\n\nToday I confronted her and asked if something was wrong. She said that she had been really mad because I had turned our overheard light off early one night five days ago. We have always done this so I was confused and asked her if that was it, and she said she was also upset that I said no to her shelf. I called her out for treating me poorly over a shelf and light. She seemed embarrassed and said she was sorry, and a few minutes later was curled up on the floor crying.\n\nHere is where I\u2019m conflicted. There have been other issues throughout the quarter that I\u2019ve talked to her about, mainly cleanliness, and I feel like this is the boiling point. I feel like living with her going forward, I\u2019m always going to be concerned that something little is going to result in retaliation.\n\nBut on the other hand, living with her has been really convenient. Obviously it\u2019s cheaper, and I am not able to get a car right now so I get rides from her when she is going to the same place I need to go (which I give her gas money for). And most of the time, we get along really well.\n\nAny ideas where I should go from here?",
