  "text": "My parents never went to college, so they don\u2019t understand the things that I\u2019m going through. I was doing fine until COVID hit, then things have just been downhill from there. I couldn\u2019t understand the material anymore. I told my parents that I wanted to take a gap year until it went back to in person classes. They convinced me that I just needed to stick with it. Ultimately it was my decision and I don\u2019t hold it against them, but now I\u2019ve just become more and more depressed. I failed basically all of last semester. This semester we went back to in person classes, but depression just set right back in and I just feel like I can\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019m about to basically fail this semester too. I have no more drive left to finish out my degree, even when I\u2019m so close (about 1-2 semesters worth of classes more). I just want to be out of college. I get the fact that it\u2019s like \u201chow can you quit when the finish line is right there?\u201d At the same time, like I said, I just don\u2019t have the will to do it. My parents just can\u2019t understand that and basically think my depression doesn\u2019t exist. I can already hear it now. \u201cSo you\u2019re just gonna waste all this money and not even get anything out of it? Don\u2019t come crying to me when you\u2019re stuck working at McDonald\u2019s and can\u2019t pay your loans back.\u201d Sorry for rambling. Back to the original point. How do I explain this to my parents in a way that they can understand my reasoning when all they do is bitch at me when something I want isn\u2019t the goal they had in mind for me? I love my parents, but they\u2019re just so hard to talk to, and 90% of our conversations now just end up in fights.",

      "text": "Absolutely sympathize with your situation. Depression is no joke. Despite that, I would caution you to not make a long-term decision with a short-term mindset. Go and talk with your university\u2019s mental health services and see if they can help. \n\nHaving a bachelors degree, any bachelors degree, greatly increases job prospects. It\u2019s likely your depression will stay if you drop out with the continued financial stress of a sub-par job (especially with inflation and rising rent). With a decent job you\u2019d be able to live well and pursue the things you like in your free time. With only 1-2 semesters left just put your head down and crank it out (just pass the classes, no need to do amazingly well). The world is better with you in it and educated. Sending good vibes. Best of luck.",

      "text": "Talk with an advisor or resource center on campus. They may know of some options for such as taking a semester off, doing a semester of community College (if you still have a couple lower division courses), and/or mental health help.\n\nYou say that you failed a semester in the past and may fail again. What is your GPA? Are you on the list for academic probation or is there a possibility that you may be academically dismissed? If so you may want to withdraw now to save that from being on your transcript. This can be a tangable reason to explain to your parents you need time off. Dripping out and being able to explain why looks better than being forced out due to low grades (imo). \n\nThe convo could go something like this:\n\"Due to the pandemic and my own mental health I am not making the grades I need to stay in school. In order to have the option the continue my degree in the future' I need to withdraw now and take a break. This will allow me to be readmitted in the future and not be academicly dismissed. This is the best and may be my only option forward.\"",

      "text": "Going to play the devil's advocate for a moment. I'm a 20 year old who decided not to go to college and am doing fine. I also know many people who regret going to college when they obviously didn't want to go to begin with. My brother ended up going to the military because he got nowhere with his degree. A cousin eventually went to the trades because it paid more. I also knew a person with a masters degree working in retail, this is unfair for everyone involved. We honestly need a revamp of everything in this country \n\nThat being said, I will agree with the other posters to just toughen it out but also keep check of your mental health. You're almost done so you may as well be in debt with a degree than without. I just hate the \"if you don't go to college you'll be poor\" mindset since it's absolute bullshit, but if you're getting an education you may as well finish it. If you do somehow end up dropping out you better have a plan since without one dropping out would seem like the most stupid thing you would have done.",

      "text": "Your situation sounds difficult, but please don\u2019t drop out of college. You\u2019ll probably regret it for the rest of your life if you do. Like other people said, try to utilize any mental health resources on campus. If you quit school, it probably won\u2019t help your lack of motivation. Also, I\u2019m sorry that your parents aren\u2019t understanding. I agree with them in that you should continue school, but I don\u2019t agree with how they talk to you.",
