  "text": "I wish to get a private loan, since that seems to be one of my best options at affording housing at the time, since I am really wanting space from my family. However, the only private loan available requires a cosigner. The only people in my life that can cosign this with me are my parents, and they wouldn't do that. I am open to suggestions. Please help.",
