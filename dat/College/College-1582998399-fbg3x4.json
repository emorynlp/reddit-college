  "text": "I made a post about this earlier, but I wasn\u2019t clear enough. So the three of us had to turn in two parts of the video, a research part, showing our research and the second part being the actual video. I did my fair share with research, and during the day it was due, we discussed. During the discussion, I asked \u201cwhat can I do for the video?\u201d Because to my knowledge, we\u2019ve only done research. One guy said \u201cI\u2019m almost done with it already, I\u2019ll send it to you guys to review and turn it in at 7:00pm\u201d he never sent me the video to review, so i texted the other guy who is also waiting for it to review, because he promised to make a groupchat but didn\u2019t so he is the only one I can text directly about the group, and he never responded. I was able to see it on the class playlist, and there it was, the name of the two other guys, and a third guy that wasn\u2019t even in our group to my knowledge, so again, I text other guy who also didn\u2019t help build the video, but still had his name in the video, because he was good friends with the guy who did the video. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything I can do, on my first post, I was told to take the L, because to be fair, I could have been more proactive which makes sense, but any other advice is welcome.\n\nEdit: he finally responded!!! The third guy that I didn\u2019t know who it was, was me, he just got my name wrong!!!",

That's what I did in a similar situation, the professor realized that I wasn't lieing and the rest of my group were actual assholes. So they had to make it again in two days since he recognized me as the author of the work, and they didn't want to be in the same group as me.\n\nThe laws about authority are probably different since they are very strict in Spain and it might be best to talk with your professor about it but this is the best solution I could think of and karma even made its move. It was kinda funny actually.",
