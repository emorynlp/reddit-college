  "text": "So my first go at college I didn\u2019t do very well, made a 2.0 my first semester and dropped out the second. I went back this fall and my classes are really easy and I have no trouble passing them. The only problem is, i have bad anxiety about school and I want to be able to do my work without worrying about due dates and just get the work done and I want to increase my workload. Should I go from 2 classes to 4 classes or just do my next semester normally which is 3 classes. How do you cope with stress in college? I procrastinate too much and let things pile up til I feel very anxious. It\u2019s hard for me to focus or start tasks.",

      "text": "Get mental health help please. I suffered from untreated OCD the first pass through college and the difference now that it\u2019s treated is just astonishing. It\u2019s amazing what you can accomplish when you just tackle some everyday, but that is soooo hard to do when anxiety is a major factor. Good luck.",
