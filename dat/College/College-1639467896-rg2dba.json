      "text": "I can relate to a lot of how you feel. I felt as if I missed a \u201cstep\u201d in adulthood since I stayed at home and went to community college rather than the independence that a four year provides, and then I transferred to an online school (because covid, and it was cheaper, anyway). I still feel stuck sometimes, but it honestly gets better. There were a lot of people at my community college that I had never met and were just as fun as my high school friends. \n\nAlso, my friend from a four year said he felt extremely home-sick when he first went to his school. He had a lot of trouble with the campus housing. Now that he\u2019s graduated and he\u2019s paying back the loans he took, he\u2019s a bit overwhelmed. I think there\u2019s downsides to both options. \n\nI hope things can improve, and if you want to, you are able to transfer to a four year. If not, I hope you\u2019ll be able to find happiness knowing you made a good choice for your future.",

      "text": "There isn't anything to be embarrassed about. If you need to cry, then you let it out and cry. Ain't no shame in that. It's easier said - but you have to find pride in your work and in yourself! Start setting goals for yourself going into next semester \\[or if your not going back, goals for your next 3-4 months\\] so that way you have motivation to get through. Remind yourself what your *end goal* is so you know \"This is what I want out of college, and I'm going to get it.\" \n\nDon't compare yourself to your friends, off at 4 years or where ever else, because no one's path is the same. Have pride in **your** work. You study hard for your grades, and \\[hopefully\\] feel fulfilled that you did a great job at the best of your abilities. And when you've finished your two year degree - possibly transfer to a 4 year that accepts you credits and only have to knock out another two for your Bachelors. Or whatever your plan may be.",

I failed 2 classes my first year. I did meet my now husband but I spent all my time with his friends and their rotating not serious girlfriends, so I came out of college with no life long friends that I\u2019ll know forever. I went to a medium size state school that had a football stadium the size of a high schools. No crazy football days, barely broadcasted on tv. I wasn\u2019t in any clubs or a sorority. I worked a part time job and finished in 4 years thanks to the dual credit classes I took in high school. \n\nNot every college is what you see at Alabama, A&M, and other big schools. Some are just average",
