  "text": "I\u2019m taking a college algebra class as a jr. in high school and I\u2019m trying to calculate what I need on my last test to pass the class. Passing grade is a 60%. Grading scale is as follows: Homework: 20% Labs 10% Test 60% and Final Exam 10%. There are 3 test total plus the final exam. I have already taken 2/3 test and the last test is tomorrow. The only grades that are not in yet are the 3rd test and the final exam. I\u2019m trying to figure out the grade I must get on the last test (not the final) in order to keep a passing grade in the class (60%). My current grade in the class is a 68.12%. I don\u2019t know why I am having trouble calculating this but please let me know.",
