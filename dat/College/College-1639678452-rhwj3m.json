  "text": "To graduate during the summer, I have to take 209 before I take 320. How do I convince my advisor to take them at the same time in one semester? My gpa is currently at a 2.5( will go up this semester to maybe a 3.0) idk. I only have 21 credits left  to graduate with a bachelor\u2019s. I can\u2019t afford to wait another semester to graduate.",

      "text": "Ask your advisor to verify that the department policy is that 209 must come *before* 320.  In some cases, a program will allow you to do both at the same time and it's not an issue.    You mention your GPA - is there a minimum level to take either class?  If not, then that shouldn't matter.\n\nThat said, it's ultimately the professor for 320 that makes the final call.",

They don\u2019t offer 320 in the summer, and I need help convincing the department lead, to let me take both classes in one semester. I heard she\u2019s very strict on prerequisites, but I need to graduate ASAP.",

              "text": "You're not making sense here. Is 209 a prereq for 320 or not? If yes, that means you must take 209 before 320 unless the department head and relevant instructors agree to allow case-by-case overrides.\n\nIt would help a lot to know what these courses actually are instead of meaningless (to us) numbers. But regardless, only your advisor can answer this question.",
