  "title:": "Peer keeps asking me for my answers in the assignments but I'm not sure how to say no?",
  "text": "There's this guy in my class, a year senior to me. 2 hours before the deadline, he asks me to send my assignments to him, and he says he'll edit them (professor clearly mentioned they'd be checking for plagiarism). Apparently, he's caught up in a lot of work due to which he can't do it. That very fact is making me question if he'll even edit my assignment in the remaining 2 hours. \n\nBut the root problem here is my own insecurity. When a friend asks me for help, I never say no because, well, they're my friend. This dude, however, has only contacted me thrice (for my homework; the first and second time I had kinda helped him out, but now I just can't). I feel like there might come a time when I'll need his help (not cheating ofc), and he'll remember that I didn't help him when he needed it (this is the insecurity I mentioned). Again, I don't feel like this with my friends but this feeling comes up when dealing with other random people. \n\nI know this sounds like a very personal question, but stuff like this keeps happening in my college life and I'm very uncertain about how to tackle it.",

I had this happen at the beginning of the semester and I kind of slow faded from people who kept asking me for these things outside of in-class interactions. For most people, once you say \"yeah I'm not doing this, sorry, but you can go to the tutoring center\" (or whatever) once or twice they get the message and leave you alone.",

One big thing you can learn in college is how to stand up for yourself. Remember that \"no, I can't do that\" is all you need to say, and that you don't owe anyone an explanation. If he keeps badgering you, just ignore him.",

Word it like that, that you \"won't be able too\" or \"can't do it\". Make it concrete. If you leave it with \"not comfortable\" you'll open up yourself to debating why \"it's ok\" from this person.",

As predicted, she ended up not understanding what I wrote and couldn't reword it in time which was about a week lol and then kind of gave up\n\nYeah, hopefully u said no because plagiarism is high here and 2 hrs for him is impossible. u will get urself in trouble. u've already helped him lots !!",
