  "title:": "Peer keeps asking me for my answers in the assignments but I'm not sure how to say no?",
  "text": "There's this guy in my class, a year senior to me. 2 hours before the deadline, he asks me to send my assignments to him, and he says he'll edit them (professor clearly mentioned they'd be checking for plagiarism). Apparently, he's caught up in a lot of work due to which he can't do it. That very fact is making me question if he'll even edit my assignment in the remaining 2 hours. \n\nBut the root problem here is my own insecurity. When a friend asks me for help, I never say no because, well, they're my friend. This dude, however, has only contacted me thrice (for my homework; the first and second time I had kinda helped him out, but now I just can't). I feel like there might come a time when I'll need his help (not cheating ofc), and he'll remember that I didn't help him when he needed it (this is the insecurity I mentioned). Again, I don't feel like this with my friends but this feeling comes up when dealing with other random people. \n\nI know this sounds like a very personal question, but stuff like this keeps happening in my college life and I'm very uncertain about how to tackle it.",
