  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm excited to make this post but I've got to admit I'm pretty nervous too. Long story short, I'm 24 and after 6 years of being a full time caregiver for two individuals (both of which have passed on) I'm now ready to start my journey to become a Pharmacist. \n\nI have absolutely no idea where to begin, all I know is that I want to begin in a CC and transfer over. But I don't know how to take the first step. I dropped out of high school in my junior year so I missed out on prepping for college and my mind is kinda spinning. \n\nAll advice is greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Talk to an advisor at the college. They will give you some advice on where to start. Personally I\u2019d recommend doing a few highschool courses again to get back into the school mode. Preferably ones that will go towards your entrance requirements for the program. \n\nGood luck! I was out 5 years before I went back to school so I know it can be a lot to think about.",

      "text": "I second talking to an advisor. However, also know yourself. Advisors do not always give good advice.\n\nThe good news is that much of the 'college prep' high school provides is actually irrelevant for college. Yes, you missed out on some information and it will be harder, but don't overestimate the amount of prepping high schools give for college. \n\nBest of luck!",

I\u2019m about a year and a half in!\n\nMake sure to either get your full associates at the CC (which will transfer regardless) or if you want to transfer earlier, make sure all your courses will transfer to your uni! GPA matters so don\u2019t overload yourself! You got this!!!\n\nFeel free to pm if you ever want a study friend :)",
