  "text": "So I have been learning programming for a couple of months now and my issue is that I can only write EXTREMELY basic programs like arithmetic equations and simple stuff like that and I can't do other big things like building projects and other stuff. Understanding syntax isn't hard but the biggest issue is thinking logically/algorithmically. I just struggle with writing the code out and to make the solution better. I keep struggling with problems on codewars and problems like this(yes please don't laugh):\n\nComplete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.\n\n'world'  =>  'dlrow'\n'word'   =>  'drow'\n\nWhat should I do? Am I just really cut out for this or not because honestly, I feel like an idiot. Honest answers please",
