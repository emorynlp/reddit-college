      "text": "If you have any interest in something technical, you should go get an engineering degree if some sort and do technical sales. Marketing is one of the more oversaturated business majors and isn't compensated super well. On the other hand, most engineers (myself included) either hate sales, or are no good at it. So if you can enjoy the engineering enough, you will have great job prospects and probably a better salary.",
