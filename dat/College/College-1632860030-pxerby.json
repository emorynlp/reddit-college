  "text": "I was washing my sheets today and after taking my stuff out of the dryer, it smells like wet dog. Granted, I did forget dryer sheets but that would only cover up the smell a little. Any tips on how to not have my laundry smell because of my colleges appliances? :)",

      "text": "Most likely the washing machine is the issue. I've cleaned my own machine using vinegar and baking soda... Baking soda cleans out some of the nasty stuff, vinegar helps reduce the smell. Some have said that if you use a splash of vinegar in with clothes or towels that helps as well. \n\nBottom line is the equipment you're using is nasty, devote the entire building to maintaining it better",
