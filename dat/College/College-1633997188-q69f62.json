      "text": "Talk to people's student organizations but I'm just saying if you're a freshman most guys aren't looking for a relationship their 1st or 2nd year typically. People are mostly enjoying the freedom of the 1st couple years of college. That isn't to say there won't be people looking to have an exclusive relationship but at least from my experience that is rather people in the minority the 1st couple years of University.\n\nSorry if I couldn't be more helpful try going to clubs or sporting events and talk to people",
