  "text": "I'm a first year college student (31 years old, never finished high school but did obtain my GED in 2009) I'm currently more than halfways through my first year of college (Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science) and was wondering if taking the SAT and/or ACT would be beneficial or would it just be a waste of time and money? Thank you!",

Maybe there\u2019s something I don\u2019t know but I\u2019m in grad school if that helps. I\u2019ve never heard of someone pursuing their bachelors taking the ACT/SAT once in uni, but I may be wrong.",
