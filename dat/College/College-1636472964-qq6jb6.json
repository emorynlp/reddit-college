  "text": "I\u2019ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and bi-polar so my emotions are all over the place. However, I just can\u2019t seem to live off of $12 bucks an hour for my two kids and I. I am also in the middle of a divorce. \n\nSomething came over me and I\u2019ve decided I want to start up college and work into becoming a nurse. I heard from my sister and friends that it\u2019s extremely hard, overwhelming and requires a lot of time and energy in four years. \n\nSeriously, is it worth it? The college nearby only has the traditional four year classes.",

I\u2019m proud of you for deciding to go back, I know it can be intimidating going back. I waited 5 years to go back to college, but it was a great decision!!!",

The reasons there's such a shortage of nurses include the difficulty of the coursework (think \"pre-med\", the length of time for advanced education, the stress, the long hours, and the \"scut\" work).  \n\nFor a similar career (helping people in the medical field) that has a stable income and benefits, I recommend you look at Radiology Tech programs.  These are often one or two year certificate programs and your local community college may offer a program at a reasonable price.",
