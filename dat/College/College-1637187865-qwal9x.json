  "text": "Y'all this is General chemistry and by now the class size is 1/4th what it was at the start of the semester, especially when the final drop date happened on the 5th of this month.\n\nWe use canvas, so anyone can go in there and see averages on grades.. and the averages on all 3 exams were all failing grades (50s and below) and absolutely nobody has made a 100 on any of the exams. \n\nSo far she's given 1 extra credit assignment and is doing a retake on last week's exam, which had an average score of 40%. She then stressed that she never gives out extra credit and doesn't know why we're all struggling so hard.\n\nVery nice lady, but her lectures are very fast paced and apparently we're already 4 days ahead of where the syllabus says we're supposed to be \ud83d\udc80",

      "text": "Right now, there\u2019s a huge problem with students being way underprepared due to coursework they had in the pandemic (whether HS or HE). This is probably a part of the problem, especially if she\u2019s surprised at the low scores. She\u2019s probably been conducting the course this way for some time now and is seeing a major drop from what it used to be, which indicates that an external factor is affecting the scores.",

          "text": "seconding this; my first chem quiz had a 30% average bc we had all just come from high school and didn\u2019t know how to study for a college class; some people dropped out but after that first one the averages climbed up to at least 70 on everything. i\u2019m sure it\u2019s even harder for students now who haven\u2019t had in-person classes/tests in a year or more, and really don\u2019t have a ton of experience studying for courses like this. chem can be a hard class with more of a focus on concepts than people sometimes realize, but if the prof is surprised then it\u2019s less likely that she\u2019s a bad teacher and more likely the content/emerging-from-pandemic class",

The class average was a D and like this guy spent the whole class going over the test and just saying how shocked he was and that we should\u2019ve known everything. But at the same time he didn\u2019t even teach the entire last question before (exam had 3 questions), and like there were other parts that we\u2019d never seen before. All this and he\u2019s still not going to curve it or let us redo it. Some professors are just oblivious. You\u2019re not alone.",

If students aren't grasping the material it can partly be the professor's fault, but students should also contribute as best as they can outside of class.",

My professor advised the class after the first exam that if we were already struggling in the class it would be better to take a course called \"Intro to Chemistry\" instead of the \"General Chemistry\" course we were in. I'm sure most of them transferred to intro to chem, hopefully other colleges offer this course. She said it was if you need a refresher on high school chemistry and it would also better prepare you for the next few chemistry courses. \n\n...I wish I had switched to intro to chem \ud83d\udc94",
