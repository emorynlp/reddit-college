  "text": "So this is my first year and college, I took up engineering because my uncle wants me to help him in his business. I really hated mathematics, chemistry, and I dont like to draw, I dont know how to draw. I'm more interested in literature, history, and law. Now I'm regretting my decision, I'm stressed all the time and I just want to quit. I wanted to shift but we already spent large amounts of money. I need your help making a decision. Do I tell my parents that I want to shift because engineering is making me nutssssss. I hate this shit. I just wanna run away from all this. Or just sacrifice and continue with this heaping pile of shit? Ii need your insights about this matter.",
