I wasn't really bullied in HS like I was as a kid, but there was always so much drama and some ppl were just straight up mean. I managed to get to a place where I mostly cruised by on the sideline of it all while still participating in sports and going to school dances and stuff, but it was impossible to avoid all the drama and sometimes I just  had to put up with it. In college you get to choose the people you interact with and you get so much freedom. I can sit in class and do anything I want whereas in HS I always had ppl telling me I had to pay attention and telling me what I'm not allowed to do.",

That keeps you on your toes and gives you some sense of responsibility.\n\nOn the drama thing, it was fairly minimal in my case but when it did exist, it was so interesting and entertaining, im not going to lie.\n\nAs for freedom, well, i already could do almost everything i wanted to because my parents always trusted me. I said \"literally\" because i skipped classes quite a lot in my school years. My grades weren't all that good, mediocre with the odd great grade here and there. Managed to get into a top college in my country due to doing amazing in the final exams.",

I went to a very small high school with an extremely limited curriculum and several administrators who actively tried to discourage people from pursuing higher education. Everything from refusing to seat proctors for AP tests and online exams, banning independent studies, to refusing to provide any counseling or admissions guidance when it came to applying to university.  \n\nThe final straw for me was when I was literally told by the principal that while I *was* valedictorian, they would not list it on my transcript to \"be fair to the other students.\" This alone screwed me out of two scholarships I'd been in the running for.   \n\nBy year three my entire friend group sans myself and one other person had given up on any plans for post-high-school education and almost all of them would get super snarky and aggressive whenever the topic of college was brought up. Both myself and the one other friend both got into our top choice college on early decision, but outside of the few remaining supportive friends and teachers we told literally nobody until graduation.  \n\nPoint is, high school can be a amazing time for some folks, but an absolute nightmare for others. For me at least though, fuck high school.",
