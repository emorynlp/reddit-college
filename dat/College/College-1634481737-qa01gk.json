  "text": "I'm thinking about going to college, but I'll be 24 soon.  \nis it pathetic starting community college at 24 and then hopefully transferring to a public university?\n\nwon't i be the oldest guy there?\n\nwhat about social life? i feel kind of embarrassed starting college at 24, and attending parties\\\\gatherings with bunch of people 6 years younger than me.. hopefully i will be able to make some friends..\n\nEdit:\n\nI just want to state that there are couple of  reasons I\u2019m not sure if to go to college. \n1. I do have a job as a software developer, at a high tech company, with high salary, 401k and all of that. \n2. As an international student it will cost more than a resident\n\nSo I need to take that into account, that I won\u2019t be working and will pay most of my savings on this degree.. \n\nBut I do want to do a degree, in order to be more successful and thrive in my field of work.",

I'll start when I'm 24, and finish (hopefully) by the time I'm 28. I don't know why this feels so weird for me, i guess it's just norms i grew up on..",

My boyfriend also started college when he was 24 and most people at his university don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s older than them by a few years, and he has a lot of friends from extracurriculars and a giant study group of mostly traditional students that meets multiple nights per week.
