  "text": "I\u2019m 19F and a sophomore in college. This is my first year on campus and I\u2019m still kind of adjusting to it even though the semester is about to end. I struggle with FOMO because every time I go on social media I see people partying with their groups of friends and just having a great time while I only have 2-3 friends that go home on weekends as well as myself and never been to or been invited to a party/fun event. It gets me down because I feel like I\u2019m supposed to be out having fun and partying it up at this age but I can\u2019t get myself into that lifestyle for some reason. How do you deal with FOMO and have more fun in college?",

Personally I wasn't too hot on them until I got a tad older. I had a lot of fun just having a small group to drink with or do other activities. Maybe convince the friends to skip going home a weekend and plan something fun to do together.",

      "text": "18M freshman here. I do not have that much experience but I can still give some advice.\n\nFirst off, you mention that you see others on social media \u201chaving a great time,\u201d but social media is meant to portray an outwardly positive, near perfect portrayal of someone. Even if someone looks like they are having the time of their lives on social media, just know that it is not the full truth and that comparing your day to day experiences with someone\u2019s highlight reel is not exactly the most fair or just comparison.\n\nOn the part about how to enjoy yourself in college, for me, I enjoy the people that I do have and the activities that I do with them. Coming to college I really knew no one, but I have met about 6 interesting people that I hang out with. By hang out I mean that we eat together, or study together, or just talk. I have not been to a party at all so far, and I have had similar FOMO to you recently, but I had to realize that there are so many other ways to have fun and connect in college with friends, clubs, exercise, games, etc. You mention that can\u2019t get into the party \u201clifestyle,\u201d but that you really want to, and if this is something you want to pursue then you will have to step outside of your comfort zone to seek out people at your college that are in to partying and ask them how to get into it. \n\nFOMO is a very valid feeling and it hasn\u2019t really gone away for me, I just feel that it gets easier when you are making your own plans, either with yourself or other people.\n\nFor instance, I may be in my dorm playing a board game or with a friend eating dinner and talking about life, and I can still enjoy these things while knowing that other people are going out and getting drunk together.\n\nHowever, everyone is different. Nothing I have said is a perfect remedy, they are just suggestions and examples of how I have slightly reduced FOMO and have been more comfortable with my current situation of not knowing that many people. I honestly believe that cherishing the people that you do have, if you know they are good people, is something that has helped me.\n\nI hope that you feel more validated and secure soon. College life is not easy especially with covid destroying a lot of people\u2019s freshman years. I wish you the best",
