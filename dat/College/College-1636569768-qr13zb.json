  "title:": "Academic Survey - Communication in Team Software Development Projects",
  "text": "Hi y'all,\n\nI'm a graduate researcher at Clemson University and I'm running a study on how student teams communicate during software development projects (like a capstone course or similar). It's an IRB-approved survey and asks questions related to how you use communication/collaboration tools (Discord, GroupMe, etc.) to work with your team.\n\nIt's open to anyone who has worked on a group software development (programming) project during their degree programs and used a communication software with their team!\n\nYou can find the survey here: [https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_6sbJ3WdK51J6GzQ](https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6sbJ3WdK51J6GzQ)\n\nI greatly appreciate y'all taking time out of your day to complete my survey! Your responses will help me move forward on my dissertation!\n\nFeel free to DM me with any questions you may have.",
