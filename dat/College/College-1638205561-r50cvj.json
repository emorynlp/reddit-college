  "text": "So I did the math and no matter what I do the best grade I can get in my class is a D. I need a D- for the prerequisites but I still need to pass this class to graduate. \n\nI accidentally didn\u2019t turn in two assignments cuz I forgot to turn them in after I finished them. So now I\u2019m gonna fail. I\u2019ve also had a rough semester because I\u2019ve developed schizophrenia and this has also been really hard to deal with. Idk what to do. My teacher doesn\u2019t seem to understand. \n\nIf anybody has any useful information or advice lmk I\u2019m open ears.",
