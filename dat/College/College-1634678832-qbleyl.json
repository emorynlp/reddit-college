  "text": "I\u2019m sure many of us have thought we were down and out for the count once colleges switched their whole scene to COVID sensitivity. Starting with zoom class, no in person sports, no events, everything collapsed. What hit hard for me was my self discipline to go to class. \n\nIt\u2019s always been a struggle because I can be in my room all day\u2026until this semester. I finally been going to a majority of my in person class and tryna keep up with my grades. I haven\u2019t seen B+\u2019s and P\u2019s on my grades since high school 2-3 years ago (I know sad but chill lol). I\u2019m happy to have found some kind of drive to do okay in school again and hope this drive n effort continues till the end of this semester. \n\nHave any of y\u2019all had the same kind of story? Has anyone found light in the COVID darkness?",
