  "text": "I\u2019m at Uc Davis and this is my first quarter and I honestly didn\u2019t do any research on the school or what it was about I just chose to come here because my parents would be proud that I got into a good school. I\u2019m so confused about college In general and I\u2019ve been taking different classes and nothing at this school Interests me. It\u2019s also way to far and I commute so it\u2019s a struggle to come here all the time and I don\u2019t work yet due to citizenship issues so paying for gas will be an issue. I\u2019ve looked at a college near me (literally a 5 minutes drive from where I live) and it has was Im looking for. I did research and i think it\u2019s the right choice for me. Davis on the other hand doesn\u2019t have what I\u2019m looking for. Im looking to drop and go to community for 2 years and then transfer to the college I want to be at and finish my degree. Should I drop now and transfer to community college.",

      "text": "You're still very early in your academic career, so I'd say do some damage control now before things get out of hand. Community colleges are often overlooked, but they're less expensive and sometimes can provide as good or even better education than a school in the UC group. Nothing wrong with going to a community college and then transferring.",
