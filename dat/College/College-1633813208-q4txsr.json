  "title:": "Thinking of withdrawing from 2 courses this semester and returning the next.",
  "text": "The 2 classes I\u2019ll retake will be physics 1/calculus 1. I didn\u2019t take precalc or calculus in high-school and I barely passed trig in CC due to the professor giving the tests and exams online(bad idea for him). Also, wasn\u2019t taking college seriously at the time.\n\nNow with physics, calculus and physics are taken concurrently. Due to my deteriorating mental health and lack of planning coming onto the campus, I am severely behind. Classes started in August and we\u2019re almost 1/2 through the semester. Idk if I can can make it due to the material progressively stacking on top of each other as you move along in these courses.\n\nIf I do withdraw(my financial aid covers mostly everything) I\u2019ll still attend classes and what not but I\u2019ll just tank until the deadline to withdrawal. Study my ass off in the meantime to prepare for for the next. I\u2019m almost a Junior. It\u2019s either I destroy myself trying to get at least a C or spend the time to properly prepare for the the next semester.",
