  "text": "so, I'm a secondary ed - English major. every time I go to class, I feel like my discussion points are so stupid and that I have nothing of value to say. I'll raise my hand to talk and immediately feel a pit of anxiety in my stomach, but I know that I have things to say. I never just talk to talk, but all of the people in my English classes are so smart or at least seem like they are. I just feel like I do not belong at all.",
