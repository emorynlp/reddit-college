  "title:": "Afraid of quitting comfort zone for internships",
  "text": "I've been accepted as an intern in a great company in an area that although I like and offers me a ton of stuff to learn, it scares me, I feel its too much. I can turn down that offer and accept a second offer in an area I know I will do good, I like and don't feel scared of. I really want to challenge myself and go for that first offer and make the best out of it but the anxiety, impostor syndrome and all those fears/nervous feelings make me doubt and think of the second offer more. Any comments and advices are hugely welcomed.",

      "text": "Your future self will thank you and be proud of you for taking the challenge. By taking the leap and putting yourself out of your comfort zone momentarily (you'll likely get more used to it once you settle in), you are opening up so many doors and opportunities for yourself. Your current fears and anxieties don't hold a candle to what you will learn and the experience you will gain. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey! :)",
