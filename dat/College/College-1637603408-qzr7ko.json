  "text": "Hi! I am a student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, and I'm writing a qualitative research paper for my English 290 class. If you are a college student (freshman to grad student) who experiences symptoms of seasonal depression, I would so, so appreciate it if you took 2-3 minutes out of your day to take my survey. I would love to have a sufficient amount of data to utilize in my research. Thank you so much. \n\n https://utk.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_esKrL3u0rLFnKUm",
