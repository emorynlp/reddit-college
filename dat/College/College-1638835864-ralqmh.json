  "text": "I wrote a paper the previous semester on a particular subject. This semester, I had the same subject to work on except with a different angle. I used a lot of same research & information because it related. I basically built on my previous research. \n\nNow, I just noticed I matched 34% with another paper at my college & it has to be my other one. \n\nIs this plagiarism? Will I get get a flunking grade for this? Do I have a defense if I get called out? A little worried this may be an issue\u2026",
