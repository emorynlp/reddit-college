  "text": "Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I\u2019m an art major and I\u2019m taking an art history class that is required. Tomorrow I have my first test for the class and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not going to do well. If I fail this class will I have to retake this class to get my degree ? I guess also in general, if you fail a class what happens?",

      "text": "It\u2019s the first test right? Even if you do poorly you\u2019ll be able to turn things around with later ones. Learning is all about the process, and it has its ups and downs. If you fail a class that\u2019s required you\u2019ll have to take it again. Keep studying tonight and perhaps try to get a good night\u2019s sleep. It\u2019ll help your memory and energy levels.  Perhaps you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by your own abilities as you keep working on them.",
