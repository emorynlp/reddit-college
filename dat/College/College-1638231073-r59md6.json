  "text": "Hi all, I'm a graduate student trying to study how people get their news and why people trust/distrust different news media. I created this quick survey and I would really appreciate it if you could help me out and answer some questions. Shouldn't take too long :)  \n\n[Link to survey](https://ql830.typeform.com/to/CEBwz5u2)\n\nI'm trying to study why people trust or distrust different news media sources in today's divided media landscape and why this \"echo chamber\" of today's internet formed. If you have any opinions about this but don't want to fill out the survey, reply with your opinion below would help a lot too!",
