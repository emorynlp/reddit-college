  "text": "College sophomore here. This semester was my first time living on campus. I absolutely hated it. I hated the food and the dorm I stayed at. I don't think I have any genuine friends here either. Some people just stopped talking to me for no reason and other people always plan to do things without me. During this semester, I felt perhaps the loneliest I've ever felt in my life.\n\nAnd the academics here were even worse. My CS class sucked all the joy out of my major and I've cried so many times because of how completely inadequate and out of place I feel among my much-more intelligent peers. Moreover, the academic life here just feels so toxic, and I don't feel like any of the professors or TAs genuinely care about people. However, I know I could just be saying that because of my CS class experience.\n\nI just feel like I don't ever want to experience this again. I would rather try to go my own way rather than put my mental health through the shit I went through this semester. It's not like the mental health counselling here is really that great either. I really only came to college because of my parents' whole immigrant mentality that the American dream = STEM degree -> STEM job. I went with CS because I thought it was super fun and wouldn't have minded if I had a CS job. But if I had made my own choice, I'd have tried to go into music or something without getting a degree.",
