  "text": "I want to go continue my higher education in grad schooling, but there are no schools within an hour drive where I live for the specific program I want to do. My family is dependent on me, has to do with health issues and care, as well as financial costs. I feel extremely guilty over the thought of leaving when they need me most and fear the potential of losing a loved one. I used to want to move away but now I fear even applying. Is driving 2 hours to campus too much? wwyd?",
