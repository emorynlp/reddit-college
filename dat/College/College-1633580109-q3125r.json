  "title:": "how to raise gpa in a semester/year?",
  "text": "im a sophomore in my first semester trying to transfer, and there's a scholarship offered to kids who have a 3.9 average gpa... I currently have a 3.7 gpa becs of a math class I took (im a politics major) and just general covid fatigue. \n\nas implied above, I can't do math for sh\\*t, and need help calculating how to raise my GPA from a 3.72 to a 3.9 (or possibly, even a 4?). Is it even possible? \n\nIn my freshman year, I took 34 credits, with 5 As, 2 A-s, 1 B+, and 1 B. \n\nIn my sophomore year (currently), im taking 16 credits (4 classes) for now, hoping to average at least 3 As and one B+ or A-, any ideas how much I should aim to raise?",

      "text": "Just take classes you enjoy. Those are the classes you will be more willing to put more effort into which in turn gives you good grades. Avoid classes you don\u2019t like (such as math). Of course, it may not be possible to avoid all classes you don\u2019t like, so if you are ever forced to take a class you don\u2019t enjoy, simply lie to yourself. Every time you think about that class, tell yourself \u201cI\u2019m exciting\u201d or \u201cthis is interesting\u201d or even \u201cthis isn\u2019t even that bad\u201d. Basically anything positive. At first this will be very forced, but over the many months of repetition you will eventually like it to some level. \n\nFinally, remember that you are more than just your grades. Make sure to eat, get rest, and have some fun throughout college. It\u2019s amazing that you are so passionate about getting good grades, but those will be pointless if you give up on your mental/physical health too much.",
