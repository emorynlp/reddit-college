  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior in high school and my school offers a program for seniors to complete their credits at the local community college called Early College. I\u2019ll still technically be a high school student and can still participate in school activities like clubs and sports. I\u2019m planning on going to my local state school and I would be getting some gen-ed credits while completing my high school diploma. \n\nSome people have said that I should just finish senior year at my high school but I want an outside opinion. If anyone has done a program similar to this or knows about programs like these and transferring the credits I would really appreciate it.",

I would be taking AP Calc, AP Gov, AP Enviro or AP Chem, and AP Spanish if they offer it next year. \n\nI\u2019ve already taken a college class on intro to American politics so I don\u2019t know how interesting AP Gov would be. Most of the seniors I\u2019ve talked to said that only AP Calc is difficult. I\u2019d also want to secure the credit for taking Calc instead of working hard and I don\u2019t get a high enough AP score to count for the credit anyway. Some seniors have taken Calc using dual enrollment credits and said that it was still challenging but with less stress that comes with an AP test",

I personally don't think that dual enrollment is better than taking AP classes, from what I understand, college courses usually have a final that is weighted very heavily so it's not that different from an AP test. Additionally, AP gov is super easy, I took it freshman year. These are just my thoughts.",

You won't even know of them if your teacher isn't nice enough to tell you \"we're skipping this stuff but it's in a regular calculus 2 course.\" This is heavily important if you are planning to take future classes like differential equations, because those professors might gloss over the introductory stuff assuming you already learned it in a previous class.\n\nthe people who say don't do it are just dum dums or too lazy or they are going to private schools (another comment replied to you explaining private schools are not nice regarding CC course transfers).\n\nof course, you must also realize that those early college CC courses are still going to be easier than your university courses, so you should try to supplement those with final exams and homework assignments you can find online from universities.",

If you end up going to that same community college or your local university (usually they are connected with local community colleges and all credits transfer) then it should be fine.\n\nIf you're planning on going to a different college you should contact the community college or look up their website if they have one. They will have information on the university's that they 100% transfer credits to. If the university you want to go to isn't on the list, not all hope is lost, the credits still have a chance of transferring since they're gen ed, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n\nEither way if you want to I think you should do it anyway if it doesn't cost you money especially or if it's a cheaper rate than if you were a regular college student. If your credits do transfer that means you won't have to take that class again and you can take higher courses if it fills a prerequisite.",

      "text": "Do it do it do it\nI did this in high school and it might just be the best decision I've made to date\nAP credits are cool but I absolutely fasttracked myself through college by having actual college credits that allowed me to skip certain classes I never could've otherwise. Colleges also often require one or two classes for all majors that cannot use AP credits or any other substitutes. These classes are generally terrible and since everyone has to take them the class time you get could be horrible, and theres nothing you can do about it... unless, of course, you took an Equivalent College Course at a Different University or whatever. Middle college js great this if you already know where you want to go and feel confident enough in your chances to start planning your senior year schedule around this.\n\nAside from this, I met the coolest people and had the absolute time of my life. I can't guarantee that everyone else will meet lifelong friends like I did, but I can definitely say that any early college program will let you meet people you never wouldve met otherwise, particularly adults (as in age 18-80, had a 60 something retiree in my astronomy class taking it for fun), with an older and perhaps wiser perspective. \n\nAside from all that, you have one guarantee: freedom. You will never ever be able to go back to having a bell schedule once you've tasted the sweet liberation of coming and going as you please. The first time I realized I was done with class for the day and all those suckers at my old school were sat in homeroom was pure bliss, I hit the road, got some boba at the local asian market, and never looked back. Just be self-motivated to keep your grades up and you'll have a great time.",
