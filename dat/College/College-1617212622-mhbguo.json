  "text": "I have been so bummed out lately thinking I\u2019ve wasted the last four years and will continue working a minimum wage job and paying off loans. \n\nI applied to a few nursing schools (accelerated program) and there\u2019s one at my university. I got denied, this bummed me out even more. I finally had an interview and it was going great. Finally towards the end she told me she\u2019s looking at my application and that she should have mentioned, she only interviews with the intent to accept those students!!! \n\nThis feels amazing. So excited for this next chapter and a great motivator to finish this semester strong.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone!!! And thank you for the rewards \ud83e\udd7a",

Or if you have a BA and it\u2019s an accelerated program. You already have all the UCs so its just the nursing part. That\u2019s the path I chose. I also know the community college near me does an associates program. Another school does 3 years and you get a certificate of nursing after the first and then MSN at the end (masters). \n\nYou really just have to look, not even just nursing bc there is a TON of options out there. \n\nGood luck!!!",

For the past year, I\u2019ve absolutely hated my professional and course work. I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life on a computer marketing, doing PR, or communications, making money for someone else while I earn $15 an hour. When the pandemic started, I developed a deep interest in nursing science and medicine. Now I\u2019m leaving my four year university and going straight to my community college\u2019s program, where I hope to get my ADN and then get into an RN to BSN program.\n\nCheers to new beginnings!
