The only reason we caught my mom\u2019s Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma (Lung Cancer) was because it had spread to her hip and was eating away at her bone, causing her to have pain while sitting and walking. When it was diagnosed, the scans showed a total of 9 tumors in her body including 3 in her brain. The only symptom that caused her to go to the doctor was that hip pain though. We had no idea it would turn out to be cancer.\n\nNot that I want to freak out OP, but it\u2019s not impossible for it to be cancer. It\u2019s honestly best to prepare to hear that and it end up being better than to convince yourself it\u2019s nothing and it turns out to be the worst possible option.",

There is nothing you can do about it right now anyway, just wait to talk to the doctor. Good luck\nEdit: after reading all the other posts on your profile, you seem to know and acknowledge that you have a habit of worrying/overthinking/stressing about things that are sometimes out of your control. I think my honest advice here is to see a good therapist. It could help improve quality of life for you tremendously. You need to take care of yourself and reducing stress is a huge factor in that.",
