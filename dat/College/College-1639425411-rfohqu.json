  "text": "I'm a freshman and my first semester ends tomorrow. 3/5 of my professors have been so fucking shitty I just can't. One professor made a mistake grading my assignments, said she would fix it, but never did. Now she won't respond to my emails and my grade is way lower than it should be. Another prof assigned 200 questions over thanksgiving break to be completed and won't let us see our final grades. My chem professor's average final exam grade was a 50%. I personally passed with a 74%, which was one of the highest class grades, but we were promised a 16.5% exam curve, which she fucked up putting in and my A dropped to an A-. I know she put it in wrong because the exam was worth 28% of our grade and I didn't score low enough to bring my grade down 4 points. I think the fact that the average exam grade was a 50% is telling of her abilities as a professor. I emailed her explaining that she put the curve in incorrectly with math to back it up and received no response. I just HATE how our degrees and GPA's are determined by people who could be completely shitty and flaky. I don't even know what to do at this point. I'm not sure if its the college I attend or if this is just college in general. Either way I'm so ready to be done with this shit and drop out. I'm so damn sick of this process om my GOD",

          "text": "thank you! though i do have a question about whether i can dispute with my chem prof. a couple of things happened over the course of the semester (if you care to read, i understand you must be busy as a prof!)\n\n\\- because people were doing badly on the tests, she told us verbally we would have one test dropped, but then changed this because she thought people were cheating. she initially told us that only the people who cheated who would receive 0's. instead, we all received 0's for the test and she dropped that instead. I personally did well on that exam I got a 0 for, and did not cheat, and did badly on another exam so this impacted my grade. I was anticipating this lower grade to be dropped.\n\n\\- if she had dropped our lowest test grade then my grade would've been an A rather than A-\n\n\\- this is turn caused the tests to be worth less and everything else to be worth more, which differs from the grade calculations in the syllabus. however, at the end of the syllabus she states it is \"a flexible document, only to be changed to the benefit of the student\"",

              "text": "Quarter is over and I am already on to revising for next session. Nonetheless, never too busy to help a student.\n\nVerbal accounts are difficult to substantiate unless other students are willing to attest for the statements. The fact she gave everyone a 0 and then dropped the grade is suspect. Suspicion of cheating is not enough, a professor must have evidence. Blanket punishments are not best practice; research even shows this.\n\nAlways try addressing this with the instructor first and identify each issue as if you were preparing for litigation. Cite exactly where in the syllabus her decisions went against how the grade is calculated and how it was not toward your benefit. If she is still unwilling to relent, take the documentation to the Dean and lay out your concern. Try not to be emotional, but it is understandable why you would be. \n\nIf you need anything else or more guidance, feel free to hit me up by email, ecarr@yvcc.edu.",

      "text": "It might be a problem at your college or it might be that you just have bad luck and got all terrible professors. Usually at my college I\u2019ve gotten between 0 and 1 professors each semester who do stuff like that and the rest are great. But I could see how someone could reasonably luck out and get all professors who don\u2019t know how to run a class. If all the professors at your college are like that though, then it\u2019s probably indicative of a larger issue.",
