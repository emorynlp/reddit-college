  "text": "I'm a freshman and my first semester ends tomorrow. 3/5 of my professors have been so fucking shitty I just can't. One professor made a mistake grading my assignments, said she would fix it, but never did. Now she won't respond to my emails and my grade is way lower than it should be. Another prof assigned 200 questions over thanksgiving break to be completed and won't let us see our final grades. My chem professor's average final exam grade was a 50%. I personally passed with a 74%, which was one of the highest class grades, but we were promised a 16.5% exam curve, which she fucked up putting in and my A dropped to an A-. I know she put it in wrong because the exam was worth 28% of our grade and I didn't score low enough to bring my grade down 4 points. I think the fact that the average exam grade was a 50% is telling of her abilities as a professor. I emailed her explaining that she put the curve in incorrectly with math to back it up and received no response. I just HATE how our degrees and GPA's are determined by people who could be completely shitty and flaky. I don't even know what to do at this point. I'm not sure if its the college I attend or if this is just college in general. Either way I'm so ready to be done with this shit and drop out. I'm so damn sick of this process om my GOD",

      "text": "It might be a problem at your college or it might be that you just have bad luck and got all terrible professors. Usually at my college I\u2019ve gotten between 0 and 1 professors each semester who do stuff like that and the rest are great. But I could see how someone could reasonably luck out and get all professors who don\u2019t know how to run a class. If all the professors at your college are like that though, then it\u2019s probably indicative of a larger issue.",
