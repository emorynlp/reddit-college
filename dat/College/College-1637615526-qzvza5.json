  "title:": "26 looking to start over, I screwed up my first go but I believe I am mentally and physically ready to try college again!",
  "text": "As the title states I screwed up my first go I wasn\u2019t ready mentally out of high school. I went in not knowing what I wanted to do, so I really didn\u2019t have ambition. I screwed up, I did okay in some classes but some classes I failed or just did poor. I want to go back replace those grades and push towards what I want to do, I now know what I want to do.\n\n\nI\u2019m very behind but at 26 I\u2019m not getting any younger. Replacing grades will be a challenge but I know I can do it if I push my self. Then I can finally work towards that nursing degree. I know how competitive it will be but I\u2019m ready and motivated. Seeing all my friends graduating or in a career making good money, sure does sting. I do believe that\u2019s what I needed to see to make me realize my screw up and make a change. \n\n\nFor those of you wondering a big reason  did so poorly other than having no set goal. I lost both my grandmother and grandfather in the span of a year right in the middle of college. I also had to watch them slowly die due to their illness. So it was not easy to focus, I slipped up and my grades fell and I just couldn\u2019t catch back up. Then eventually just decided to stop going once covid hit. \n\n\nThis time though will be different, I\u2019m gonna get this done. Im feeling really motivated but scared at the same time. As anyone else failed and tried again to have success? Any advice will help!",

      "text": "I don't have any advice, but I just wanted to say that I'm in the same boat. I never went to college though for several reasons. But I'm sick of shitty low paying jobs that I can't stand. I'm 28, and I just can't do that stuff anymore, not for the rest of my life. So I'm starting school in January to be a vet tech. There are some better paying jobs to go to college for, but that's what I want to do, and it'll still be more money than what I'm getting now, especially if I decide to specialize in something later. I mainly just want something that I'll enjoy and find some meaning in.\n\nSo I don't have advice, but just know that you're not alone. And if you want to, go ahead back to school! I totally understand dropping out before. While I never went to college before, part of the reason I never went before was my mental health. I've struggled severely since I was a kid. I wasn't in a good enough mental state to try before. Until now, that is. College is hard enough, without mental health issues and death on top of it. I'm sorry for your loss btw. But I'm glad you're doing better, and I'm sure you'll do great in school!",

I\u2019m in the same boat just sick of the shifty paying jobs 1, and two know I\u2019ll regret it if I knew get it done. The pay off of being financially stable is going to be satisfying.\n\n\nThough it\u2019s scary to start later we got this, gonna take time but better to get it done now, rather than being 33 and going \u201cI could of been graduating now, had I gone is it too late to start now?\u201d You got this you\u2019re going to do awesome as well. Good luck!",

I'm taking 6 classes next semester I am scared every second of it, I wish you luck on your journey!",
