  "text": "I have accounting classes that I have to take even though I\u2019m going into CS, I\u2019m trying to substitute them with database oriented courses instead but, when I talked to my advisor he said that accounting is necessary to take.So, I went to the career center we have here and they told me to avoid taking them since they won\u2019t even help me land an internship. \n\nJust thinking of the amount of money I would have to spend on those two classes makes me want to vomit. I\u2019m thinking of speaking to the director of my college but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right move. \n\nAny help, opinions or past experiences would be great help and reference.",
