      "text": "Your parents probably just want the best for you, but they\u2019re not going about it the right way. It should be a balance between the two. Staying home and never meeting people will probably make you lonely and cause you to miss out on good experiences, but forcing yourself into every social situation possible will just make you anxious and miserable. \n\nTry to strike a compromise with them. Like, \u201cI\u2019ll go to a social event this weekend, but then I\u2019m off the next weekend.\u201d Explain that you want to try but you can only tolerate so much at once.",
