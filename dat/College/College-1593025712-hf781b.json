  "text": "My university recently just amended their housing contract (after students have signed), where it added a section for the case of on-campus housing termination if we are sent back home due to COVID-19 or other health interruptions. However, we are allowed to cancel without a fee. It states that...\n\n\u201cStudent acknowledges that, in the event of such temporary closures, restrictions and/or adjustments to the housing schedule, the University shall not have the obligation to issue a partial refund or credit for such interruptions.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m assuming that this is an occurrence at other American universities as well, but nan this is a bitch move imo",

Most university lawyers were in the corporate/employment area of law, thus the poor track record universities have when fighting students on civil liberty issues (ACLU and FIRE win all the time). But this is simple contract law. Any lawyer should understand it, especially university lawyers,... so is there some other reason they added it? Perhaps they are gambling on the prediction that students just won't challenge it. Maybe their reason for adding is to set an expectation that they think nobody will actually fight in court, worst-case scenario is ending up where they started and having to issue the refunds.",

If this contract is new then the university is inside the law and taking an approach similar to what airlines/hotels are doing in terms of billing agreements (no refund addition). But yes, it's fraud if they change an existing one and try to present it in court as signed by both parties.\n\nThe upsetting part is that the most likely solution will be a student filing a class action. Very few students are aware they can do that and also have the guts to do it. A lot of universities will probably get away with not giving out refunds for Spring 2020 housing simply due to the lack of students actually challenging them.",

The biggest misconception with class actions is that you have to be wealthy to start one.\n\nYou use similar math to economies of scale. It might cost you $2,000 to get a lawyer for your invididual case but if you file a class action, you can get a team of expensive lawyers that represents all the students and just goes on commission for a larger amount.\n\nIt would be different with suing as an individual but with a class action you have thousands of students so lawyers are much better just taking a percent of the winnings.",
