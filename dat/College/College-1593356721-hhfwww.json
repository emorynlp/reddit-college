  "text": "My major is elementary ed. Here are some of the responses I\u2019ve gotten when telling people that this is my major:\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s cute\u201d (what the hell?)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard ed majors skip class a lot. Is that true?\u201d (I go to class, thanks for asking)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m (engineering/pre-med/etc) so I\u2019m taking a lot of science and math classes you don\u2019t have to take.\u201d (Good for you, I guess? I don\u2019t really believe that more difficult classes make a major superior to others, so I guess I just don\u2019t really get the point to this one)\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019re selling yourself short?\u201d (No.)\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather be a child psychologist/social worker/lawyer?\u201d (I think for some reason the fact that I\u2019m *not* jumping straight from undergrad to grad school makes a lot of people uncomfortable. That\u2019s really not my problem, sorry)\n\nEDIT: I just remembered a bonus one: \u201cyou should try to get into a private school! Public school teachers make so little money!\u201d Fun fact: public school teachers tend to make more money than private school teachers. As a general rule, it\u2019s not a good idea to give advice when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. \n\nI think the more polite thing to do is to say something simple like \u201ccool!\u201d when someone says their major, or make a connection (\u201cmy sister has the same major!\u201d) or ask a relevant, easy-to-answer question (\u201cI heard the department of xyz is merging with your department. Is that true?\u201d). \n\nI\u2019m sure plenty of people in other fields have similar experiences. What weird/rude responses have you gotten when you tell people your major? How would you prefer the conversation to go?",

      "text": "I'm not majoring in elementary ed, but I'm still going to school to become a teacher. In my state you are required to major in your content area (for me it's History) and then from there earn your teacher's certification. When telling peers my major and my plan, it's incredibly frustrating to hear comments like \"Well, you can't do much else with that major but teach!\" or \"I don't understand why you're going to be a teacher, you're so smart!\" or \"Wow, you're not going to make any money doing that!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm becoming an educator because I think education can provide youth with all sorts of opportunities they might not otherwise have and remembering the impact my teachers had on my growth. I'm not doing it for the money or because I don't think I can do anything else - which is what it seems a lot of others are assuming. Because I'm minoring in Social Studies, I'm taking a lot of anthropology and geography courses and I find that science majors in these courses are some of the ones making the rudest comments. Between them and business majors, actually. It's just frustrating and I've learned to reply back with some quick quips of my own so others can realize how they come off.",

I\u2019m not saying all business and science students are like that, but that attitude is a lot more common in those fields than in teaching.",

For a lot of people, college is just a means to an end - that end being making enough money to have little to no material wants. To people with this mentality, it comes off as ludicrous to go to college for anything that wouldn't lead you to financial freedom, especially considering that college isn't free. If I knew that my major would not definitely lead to having a six figure salary in a five year timeframe, I would have either switched my major to something more profitable, or just not bothered going in the first place. \n\nAcademia isn't fun; you just get paid a lot depending on what you do there.

I used to be a finance major and that leads to some high paying careers but with very long work hours in certain parts of the year which would reduce my quality of life.

However, I do like politics but I decided not to major in it because there aren\u2019t any standard high paying careers that someone can get out of college with a political science degree. Most poli sci majors I know ended up working in retail or struggling to get into a low/mid tier law school which results in even more debt. \n\nConsidering the cost of college, it\u2019s definitely an investment you need to get a return on in order for it to be worth it.",

They\u2019re the shape the next generation of innovators, doctors, artist, writes and everything else. I hate having to justify the fact that I want to be a teacher. I was premed for the first two years because I thought I had to do something hard to be considered smart. I was working at a preschool at the same time, teaching at a Hebrew school and working as a counselor for older kids in the summer. I always knew I wanted to be a teacher and I got so sick of trying to prove myself to others rather than doing what I\u2019m best at. Teachers are smart. In order to teach a subject you have to have a B or higher in all related courses. If I want to be an English teacher I have to have A\u2019s and B\u2019s in almost all of my English classes. Same if I want to be a science teacher or a math teacher.",

My major is male dominated and routinely has some stories of implicit discrimination against females sometimes explicit as well. Not in school but in the industry. The reason I was surprised was cause they're way more passionate about it despite knowing these things happen. Most of the girls in my program are easily way more dedicated than the average guy. \n\nIt's exciting to see people who are passionate but kind of depressing as well when your meh. \n\n\nAlso teaching, especially elementary imo would probably be one of the more difficult things to do. Explanation is one of the hardest things to do well especially simple things we take for granted. That's is just the conclusion I came to as I talked with couple first time teachers when I was in highschool maybe going for teaching.",

I\u2019ve gotten this comment a lot from Catholic school loyalists who have no idea how underpaid their kids\u2019 teachers are. But the reality is that teacher pay is much more strictly regulated in public schools. Each public school district has a salary schedule that says how much you will make depending on your education and experience. Some states have teacher-specific minimum wages that only apply to public schools. Public school teacher salaries are transparently available online for anyone to view. Private schools don\u2019t have to publicize their salaries or follow salary schedules and minimum salaries. Where I live, I\u2019d probably make about 20% more at a public school than a private school as a first-year teacher.",

Granted, they do the majority of shitting on other majors (just speaking from experience) because a lot of people have an inflated sense of ego because engineering is considered to be difficult. Still, people are insecure or say dumb stuff to you no matter what major your are.\n\nI'm graduated now, but I was electrical engineering in college.\n\n\"Wow you must be really smart!\" (I had failed a few classes at this point and was killing myself to try to make it through to the end of the year. I felt dumb 95% of the time when I was in school. Just don't say stuff like this, we don't know how to respond and it's awkward).\n\n\"Lol you're just in it to meet smart guys right?\" (I'm a woman and my class was 90% guys)\n\nPost graduation at a happy hour with my new company, wearing the company polo, introducing myself, \"Soooo are you someone's girlfriend here or...?\" Me, \"No... I work here.\"\n\n\"All women in engineering are ugly/awkward/unhygienic/not worth dating.\" Alternatively, \"All guys in engineering are ugly/awkward/unhygienic/not worth dating.\"\n\nEvery major has a stereotypical weakness or bad trait and every other major plays on that and picks on it. It just happens! Advice to new college kids: don't be a dick, don't hate on other majors, keep your head down and be kind, and you'll get along with pretty much everybody.",

I'm taking courses in human psychology, the psychology of education, advanced history and research based courses, a variety of courses for \"Social Studies\" such as geography and anthropology courses...it's not easy becoming a teacher! I don't find it fair to compare degrees in general because each present their own unique challenges and complications. People should just respect that any form of higher education requires a certain level of dedication and get over their shitty comments.",

Think of it more as along the lines of Black Studies, Latin American Studies, East Asian Studies, & language majors. It combines elements of literature, history, and sociology with a specific focus that I am interested in learning a lot more about. Typically people with these majors plan on using their degree the same way that WGS majors do. It's a niche field with niche applications, but its niche applications are exactly what I want to be involved in as an adult career. Totally open to follow-up questions if you have any.",

I don\u2019t know a woman who has not been talked down to or harassed at work. \u201cPro Islamic and anti Israel\u201d are you serious? My Muslim friends who have been constantly discriminated against by professors would disagree.\n\nThe Middle East is not a fucking monolith, people there are not the same as their governments, women in the Middle East and everywhere are actively fighting against oppression, Islam is not unique in its treatment of women, patriarchy is omnipresent, and Muslim and Middle Eastern women have agency and don\u2019t need to be saved by anyone.\n\nAnd you still haven\u2019t addressed my point about Christianity. It\u2019s literally white Christian men in Congress who are trying to destroy womens rights in the United States. What about that? (and I used to be a Christian btw) \n\nFor further reading I suggest \u201cDo Muslim Women Need Saving?\u201d By Lila Abu-Lughod and \u201cOrientalism\u201d by Edward Said. Go into reading their work with an open mind and heart. It\u2019s fantastic and thought provoking. The work is already out there so I don\u2019t need to discuss this with you any further. Enjoy.",

We were made differently.  Women have different skills, so we are in partnership with men on this earth.  Even an evolutionary, scientific view point will recognize the differences.  Of course, there are exceptions.  Debora was one of the first judges of Israel.  I\u2019m sure many woman are treated well and with respect in the Middle East.

If you want people who have left the faith to return then you shouldn't talk to them in this condescending way. It only causes further resentment. Do something more productive like helping the poor and sick instead of evangelizing. That was part of why I left the faith; the Christians I knew were more interested in recruiting people to the faith than in actually helping people, they would intimidate people into becoming Christians by threatening them with the idea of hell and they resented the poor. I know not all Christians are like that but that's not the only reason I left, I simply cannot believe in a God that tortures people who do not worship him forever and claims to \"love\" them. You see it differently, but that's my view of it.\n\nAs for gender equality, gender itself is a man made construct, so ... And I'm a gay woman, so I don't subscribe to traditional ideas of women and men being created as partners on the Earth - at least, not in a sexual or romantic way.\n\nI respect all religions until you shove it down my throat, any time someone tries to get me to \"come back\" to Christianity I move further and further away (not like I was going back anyway). I've been much happier since I left the faith, and my mental health is my priority. I'm glad you have found peace and purpose in your faith, but it is just not my thing. Please respect the choice of myself and other ex-Christians and leave us alone.",

Forensic toxicology is more chemistry based, like how in chemistry labs we would try to find out what the 'unknown powder/liquid' is. There are other fields and specialisations as well. \n\nI did an internship doing rounds between the different fields earlier this year.

Plus, STEM workers may make more $ on *average*, but there are still solid-paying liberal arts careers too, just fewer. That on top of the fact that more people who don't really know what they're doing in college/for a career go for liberal arts degrees than STEM degrees, likely skewing general data in the scope of people pursuing their degrees with intent.\n\nTl;dr Broad generalizations really make little sense imo",

If you like playing music - play music!\n\nBut there is 1 major that I'll never respect -> Business Administration - fuck that.\n\nJust my two cents.",

These days that\u2019s what most people care about because of the cost and the fears of paying for student loans. A business degree isn\u2019t always going to get you a job but in some areas corporate business is the only way to get hired. Lots of artists etc I know have chosen to go into business or even work for banks because it feeds them at the end of the day.",

That's super helpful and supportive.\n\n(My favorite is being able to explain to them what it is and be like \"I take pictures of decomposing bodies\" bc my school has a body farm.)\n\nI think some people think of anthropology as one of those \"SJW waste-of-money degrees\" which it's NOT. We talk a lot about human rights and humanity in the classroom but I'm also focused on the forensic part so I'm climbing through leaves and around trees to put donor bodies in our decomp facility and come back to document scavenging activity and studying skeletons in the lab.\n\nIt'd be great if people who have no knowledge of our fields would just say \"oh that's cool, tell me about it\" and save us from their opinions on our lives.",

Teaching has very little to do with how easy the material itself is and everything to do with *actually being able to effectively educate a student*. There are so many different things you need to understand in order to be a good teacher, which is why we spend years doing ed classes, curriculum and instruction classes, and student teaching. I guarantee if education became a 1-year program and didn\u2019t require a college degree, our schools would be extremely ineffective. It\u2019s very obvious to me that you know little about education and are pulling these ideas out of your ass based on your impression of what teaching is.",

I'd also say it depends on the school and the cost. If your at a low cost/community college then yeah that's fine, your not spending much. But if your at an expensive school that's just straight up stupid. Your putting yourself in debt for what?  (It's even worse if you are having your parents take on the debt for you)\n\nYour putting yourself in debt to do what you love? No career is worth a life of debt. College isnt to 'follow what you love,' rather its a physical transaction of funds for training and a piece of paper. There is nothing magical about it. It's digging a 100k hole for the purposes of sitting in a cubicle for 50k a year. I can think of a lot more efficient ways of doing that...\n\nPeople criticize such decisions because they are thinking of the stereotypical millennial/gen-z that goes to college for something with no marketable skills, subsequently doesnt get a job with that degree, and then complains that college is too much and that government should pay for it.\n\nAgain, not saying that's you. There are a ton of qualifications that could make this whole strawman an invalid description of you. I dont know you. But I am trying to help you understand what they are thinking when they say that to you. It's not all them just trying to stroke their ego by putting you down. They're are thinking you fit a stereotype and then challenging you to see if you fit it. It's more a curiosity, at least in regards to my purposes of this comment, as to whether or not this stereotype can unironically exist.",

Education is extremely academically rigorous and research heavy but is often trivialized in society and by other research fields.\n\nEdit: OP I just want to say that I've received many of these comments as well as an educator and echo your exhaustion at being seen as less than or trivial compared to other majors. \n\nThere's the common phrase \"those that can't do, teach\" and while many may not think it entirely, the message is definitely ingrained in American society, most prominently in the woeful lack of funding and incentive for passionate educators to be paid appropriately for the level of education required to be a great teacher. It's difficult to be an educator because America is basically exploiting your passion for education and saying \"your love of teaching should be enough.\" Not to mention the guilt tripping some school sites do to get you to pay for your own supplies for students. \n\nI'm there with you OP. I hope you find solace in other education majors who take primary, secondary, and higher education seriously as the active, vibrant, and rigorous research field it is.",

You not only have to teach, you have to inspire, have patience, and many times you may even serve as a role model to who you are teaching. Teaching is so important and yet many take it for granted or even worse, make fun of it. We wouldn't have doctors or lawyers or engineers if we didn't have teachers leading the way.",

From what I\u2019ve seen, many people consider it to be morally noble *because* of the high difficulty to low pay ratio. I see how all the other points were somewhat demeaning to the major and I\u2019m sorry education majors face those, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s generally happening for these two arguments.

                  "text": "No I don't disagree. To clarify the issue I'd like to highlight the statement that \"many people consider it to be morally noble because of the high difficulty and low pay ratio.\" This is the best case scenario and I'd like to talk a little bit about how even this best case is problematic. In trying to advocate for new teachers and generate interest in the field, the very real knowledge that this is a noble profession with a high difficulty and low pay ratio sends a message to prospective educators that to be a teacher you have to be willing to sacrifice. That's not a new concept and certainly other professions have an ingrained sense of sacrifice as well, but the messages teachers hear are that they are so brave and noble for making that sacrifice and that message has become so ingrained in the 'positive' social perception of teaching, that teacher's devotion to the cause is constantly being taken advantage of and the sacrifices demanded of them being increased. \n\nThe most important advice I've been given as a junior educator entering the field is to stand my ground and know my own worth. I have seen and heard from other educators who are ask for resources they don't have from their school site or their district and are told to find creative solutions and even pushed to use some of their own money to help enrich the learning of their students. This is a toxic norm in the education system born of that idea of self-sacrifice for the betterment of our students. Of course our student's educational welfare is the top priority, but the continual financial exploitation using the passion of educators only leads to higher teacher burnout and a decline in that passion. \n\nImagine for a moment being in data analysis for a big company. Your passion for this job is immense and your knowledge of the field vast. The company gives you a decent salary, but says \"please analyze this data\" without providing you the licenses for the programs you need. Instead they ask you to purchase any licenses you need for programs to analyze the data and for programs you need to develop A.I. that track and predict the data out of pocket. That is unacceptable and you'd probably leave the job. \n\nThe main difference between the scenario above and education is a privatized vs. government ran workplace. In public education we have to rely on the funding of federal,state, and local government in order to fun salaries, programs, and student resources. And if these systems ask us to pay out of pocket for resources that peers in private education or higher resourced schools have innately there's three options. \n\nOne, like in the data analysis job, we can quit and go to a school with the resources available to make a difference. This happens a lot and leaves schools who don't have the resources to properly care for it's faculty and students with a drought of highly qualified teachers. \n\nThat's not to say that there aren't still highly qualified and incentive teachers at these school sites, but that these teachers are facing thr constant pressure of having to invent and invest personally in their classrooms. This is option two, where we stick it out and do our best in the school site using the tools our teacher preparation program have provided us and the tools the district and online peer learning communities have provided (within this whole subset of teacher aid there are vastly different rigors of programs, resources, and professional development that make this a huge equity issue). That pressure can lead to increased teacher burnout and a drain on that noble passion they began with. \n\nOr three, the fatigue finally becomes too much, and noble, passionate teachers leave the profession.",

It\u2019s clear that in any other story her and hamlet would get together, but because this is hamlet, Ophelia is forced to denounce the dude she loves and be a pawn against him by her father and brother. With the latter, a few have interpreted that Laertes has an incesteous attraction to her. And because either hamlet is going fucking crazy or he isn\u2019t giving enough cues that he\u2019s faking, so she also has to endure him sexually harassing her. And (again lit theory) Ophelia might be pregnant, which would defile her. \n\nOnce so polonius dies, Ophelia does go crazy, but she realizes the truth of the world now that her father isn\u2019t around to control her. There\u2019s a scene where she\u2019s giving everybody flowers for stuff like remembrance, such as Gertrude. The joke is that Ophelia is saying \u201cand here\u2019s one for you, you stupid slut! And one for you you crusty old man!\u201d Ophelia is a tragic character as well so she fits into the whole sub genre.",

If you\u2019re interested at all in linguistics you should 100% take an intro class because the stuff I\u2019ve learned in there is just fascinating. From there see if you could picture yourself taking the material you learned in the intro class and working with it in ever more complex ways for literally years to come.

(Well, at least according to the profs at my school lol)\n\nFor anyone in u/BRBarnard's situation, obviously look into whether your school's intro to ling is worth taking, but most undergrad ling classes don't require an intro to linguistics. I would personally take a class in a ling subject that seems interesting to me rather than the intro, just because I feel like two weeks' worth of (e.g.) phonology is way too short to give you an idea about the field. Even if the ling intro is required for the minor, I'd only do it after you're fairly confident that you're doing the minor unless your school's intro class has a good reputation, and even then I'd suggest doing a more specialized class first",

I believe your point is: Some people obtain an education that leads to a lower income job, and then they complain about the salary/govt instead of evaluating their own choices. \n\nI agree with that to a point, but it is odd to jump straight to thinking that \u201cdoing what you love\u201d= no money. I\u2019d recommend therapy considering you handle criticism by saying you\u2019re an engineer that makes six figures. It comes off like validating yourself by invalidating others, then boasting\u2014all to online people where there is no literal validation.",
