  "text": "My three friends and I have been discussing planning a trip somewhere for sometime, but we have no idea where to start. We're thinking around a week or so in January with a spend of $700 or less per person. Does anyone have any ideas that could be fun? We're all over 21 and are on the east coast (Boston area). We're trying to stick to places within the U.S./territories to avoid visa issues for the international friends. We're open to anything and have brainstormed a lot of various ideas but unsure of what to move forward with (Vegas, Orlando, sightseeing roadtrip, Airbnb retreat, cruise, etc.) Any ideas are appreciated!",

      "text": "The southwest is doable if you get a decent airfare deal.\n\nYou would not drive there with your own car, it would take too long and you would need to drive it back. You would fly into where you wanted to start the road trip, rent the car there, and return the car at the airport where your trip ended for a flight back home. You'll need to search flights using the one way or multicity option. Since it's a road trip you can be flexible on where you fly into or out of.\n\nAirbnb is good. You might mix in some economy hotels. For Vegas I would stay on the strip.\n\nWith the rental car it might bring you a bit over 700. I did something very similar and we were around 700 each for a 7 day trip before food and extra spending. Enterprise had the best deal for younger people. I *might* be able to get you a 5-10% discount code through friends if you end up needing a rental car and go with them, dm me if you do that.\n\nTravel inside the US on a per-day basis is generally much more expensive than international travel. The only reason this is doable on 700 is because you would be splitting the lodging and car costs four ways. If you were traveling with one friend or solo for over 5-6 days, it would be cheaper to go abroad.",
