  "title:": "in my first class essay, i accidentally plagiarized",
  "text": "okay so i'm a freshman and for our first essay i was making, it is about intuition. i am not a wiz at psychology and stuff, so a lot of my assignment is based on research by psychologists and stuff. i was trying to make sure i didn't plagiarize by using quotations and MLA linking where i got my info, but there was about 3 sentences i didn't use quotes for since i scrambled the words of research up to make sense in my view. i guess i didn't do a good enough job, and after my prof reviewed it (it wasn't a final grade) she told me that i plagiarized it and she couldn't trust me to finish reviewing the essay and i'd get a 0 for turning it in as is (fair enough). but literally everything else after that point was quoted and stuff, and now i feel like a loser and am scared of any consequences to my mistake. i didn't even once copy-paste anything to my essay. i just did a shitty job rewording my paraphrase. \n\ni went back and fixed my error, using quotes and using my own words a little better to make sure i didn't use words i don't even understand myself. am i beating myself up too much for my first essay? i'm afraid she'll tell me i didn't work on it enough or something when i was genuinely busting my ass to make a decent essay that i haven't done for 2 years.",

      "text": "Even with paraphrasing, you still have to have a citation. Did you do that? A tip I got in my class is if you use any information that requires specific knowledge not commonly known, you need to cite where you got the information. Like if you have a source talking about 90 percent of whatever thing does someone. You shouldn't include the specific 90 percent detail without citing your source, because you had to have gotten 90 percent from somewhere.",
