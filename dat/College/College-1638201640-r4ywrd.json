  "text": "Do you guys ever sit back and realize how blessed your life is\u00a0while there are people out there who are suffering, getting abused, human trafficking, killed, living in poor living conditions, and you just think that's crazy because you're living the best life while others aren't? So it's kind of bizarre when you hear about a person's experience in a documentary or whatever, because you think to yourself, \"How is that even possible?\" \nBut you aren't thinking in an entitled way, but a terrified/ panicked way? I don't know how to explain it.",
