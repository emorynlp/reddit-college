  "text": "Retaking a quiz for standard deviation tomorrow for a college math course. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not my strong suit in the past. I overthink the data and because this course is 100% virtual, the quizzes are also virtual and we have a very short time span to do the work before uploading it to the professor online in a portal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust venting. Am I the only one who isn't a huge fan of it?   \n\n\nDisclaimer: I'm 32 and after having worked with Finance for the last 12+ years, I've never had to use it so in my mind, I'm learning this to pass the quiz and class and then never thinking about it again. \\*shrug\\*\n\n\n**********\n\nEDIT: \n\nGUYS. I DID IT. \n\nThe first time I took the quiz and didn't do great I got a 7/15. \n\nToday I did soooo much better and just got the score. I got a 14/15 and it took my overall grade from a high B yo a low A. \n\nI worked so hard for this grade. It feels fucking fantastic to have closed out the semester with something like this that otherwise I had so much trouble with before.",

My area (being vague on purpose as I don't often talk about my specific work experience/environments on reddit) was in a different lane of finance than the traditional one that would use it a lot more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's mostly the short quiz times and the content was not fresh in my mind the day we took the original quiz. It had been a few weeks since we'd gone over it and we'd done a chunk of new unrelated content after initially \"learning\" it in the class, so shoving semi-remembered info in a tiny 20 minute quiz block for writing out all the work to upload and turn in bit me in the ass. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving had redone the work and understanding it better again the night before a retake I feel more confident this go around.",

For me, if I don't understand how to work it out, it's chaos. Luckily (see above comment) I have refreshed my memory on how it works against the question styles she's giving so I feel better about approaching it tomorrow.",
