I think that is impressive i'm for a high schooler, so I want to mention it on my application. Should I incorporate that into a me of my essays or should I refrain from talking about my money?",

      "text": "I think it would be great if worded correctly. Don't be like a rapper and say \"I've got racks on racks on racks\", but walk the admissions person through how you started it, what challenges you faced, how you overcame those challenges, and wrap it up with your results showing that you managed to start a successful business. On top of that, tie your ability to form a successful business into how you will succeed at the school you're applying to. Something like you're a go-getter, someone who rises to the challenge, etc.",
