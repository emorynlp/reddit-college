  "text": "So I am a freshman in college this year, and I hate it. I did not want to attend in the first place but my parents are making me. I am lacking so much motivation, I do my assignments but I have been procrastinating and I need motivation to get through this semester. I am so stumped and I want to just give up.",

      "text": "I was in same situation. What I did was never go to class unless it\u2019s mandatory. With my assignments, I do them the second they are published and I don\u2019t do anything else during that time. In 1 semester I maybe have 7-10 days where I actually do school work. My lowest grade was C and my highest A. People like to think you actually have to go to class, but if you just do your assignments and study well before exams, you never need to go to class. Only exception is if you\u2019re doing practical work, but that\u2019s usually mandatory.",
