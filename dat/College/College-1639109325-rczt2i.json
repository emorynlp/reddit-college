  "title:": "How much will 1 bad grade hurt my GPA?",
  "text": "I transferred this semester from a community college, which was my plan. That makes me a junior now at a school that operates on a different grading scale and also involves quality points in GPA calculations. If I have a 4.0 right now but am likely going to make an A- in one 3 credit class but possibly a B or even a C (I currently have no idea what grade I'm making) in another 3 credit, how much will that hurt my GPA overall? I took 17 credits and got A's in the rest. \n4 credit A, 1 credit A, 3 credit A, 3 credit A, 3 credit A. Then the questionable 3 credit A minus and 3 credit B or even C. \nI've never had trouble with my GPA dropping since I've never really struggled with my grades. I just want to be prepared for how bad it might be if I do end up with a C. I don't need any specifics, just something similar to how it might look. It's my first semester and I've found that the transition was harder than I thought to say the very least :/  also, I've always heard you can never regain a 4.0. But you can regain a 3.9, right?",
