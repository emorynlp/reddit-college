  "text": "As the summer is winding down and you are getting ready to leave home and go off to your college of choice (if you haven\u2019t already), this post is for you. \n\nLeaving for college is both a liberating and terrifying experience. You leave everything that you\u2019ve ever known to go to this place to peruse a better life for yourself. While there is much honor in doing this, there is no doubt that you feel scared to leave the comfort of your parents home and the life that you have become accustomed to. You will be leaving your parents and your home (for those of you not commuting), your friends, your pets, your room, etc. You go to this new place with no idea what to expect and not knowing many people. Many college students have gone through this. \n\nAs a sophomore, I will admit that I do not know everything that there is to no know about going away to college. However, I can say that I can offer pieces of advice. \n\nGoing away to college is a big deal. It is a major transitional period in your life. Your parents know this, your professors know this. That being said, in your freshman year, professors and school officials do tend to be more lenient toward freshman because they are adjusting to the new lifestyle of living away from home and on their own. \n\nOnce you move in to your new dorm, the reality of the situation will not begin to set in until your parents leave (If they helped you move in. I know that some kids drive themselves). Once they leave, take some time to unpack and organize your things. Then maybe take a walk around campus, either by yourself or with a roommate, to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and the layout of the campus. \n\nDon\u2019t try to join too many clubs or organizations because if you do what I did, you try to sign up for as many things as possible. Please take into consideration that you are acclimating to this new lifestyle and don\u2019t try to overwhelm yourself with unnecessary activities. You also need to make time to do everything, such as study and do your laundry. More power to those that can handle it all though.\n\nRemember to be respectful of your roommate. You will share a room and maybe a bathroom with this person for the whole year. It is better to be at a good understanding of each other\u2019s boundaries then to deal with the fallout from not doing so later. Also remember to set up those boundaries earlier. Your RAs will most likely encourage this. An RA told me something that I will never forget and its that you will not always be best friends with your roommate, sometimes you are just simply that; roommates. \n\nKeep your classes and classwork organized. You will save so much time not having to dig through piles of paper to find one assignment. Personally, I use separate binders for each class but that\u2019s just me. \n\nFigure out a good sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it. Don\u2019t wake up at staggered times and go to bed at staggered times. There were countless times that I would have an 12pm class as my first one that day and sleep until 11:30 and then not want to go to bed until 1 or 2 the following night before I had an 8am the next day. Sleep is more important than you think.\n\nAlways print things out in advance. You don\u2019t want printer problems to screw you over 15 minutes before you have to turn it in. Print it out ASAP to save yourself some stress. \n\nNever feel pressured into partying. If you want to go to a party, then by all means go. If it is not your thing, then don\u2019t go. Just make sure that it will not be an inconvenience to your schoolwork. It is okay to say no to going to a party. I know many, many people that made partying their first priority and they dropped out by the start of the second semester. It\u2019s important to have a good balance between fun and work. \n\nGo to class!! Just go. You don\u2019t want to miss one and be out of the loop and have no idea what\u2019s going on. If you have to miss one because you are sick or there are family issues going on, email your teacher or ask classmates to catch you up, maybe even bring you a copy of class work. You have unlimited resources to keep you caught up. \n\nIn regard to the above paragraph, you are allotted a certain amount of classes that you can miss before you fail. Do not abuse these because I guarantee you that there will come a day where you really wish that you had a freebie to use but you used them all in the first two months. Just keep a couple in the reserves and use them wisely. \n\nAnd last but not least, do what YOU want to do. Do what makes YOU happy and what you feel is best for yourself. Don\u2019t do things you don\u2019t want to do because your friends are doing them. Don\u2019t do something that you don\u2019t want to do because your parents are forcing you to. Do what makes YOU happy. And while you may feel pressured from all sides to do things that don\u2019t make you happy, in the end is that really a way to live your life? Constantly bending over backwards for something you don\u2019t like? Be yourself. Do what you love. Be happy. College only lasts for so long so enjoy the time that you have there. \n\nSincerely, \nYour neighborhood sophomore \n\nCU\u2019 22\n\nEdit: grammar & spellling",

      "text": "Also if you simply don\u2019t feel like joining clubs or extracurricular activities there is nothing wrong with you. Feel everything out first before you dive into things being afraid you won\u2019t make friends. There\u2019s plenty of time for socializing. Just make sure YOU are grounded and all good before you try to pour from an empty cup. Obviously if joining clubs is something you know you want to do, then by all means PLEASE do it if it makes you happy! \n\nBut for all you people out there who are like me (enneagram 5 btw), it\u2019s okay to not want to be involved in anything but your classes for a while. I joined my first extracurricular club/organization when I started the second semester of my sophomore year. It was in line with my major and what I wanted to do after college. I was the graphic design chair. \n\nTL:DR:\nDon\u2019t try to pour from an empty cup and do what the hell YOU want to do.",

There's a valuable skill called \"faking it.\"  Trust me, you will be doing that a lot with people you hate.  We are about to enter a recession - the job market is going to suck, incoming freshmen will need every advantage they can get.\n\nAlso, no matter what your major is, STEM, bio, computer science, MIS, pre-med, art, communication, woman's studies, farting - **dual major or minor in business and/or accounting**.  No matter what you do, knowing why money and finances do what they do will be a great skill to have.",

My personality didn't come into play because I didn't get the interview.  I was nothing but a piece of paper on a desk.  The trick was to get that piece of paper to stand out from the rest, a 4.0 GPA isn't going to do that but an endorsement from a frat brother absolutely will.  Every interview I *did* go on I aced.  I know this because companies that had deals with the university sent evaluations to the career dev office and I say my score(s).",

If you're a in dorm, don't go ham on all the fried and junk food that your buffet-style dorm diner offers. Make a salad for yourself every now and then, and drink plenty of water. Watch what you eat. If you cannot afford groceries, there are local pantries and churches near campus that usually offer free dinner and groceries. Check those out too!",

If you are an introvert like me, it would be easy to sit in your room and play video games and study.  Especially in the beginning of freshman year, people in the dorms will come by and randomly say \"want to go grab some food?\" or \"want to walk over to wherever?\"  Say yes.  Even if you aren't particularly hungry.  Even if you didn't really feel like walking to wherever.  You never know when you will connect with someone and make a life-long friend.  And if not, no harm done.  Those little invites will turn into \"we're doing whatever this weekend, want to go?\".   \n And, if you keep saying no to those little invites early on, sooner or later, the invites will stop coming.",

Don't trust what I see on social media, not everyone is as happy as they make it seem. If you catch yourself being jealous, I would recommend just taking a few days off social media. I took 2 months because seeing other people hang out with their friends and go to parties genuinely made me feel bad about myself. I realized the feeling was stupid because I got upset over some meaningless pictures. If you ever feel this way, seek help. Possibly talk to a close friend or go see a therapist. After 2 years of struggling, I'm so excited to be coming back next week to see a therapist for the first time. Also, try to not go into college with a relationship unless you feel happy that you've done what you wanted or \"explored\" or maybe don't want to explore. I know many students who were sophomores or juniors when they got engaged to their high school sweethearts. One of my cousins met someone in high school and they dated for 8 years. They broke it off for a little while just to see what else is out there and now they're back together and happily married. But I would still personally recommend not coming in with an SO. For me, this ruined my chances of forming close friendships with other freshmen I met. I was so focused on maintaining my long distance relationship, that it ruined me completely. But if you know they're your person, then do what makes you happy. Also, college IS NOT high school. If you're hanging out with a group and you see them doing something you're uncomfortable, or hear them say something rude or negative, you don't have to stay with them. You don't want toxic people around you. College is not meant to be dramatic or full of social groups. It's really where people come together to talk about what they love doing and share it with those they care about. If you don't like the behavior of a person or group, then leave. Also, as OP said, DON'T pile yourself more work from joining a lot of organizations. For something like Dance Marathon or Relay for Life, those are some of the largest organizations on campus and they require A LOT of effort like fundraising and advertising. If you're not into that sort of thing, then I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are willing to put effort in and want to meet a lot of people, those are great places to go. Join organizations that interest you, many times you aren't even able to be a part of too many because of conflicting schedules and all of that. So choose what you like most, maybe something you were similarly involved in, in high school. Anyway, do your best, college is expensive so put in your best effort. You want a career in the future, be ahead of the game and find out requirements beforehand, chances are most people don't even know them or pay attention until they need too. Come to your advising meetings prepared with classes you want to enroll in and any questions you may have.",

I do regret missing classes though so I cannot agree with OP enough DO YOUR BEST TO GO TO ALL YOUR CLASSES. Your education is what you're paying for, at the end of the day. That said, don't feel guilty or bad about having a social life!! It's all about balance.

College is a lot less structured and gives you more flexibility, but that is because they assume that by now you are a sort of functioning human being. If you come in with a mentality expecting a structured guide you by hand environment, you will be very frustrated very fast. Also if you abuse that flexibility due to too much lazyness and procrastination it probably won't end happy either. \n\n\nAs for socializing, again, you are not in high school, don't act like a stereotypical high school jock to people. Don't bring high school drama to college. Instead, be chill. Alnost everyone likes chill people in college. If there are people who are acting bad to you in college, avoid and/or ignore them. Unless you went to a really small college program, college usually has larger classrooms with more people in classes so it is much easier to avoid people than in high school.",

I'm finishing up one last semester here before transferring to a different university closer to home.",

Keep in mind that whatever you\u2019re studying you will use at work for at least fourty years, so it\u2019s important to have some interest in the subject you\u2019re studying and the research you do. \n\nAlso if you\u2019re lucky, you will at some point realize grades aren\u2019t everything. It\u2019s hard to believe this, especially if you\u2019re coming to college straight from high school! You\u2019re life has been about school since age 5. Try and meet some friends who only know you outside of class, that ways there\u2019s no competition over school things and the atmosphere with them is more relaxed. \n\nTry to branch out and try some new activities, and see who you are as a person without being around your family all the time. I\u2019m going to be 22 later this year and I\u2019m still learning a lot about myself, it\u2019s okay to like things that you knew nothing about on the first day of college, it\u2019s okay to have beliefs that differ from your family and your hometown. \n\nThe only person who has to live with you for the rest of your life is you, pleasing someone shouldn\u2019t be high on your priority list!",

      "text": "Dear Freshman:  Ask for help.  Take care of your mental health.  Make the tutoring dept your BFF.  No, you don't need to join every club on campus.  If you miss out on internships, go to a local worksource center (formally called unemployment office) and ask for help finding temp/entry level work in your intended major.  You don't need to drink and party ever night to have a good time.  If you have a learning disability, ask for help.  Advocate for yourself. Remember that sometimes, a class really really honestly will get the best of you.  Learn to cook.  I'm not talking 5 star high end restaurant here, but learn to cook basic foods like beef stroganof from scratch. Learn money management now.  Take a personal finance class.  Don't overspend.  If your group of friends is always dropping $50-$75 a night at a bar, and you can't afford to do that, and they can't/don't/won't understand you need cheaper fun, it's okay to ditch them and find a more understanding group to hang out with.  Any degree has the potential to be useless.  Yes, some degrees are worth more in the job market than others.  But in the same breath, just because your a marketing major doesn't mean you'll end up with a marketing job in the end.  You might end up as a tour guide at an art museum.  You might even end up majoring in history and ending up a mid level HR person.  And that's okay.",
