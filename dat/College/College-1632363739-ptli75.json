I feel myself getting a bit depressed and I wish I would\u2019ve chose another school to attend. Is there any possibility of me transferring to another UC or university at all?",

Thanks for your advice as well I appreciate it!",

              "text": "Yeah, so I also transferred. I transferred after completing my first year of uni. Your first step is to apply to the school you want to go to. On most school websites, if you search \u201ctransfer\u201d they\u2019ll give you step-by-step of the things you need to do in order to transfer. They may even provide a number for an advisor who can guide you with this. They\u2019ll help you figure out how your credits will transfer. Be sure to evaluate costs, programs, clubs, etc. that your potential new school would be offering. You can find these by exploring the school\u2019s website",

I\u2019ll definitely look into the university\u2019s website that I want to go to. I actually applied to the new uni I want to go to when I was transferring from CC but I was waitlisted there, so I wonder if I have a chance at getting in again. I\u2019ll definitely look into it soon. However, do you think I still need to finish this quarter/year at my university currently? \n\nAlso I did 2 and a half years at CC, and I\u2019m 60% done with my degree (I need to look at exact credits I need) but I still need quite I few classes left.",

Do you think you have 60 credits left? This is something you could find on the school\u2019s website or talk with an advisor about. Good luck! And btw, I transferred within my state, from one state college to another. Nothing too prestigious. I\u2019d also say finish up this semester then try to transfer by the next one. Of course, this depends on how long the application process takes.",

Yeah, even an advisor at your school could be helpful. They could help point you in the right direction. To get in touch with an advisor, I think you could call your prospective college\u2019s main phone number and asked to be transferred over to admissions. You could ask your question once transferred. It\u2019s a lot of researching and calling, but you got this! I hope all goes well. :)",
