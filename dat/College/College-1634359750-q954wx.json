  "title:": "Being Sad when visiting home",
  "text": "Every time I visit home I have to constantly fight back tears. Everything I see makes me feel like crying. Literally everything. Not figuratively everything, literally everything. It takes about a week of being home for this to go away, but it's really hard to deal with. I just visited for a day, and now that I'm back at school I can't shake it. I was going to spemd the weekend but I left early specifically because of this. I'm in my room at my appartment fighting the urge to cry my eyes out. Isn't visiting home supposed to be a happy thing - something that helps homesickness? I'm a third-year but this has been happening since I was a freshman. Is anyone else familiar?",
