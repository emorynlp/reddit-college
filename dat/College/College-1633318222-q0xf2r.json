  "text": "I\u2019m what is called a \u201cJunior 2\u201d at my college even though I technically should be a senior at this point. This is because I tried my hand at a major I wasn\u2019t ready for and ended up failing a semester because of it. Fast forward to the present, and I\u2019m stuck in a major I absolutely hate. Accounting. I find it extremely boring and it is a chore to try and maintain good grades. The only reason I\u2019m in the major is because my Mom thought it would be a good idea and forced me into it. \n\nMy real passion is science. Ever since middle school I have loved science and specifically physics. So naturally when I went to college, I majored in physics. Unfortunately I failed due to me being immature and going down the wrong path. Basically I had a little too much fun at school. Because of this I failed an entire semester which ruined my GPA and ruined the trust I had with my parents. I convinced them to let me continue with physics the next semester, but I got so paranoid the first week that I ended up listening to my Mom and changing to accounting.\n\nMy parents want me to have a stable income and a cookie cutter life. I understand this as they just want me to have a better life than they had and not have to worry about money. But as I get deeper into accounting I\u2019ve just been more and more depressed. I hate it so much and wish I would\u2019ve just buckled down and followed my dream of being a physicist instead. I\u2019m only 21 years old but I feel like my life is destined to be a boring 9 to 5 accounting job that makes me miserable. \n\nIs it too late for me? My current mindset is to finish the degree and go back to school for physics sometime later. Is this even plausible or worth it?",
