  "title:": "My GF and I gonna study in the UK for 1 year. Can you recommend some good stores where we can buy all the necessities?",
  "text": "Hello guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m here with some great news! A couple of weeks ago, our application for an Erasmus study program (student exchange) got approved. So, my GF and I gonna spend one year in the UK. We are going to one of the Universities in London. That\u2019s gonna be so cool! Besides, we both got approved by the number of applicants, and we are so thrilled that we are going there together. So, we gonna skip all this shit like long-distance relationships or breaking up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though we are not traveling there until the mid of September, we\u2019ve already started planning our trips. Hopefully, things will go well, and the pandemic won\u2019t cancel our plans. My GF got so excited that she made a massive list of things we would buy before our trip. While I\u2019m doing some research about the university and the fun stuff, we will do in London.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though we are both happy about this upcoming year, we have already started arguing about that. For instance, we\u2019ve decided that we will not stay on campus. We both want to live together and not live with random people in student dorms. I\u2019ve read on forums that there are students accommodations with rooms for couples, but I didn\u2019t find any of them. Well, I found one, but the lease agreement for the whole year is so fuckin expensive that none of our parents can afford this. Besides, someone recommended that I try Zoopla, similar to our Zillow platform with different apartments. So, we found a couple of nice flats close to our campus. They are not too expensive and look nice and tidy. Here is one of the options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5mdcjo2pb481.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad70d560eeb477008c90d99f2a491343113d2661\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the thing is that I\u2019ve read somewhere that those apartments basically have nothing there except for furniture. My GF wants to buy bedding sheets, towels, and dinnerware with cookware here in the US. She\u2019s afraid that we won\u2019t be able to find any stores there shortly, and she won\u2019t be able to take a shower straight after the arrival. I understand her, but I don\u2019t want to waste money on that. BTW, she even found a solution for that. She persuades me to buy [Monos travel](https://monos.com/) suitcases like they are lighter than other bags, and we can fit a lot of stuff there. But, I\u2019m not sure whether t worth spending money on them or not. We are both agreed that we are not wasting our money and saving for the trip. Besides, we need to buy only some helpful stuff. So, I kinda need your help with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, could you please suggest what is worth taking on a one-year trip or not? We\u2019ve never traveled that far for too long. So, I feel kinda lost there.",

      "text": "ya well first off congrats. Not to sound like a party pooper, but think it through seriously.\n\nWhat is the main purpose of your trip? Learning and future prospects or a year of vacation? Those are two different mindsets and even though many think it can be both.. I have not seen instances like this leading to good results in the long term. Couples end up spending way too much money and a lot less learning. Relationships usually suffer and go poof and it already sounds like you two are on different pages.\n\nMaybe it will be different in your case.  Cold hard facts as usual. Yes it will be expensive so if you are financially strapped, again think it through real good. Apartments are generally barebones and will cost quite a bit to simply \"move in\". If you can live minimalist lifestyle, you might be fine. But if you find yourself juggling with furniture, sheets and curtains, picky laundry stuff, expect to spend a good amount.\n\nagain, make sure you understand the purpose of your trip.\n\nTo answer your question. You can have some stuff mailed and take the basics with you. Lots of undergarments (they can be expensive to buy again). Bring some packed, long shelf life meals. You dont want to be spending too much on eating in the first few days. \n\nBring  some weatherproof clothing.  And yes, some basic school supplies as they could run you up a fortune if you have to buy it all again.",
