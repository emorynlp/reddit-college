  "text": "Well, I never thought this would happen but it did. As we all know, online courses have been a mess this semester. In particular my chemistry class has been hell. Our average test scores are 20%-30%. I usually get lower, and chemistry has never been my strong suit. \n\nSince this is reddit, im not going to lie. On our 3rd exam last week I was having trouble with a few questions. Our tests are technically open note, but I went to the one place that is usually off limits: chegg. I searched some questions and some people had clearly copied and pasted the exam questions to chegg, and received answers. To my credit I did look at the explanation of questions and figured out how the answer became to be, but ultimately I did see the answer and therefore put that answer into my exam. \n\nYesterday my professor sent an email about how people posted the exam questions on chegg and how my schools Dean Of Students would be contacting chegg to request who posted the questions AND who accessed the questions. He mentioned how the penalties will be lesser if those who cheated came forward on their own. So I did. \n\nBecause I came forward and its my first offense, my punishments include a 0 on the exam, have to take an online academic integrity course, and get an official report filed at the Dean of Students just to have it on record in case I offend again. The real part that sucks? I work within the Dean of students which makes this 10x more embarrassing. Im pretty sure nothing will happen to my employment, but there's still a worry in the back of my mind. \n\nI never thought about using chegg to be honest. All of my roommates use it even on exams and a lot of other people in my class cheated on this exam as well. Its so common I didn't think anything would happen. But it did and its my mistake and I take the consequences. \n\nBasically. I want this to be a warning. I've learned a huge lesson, and I deactivated my chegg account. Id rather get a C in the class vs getting suspended from my university. Even though my punishments can be seen as mild, it certainly wasn't worth it.\n\nEdit: there are people calling me dumb and an idiot in the comments because they believe my professor tricked us into confessing. I dont know exactly what to believe, because on cheggs policy they say they can and will give out extensive information on who accessed certain questions, meanwhile threads on r/professor say differently. The point is no matter if I was baited or not, I learned my lesson from looking at chegg and won't be doing it again. I find it takes my integrity to admit mistakes then try to get away with everything. Sometimes its just better to receive the necessary punishment and learn for the future.\n\nAlso, everyone is asking why on earth id use my real name on my account. I did so because I truly didn't start my chegg account to cheat, and when I looked at questions during the exam I wasn't even thinking about it because its so common to use chegg. Yes it would have been smarter to not use my name, but understand that I didn't start my chegg account with the direct attention to cheat.",

If you can still get a C in a class with a 0 on an exam you weren't doing that bad to begin with, but that's not the issue.  Learn from it and move on.  When you are a out in the real world in the future, you will probably think twice before attempting something like that again.  College is for learning and my guess is you learned.",

Other times, there are cases like this:\n\nLast year there was this assignment in my years' class (which I didn't take with them because issues) where something went wrong, and like 5 students, not even bed students, had trouble understanding the assignment material or something. so they did what every student does when they feel they can't ask the professor/ta/etc... went searching the internet for alternative answers.\n\nSomehow, even though they did the final assignment individually and I know at least one of them didn't actually copy their stuff from the net word by word, their essays ended up being similar enough the professor called them one by one into his office and basically interrogated them military style  about plagiarizing and copying off each other. But eventually he accepted their complains about *him* not being clear enough and that the works have similarities because.... well what do you expect when *you're* the one providing the same essay topics to everyone?\n\nYes, the professor is the one who assignment each student what their essay is gonna be about. The students didn't get to pick their topics. Yes, these topics were recycled - it's a class of like fucking over 50 people. OF COURSE some of the final works are gonna look the same! Not to mention the students had to it in groups, so like... I didn't hear the professor's side of it, but what gives??\n\nLike it was so ridiculous, to the point that if the some students even tired to just *help* one another, like beta-reading, fixing error, rephrasing, grammar, etc, they could get suspected for copying.\n\nI'm taking this course this year, with another class of students but the same professor. I'm gonna have a talk with my study partner later to warn him about this. Might as well warn the rest of his year, just in case.",

By putting artificial constraints on you (no collaboration, no book/online material, harsh time constraint), they encourage you to panic and do something like what OP did: access shady websites online in hopes of finding your exam question. They cause you to panic because they're worth so much too. With the harsh time constraint, you don't have time for rational thought or to think your decision over. At that point, the desperation sets in and you go scouring the internet for anything that can save you.\n\nExams would see less cheating if they were designed more like homework and/or if homework had more emphasis on the grade than exams do. A soft time constraint, active collaboration, being able to look up formulas and facts, etc. all really remove the necessity of cheating and give you many avenues to succeed. Homework tends to be more comprehensive than any exam too, which makes it more effective for learning. \n\nDesigned this way, the only real cheaters that would be left are the people that outsource their homework, but this system wouldn't penalize a panicking, but well-meaning student for a poor split-second decision to cheat.",

Especially when it comes to police they are a lot of times REQUIRED to give away your information. I had to read about it for a class, and it's actually terrifying.

But I honestly didn't think of it as cheating at the time because I didn't post the questions themselves but was just looking at what the tutors wrote. I admit the stupidity came when I didn't make the connection that in a professors eyes there is no difference and it was cheating either way. Dont know why people comment if they don't have anything constructive to say",

Why do you think is that?  Because while some people do use Chegg to cheat there is an awful lot more people who use Chegg to understand how to do the questions. You are a prof according to your user so you will surely know this. A lot of chem teachers teach you the concepts, and the basic processes but don't teach the students how to do the questions. There are legit people who thank me through the comments on chegg for teaching them how to use the ideal gas equation because no one bothered to tell them once that the units of the gas constant should match the units of everything else as well. I see a lot of questions about organic conversions, why is that? Because that takes practice and more importantly needs your teacher to tell you that you do \"this\" in \"that\" situation and how if you want to reduce something just use LiAlH4 and if you want to oxidize something just use KMnO4. While Chegg yes does have a drawback of cheaters, Chegg also has a very VERY big audience of students whose teachers simply don't give a fuck.",

                      "text": "For lockdown browser tests, a webcam is *required*, and not having one (or trying to uninstall drivers) will result in an invalid score. Any class that uses those browsers will state that in the syllabus, and also cite how cheap webcams are to buy (though it should be included in the tuition imo). Every lockdown browser that I've heard of thus far has VM detection, which is incredibly easy to implement, and practically impossible to circumvent because it deals with the entirety of the registry information, fake hardware information, and even sometimes down to determining they're being virtualized by running checks in the hardware itself. Even if you renamed all the registry entries, created new ones, and reprogrammed your VM software to *actually work* after doing so, then you won't be able to prevent hardware checks. So no, you cannot circumvent lockdown browsers with a VM or by trying to uninstall the drivers (I have no idea why you think uninstalling drivers would work to begin with).\n\nThat being said, I am not advocating for lockdown browsers even in the slightest. They are legitimately malware (and that VM detection I mentioned is actually directly copied from existing malware as well, so it's harder to analyze), and a gross violation of privacy, and sometimes even the law (having to show your driver's license or state ID, among other things). There are better solutions to combat cheating, such as requiring scanned images of your work, enforcing time limits that prevent cheating, not reusing test questions, having questions that have different parameters (like coefficients and basically anything else you can make different per person) for each individual, and designing tests well enough to still be challenging with open notes if you don't understand the concepts.\n\nEither way, using Chegg for test answers should not be a problem with a well designed test meant to be taken online.",

Despite many students complaining about it, Lockdown Browser and other test monitoring software (including the webcam monitors which, by the way, many teachers hate to use too) is still in use and I have yet to hear any successful lawsuits against its usage.\n\nEdit:\n\nForgot to mention - I know of one case where they knew the IP address of and even the apartment building that the computer that violated school policy accessed the internet from, and a potential culprit was narrowed down, but he claimed that it was not him and they couldn't punish him because they couldn't prove it was him at the computer (there were others in the apartment, some of whom were not students).\n\nSo even if they're reasonably sure it was you, they have to be certain.

A zero is a better outcome than what will happen to those who don't take the step you did. \n\nI've heard stories about how people cheated and could've gotten away with it if they hadn't caused a fuss about a simple zero. They fussed and utimately got expelled for cheating and possibly criminal charges brought up (they hacked a site to get the answers to a open book open person open pretty much anything except the internet test) all because they refused to take a zero for the test and that's it.\n\nSo in the end you were a lot smarter than most people.
