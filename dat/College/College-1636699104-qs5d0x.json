  "text": "Bit of a background: I am a Second Year CSE Major in one of the best Institutes in India. However, I have lost interest in the course that I am studying and have zero inclination to pursue it further. I am over a thousand kilometres from home, so discussing this with my parents right now is not an option. I don't even know what to do in life. I don't have many close friends here with whom I can discuss this. I request my fellow Redditors to help me.",

          "text": "There are not any professors that I am close to. I tried contacting the advisor through multiple channels, but no response. The issue is that the past 1.5 years have been completely online. Even though I am on campus, my lectures are still online and I have not met any of my professors till now. Also, there is not any major that I like that I am eligible to take. In fact, the other majors are much worse.",
