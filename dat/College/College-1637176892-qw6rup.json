  "text": "Hi guys! I was curious if any of you have thoughts on this. I have severe anxiety that, last semester, forced me to drop my classes and switch to online learning. \n\nI'm now going into the spring semester with hopefully one in person class and the rest online. I'm having a lot of anxiety about going in person. Thankfully I have a therapist who's willing to vouch for my need for accommodations, but I'm questioning whether or not it will actually be helpful.\n\nHas anyone been through this, or has successfully used this type of service? I can't decide if it's worth the effort and, I'm assuming, the decent amount of paperwork. I'd appreciate if someone shared their opinion or their experience. Thank you!",

Because you need to have a diagnosed with something to be enabled for accommodations.\n\nI have dyslexia and Speech disorder. All that I remember when I requested accommodation is that submit paperswork that I officially have those disabilities.  I believe if you have recent paperwork of your disabilities and disorders, you should have no trouble in receiving accommodations.\n\nEver since Covid 19. I have not requested accommodations because all of my issues were in person and all of my professors so far have be super giving in their how much time everybody's gets. \n\nUltimately it's up to you if you want to get accommodations. I would say if you can legitimately get them.  just get them",

I may just end up emailing the office and see what they say, haha.\n\nI'm glad you're doing a little better. It seems like it's worked pretty well for you, so that's definitely encouraging. You're right, there's no harm in at least asking. Thank you!",

If in person proctoring is required, you will have to do that. If you have presentations or participation of people require cameras on, you may not be able to get out of those either",

In the long run if I do qualify for help, at least I have that knowledge in my back pocket. Thank you! I've honestly just been needing some information on how it would practically work, so that helps.",

      "text": "It's worth it IMO, both to see what kind of help you can get, and so you have documentation in the case that your mental health interferes with your academic performance.\n\nWhen I did my accommodations, the process wasn't bad. My mental health provider had to do some paperwork, and then I had a bit, but not a lot. Then I met with someone at the office, and we basically talked about the challenges posed by my disability and various options based on that. It was so much easier than I expected! I dunno if that eases your worries, but it may help.\n\nAs far as whether they help, in my case they don't always help, but they've definitely made things a bit smoother than before. At times, I also feel they make faculty more willing to work with me as far as making adjustments. Profs obviously won't restructure an entire course, but I can usually work through things with them in office hours since they know that there are these established challenges to my education. So for that alone, I think I'm glad to have them.",

          "text": "Fantastic points. I hadn't really thought about it, but yeah, having documentation that I've already been struggling with something could make things easier in the case I ever have a serious issue and need to take time off, or something similar. Hopefully that doesn't happen but it's possible. \n\nThat's good. So far it looks like I (and my healthcare provider) send documents, and then I meet on zoom (thankfully, haha) with the person in charge. That sounds doable, and I'm glad to hear your experience wasn't stressful. \n\nYour guys' advice is helping me make this decision. If I get accommodations, at least I have the option of using them! Thank you.",

      "text": "Absolutely worth it. I have medical conditions that force me (an on campus student) to take online classes and getting accomodations has allowed me to get permission to register in the restricted online sections, as well as getting priority registration. And whatever accomodations you get for the actual classes can help out a ton on occasion too. I have anxiety + pain flare ups so extended time on exams has been a life-saver. Deadline extensions upon request could be another accomodation, I just let the professor know when I'm feeling unwell and I will get a few days extension. I don't use it often so as not to abuse it, only when I really can't do it.",

Right now I'm having that exact problem, as my advisor honestly isn't getting dibs on online classes which is making signing up difficult. It would be super cool if in the future I could hold just a lil priority, lol. \n\nYou have a great attitude about usage. I think I'd do the same thing, as honestly I'd probably feel guilty if I didn't use it sparingly (gotta love inner dialogue! ugh). I'm happy to hear it's helped you and that those accommodations are a possibility. Thanks so much for commenting, it's super helpful!",
