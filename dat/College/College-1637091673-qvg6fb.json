  "title:": "Being a commuter makes me miss virtual learning",
  "text": "Being in person again reminded me how shitty commuting really is, and its not even the commute that is the issue(I love the commute actually for podcasts), its the amount of time it takes, the 2 hours to school, and then the 15-20 min bus ride between classes. Pretty much every day I just come home to do my homework and study and go to bed, and depending on the day go to the gym. \n\n\nThe closest to socializing on campus I get is Japanese class, and even then my adjacent peers keep to themselves or speak with their friends in Chinese. \n\n\nI hated Zoom class before, but at least then I had more time in a day with the same level of social interaction.\n\n\nI feel stuck, virtual learning is not even an option anymore unless I transfer from my main campus to a cyber option, and if I did that the money I spent for the main campus to be on my degree will be in vain.",
