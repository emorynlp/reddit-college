  "text": "Hi guys, I'm currently attending a mediocre 4 year university as a CS major so I was thinking of transferring to one with a little more reputation since I heard that connections really help in CS. However, I would be able to graduate a semester or year earlier at my current uni since they accepted more of my transfer credits. Should I stay and complete my degree earlier or should I transfer to a more credible university?",
