  "text": " So to start off, this is the last class to complete my undergrad. My semester started late August and since then I have been absent twice. The first time was my own fault due to sleeping in. However, I did provide a good reason for the second absence. During my second absence the teacher was assigning groups for a semester long group project which would account for 30% of the final grade. Since I was absent I was not placed in a group and after continuously trying to explain to the teacher my reason for being absent they told me that they made the final decision not to place me in a group anymore. The syllabus already takes into consideration attendance as 10% of the grade and I would understand if I got docked in that area but a whole 30% for actual work? I asked during office hours if it was still possible for me to pass and they gave me a vague answer saying to double down on everything else. I don\u2019t know what they meant by that and they would not elaborate further. I tried asking if the grade cap for me would be 70% without the group project and then they began to mumble something about the 10% for attendance as well. I understand that attendance is important and that this could have been avoided had I shown up but I don\u2019t know what my options are anymore.",

      "text": "Faculty here.  Assuming that what you've written is the whole and unbiased story, it seems quite unusual to me that being absent on the day project groups were assigned means that you don't get to complete any of the project work and will get a zero for the project.\n\nIn general, I think undergrads run to the department chair to complain about stuff too frequently and for things that are too trivial, but in this case I think it would be warranted for you to do so.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the professor to provide some explanation as to why missing one day means you can't do any of the project, and the department chair will probably be able to facilitate you getting that explanation.  If the explanation turns out to be strange or unreasonable (which I think will be the case), then the department chair might be able to help you and the professor reach some compromise.\n\nGood luck.\n\nPS -\n>they made the final decision not to place me in a group anymore. \n\nIs it possible that the professor meant that you just have to do the whole project yourself (i.e., you are a team of one person) instead of working with a group of other people?  While I still would find that a bit strange, that would be much, much more reasonable than just declaring you can't do the project at all.",
