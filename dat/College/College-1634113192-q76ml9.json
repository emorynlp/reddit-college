  "text": "I am currently in the middle of my second semester of my second year of uni. I am miserable. I struggle a lot with anxiety and depression, but my dad don't believe in mental health stuff so I never got the help I needed to deal with my mental health issues. After my mom died my dad got back into our lives and he didn't allow us to cry or share anything about how we're feeling. I've reached my breaking point. I've tried committing su\u00efcide before but couldn't. And 2 days ago i was in a car accident (luckily nothing broken just a few bruises) but after that I am mentally f*cked. My dad was in a different town when it happened, when I finally got to see him today he just handed me the insurance papers. Didn't ask how I'm doing or you know \"I'm glad my daughter is still alive\". \n\nI want to take a break from uni. I have taken more modules than last semester since I failed a module, and it's too much. It feels like I'm drowning. I get panic attacks almost everyday and I throw up from the stress at night. I don't want to give up studying for good, I just want to get on a safe path again and get back a good lifestyle. I also just want to be happy again...\n\nI haven't spoken to my dad about it, but he's really not the type to understand stuff like this and he already paid for this semester, but I can't put myself through this anymore. \n\nI know I didn't really ask a question, but I just want to know if you have any advice. I feel so alone.",

      "text": "How many weeks of your semester do you have left? Have you tried reaching out to your uni counselors/mental health groups? It\u2019s usually free I\u2019ve never gone cuz I can\u2019t rn but I plan to, I think you can just book an appointment and go, your parents don\u2019t have to know. This is a temporary solution but it might present you with opportunities around what to do with your semesters or how to manage your mental health before having to deal directly with your dad. Hope this helps, you got this :)",
