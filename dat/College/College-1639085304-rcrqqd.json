They need to be confident that your total education meets the standards associated with their brand.  \n\n> will only make me take 1-5 classes with them to get the degree (none of this \"Transfer up to 90 credits\" nonsense), so I can finish in a semester.  \n\nMost universities have a minimum credit requirement for the number of credits you earn from them towards your degree.  \n\n\nThe short answer is probably Western Governor's University.  \n\nAlso, this probably belongs in /r/ApplyingToCollege",

      "text": "The first two? Likely not a problem.\n\nAfter that? Oh boy. The reason why gen ed courses don't typically transfer after that long is that the material changed, especially with CS. It changes almost daily with new tech, depending on the subfield, but it's assumed that once you're in the field, you'll be learning these new things in your everyday job. Non-related gen eds are to give you a broader view of the world so you can apply different concepts to your major. This will not happen within a semester.\n\nSome schools do count work experience. Let's say you've been working at a CS firm for 10 years without a bachelors, but you want to get a degree. You \\*may\\* be awarded credit based on that experience. You may also take aptitude tests to determine your knowledge and application of certain concepts, meaning you might be able to test out of classes.\n\nTL;DR You're looking for a unicorn school that doesn't exist, but you should definitely be able to find one that will help you achieve your goals without spending 4 years there.",
