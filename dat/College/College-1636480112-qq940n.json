      "text": "I should of graduated in 2020 (im glad I didnt seeing what happened that year) so now im graduating in 2021 with two degrees. I use to feel the same way but I realized it doesn\u2019t matter when you graduate it just matters that you do. In all honesty degrees dont prove jack shit unless you use them and some people have a hard time even figuring out how to use them. I would be more focused on if you have the experience before you graduate not on when your graduating. Plus its your time not someone else\u2019s, never focus on what others did only what you can do.",
