  "text": "While I was attending CCU for 4 years ,My college has charged me out of state when I was an in state resident. I lived in SC for 4+ years and graduated from a highschool from SC and after summer went to CCU. My sophomore year I noticed I was being charged out- of state when I\u2019ve been an SC resident. I thought it was a simple mistake and tried to talk to them( note: I put mailing address in Maryland because that is where my mother lived and for the summer I went there for an internship, but I did not live with my mother). I called and they only sent me 2 of 4 forms I was suppose to fill out to prove my residency for 2 years. I sent my Farthers ID as well as mine and other information to prove he was a legal resident for 11+ years. I feel I was conned because they never sent me the other 2 forms in past emails to complete and they kept saying to fill out same 2 forms they were sending me and they were correct every time. The more I was asking why I didn\u2019t get in-state after filling out the forms, the more they beat around the bush. Does anyone by any chance know if I can possibly get my money reimbursed without going the lawyer route ? Suing is my last resort.",

      "text": ">My sophomore year I noticed I was being charged out- of state when I\u2019ve been an SC resident.\n\nYou noticed that they started charging you for it this semester? Or has this been an issue in previous semesters too?\n\n>I feel I was conned because they never sent me the other 2 forms in past emails to complete and they kept saying to fill out same 2 forms they were sending me and they were correct every time. The more I was asking why I didn\u2019t get in-state after filling out the forms, the more they beat around the bush.\n\nThey are giving you the same work around you get with airlines and insurance, even though it seems rather odd for a *university* to be doing that to a *student*.\n\nCan you print out the two forms and mail them to the school (probably to the department that is in charge of the billing) via CERTIFIED letter (snail mail)? Also include copies of your residency proof and a statement asking for the billing to be corrected. Businesses take certified letters more seriously than emails because establishing a paper trail and receipt of message is the first step a lawyer would have told you to do. There should also be a letter with a statement of facts and your demand. If you want to add pressure, you can send a copy to the US Dept. of Education or another regulatory body and let the university know you did that. I can write a template for you if you'd like.\n\nYou'll probably be jerked around for months if you play along with their bureaucratic email process. Sending certified mail and making a complaint to whoever regulates the university are your two next steps if you want a fast resolution. These things will also make it a much easier process in court if it gets to that point, but let's assume the university will be responsible and correct it.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer, my experience comes from fighting with companies and the government as an individual.",

I didn\u2019t notice it until my the summer before junior year I faxed over the forms and they didn\u2019t reply back until fall semester and asked again what I was missing and they said proof of residency which didn\u2019t get into their semester until 2020 my last year . So basically after talking to them they couldn\u2019t refund me for the previous years at all. Even if I did my part on their end. They said when signing up everyone is considered out of state until proper paper work is shown and I sent that paper work to them and even more information like my own SC ID to show I was as resident of SC.",

Because for me if I was charged this it would be double what I was expecting to be billed.\n\nThey probably won't refund you retroactively if you paid the amount and didn't dispute it for such a long time. This was the summer before junior year, so you had waited two years and continued to pay what they were billing before disputing it?",

Apparently since I was a bridge student even though I completed the coastal application with my SC information it\u2019s not until I\u2019m a bridge student that they request proof of residency. I filled out the information through through the summer, but they had also lost information on  credits of the classes I took that semester before summer. Along with my farther moving into another neighborhood could have gotten everything mixed up.\n\n\nI now have a meeting with the Vice President on Friday so I hope this gets fixed !!!",

                      "text": "You should politely mention how you will be contacting the local news if you aren't given a date when it will be fixed by. Be assertive but toward the institution, not the person taking your complaint. You need to treat the individual like they are on your side, i.e. \"what do *we* need to do to fix this?\". That will let you attack the university without her feeling personally attacked. You need to manipulate them in a way where you can give demands without them being agitated or taking the demands personally because they will be much more resistant if they feel like they are being challenged, whereas they will work for you if you make them your partner.\n\nThe university might not technically be required to reimburse you but the court of public opinion won't care about technicalities. This would look pretty bad for them if it got circulated due to the power dynamic and ethical aspect.",
