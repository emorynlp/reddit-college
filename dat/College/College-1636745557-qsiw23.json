So, after meeting with the professor over my failed exam, she agreed dropping the course now was smart. That way, I would only incur a W (which doesn\u2019t effect gpa) and I could retake the class Spring, while still attending all the remaining lectures and doing problem sets. Best of a bad situation\n\nLook at your schools website if you\u2019re past the drop deadline. If not, DROP!",

But if it comes at the expense of other classes, a fail\u2019s a fail. So set aside time to finish all other class work, before you touch stuff from this class",
