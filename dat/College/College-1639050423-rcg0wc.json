      "text": "AA means nothing. AA in what? AA in english? AA in philosophy? \n\nAs someone with 5 associate degrees, they are both equally useless. The general studies one would probably be a bit better for transferring opportunities later on, but even then, not quite. Because to transfer to a specific program, say, business or engineering, you\u2019ll need to do the lower division pre-reqs to transfer for that program, something you won\u2019t do in an associate general studies program. \n\nThe useful associates are the ones that are immediately employable. Nursing, engineering, medical technician, etc. are all useful. A vast majority of associate degrees don\u2019t mean anything for job searches.",
