      "text": "You can do any combination of work up to 20 hours per week related to your study. After that you would need an H-1B visa or another that allowed you to work.\n\nThe option with less risk is to quit the university-provided OPT job and freelance if you can make more that way. You have make sure to document who you are working for as an independent contractor and the weekly hours. For compliance purposes, it should not be difficult but I would read up on it first.\n\nThe riskier option is going over the permitted weekly hours doing stuff unlikely to raise a red flag. As in you do stuff for students like painting for cash. You would technically not be in compliance with the Visa but it would be very unlikely anything would happen.\n\nIf you go over the 20 hours a week, the difference needs to be very casual work like independent tutoring, drawing, graphic design, etc. For individual students. It absolutely can't be anything at a workplace or where you provide services to a business, that would add more risk because they report a lot of stuff on their employees.",
