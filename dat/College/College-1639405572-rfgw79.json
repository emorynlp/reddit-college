  "text": "So under normal circumstances, most of my courses require a written or oral exam at the end after the semester has ended. The courses where a written exam is impossible or not ideal (e.g. translation or interpreting), are graded during the semester. \n\nThis semester, however, was absolute hell, as ALL of my profs decided to base their grades on group projects during the semester. \n\nWith 7 courses, I have: \n-\ttwo courses that base their grade off of 3  individual group presentations/papers each, \n-\tone course that required 2 group projects \n-\tand four courses that require one, big project or paper to be turned in on X-Mas. \n\nAnd I am fucking exhausted. I can understand that some amount of group work will be required and that due to covid profs have to change their plans, but 12 Group projects in 3 months is something I never want to ever do again. \n\nAt least two profs were kind enough to let me complete the assignements in their courses by myself, so I at least had to only deal with the headache of organisation with other people for 5 courses. \n\nBut still, I want to ask a question: JUST WHY? Group projects & papers are SO tedious to complete and I feel like it would have been faster for me to just do all these assignements on my own. \n\nBecause even if I\u2018m already almost finished with my BA and the typical unresponsive & procastinating group members have been weeded out at that point, it\u2018s still an organisational nightmare. \n\nI have never felt my grades be at the mercy of others in such an extent. \n\nHas anyone made a similar experience this semester? How do you deal with this?",
