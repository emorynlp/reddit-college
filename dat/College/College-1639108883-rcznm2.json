  "text": "Any advice that can help me or anyone in the same situation as mine would be greatly appreciated. I really want to declare a major before Winter 2022 but have absolutely no idea what career I want to pursue in life. I have had several meetings with my advisor but haven\u2019t gained much. If anyone who\u2019s been in my position before can tell me what helped them move past this obstacle I would love to hear it.",
