  "text": "I am a freshman in college, and I absolutely HATE my English class! All of it is asynchronous. We respond to forums in canvas and then the professor just assigns essays without meeting with us or clearly explaining what he wants. After we are done writing the first draft, he meets with us for just thirty minutes and tells us what we did wrong and not how we can fix our mistakes. I don't feel like I am learning anything. I am just constantly being evaluated through the essays. Also, the essay topics suck because he picks topics only he is interested in. I thought in college you read chapter books with a storyline, but in this class, so far, we have read only one heavily informational book about music. I just want to know if this is how English classes are in all colleges or if it is just my college that has the worst English class.",

And the prof can pick the readings they want for a comp class where you\u2019re focused on writing, not reading. Take a lit class if you want to read literature.",

I mean why can't he just meet with us through zoom every class? I have this class twice a week, and he won't even meet at those times. \n\nI know that in an English class you are supposed to be evaluated based on your essays, but I didn't know you were just assigned essays without any explanation from the instructor.",

I'd say 102 was better and there was more feedback and 1 on 1 professor time. I didn't need to do anything besides these two classes since I'm not an English major. It'll get better when you're done with gen eds.",
