Yes you can advantage it by putting money in certain places.\n\nGoing in, you should always plan for and expect no aid until you get something saying you have aid. Figure out what you can contribute to each kid's education per year and give them that number. They can shop around for the best deal and get an idea of what work or loans they need to prepare for to make the difference. They should not graduate with an unreasonable amount of loans if you are helping them out a bit and they cover most living expenses with part time work.",
