  "title:": "How much trouble could I be in if dyed my campus's fountain blood red for Halloween?",
  "text": "\\*\\*\\*Edit: At this point I doubt I'll be doing it, this is just for discussion sake now\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did my research ahead of time and settled on the method of using environmentally friendly red tracer dyes intended for storm sewers.  I tested it out using a small sample of water I pulled from the fountain and also tried putting a few shavings of chlorine tablet in afterwards and it became clear again!\n\nMy plan is to dye it very late the night before Halloween and chlorine it back after Halloween has ended, both attempts being covered up entirely to conceal my identity in the event that anyone happens to be awake and looking outside (wearing a mask isn't too odd to see on campus anyway) and there's no cameras around the fountain.  I'm just not entirely sure what I should expect as a response from the campus, if they'll shrug it off or if they'll want to find out who did it and expel them or something.  Idk if anyone here has witnesses similar pranks happen at their campus and how the reception is.\n\nI've kept this plan a secret aside from my GF and her close friend so chances of me getting caught are very slim.",

Dyeing the fountain and spraying fake blood on the steps did: 1) nothing to educate anyone about factory farming, 2) did nothing to stop farming, 3) forced some good, underpaid, overworked people to do unnecessary bullshit just so that a few vegans with too much time on their hands could feel like they were making a difference.",

What you should do is put some insoles in your shoes to make you taller and put a pebble in your shoe to so it changes the way you walk. Wear clothes that no one has ever seen you wear before. Have a plan of how you will leave the area too. By car? Bike? Etc.\n\nEdit: I would be too paranoid to do it myself but you do you",

Your prank is pretty innocent and well thought out to prevent harm from to anyone or to property, which is good, but that doesn't make it a good idea. \n\nThe more appropriate way to go about doing this is to take it up with the student group at your school that is in charge with holiday activities and get them to approve it and to go through the proper procedure of getting admin to approve it. \n\nLess fun than prank, sure, but you'll have your ass covered.",

No. If they had to do any of that, then OP should have to pay for it. And if this is cleaned up before anyone can see it, what\u2019s the point? And if it\u2019s left up long enough for students to see, administration will surely know about it soon after and then will have to address it before OP can go back to clean it. Also, saying \u201chopefully the dye doesn\u2019t stain anything\u201d really works more for the case to be made against doing this, not for it. You don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll stain the fountain, yet still think it would be a good idea to do. Doesn\u2019t make sense.",

And if you had read any more comments from the OP, you\u2019d know that they tested whether or not the dye would stain. That\u2019s actually why they chose that specific dye! I think OP has actually given this a lot of thought and it\u2019s super creative. \nAlso I never said it was a good idea LOL just that it\u2019s super fun and literally harmless :) but I was waiting for someone like you to comment, and I\u2019m just being devils advocate",

But yet you also say \u201cthey tested whether or not the dye would stain\u201d. Soooo are you sure it won\u2019t stain, or not? Which is actually the problem here. OP doesn\u2019t know for sure that nothing won\u2019t be damaged so why risk it. So you don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019ll cost a lot of money to clean up or fix. And tbh even if it wasn\u2019t expensive, why should the college have to pay anything at all for a prank? If OP damages something, they can pay for it. They\u2019re an adult, and they should take responsibility for it. I mean if they wanna risk it and do a stupid prank it\u2019s on them.

Though I do think you should call it that and the admin definitely has some kind of protocol for pranks. \n\nBut I would like to point out that colleges kids- even with the possibility of receiving a felony- tend to do things they could be arrested for. Such as owning a fake ID, underage drinking, supplying to a minor, smoking weed, and a whole lot more. So, i don't think vandalism will be the worst possible scenario on campus on halloween night.\n\nI'm not sure if the dye will stain or not, OP has made that discretion for themselves. However they did mention that the dye is eco safe, used in storm drains, was tested in a sample fountain water, and dissolves with the chlorine tablets. Tbh to me, this sounds like a well thought out plan that I'd be down to execute, but again OP's discretion lol.\n\nNow this is where our views may differ but I believe that college's are greedy and are stealing my money. But seriously, do you think that will be the worst \"prank\" occurring on halloween night? I don't know about your campus but literally yesterday I saw some drywall punched in and a pizza box inside of the wall. This is good clean fun compared to THAT kind of vandalism. If anything, pranks are an age old college tradition and a campus should encourage some harmless pranks,  maybe even at the expense of some fountain water.\n\nBut yes, we have been made aware of the risks and hopefully no one will be surprised of the consequences since this thread has really gone over the possibilities.",

Also, fountains are not made up of only one material. Further, you think some random rock you got is somehow a sufficient test for all that...?\n\nSo again, you tested longer term exposure on every piece of the fountain at the temperatures ranges it will experience at the exact concentration you will be using? Which also means measure the total volume of water in the fountain, including all things you cannot even see (pipes, pumps, filters, reservoirs etc.) factored in evaporation and replacement rates.\n\n> plus the product itself says it doesn't stain\n\nThat doesn't mean jack shit. Trusting the packaging. Lol. Thats a good one. It *might* not stain for the use cases they say you're supposed to use to for on the materials they tested it on, yes. That doesn't mean it can't on something else. \n\nThis is what literally everything that isn't retarded says 'test it on an on inconspicuous section before using' \n\n> I doubt factors like that would suddenly change it.\n\nYou don't know what any of the factors are in the first place, so its irrelevant if they 'changed'.\n\n\n> My main goal of this post was to gather secondhand experience of how much the average college cares about catching someone who does a similar scale prank.\n\nNo, colleges don't like people fucking with their property. Its not about the scale, its about the damage this behavior inevitably causes. So even if *yours* doesn't end up causing much, or any damage, they are still going to come down as hard as possible to deter anyone else, and make it clear the behavior is not ok.\n\nFundamentally, you're going to risk felony and/or criminal charges just to make some colored water for one day. Pretty sure you can find something with a better risk to reward ratio than that....",
