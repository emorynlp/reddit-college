  "text": "Maybe it's my medication, but it doesn't feel real. 4.5 years of college. A gigantic ride that left me a different person. Part of me wants to cry but I'm unable to. I'm happy that I came to my particular college and grew as a person, but I still feel grief over how the past two years of experience were stolen by the pandemic. I do plan to go for a Master's, but I have to work first. The thought of a Ph.D. in my 30s scares me. Or rather the thought of a PhD at all. Just wanted to share this.",
