  "text": "Hi everyone, I dropped out a few years ago from Hunter college in NYC.  I plan on returning to college for a Computer Science degree , and would like to get into a top 20 school.  Would it be best to start fresh at a community college or go back to Hunter? I only completed a semester worth of classes there, and in the very last semester I failed 3 classes.\n\nI read somewhere that top schools prioritize CC or 4 year college transfers because CC have no where else to go. So would my best option be community college?",

      "text": "You have almost no chance of transferring to a T20. The transfer acceptance rates for all are super low. The only real options are if one of the T20 is an in-state public, like if you're a CA student trying to get into UCLA or Berkeley, that is possible if you do well.\n\nSOME of the Ivies do take transfers... IIRC Cornell and Brown take a decent chunk(in the low 100s) transfers per year. So there is a chance, but it's very low. And as the other poster said, they will see your old transcript, which will make it next to impossible when they see a bunch of Fs at the end.\n\nI suggest going back to your old college. You can retake courses to replace the Fs, raise your GPA, and go to the T20 for your masters.",

You aren't restricted to taking it at the same school; you just need to make sure it is an equivalent course (which is easy for most subjects, especially during the first two years).\n\n> Also, read the post, he literally said he failed 3 classes the last semester.\n\nI'm on my phone and the formatting messed up so I missed that part; my bad.\n\n> Also, literally every single employment study on degree status vs lifetime earnings would disagree with you on that last point.\n\nAn MA/MS is not valuable for most fields. Hence \"most people.\" The earning potential does not stay in line with opportunity cost, lack of funding for terminal MA/MS programs, and lack of need for it for most professions.",
