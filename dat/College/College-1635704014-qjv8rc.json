I still don\u2019t even have any friends in college yet, so I had no plans whatsoever. Ik a lot of people say that the it\u2019s ok not to party and that lifestyle isn\u2019t for everyone, but I do at least want to experience it. And this weekend was THE weekend to party and have fun, and I missed it. How did y\u2019all\u2019s weekend go\u2026",

Uh, this was also the finale of our homecoming. I missed our game and missed our parade. I bought a sweet jacket out of the affair though. \n\nI cleaned up my dorm while studying too. Interesting isn't? That was just an excuse to procrastinate. \n\n Personally I don't mind not going out, sometimes. I *know* that type of wild partying/drinking crowd isn't for me, so I don't envy it (I do want to see what it's like) but sometimes I do wish I made more connections with people to do more simple stuff like photoshoots, or trick or treating, pumpkin patches, haunted houses, etc. \n\nWhile yes, you should learn how to enjoy your own company (so that you're not out here calling yourself a loser), I do sympathize with you, and I hope things get better for you.\n\n But you know, try doing things for yourself before judging yourself so harshly based on some imaginary expectations. Like next year if you're still alone, get your costume on and go to any general admissions party. Or do your own photos, or do whatever you want to do. \n\nIt's okay to be by yourself. It does *not* make you a loser. Wanna know what makes someone a loser? A negative and mean attitude towards others (or themselves, not including mental illness)\n\nLuckily you're still a freshman so you have a loooot of time in front of you to make great friends.",

College parties consist of dancing in a crowded space with a couple of friends and going home 2-3 hours later. What's more important is your GPA and if you've done internships or not. If you have a subpar GPA with no relevant work experience, then you would've been better off not getting the degree at all. College is an investment into your future and most people get too caught up into the social aspect. Then they wonder why they work at a fast food or coffee shop with a bachelors. I personally don't think wasting studying time is worth it because I've seen countless people in this situation upon graduation. I'd say focus more on the networking aspect of socializing, rather than just making friends",

      "text": "I\u2019m a college senior. Went to a community college for a \u201c3+1\u201d program, where I got 3 years there and 1 year at a public university with an hour-long commute. Had to do all of the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school year online, and, since the public university is an hour\u2019s commute both ways and I\u2019m too poor to live on campus, 2021-2022 is online as well. I\u2019m also dealing with stage V kidney failure and awaiting a transplant, and on top of this I\u2019m an engineering major (CS). So my weekend has consisted of homework when I could muster up the energy for it and sitting around feeling like shit for the rest of the the time. Safe to say, I never really got \u201cthe college experience.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t to throw a pity party for myself, but to basically say \u201ccount your blessings.\u201d It could always be worse. It\u2019s also to say that at the end of the day, \u201cthe college experience\u201d doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019ve been to parties unrelated to college with college-aged people. They suck. Whatever you think you\u2019re missing - drunk dancing all night, hookups with attractive women/men/whatever you\u2019re into, making life-long connections that will help you in your career down the road, etc. probably isn\u2019t gonna happen. My personal experience is people sitting around on their phone with their own friend groups that they came with and occasionally talking over some alcohol and/or weed. Which is perfectly fine, but it kind of defeats the purpose of a \u201cparty\u201d if you\u2019re not meeting new people. And if you don\u2019t or can\u2019t drink/smoke it sucks even more.\n\nWhenever you feel like a \u201closer\u201d for not going out and partying, just remember why you\u2019re in college in the first place. You\u2019re there because you wanted a career that a college degree will allow you to be in. So work on that first, and work on socializing when you have time. You\u2019re a freshman, you\u2019ll be fine.",
