  "text": "   Allow me to give you a bit of background info on myself, I am a sophomore in high school currently and want to get into politics when I\u2019m older, I may become a political scientist but i am currently in my \u201cgrowth stages\u201d and I am still trying to figure that out. \n\n  I am privileged enough to have my tuition in college entirely paid for. \n\nShould I start looking into this degree? Is it worth it?",

      "text": "it really just depends on what you plan on doing with it and what you\u2019re willing to do during your time in school. poli sci is a good investment if you want to go to law school or are planning on getting a master\u2019s in something more specific. contrary to popular belief, there are a lot of lucrative jobs you can get with a poli sci degree, it\u2019s just that they aren\u2019t what most people who major in poli sci are looking for. careers in consulting, campaign management, and a myriad of bureaucratic positions can be good options for poli sci majors. at my school, places like the NSA, CIA, FBI, the White House, and state and national congress come to our political science department specifically to recruit for internships and permanent positions pretty regularly (the CIA has already been here three times this year). i always recommend adding on a minor in a language or field that interests you so you can start developing a specialty. the reason a lot of people say a poli sci degree is useless is because truthfully, a lot of people enter thinking a career in politics is a career in high profile public office, so they don\u2019t focus on professional development nearly enough. \n\ni\u2019m also going to preemptively warn you about people who will tell you that any liberal arts degree is a waste of money. they have no idea what they are talking about. fields like engineering and computer science are becoming oversaturated after the big push for stem in the 2010s. as we increasingly move towards automation, liberal arts is going to be valuable. a liberal arts degree is also basically a degree in critical thinking/analysis. these are valuable skills no matter what you decide to do with your life. there\u2019s a reason the arts were reserved for the upper class for thousands of years and it\u2019s the same reason rich people continue to send their kids to private liberal arts colleges.",
