  "text": "5% of a classes final grade is based on the students sending surveys out to friends and family. This is for the professors personal research, and the results will only be briefly discussed, if at all. I thought this was illegal unless the class / learning was based off of the survey responses?",

      "text": "Personally, I would have picked r/askprofessors, but here goes:The prof has probably very carefully designed it so that it is both legal and ethical\n\nAll human research done at a north American university is governed by a research ethics board. They go by different names in different countries, but they exist. Part of these boards jobs is to review any research plan before it is done to make sure ethical guidelines are followed.\n\nIf this is actual research being done, then the students participating will have been told where to go to get answers to exactly this question. Some will have ignored it... but it was probably part of the syllabus or information given just before the start of participation.\nIf the prof is breaking institutional research board rules, then he puts all national level funding that the university gets from the government at risk. Duke had an issue like this about a decade ago. It was devestating to a lot of unrelated research programs. So the university does keep close tabs. \n\n***That said, any of the participants are fully within bounds to contact the research board and ask questions and get their questions answered completely.***\n\nSo, for example: say does research in science education under an research board approval. The activities analyzed in the project are mandatory classroom activities, however it is not mandatory for a student to consent to have their data analyzed for research purposes. Either way they still do the activity, however informed consent is obtained to include the student data.",
