  "text": "I just turned 21 today!!! I have already told my friends I don't want to go out to a bar and get shit faced but I do want to try some sort of alcoholic drink. I'm really worried about feeling drunk, since I have anxiety and think I might have a panic attack. What are some good drinks for people who are lightweights who just want a little taste of being drunk but not completely blacked out?",

You're going in knowing you're being responsible, so at most you will likely get tipsy. Tell the bartender as well that it's your 21st, and so prefer lower alcohol drinks. They will be cognizant of it (and might even give you something special since it's your birthday). \n\nI second the recommendation of hard cider, since it tastes the best (imo) while still being alcoholic. I would probably stick to a maximum of two until you can better feel how alcohol affects you, or just one if you don't really want to get that tipsy. Depending on how long you'll be at the bar, you could probably have another one.\n\nHappy birthday, and good luck \ud83c\udf82",

      "text": "Tips: \n1. Be hydrated before you drink any alcohol. You don\u2019t want to be drinking alcohol because you\u2019re thirsty, drink it sparingly for its effects. \n\n2. Order a glass of water with each alcoholic beverage you have. It\u2019s a lot harder to over do it when you also sip water all night. \n\n3. There\u2019s a lag time between when you take a shot or have a drink and when you feel it\u2019s effects. So wait a while between drinks and see how you feel. \n\n4. The first part of your brain to go when you\u2019re inebriated is your ability to self monitor. So you aren\u2019t going to accurately assess how intoxicated you are as the night progresses. Because of this, it\u2019s best to give yourself and your waitress an upper limit. Say three drinks or whatever you choose, for the entire night. Stick to it. \n\n5. Eat. Eat before hand and nibble throughout the night. \n\n6. Only drink with people who aren\u2019t going to push you into getting shwasted. If you don\u2019t know whether or not your company is going to encourage you to over do it, then only have a drink or two and see how they respond. Now you know what to expect from those people in the future. \n\n6. Ask for cocktails or highballs. Only get singles, ask for them to be in a large glass with no ice. It\u2019ll take you longer to finish them so it\u2019s less likely they will go to your head. \n\n7. Remember that you\u2019re drinking to feel a warm, light relaxed feeling. Not like you can\u2019t control your body and words. \n\nI hope you have a fun night and remember it all the next morning. \u2764\ufe0f",

I'm also a huge lightweight, but the first time I drank with friends we ate a shit ton of pizza, brownies, chips, etc. We drank red wine and vodka and I got drunk very slowly and was able to notice how I was being affected. The second time we started earlier and didn't eat anything beforehand, I went from sober to black out drunk before I could blink \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo basically, fill your stomach with carb heavy food beforehand and drink slowly, alternating with water. If you're sitting, get up once in a while to check your balance.\n\nLastly, I know we've all heard about the dangers of alcohol our entire lives, but I promise you it isn't as scary as it seems. Even if you're 90 pounds and drinking on an empty stomach, ONE drink is going to get you tipsy at best. Have a great 21st!",
