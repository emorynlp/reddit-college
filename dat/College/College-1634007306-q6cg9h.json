  "text": "This may just be me but I parents love the school I currently attending to the point where they are talking about sending my sister there. However I am not enjoying it. I don\u2019t know how to tell them because I usually bite the bullet with things, but this is like major so I have to eventually. This might seem stupid but I feel like they will get mad or something idk.",

      "text": "Frame it with action \u201cI know you have been excited for me to go to X university, but it doesn\u2019t feel like the right fit. I\u2019ve applied to and been accepted at Y university. They have a, b, c that offers me more opportunities. It does/does not affect my graduation date and is more/less expensive than X university. (If more show that you\u2019re willing to help or take loans to pay for it).\n\nIt\u2019s a big decision, but when it\u2019s presented as a rational adult decision, it will all be okay. \n\nAlso if they object, don\u2019t argue. Listen and tell them you\u2019ll think about what they\u2019ve said and give them a decision in x amount of time.\n\nEdit: missing parenthesis",
