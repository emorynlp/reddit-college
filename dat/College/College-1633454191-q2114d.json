  "title:": "Calculus II or Physics I for the spring semester?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a current sophomore at a University who is about to select courses for this spring in two weeks. I was thinking of taking Physics I (Calc based) and Calculus II but unfortunately they are both only offered during the same time slot, so I will have to pick one or the other. I am leaning towards taking Physics I next semester and taking Calc II next fall, giving me time to strengthen my Calc knowledge before heading into II (which I hear is very challenging). Do you think this is a good course of action? Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "Calc 2 in my opinion would be better.\n\nI\u2019m currently taking Calc 2 right now and it is heavy on integrals. You still have to retain all your derivates and trig functions so if you take time off it will become harder to remember them later on. When I took physics in HS, Calc knowledge only helped a little. You don\u2019t really need prior knowledge for physics as it\u2019s all new equations and logic. My rule of thumb for college that I\u2019m trying to stick to is to finish what you started as fast as you can. You already did Calc 1, I think it would be better to finish it out up to Calc 3 in succession ( if you need to go up to 3) so you don\u2019t forget. That\u2019s just my opinion. I\u2019m halfway through Calc 2 now and it\u2019s all built from knowledge from Calc 1. Nothing goes away in it.",
