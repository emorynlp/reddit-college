      "text": "If I were in this predicament, I know I wouldn't want to stop what I'm doing, get ready, and make an effort to be on time for this class three days per week when I can do such for one day per week instead. That's even worse to do three days per week if you're a commuter in a high-traffic area.\n\nProbably the only reason I'd go for the three days per week option over the other is if I had trouble focusing that was so significant to the point my grade in the class would suffer tremendously as a result. I've been in hours-long classes, and I know it can get restless, but there can be a difference between a long class being frustrating versus unconducive to learning.",

If you know you will do fairly well then go for the 3 hour class but if you will struggle a bit then choose the 3 day option. \n\nEven if you just suck at staying awake during boring classes do the 3 day one, I used to fall asleep constantly in my psychology class and I was not the only one \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but good luck to whatever you do!",
