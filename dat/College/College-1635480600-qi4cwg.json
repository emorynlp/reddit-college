  "title:": "Advice to get out of blanket residence hall damage charge?",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nSo recently some idiot(s) in my residence hall damaged the wall in one of our lounges and the lack of video surveillance makes it impossible to determine who did it. Because of this, residential life has issued a blanket charge for all residents of my building. We haven\u2019t received additional information on the charge yet (i.e. how/where to pay, when to pay by, how much). However, I know that I am not at fault and I don\u2019t even use the lounges in my building for more than a couple of minutes at a time (only to use the sink or microwave). I have extreme social anxiety which is a strong reason why I don\u2019t use the lounges and I certainly do not break things. Are there any tips for what I can say to request an exemption from the charge? I spoke to the student accessibility office and they can\u2019t do anything, but suggested that I speak to the residence director.\n\nIf the residence director refuses to exempt me from the charge, if we pay by credit or debit, would I be able to have the card company claw the money back on grounds it was charged fraudulently or in bad faith, and if the school notices, would they go after me? (My guess is that the charge will be around $3-5; if they charge the full cost of a wall repair for each student instead of dividing the cost among all of us, they\u2019d be in violation of their own policies and I would absolutely ask my parents to get a lawyer involved).\n\nFor the future, would it be possible to get a doctor\u2019s note testifying that is extremely unlikely I would be at fault for incidents like these to protect me against future charges? If I get one soon, would it be able to retroactively protect me against recent charges?",

It's also probably written into whatever agreement you signed when you moved in.  Only way you're getting out if it is if they find out who did it.  Maybe everyone there could petition for them to install more cameras so it's less likely to happen again.",

      "text": "Former RA here. Unfortunately unless someone fesses up everyone gets charged. The repair needs to be paid. Only way to get out of it is to have someone fess up. Lots of people who didn\u2019t do the damage will have to pay, but if people could be exempt everyone would request this and then the bill wouldn\u2019t get paid. The cost of a lawyer getting invoked far outweighs the charge. Not to mention this is probably somewhere in a housing contract that you signed. This is customary protocol for shared dorm damage",
