  "text": "We were assigned to host a Webinar for our project and my classmate who's bragging about her achievements and grades while looking down on other people wrote her name on the certificate of attendees even though my name was their in the first place, claiming that she's the leader. I did the most on the PowerPoint, script and everything in the webinar preparation and even led my group members. All she did was brag and talk while doing no work or effort at all. \n\nI even acted as a mediator for her and my other classmate because they were fighting while rehearsing for the webinar.\n\nEven though I don't want her as a friend, I still keep her close because I don't want any drama but she's so conceited. Am I a pushover for tolerating this?",

      "text": "Are you a pushover? I'd say yea considering how it's affecting you. If you didn't care then I'd say you're apathetic to the situation. Additionally, if she really did nothing and you can get your group (plus they already don't like her) and bring evidence (texts, messages, etc) against her to your prof you can get her a fat 0. There's no reason for you to carry water for this person.",

You\u2019re an adult now, you do not have a responsibility to suffer fools. Your own crosses are going to be hard enough to carry - stop trying to carry other peoples.",
