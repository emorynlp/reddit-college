I\u2019m excited to be going in person but also terrified at the same time. I\u2019m so used to the online format idk how to take notes or stuff in person. I also haven\u2019t touched any lab equipment for chemistry, and I\u2019m jumping right into the deep end with orgo.",

As for note taking I would avoid using a laptop for typing notes in organic chemistry. A notebook and printer paper for drawing reactions and mechanisms is best.",

This is because organic chemistry is all about carbon and structure while gen chem is all about math and memorization. Something that is helpful to know from gen chem is electronegativity, polarity, and pka. Other than that really nothing much from gen chem",
