  "text": "Im sure as college students we are over the semester at this point and just want it to be over. \n\nIve been in a bad mood as of late and simply not caring about school. \n\nIm not failing any classes at this moment but if I dont do well on this assignment it can lower my grade to the point where I risk failing if I dont do well on the final in a couple of weeks.\n\nI have two essays due today...the shortest was just a 2 page book review which I did last night but the one due tonight is a research paper. It's 8 pages doubled space and requires a book that I only skimmed through...i did find a useful site where it gives me a summary of the chapters and tells me the page numbers so I'm just going to wing it with that. \n\nI'm not making any excuse for leaving this paper last minute but I'm just mentally tired, I haven't been sleeping, I'm tired all day, I cant focus anymore. I just want a nice vacation to clear up my mind.",

Just power through this for now, you can do this. By the time vacation comes around, you'll feel like you've earned it.\n\nDo whatever you can, submit whatever you've got on the paper by the deadline. If you don't do so well on the research paper, you'll at least get some credit for it which will be better than nothing at all. And if this class has a final, study for it to be able to push your grade up. You can do this!",
