Went for poli sci, figured out I hate politics and switched to anthropology. I\u2019m scared to join the workforce, I don\u2019t fee old enough even though I just turned 23. :/ I wanted to go abroad but with my credits it wouldn\u2019t be possible. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t change things for the world, I\u2019m so lucky to be here and so thankful, it feels like life is just moving so fast! Anyone else?",

Was going for computer science, found out I hated it and then changed to an arts degree. \n\nIt can be a bit scary buy if you really enjoy college and want to learn a bit more before joining the workforce, maybe look into a masters program. Most take about 1 or 2 years and it ensures you will make more money in the future. \n\nIn addition to this, you can also pick up a job on campus to help you gain more experience before graduation. Best of luck mate!",

          "text": "Hey, thanks friend! What art degree are you getting/got? Were you ever worried about all the people (especially on reddit) telling you how worthless your degree would be and that you wouldn\u2019t make any money? Ugh I had so many breakdowns before finalizing my switch. But I genuinely enjoy history & anthropology! My school encourages students to pursue degrees they like which is cool. But that nagging \u201cadult\u201d stuff gets to me sometimes.",
