  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman and attending my first semester, and I am living on campus in a state FAR away from home, and I think I need to withdraw from all my classes this semester due to some personal problems that happened, otherwise I would fail every class. I was just wondering if I do so, will I be kicked out? I\u2019d literally be homeless if that happened, any thoughts/advice would be very helpful! Thanks",

Some colleges are okay with you taking one semester off just because. Longer than that and you will probably have to fill out a Leave of Absence form.",
