  "text": "i recently sought out testing for ADD only last month and i feel like i\u2019m not gonna be able to get into many colleges at all and i feel like such a failure. i know it doesn\u2019t have to be the next thing in my life but i wanna go to become an architect and i feel like shit because i feel like i do have ADD but it\u2019s like i can finally fix myself and get things done and j be functioning fine but like what good is it now if i\u2019m applying to colleges in my senior year with a 3.3 gpa. it\u2019s really frustrating. one college i was looking at was cooper union but i didn\u2019t realize how selective it was and most people who are going towards architecture in general i feel have a significantly better gpa. i have decent extracurriculars but i\u2019ve done a lot of  work in them and i know i\u2019ll get one really good recommendation but is that any good? i j feel kinda dumb even tho i know i\u2019m not but i can\u2019t do much anymore to better my situation. can anyone offer any insight, especially if u were in a similar situation?",

      "text": "Person with ADHD here - it's going to be alright. I'm so glad that you were diagnosed early, so you can get the help/resources that you need right away!\n\nIf you feel that your GPA is too low, there are three ways you can go about this:\n\n\n1) Go to a community/tech college and work on an Associate's degree (preferably something that applies to Architecture). Focus on getting good grades here and your GPA from the community/tech college will help you get into the 4 year college of your dreams! This is also a great way to save on tuition at a 4 year college, as many accept transfer credits from community/tech colleges.\n\n\n2) See if the colleges you want to go to have an earned admissions program - these programs are designed to help you earn credits by taking electives that can be used towards a degree, while raising your GPA.\n\n\n3) Go for a major that has a lower GPA requirement, focus on raising your GPA, then change majors once you hit the requirement to apply for an Architecture program.\n\n\nYou got this!",

      "text": "There's plenty of opportunities to get where you want to be. I'm not extremely familiar with architecture educational progression, but if it's anything like most other collegiate programs, you have nothing to worry about. Plenty of good schools will take you with a 3.3. Apply to some state schools. You'll save 200k going the state school route vs private for a similar quality education (with a few exceptions).\n\nHigh school students have a tendency to idolize a career. A couple years into undergrad a lot of people swap majors or drop out because the work is much different than how they pictured it. Something to keep in mind. \n\nIt seems like you've created a clear picture of success and now you're disappointed you haven't achieved exactly that. Maybe as a high school student you don't have the clearest picture of what's going to make you happy or what success really is. Take a few steps back and evaluate how much you really know about the career you want to get into. \n\nIt might be best to take some time and realize your life isn't over and there are many paths to a fulfilling life. You sound very excited about your future, which is great, but you're putting this pressure on yourself and creating the anxiety. \n\nContinue to do your best academically and send out some back up applications. Give yourself time to calm down before you make any major life decisions. If you haven't done so yet, start networking with people in architecture and try to learn more about it.",

      "text": "I was diagnosed with adhd around the same age as you, so I get where you\u2019re coming from. A 3.3 can get you into most state universities. I live in California, so I\u2019ll use that state as an example: in Cali, there are around 25 state universities. A 3.3 would get you into about 20 of them. Now, UC\u2019s are a lot harder to get into. Let\u2019s say there are 10: you would probably get into 3 or 4. You have some options:\n\nA) go to a state university with a lower program but somewhere you could get into \n\nB) try some of your reach schools and see what happens\n\nC) go to a community college, get above a 3.5, and transfer to a selective school.\n\nHope this helps! And with ADD/ADHD it\u2019ll be ok. If you go to therapy and work on treatment, you can learn to live with it. I got my first 4.0 last semester with both OCD and ADHD\u2014it\u2019s possible, but you just gotta get the right help",

      "text": "Lmao dude, ADD ain't nothing but a Thang. I had it when I was younger, and most people outgrow it by the time they hit adulthood. Even IF you do have it, all they're gonna give you is Vyvance, or whatever they give out nowadays. Colleges don't care about that kinda stuff and unless you're actively telling people you're medicated for it, nobody would know. A 3.3 GPA isn't bad by any stretch, you'll be able to get into a lot of schools with that. If you want to go to the one school you mentioned, and they're that selective, go to a 2 year school and bust your tail, and reapply in two years to graduate. You got this!",
