  "text": "I was eligible to receive the $600 a week last year when the pandemic first started. I also received the extra $300 they provided this year. I submitted my FAFSA for the 2022-2023 year but I am worried that this will impact the amount of aid I receive. I filed for my tax return and submitted it in my form. My papers don't make a lot of money and we are above the poverty line by $200. We can't afford to pay for tuition out of pocket. Should I be worried?",
