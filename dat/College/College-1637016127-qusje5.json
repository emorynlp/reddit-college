      "text": "No, it wouldn\u2019t be weird. That is why the preferred name is there. At many universities, the preferred name will be used the one professors see or on blackboard/Canvas. \nI go by a nickname, and at my university they put the preferred name even in your university email. College is a time to start over, be comfortable with the name you use in your classes, the name people will call you. Use this as a way to make it so they know your choice of name.",
