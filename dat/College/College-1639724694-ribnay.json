  "text": "Hi everyone, I am currently a transfer at my current college, a \"second\" semester freshmen. I made the dean's list this semester and have been doing really well but I really want to transfer colleges. My current college isn't too bad or anything, I can't speak too much on it for reasons, but I am very unhappy there and wishing to transfer. My old college, the college I was at previously, I got assaulted on campus and ended up very suicidal. I had an incident on campus where I threatened to kill myself publicly and the school officials called an ambulance on me. The administration workers ended up talking to me about it probably about two months or so after the event. \n\nI ended up medically withdrawing the next semester. I was later readmitted back into the college but I could not afford it and I chose to transfer to a cheaper college where I had family attending. I am really unhappy there and it doesn't have my desired major and I have plans to transfer. However, while none of my credits from the first semester I did college transferred they followed me on my GPA and because of my poor GPA due to the assault and deep depression I had, I am unable to apply to certain schools with my intended major.\n\nI understand some schools have a thing called academic renewal and I am planning on writing to my old college seeing if they are willing to make an exception to do this or if I could meet in person with the dean to discuss other options. Only other option I could think of would be to retake the classes at the college but I can't afford it. Does anyone have any advice on how I should draft the letter? I'm not sure if I should mention the assault or not, I later came forward before I medically withdrew that I had been assaulted by another student. One teacher knows who it was but I refused to tell them until they promised me they wouldn't report the student.\n\nI just really need the help, please. My family has been no help with this and none of them want me to transfer but I am so miserable at my current college. I'm doing well in school but every other aspect of my life is suffering.",
