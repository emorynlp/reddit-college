  "text": "So I just got out of a presentation that I needed to pass in order to graduate. It went really really badly. I\u2019ve never done so bad on a presentation during my time here, but I was just so nervous that I flaked and BS\u2019d my way through it. I had originally chosen a topic that I was passionate about for it, but my advisor had me change it halfway through to something he was interested in. I\u2019m also pretty sure I just failed the last class I needed in order to graduate. I don\u2019t know what to do now. Much of my time at this school has been a bad experience and I basically continued it in order to please my family. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I tried my best in every thing I did. I was so excited and passionate about the major when I started. However, this school is just so negative and toxic that all hope and excitement that I had for my major has been pulled out of me. Every goal that I had going into here was squashed by my professors. Every friend I made either failed out or was told they weren\u2019t good enough to make it here. I\u2019m alone, I\u2019m angry, and I\u2019m tired. Not to mention mentally out of it. I even considered hurting myself just to get out of this project. I\u2019ve just been so blinded by all of these things that it\u2019s stopped me from succeeding. \nI want to start over somewhere new with the new passions that I have gained over my time here. I want to make new relationships with professors that care about the things I have to say. I don\u2019t want to be so goddamn introverted and intimidated by people that couldn\u2019t give two shits about me. I just wanna be happy and motivated again. I don\u2019t know what to do or where to go now from here, but all I know is that I need to get the fuck out of here.",

While I\u2019m not in college yet, I\u2019d suggest trying to email the professor and explaining your situation. There\u2019s a very slight chance that they agree to give you a second try, which, I think, sounds like a win.\n\nDon\u2019t lose hope. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get through whatever obstacle your facing right now. Good luck!! <3",
