  "text": "Question, so my roommate (whos gonna be a senior) needs a few more classes to graduate and one of them is physic. However, there seems to be only one lecture class availabe and they let priority student pick their classes first. This includes athletes and graduates. She didn't even get a chance to sign up. This pretty much ruins all her plans and will mess with her finacial aid if she has to take this class (which is only available in the fall) next year. Any advise on what she can do?",
