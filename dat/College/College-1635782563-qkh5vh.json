  "text": "I\u2019m a first year, I know we\u2019re only a couple months in but I keep going to club events and things but honestly nothing is really clicking. I just want to stop going at this point because even when I go I get too anxious and don\u2019t talk to people and half of the time I feel really stupid for even going afterwards. I really want friends since I have none. It\u2019s not even like I need a best friend or a tight friend group  or anything but I don\u2019t even have casual friends really, idk, it\u2019d just be nice to have SOMETHING but I\u2019m really tired of failing over and over again.\n\nI think I might just give up on making friends this semester and try again next semester but idk if that\u2019s backfire on me, cause I've also heard that it gets harder to make friends after freshman year. Honestly I'm worried I've already missed the boat. What should I do?",

So often it\u2019s easy to get lost and think about differences and anxiety when meeting people, but if you\u2019re not regularly forming relationships on campus something is wrong. Be sure to put yourself out there without being too pushy, don\u2019t be awkward in conversation and crack a joke occasionally.",
