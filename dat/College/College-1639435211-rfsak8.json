              "text": "An example of remediation my school offers include \u2018repeat-delete\u2019 where you retake the class for a new grade, and your old grade is removed from your transcript. Or petition for a re-evaluation from the professor on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grade scale. Essentially just programs to make up for it aside from probation, which you still likely will have to take part in.\n\nAll around no biggie though! Freshman year is an adjustment and I definitely had difficulties myself. Just gotta identify & work with/on your weaknesses from her on up.",

      "text": "Depends on your policies but typically academic probation kicks in when your overall GPA drops below a certain number (2.0 at my school). It's basically just a warning, a wake-up call that if you don't turn things around you could end up suspended for a semester. At my school if you're on probation and your *semester* GPA is below 2.0, you'll be suspended and have to sit out a semester.\n\nIf you fail a class but still have an overall GPA above your school's cutoff for probation, you just need to retake the class, that's all (if it's required). How repeats are handled also depends on your university's policy: I've seen a lot of folks here talk about grade replacement, but at my university *both grades* remain on your transcript and are factored into your GPA (like if you make an F the first time and a B the second time).",
