  "title:": "American Colleges are a Scam, even for STEM Degrees. Do not forget that college is a business. I will work as hard as I can so I can pay for or even CREATE a top-tier learning system for my future kids instead of sending them to college in America.",
  "text": "**TL;DR: American colleges prioritize anything else over teaching and do not run a tight ship.** \n\n**WARNING:** All the examples I give are from the university I went to, but I went to a highly acclaimed American school and I know many people who got a lot less from other \"better\" schools who paid a lot more than I did. It also goes without saying that all of these examples are much worse at most American \"party\" schools where they prioritize teaching and career prep even less, and I know a lot of people who went to these types of schools.\n\n**I know what you're thinking: \"This is some kid who didn't do well and didn't find a job so he is blaming his problems on something else.\" Actually, this is further from the truth.** \n\n**I graduated with an engineering degree with a high GPA and I easily got a good job in my field after graduation. I am satisfied with my life at this point.** I definitely learned a lot in college, but I can't help think that I could have learned a lot of this on my own without spending 10s of thousands of dollars or at least what I got out of college was not worth the price. Even with an academic scholarship for 50% off tuition, I still paid a ton of money. I was really funny to see that athletes got priority in an institution that was supposed to be about learning. I actually almost became a starter on one of our best varsity teams since I was recruited, but I figured it would be a waste of time since I don't want to spend 4 years playing sports instead of learning. Athletes had the same scholarship I did, but with a 0.5 point lower GPA requirement and with preferential treatment in course scheduling. I get that athletes need to get priority to schedule things around practices and games, but this just proves that American colleges prioritize sports over actual learning.\n\nI used to be a college advocate because people in my industry frequently told me that they prefer college graduates over self-taught people because in college you learn the meaning behind all the principles that you are taught and you could therefore be creative and extrapolate them to engineering new things. Despite this argument, I kept noticing that all I need from college are these key explanations, and professional instruction, which is what I got, but I still think the price I got them for is a rip-off. Some of the best professors I ever had agreed with me. In class they would say \"Tuition is ridiculously expensive and the price that you guys pay per hour to be here is unjustified so it's in your best interest to pay attention.\"\n\nI think that this is caused by colleges falling prey to chasing profits. **There is nothing wrong with chasing profits since it is a great incentive structure to make your product better, unless it causes your product to get worse...**\n\nAmerican colleges nowadays prioritize selling \"The College Experience\" over learning and being tough. They love to raise tuition so that they can pour millions into sports facilities, professors' research that sometimes isn't very useful, and random events that totally overpower the actual objective of being there: actually learning. I loved the \"College Experience.\" Partying and having fun with friends and going to events and being able to discipline myself as an adolescent to get my life together was great...but I can do all of that without paying tens of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately this has created a perverse incentive structure where student \"happiness\" is prioritized over learning. Colleges will get more student satisfaction and good reviews if they make their classes easy, super informal, and have the professors bow down to the students. American adolescents love this type of stuff since they are immature and have been sold this type of lifestyle. And I don't blame them. Why would you go to a school with hard classes and strict professors, when you can get the same degree from a school with a similar ranking/reputation with easy classes and pushover professors?\n\nI went to a pretty good engineering school, but I would not send my future children there. At least, I would not give the school any of my money. There was so much blatant cheating, professors that changed grading schemes and gave extreme curves because we were so lazy, and students would show up to class late and in pajamas just to play on their phone the whole time while their parents were paying dozens of their hard earned dollars per hour for their kids to be there. \n\nSo many of my classes were easy A's because the professors were basically afraid of upsetting the students. And I remember so many classmates prioritizing taking a ton of easy freshman-level classes as electives over actually practical ones just so that they could get their degree with no effort. I despised this. I thought \"You were blessed enough to be born in the U.S. into a middle-upper class family and have your parents pay for your degree and you have the audacity to sign up to learn nothing in these easy classes just so you can get the participation award.\" Each year we had a credit limit of 20 per semester and any credit amount over 12 credits was just charged as a one-time \"Full Time\" tuition, so someone taking 12 credits would pay the same as someone taking 20 credits. I made it a point to take 18-20 credits EVERY SEMESTER of my college years, except my last semester when I took 16 credits of Graduate-Level courses and focused on my job search. I was paying them money and I was going to get my money's work\n\nNot all bad classes had bad professors. Many of my professors were geniuses who had a lot of good stuff to say, but they were not held accountable for their class not being worth the money. I thought it was disgusting that these smart men and women had the worst organization skills that I have ever seen. We used the \"Canvas\" software that most schools use and these professors had no clue how to use it. They would also forget to upload essential material that they said they would, spent the entire semester grading assignments that were due in the first week of class, changed the rules of the course as they went, and were disorganized in general. I had a professor who never used slides or prepared material. This was a highly technical, mathematical, and logical class. He just had a list of topics to cover per lecture and he would actively write out the lesson as he went. His verbal explanations were better than any supplemental material and he taught us deep explanations as to why these mathematical structures operated as they did. The problem was that he wrote everything in a Google Doc in Arial font, including diagrams written on the fly in Google Drawings with a laptop trackpad . Thus, looking back on the notes was effectively useless. He also made new rules on the fly like \"pop quiz every week to encourage you guys to study\" that only happened twice before he forgot about it. He also barely wrote essential planning info down like test dates or test info. Now, you may think: \"OP, you are complaining about college being too easy, but get mad when the prof doesn't spoon feed you the info.\" I'm not mad that he didn't spoon feed the info and wrote everything during class, like how college used to be (which is cool). I am mad about his lack or organization and me spending much of my time dedicated to that class trying to guess what would happen next. I learned a lot of essential info from the two classes that I took with that professor, but they could have been perfect if his organizational skills weren't abysmal. He did have two very smart TAs but they were effectively useless. Why you may ask? Because we barely got homework. We got 4 very large homework assignments throughout the whole semester even though he promised 12+. This sounds like a simple class structure difference, but most college students don't learn well like that. The best classes had mandatory small and frequent assignments that led up to the large projects so that we would get constant practice and have a reason to got to the TAs for more info and help. But, when you make the homework assignment very infrequent (or make homework optional, as other classes did), you create an incentive structure where students will prioritize homework from other classes over your own. **Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with students being held accountable for motivating themselves to study often and put in work, but if you are charging obscene amounts of money you cannot ignore the basic psychological fact that adolescents are more likely to learn if you give them mandatory constant practice that is, each time, a little harder than their current abilities.**\n\nI did have a few great classes with great professors. ALL of my favorite classes involved the professor coming in on the first day and saying something along the lines of: **\"If you are not here to learn, get out so you don't disrupt my lecture. I know a lot more about the world than you do so do not even try the BS that most college students do when they refuse to do work or beg for better grades. I don't care what grade you get and if you fail, you fail, but I just care that you learn a lot.\"** I would pay good money to have my future children to take these classes. The professors cared and were not afraid to subordinate students' happiness to actually learning. They taught practical skills and were very aware that college was a rip off. \n\n**How to make College Classes Worth the Money:**\n\n1. **Make sure the info is relevant and taught well.**\n2. **Have constant practice with progressive overload via assignments and quizzes as well as frequent professor attention.**\n3. **Hold the professor accountable for not doing his/her job or being too disorganized**.\n4. **MAKE ASSIGNMENTS AND ATTENDANCE MANDATORY.** (It makes me sick to my stomach when a class has optional attendance and homework because only and idiot would believe that a bunch of 18-22 year-olds would prioritize that work over anything else).\n5. **Cut the inflated salaries of college administrators and PRIORITIZE learning from industry and research professionals over having fun for 4-5 years.** (We would get emails every day about what cool fun events are happening on campus, but barely any on essential info to get jobs and known paths to success via hard work. I don't care about the new $10 million rec center full of random things that the school just built. I am here to learn and set myself up for a great career.)\n6. **Don't let students run the show.** Teenagers and young adults are notoriously bad at discipline and everyone on Earth knows that college-aged young adults make impulsive and self-gratifying decisions while thinking about the short term. With this, you will greatly increase the chances of success of students.\n7. **If you are a student, think about whether you need to go to college right now.** Maybe it isn't the best idea to get a degree in philosophy right out of high school just to have fun and blame everyone except yourself when you aren't a millionaire in 4 years. Set yourself up financially by getting a more practical degree or entering the job force and ensure stability. **Once you are stable and happy with your life, go back and get that philosophy degree** so you can put in your effort since you're more mature and don't worry about becoming poor. **If you are passionate about the \"less practical\" or non-STEM subjects, they are totally worth studying in a professional context...just not right out of high school by someone who knows nothing about the world and has no stability in his/her life.**\n\nMy favorite class in college was a class outside of my major but it had an excellent professor, practical info, and great structure. The professor did not have the most advanced degrees like other professors did, but he DAMN well knew how to run a class. We had lectures during the week where he would present like a professional public speaker and teach us only the most relevant information. Then we would have assignments each week based on that week's lecture that were slightly more advanced than our current abilities so we were challenged, but in a way that made us want to struggle and put in effort. The content of each assignment was always very relevant and I maintain those skills to this day. He came in on Day 1 and laid out the grading scheme and said that if anyone disagreed or thinks they can manipulate him instead of putting in the work, they can walk out right then and there. He kept his promise. I failed several assignments because they were hard, but I DIDN'T care. I learned a ton of info from the class and he made it clear that the assignments were challenging and that since we had a week to do them and TAs as a resource, all grades were final. I almost forgot to mention the TAs. The only people he allowed to be TAs were former students who previously earned a 95+% in his course and he treated them very well, so they were incentivized to do a great job. **This man earned my money and my respect.**\n\nIt was really sad to see that the students that got high-paying jobs at FAANG (now MAANG) companies or high-level engineering positions had GPAs in the low 2.0 range. They had initiative, drive, skills, and the ability to delay self-gratification. **They were only there to get the degree since most high-level jobs required one.** **This racket made them spend tens of thousands of dollars for no reason.** I also knew a lot of them and they were extremely smart. Not academic smart or \"book smart,\" but their problem solving skills and logical abilities were insane. They easily could have gotten 4.0s, but why waste their time, when they could learn a lot more on their own? These people easily had 140+ IQs and they all tried to get high-level jobs that didn't require a degree out of high school and they worked their asses off outside of school.\n\nMost of the high-level skills that got me a good job were self-taught. :(\n\nI really hope that there is some sort of shift from high-level jobs requiring degrees. Once that happens, colleges will be forced to make students get their money's worth in learning and the people that truly deserve those jobs will be motivated to get their money's worth or not to go to college at all. The modern American college system is a racket and they are not even hiding it.\n\n**I, however, am hopeful. I go on job recruiting websites and see the GPA requirements getting lower and lower or even with a degree being optional. GOOD JOB. Hire people based purely on their skills and abilities, and not whether or not they spent a bunch of money to get a fancy title next to their name.**",

      "text": "I agree ultimately with many of your points -- I disagree on your prioritization of the practical job-orientated view of college, that is a particularly modern way of viewing college -- but I agree on many of your conclusions. College in the US is definitely a business, and too much emphasis is paid to ultimately unimportant things (biggest one: sports). Costs, especially at private institutions, are ridiculous.\n\n1. I agree with the taught-well requirement. Interesting, I went to a fairly selective state school and thought all but one class was well taught. What is relevant is a different issue, and just because it isn't important for a job doesn't mean it shouldn't be taught. No job needs to know how a Black Hole works, but that doesn't mean we should forget anything we ever learned about them.\n2. This would depend on what the class is. Some classes cannot be set up in a way you could make multiple comparatively minor assignments. Constant professorial attention would be nice, but that was my reality anyways so not particularly radical.\n3. Agreed, although again, I never had a professor who wasn't doing their job.\n4. I disagree with the mandatory, but how did anyone pass if they didn't go to class? Yes, attendance isn't mandatory, but at least at my school in my major, there was basically no way to pass if you didn't. Maybe my heavy discussion-based classes were an anomaly, but there was no way you were going to pass if you didn't do the book-a-week reading and show up for discussion. I am in favor of letting people not show up if they don't want to, but also having them inevitably fail.\n5. Agreed. Universities in the USA mostly follow the Research University format, meaning you prioritize equal parts teaching and research. Anything else other than the maintenance of this structure is excess.\n6. What college allows students to run the show? Also, just let them fail if they chose to run the show poorly.\n7. I agree college should not be pushed upon so many people and that taking time is a good idea. I disagree with the overt prioritization of the career-focused view of college. Ultimately, this comes down to a question of what is college: is it Trade School writ large, or something closer to the Humanistic Renaissance knowledge-for-knowledge's-sake? The humanities, many social sciences, and even some science fields reside firmly in the latter, much of STEM and a handful of social sciences have embraced the former. Try to match your own opinion on this quandary with your major. I wanted to be a STEM major, but I couldn't stand the taken-for-granted and job-centric attitude of STEM fields.\n\nHowever, I think you overemphasize the lack of jobs open for non-STEM majors. I'm not a STEM major and had no trouble getting a job. None of my friends did either. Diplomats, lawyers, teachers, journalists, editors, librarians, etc., they are all needed jobs.",
