      "text": "Yep. Every single time I have to give any kind of presentation or speech, I'm told I sound \"wooden\" or \"stilted\" or \"unnatural.\" \n\nDoes your professor know you have ASD? When I took speech, I hadn't been diagnosed yet and my professor was honestly pretty vicious about my inability to behave like an NT. This go-round (older student in college again), when I had to give a presentation in one class, I basically warned (before class) the professor that I have ASD and that there's only so much I can do and I'm legitimately doing my best even if it's not obvious. She was far more understanding.",

          "text": "I\u2019m not diagnosed with ASD, but I was diagnosed OCD  years ago, which makes feel I am actually undiagnosed ASD. I didn\u2019t think going without a proper diagnosis would be a problem because I thought I was doing well until this happened. I was in denial at first but after recording and watching myself practice countless times and not understanding what I\u2019m doing wrong I\u2019m starting to rethink things.",

I really had no worries about what I got to present for me it was just how I prepared for my speeches.",
