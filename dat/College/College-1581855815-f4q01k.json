  "title:": "How to deal with roommate with opposite sleep schedule?",
  "text": "I'm a college freshman, and I was randomly assigned a roommate at the start of fall semester. We hit it off really well and were good friends. Both of our sleep schedules lined up and it was really easy to talk to her. A few weeks in, though, she deferred for the semester. \n\nI was assigned a new roommate (RM) a few weeks later, but we have nothing in common. She likes to go to bed before 10 PM and wake up at 7 AM to exercise, and I go to bed at 2 AM and wake up at 10 AM for my classes. She's also a really light sleeper, so even when I enter and get ready for bed as quietly as possible, she still wakes up a little bit. RM already wears ear plugs and an eye mask to bed. Sometimes I ask her if I'm being too noisy, and she says that I'm fine, but she'll also shade me and can get passive aggressive. \n\nA few days ago, I set an alarm for 7 AM since I had to go to an event for a program I was in, and RM yelled at me. She was like, \"OP just get up because its not fair that I have to wake up to YOUR alarm.\" I was really surprised because she yelled at me the minute I opened my eyes, and it wasn't what I was expecting as soon as I woke up. I was also a little confused because I know RM usually wakes up at that time so I didn't think it was a problem because it'd be like we were waking up at the same time. RM also never let on or mentioned that this was a problem before so it kind of came out of nowhere. She was very harsh, so I avoided being in the room for the rest of the week. I did set my alarms later and more quieter though, and RM seemed to be fine. \n\nHowever, I'm in the process of pledging, and I had to wake up at 3 AM for a pledge activity. I connected my phone to earbuds so that I would be the only one hearing it, and I turned down the volume and put my phone right next to my head so that it wouldn't wake her up. It still woke RM up though, and she yelled at me again. Once again, she was really harsh, and I feel really bad, but I don't know what to do. I'm a deep sleeper so it takes a few alarms to wake me up. I usually don't wake up to her alarms, and if I do, then I fall back asleep right away.\n\nI'm not really sure how to handle the situation. I looked it up, and if I put my phone under my pillow, it increases my chances of getting brain cancer. Plugging in earbuds/Airpods didn't seem to work either. I also don't really feel comfortable talking to or being around my roommate right now. I don't think I would feel as uncomfortable if she just talked to me in a civil way, but her screaming at me is off-putting to say the least. Any advice?",

      "text": "I come from six months of this exact situation, except for the waking up early for training. My roommate if left on her own would go to bed at 10 and wake up at 8. I, on the other hand, would go to bed at 1.30/2,or sometimes even later, and wake up around 9 or something like that. She was wearing a mask and using plugs and I tried helping her by doing my night routine only with the torch of my phone on, but I felt like she was still upset someone dared do something after she had gone to sleep.\nOn the other hand, she has the horrid habit to snooze her alarms for an hour (I understand it's a personal preference, but I am on the opposite side of the spectrum, and never need more than one alarm unless I have only slept two hours or such extreme cases). I don't have a solution as I didn't find one in my case. We were really close friends at the beginning and by the end of the experience I felt like she wasn't really interested in the friendship, despite I was trying to accommodate her every wish (something she wasn't doing), by going to bed earlier etc. (she never set her alarms later not even by five minutes, claiming it wouldn't change anything, which, funnily enough, could be used as a counter argument to her own point, but whatever).\nIn the end, our friendship suffered from this situation and I doubt it will recover, since she was behaving in a pretty annoying way.\nAnyways, good luck for you, hopefully you'll find a solution!",

She's turning into bed???    \n\nYou can think her sleep schedule is 'inconsiderate' but guess what? Some of us have that sleep schedule...\n\nMine was rise at 5am take my medications...  shower and dress in restroom down the hall... quietly place towel meds and toiletries back in room. Grab coat and book bag... head to 6am newsroom to write and provide 6:30, 7, 7:30 AND 8:30 radio newscast Monday through Friday  to be at 8.50 am class. Continue through classes and listening to texts til 10pm T and H 8pm M and W 3pm Friday...  listen to more textbooks..  til about 2--3 am always, always always with headphones... and NEVER EVER IN MY ROOM, because listening to text books takes 2-3xs as long as it does for folk to read them and at the time I was doing it was NOT quiet! \n\nI was up late every damned day and on the weekends too. I have a reading disability so I did what I had to. \n\nAnd when folk dropped the load of horse hockey you just did on me... I smiled and said... well when you make Dean's list and do what you came here for dealing with what I do .. ON THAT SCHEDULE... LOL... you call me... til then... Ciao bella... \n\nWe won't talk about the most nights I just slept in the lounge because it was easier.. and as a guy who is 6'2 and a Lifeguard instructor  at the time... I didn't have to worry about being assaulted.  I call that privilege  and being white... no one questioned my being there... well after I introduced myself and showed ID but still.. also privilege.   But I  was given that opportunity.  \n\nYes, I cleared it with the hall director.  I'm rude like that. \n\nMy point is...\n\nPart of being a grown up is doing what needs to be done... I spent more hours in the formal lounge (no tv.. and no quiet studying for me to disturb!) than anyone... even the architecture and graphic design majors who got to become  friends with because they were working their asses off too, while being 'inconsiderate.' \n\nYes... I got less than 4 hours/night of sleep for 6 years and 2 full BA degrees...  I  know. How rude...",

      "text": "First off,  she moved into YOUR room. If she has a problem, rather than yelling and have a tantrum like she is 5, she should have talked it out like an adult, get an RA involved, or move out completely. You already had a set schedule before she came and should not change it just because she moved in. Also, yelling is not going to get anything acomplished, hence why your so upset. If she tried to talk it out rather than having an emotional episode perhaps things could have been better.\n\nI recommend talking to an RA about this if she does this anymore. However, push come to shove she is going to need to make sacrifices and compromises, as from the sound of it she is making more requests and wants than you are. Try to compromise than be a slave to her and do what she wants. Since you wake up 3 hours after she does a useful coversation would be \u201cI understand that your upset that I have to go to bed at 2 am, however you wake up 3 hours before me. I feel like that is a compromise in itself as we are both losing sleep. I get that I wake you up when I head to bed but you do the same. If it\u2019s gets to be too large of a problem then talk to the RA and move to another RM that is more catered to your schedule.....\u201d and so forth.",

I tend to take after your roommate in that I generally prefer to go to bed early and wake early. However, it\u2019s college.. I would argue that most people have an irregular sleeping schedule. You need to have a conversation with your roommate and set ~reasonable~ rules for your space so that you both get enough rest. \n\nI think that your roommate is being unreasonable given that she\u2019s yelling at you for having an alarm go off. Sharing a room with someone is inconvenient but she is not allowed to express her frustration in such a threatening way. Don\u2019t let her bully you, it\u2019s your space too. As much as possible, try to have a goal oriented, productive conversation- if she is unable to do so, bring in a mediator. Remember, this is a learning experience and you can do this! Best of luck.",

I felt like I was doing a lot of compromising and she wasn't so I just said fuck it, I'll move. It was a v stressful semester and I ended ranting to my friends in the SU building and one of her friends heard and it started this big drama. That was basically the straw that broke the camel's back. It happens, you just gotta move on bud. \n\nFor me, I had to just get my body used to waking up at, or before that time. I'm similar to your whereas I'd be out/up til 2, but my classes were actually at 8. She went to bed at 9-10 and had class schedule that varied. Eventually through waking up enough at a consistent time, and through learning how much sleep your body needs (it really just depends, mine needs about 6hrs to function like normal, but I'll always sleep more if I can) you can adjust and figure out what works for you.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a light sleeper who sets multiple alarms due to trouble waking up, but that\u2019s an awful thing to do to people around you. For real. I had to share a room for the first time this past fall with someone who had different sleep schedule; actually, it was a quad, so three people. \n\nFirst of all, get a silent alarm. I use an Apple Watch, but you can use a Fitbit or a dedicated silent alarm. It will violently vibrate you awake. Since it\u2019s on your arm and not a hard surface, though, she shouldn\u2019t be able to hear it. You can also try setting a series of silent alarms and ONE out-loud alarm that would wake you up out of a lighter sleep. \n\nSecond, talk to her about a white noise machine for while she\u2019s sleeping. I now live at home in a house with thin walls and two brothers who have to be awake at 5 AM. The only thing that keeps me from wanting to scream when they slam around at 5 AM is white noise covering most of it up. The thing about it is I KNOW they have to be awake; I\u2019m not mad that they\u2019re awake, I\u2019m mad that they\u2019re waking me up. It\u2019s not my fault or theirs that I\u2019m a light sleeper, but they do need to be reasonably quiet and I got a white noise machine to make it more effective. That being said, she has a really consistent, healthy sleep schedule that she\u2019s informed you about. It\u2019s very possible that YOU aren\u2019t being as quiet as you think; even if she has earplugs and a sleep mask, have you thought about actually getting READY for bed in the bathroom? About maybe keeping your night routine stuff together so you can quietly grab it and head to another room?\n\nI get why she\u2019s mad, honestly. You guys should try to talk about it, though I can imagine she won\u2019t be very responsive. She probably hasn\u2019t slept right since living with you and you don\u2019t seem to care. To be frank, you aren\u2019t compromising right now, which is a big part of sharing a room; you\u2019re ignoring her needs and going about your day. You\u2019re a deep sleeper. I assume that means her alarms don\u2019t bother you. If I were her, every time someone woke me up I\u2019d need probably 30 minutes to get back to sleep, if not more. She\u2019s probably frustrated because she didn\u2019t want to inconvenience you by saying that you\u2019re incredibly loud, especially because she moved in to your room; it\u2019s both of your rooms now, but she\u2019s the new one, and that probably came with some weird feelings. Add on to that a break where she COULD sleep, she probably feels awful again from a lack of sleep. \n\nRooming together requires compromise but, as someone who needs a certain amount of sleep on a consistent schedule to combat medical issues, you can\u2019t compromise on sleep; you compromise by working around it. She got a sleep mask and earplugs. You get a silent alarm and try a white noise machine. \n\nI\u2019d say don\u2019t come at it on a defensive way. I\u2019d recommend saying, \u201cHey, this is both of our room, and I think we need to talk about the sleep stuff.\u201d Explain that you\u2019re trying to be quiet but feel like you\u2019re not doing well enough and waking her up, say you\u2019re going to try a silent alarm, say you thought maybe a white noise machine could help drown out some small noises.\u201d Ask if there\u2019s anything else you can do. Keep in mind that, right or wrong, she\u2019s been sacrificing being able to sleep to try to avoid arguing with you about it and to let you live your life. Also keep in mind that most people with rigid sleep schedules have them for a reason- and they need probably them, either because of their intensive workout schedule or because some do genuinely need more sleep than others. \n\nThe other layer to this is you might just not be compatible as roommates. I\u2019d look into switching now, other solutions if you can\u2019t do that. I actually highly recommend a silent alarm no matter what- I find it easier to wake up too than a loud one. \n\nTLDR: She shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you but you\u2019re not compromising. Either compromise or leave, stop long-term torturing her by keeping her from getting enough sleep.",

She tried to use earbuds for the alarm, and now she's asking for genuine advice on how to mediate the situation. Some people just have different schedules, but it's not unreasonable to get ready for bed quietly after midnight. Personally I have work and class and extracurriculars so some days I'm gone from my room 9am to 11pm, and it wouldn't be feasible to be completely quiet beyond those hours (luckily me and my roommate are good this year). I'm of the opinion that living with someone else means some inconvenience. What if OP was a light sleeper and also waking up everytime her roommate got up at 7am? The only difference here is OP isn't sensitive. Beyond that I agree with your suggestions to mediate and compromise, but I also think that this girl shouldn't have a roommate if she's this sensitive. OP is far from the worst she could have gotten.",

              "text": "I didn't say she didn't \"try\" to compromise, I said she isn't. You don't compromise on sleep. You can do the rest of your life literally anywhere else but your dorm; your dorm is the only place with your bed. Therefore, sleep takes precedence. It's not like the roommate is getting mad that she's interrupting random nap times; she gave a very clear time that she needs to sleep, and has asked OP to be quiet in that time.\n\nI know all about different schedules; I was in a quad for four months this fall with no other option. We all had work and class and very different schedules and sleep preferences. There were days where I was the person who had upset someone and there were days I was woken up; we all had moments of frustration. However, it took us not even two weeks to realize that during sleep time, the room was for sleeping. If you had to get ready for work or for bed and someone was sleeping, do it in the bathroom. You want to eat or scroll on your phone or work on homework and someone is sleeping? Common room. One of my roommates chose to sleep on the couch because 1) she liked couches and 2) lighting up the room scrolling on your phone and making noise snacking into the middle of the night wasn't cool for other people. You can study, get ready, etc. anywhere else, you cannot sleep in the common room if you need quiet.\n\nYeah, it means inconvenience. Yet OP has literally done nothing inconvenient for herself, it's all been on the roommate. If all she's done is try to be quiet, that's not doing anything but the slightest bit of human decency. And based on OP's given timeline, roommate hasn't slept right during school since around October. She shouldn't have yelled; that wasn't cool, but it was also immediately after being woken up AGAIN, so it's at least understandable. \n\nAfter this long, either roommate has almost certainly tried to leave or can't. She can't just magically become a more sound sleeper. She's already compromising with a sleep mask and earplugs. It's really not that much for OP to just not get ready for bed in the room if she can't do so quietly, to try a silent alarm, etc. That's inconvenient. Losing sleep for months is torture. I hope she gets a single or a room off campus in the future because dealing with this all year must have been terrible.\n\nAs for if OP were a light sleeper, this probably wouldn't even be a problem. She'd intuitively understand the steps to take to try to avoid waking up the roommate, because she had a personal understanding of the consequences if she didn't. In that case, both should try a silent alarm and roommate should get ready for the day in the bathroom. It's really not that hard to understand. If OP needs to, she should lay out her things for getting ready for bed before leaving for the day, leave them by the door, and grab them to run to the bathroom so she's minimizing light and noise. For when she's in the room, the white noise machine should cover sound of her shuffling around, plugging things in, etc.\n\nI don't think I was too harsh. I think that you're not quite seeing exactly how little OP has been compromising based on the post. They need to talk this over but I don't think it'll be productive if OP isn't able to see how hard this must be for the roommate and how little she really has done to address it, at least based on what she wrote here. She needs to walk in with solutions, and that means actually doing things in a way that are a little inconvenient for her.",

This will block out a lot of noise and light and make it easier for her to sleep. \n\nYou should also be aware that getting up at 3am is not at all a normal sleep schedule. Yes, you are pledging, and yes, Frats/Sororities do stupid crap that like all the time, but, still. Multiple alarms going off at 3am is really not OK if the roommate is not OK with it. It seems like she's a really light sleeper, so even if you've got an alarm going through your headphones it's waking her up. And, I mean, 3am is NOT a normal hour to be waking up, and it's not like you're doing it for work or something. \n\nIt also sounds like your alarm was going off a lot of times before you woke up to it in the instance when you were getting up at 7am, which is also super-annoying. \n\nI would consider investing in a Fitbit or something with a vibrating band alarm and see if that's enough to get you awake. \n\nIn terms of her, she needs to chill out a bit (and I think adding white noise will help her not hear you), but it also sounds like you need to find a way to wake up without a ton of loud alarms/wake up without making use of snooze. If this is not possible, then it's time to think about switching roommates. \n\nBut, I mean, yeah, you seems to be a deep sleeper with a non-diurnal schedule while she's a light sleeper with a diurnal schedule. It is likely that the RA is going to be more on your roommate's side where quiet hours are concerned. Are there other places you can go in the building after 10pm when she's asleep? Like, say, a lounge? If you took your pajamas with you and your computer and set up in the lounge for those hours, she could sleep and you could just go change in the bathroom and go back in when you were ready to go to sleep. \n\nIs there anybody else in your building who is pledging? Can you do a brief roommate swap where the pledgers share a room so the non-pledgers don't have to deal with 3am alarms? \n\nI would definitely not room with this person next year, though. You guys don't sound compatible.",

      "text": "I'm sorry your roommate is yelling at you. That is no way to solve problems.\n\nHowever, as a heavy sleeper with a partner who is a super light sleeper, I can somewhat understand your roomie's frustrations. I am a teacher and have to get up before 7am everyday. He however can choose when he starts his workday and can even work from home if he wants. So he is at an advantage here, but it's always me who ends up feeling guilty when he is cranky in the evening and says he couldn't get work done because he wouldn't fall back asleep after my alarm went off (he typically needs at least 9 hours of sleep to be rested while I can work with 7). He never yells at me, but I can just sense that he's tense when he wakes up because of my alarms - sometimes he sighs deeply and rolls over to the other side and puts the blanket over his head. I try to be accomodating, so I put all my clothes and items I need for the next day in the living room before going to bed. I never let my alarm ring more than once and sometimes if I happen to accidentally wake before if goes off, I turn it off and silently climb out of bed when it's time.\n\nI realize I am maybe doing too much and he could be more understanding - same goes about you and your roommate. However, if you don't have an option to rent a room by yourself or to tell her to move elsewhere, I'd sit down with her for an honest discussion of what could be a good solution. (I used to live in a dorm for 5 years and had all sorts of roommates so I guess I have very thick skin about all this lol)\n\nOne of the best arrangements we had for a while was my electronic watch. I got it on AliExpress for 5 euros, just hooked it up with an app on my phone and put my alarms in there. Then a gentle, but for me noticeable enough vibration on my wrist woke me up and he didn't even flutter an eyelash because he didn't hear anything. The vibration on my wrist was also a lot less annoying than music blasting in my ear. Unfortunately the electronic watch/ wristband broke some time ago, but I'm looking into getting a new one. If this is something that could suit you, I recommend trying it out. As a bonus, it analyzes your sleep patterns, too!",

Unfortunately sharing such a small quarters means at some point you\u2019re guaranteed to step on toes at some point. It sucks that she\u2019s a light sleeper but you need an alarm and that\u2019s just the fact of the matter. You can get your RA involved if you need a conflict resolution. But otherwise things seem pretty normal as far as roommates and she\u2019s already got earplugs so she\u2019s trying her best. All I can suggest is maybe take your heels or shoes of before coming in the room at night and leaving your pjs and everything out so you don\u2019t have to russle around as much at night. Also just keep turning your alarms down and maybe double check with her the night before and see if she\u2019s waking up early or possibly has the day off. Communication is key! Best of luck, freshman year a wild experience! And good luck with pledging, going Greek was an amazing experience for me!",

      "text": "I am the sensitive roommate in this situation, and I've had several roommates that were similar to you. It sucks a lot on both sides. One of my roommates would sleep through literally any alarm she set, which meant I would be jarred awake by her alarm and she would just let it go off for a long time. Sometimes she didn't even wake up to it, so I'd go and turn it off because fuck that. I sleep with a sound machine, earplugs, blankets over my head, and sleep meds, and I still can and will get woken up by an inconsiderate/unknowing roommate. See if you can do a roommate change, or at least be a bit more considerate/acknowledge the importance of her sleep. Like, get ready for bed at 10pm or something, or take your stuff out of the room. Tell your roommate that you have to get up at a certain time so that she isn't startled awake by your alarms. (Because being startled awake by someone else's alarm is an absolutely shitty way to wake up.) Figure out a way to have a vibrating alarm that will only wake you up or some other alarm that only you can here. Or work on switching your sleep cycle a bit. You might be as surprised at how good you'll feel if you go to bed a bit early and get better sleep.",

I would wake up every time she got up and wouldn\u2019t fall back asleep until a while after she left. There were some things I negotiated with her- for instance, when she got her textbooks from the top of her desk it would cause a lot of noise, so I asked if she could just keep them down the night before. But I also just accepted that I wasn\u2019t not going to wake up, and that I just had to deal with that. \n\nDo as much as you can- keep your alarm noise low and don\u2019t set multiple alarms if you can help it. I tend to set multiple alarms to get up too but if I\u2019m going to be getting up before my roommate, then I limit it to two max. But she will have to compromise a bit and accept that it\u2019s not going to perfect- roommate situations rarely are. \n\nAlso- she shouldn\u2019t be yelling at you. Roommate problems should always be handled with civil communication if possible. My roommate would sometimes speak rudely to me and I would always tell her- \u201chey, I\u2019m happy to work out this issue with you but you can\u2019t just come up to me and talk to me like that.\u201d She usually agreed and apologized- hopefully yours does too.",

For me, once an alarm goes of once I'll start falling back to sleep at around 10 minutes, that's when the second one hits usually. After that I'm SOL. It's incredible annoying and inconsiderate to justify this with being a deep sleeper. \n\nAlso you might not be as quiet as you think. Even things like typing on a keyboard will keep me awake. If it's feasible you could try to get ready for bed before 10 so you don't make noise getting dressed, opening doors, showering etc. \n\nYou should ask her if you're snoring as well. When my roommate has a cold the snoring will wake me up from deep sleep in the middle of the night\n\n\n>I enter and get ready for bed as quietly as possible, she still wakes up a little bit\n\nIf she's chronically getting sleep deprived it's probably causing anger issues. I have had the same issues before. And just to note, there's rarely a way to get ready for bed quietly. When my roommate starts getting ready for bed after I'm in bed (for me at 12) or starts homework only after I go to bed, over time it makes me angry. I feel like \"I told you I have sleep issues why are you only starting these things after I'm asleep\". She could have a similar feeling. \n\nI think the best scenario for you is to change roommates though",

This problem, like basically all problems with roommates, can be dealt with by **communicating**. She needs to discuss this with you in a mature way, but since you *know* she's going to wake up to your alarm, it's also your responsibility to warn her that you're going to set multiple alarms for 3am.\n\nSetting multiple alarms that you don't plan to get up to is a dick move when you share a room with someone else regardless, *especially* if they're noise alarms. We're primed to wake up to noise, hence why smoke alarms emit a very loud noise. I really recommend you look into other kinds of alarms, e.g. vibrating alarms in watches and wristbands. \n\nWhen it comes to sleep, she kinda wins on this one because she has a \"normal\" sleep schedule *and* she wakes up more easily so an RA is unlikely to take your side. Look at it this way: you always interrupt her sleep and she practically never interrupts yours. You're so poorly matched and she's so primed to hate you that you should look into switching if you can. But first steps first: talk to her about it. \n\n>I looked it up, and if I put my phone under my pillow, it increases my chances of getting brain cancer.\n\nThat is 0% true.

Also, setting alarms for 3am is definitely not normal. \n\nMost people go to sleep sometime *before* midnight which is precisely why the quiet hours start around 11pm. If you're someone who goes to sleep significantly later than that (including me), then you're the one who needs to be considerate and not wake others up. Society has agreed that the waking hours are very broadly 7am-11pm, so OP's roommate can be mad that she's woken up at 2-3am but OP can't exactly be mad if they're woken up at 7am or later. When I'm out on an observing trip the hours are reversed: people sleep during the day and you must be quiet between 7am-7pm. You just have to respect what the bulk of people are doing. \n\nI agree that they probably need to sort a room change. Most things can be negotiated pretty heavily but sleep is a dealbreaker if you're on very different schedules. Depriving someone of sleep is the fastest way to make them hate you with a murderous passion.",

Dress codes are meant to be a representation of the organization for the members involved. Mandatory study hours aren't a \"control mechanism,\" it's to make sure students with low GPAs don't put the academic standing of the organization in jeopardy and to build good study habits. Pledge activities can be analogous to team-building exercises. Most frats use them because they generally have a purpose behind them. A control mechanism would be forcing pledges to do planks on bottle caps because it's entertaining to watch. Events like that have fallen far out of the favor in the pledge process.",

(I do think he got it from our dad, though, who\u2019d only wake up with 7 separate alarms going off at different times\u2014one of which would brighten his entire room as well as make noise). \n\nOP is probably not as extreme as either of them, but the vibration itself could actually wake the roommate. i know my brother\u2019s would wake me up, and i\u2019m not a super light sleeper, so i\u2019m sure it\u2019d wake her too.",
