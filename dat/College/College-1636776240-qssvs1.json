  "text": "i feel like i\u2019ve lost who i am as an individual. all i do is go to class, eat, and study every night so i don\u2019t fail my classes because i\u2019m trying to get into competitive grad school so i essentially need straight a\u2019s . i don\u2019t even remember who i was before college. everything that made me an individual feels like it\u2019s gone. i used to curl my hair sometimes and do my makeup and i would paint my nails when i needed a break, now i feel guilty even taking a break to look at my phone. i\u2019m so lonely some days it feels like that\u2019s how i\u2019ll be forever. has anyone gone thru this? does it ever get better? college is not the \u201cbest years of my life\u201d. at least i hope it isn\u2019t.",
