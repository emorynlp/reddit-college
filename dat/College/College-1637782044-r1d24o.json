      "text": "This comes down to maturity. Two people can be a great match and hopelessly in love, but if they have discipline and goals, they're still going to pay attention in class and work hard. Likewise you don't need a girlfriend to not pay attention in class. To me, and for someone with my personality, the biggest issue would be being competitive about grades, or having a hard time separating relationship from school work. With covid and work from home people have struggled with work-life balance because work is just right there, now imagine that your significant other is also associated with work. That doesn't have to be an issue, but something that could come up. In my major though, I did see several couples who were dating, and even a few married couples, and they all did just great.",

You two talk, and get to know each other.\n\nThe other version has a one minded focus to the lesson plan set out by the professor. This version realizes he is attracted to this girl, and avidly puts her out of his mind in order to focus on the lesson.\n\nWhich version do you think would perform better in the class? Which version would you be happier becoming?",
