All my classes for spring are exclusively online, and I am not exactly enthused about that change going into my second semester of freshman year.",

      "text": "Zero. I hope it stays that way. Spring 2022- fall 2022 is my last year of college and I don\u2019t want it spent like fall 2020 when I was depressed and eating crappy food in the dining halls (there was the option for students to live at home but I had one class that was hybrid every other week so I had to stay on campus with the fact that it\u2019s over an hour away from home). I want my last year for be the best. I\u2019ve had my two vaccinations, recently my booster shot, and I wear a mask all of the time in public areas around people. If people do the same, they should be TOTALLY fine, but that\u2019s their decision. If they get extremely sick with the virus due to not doing any of that, that\u2019s a shame for them. Because unlike 2020, there are plenty of options to keep yourself from dying of this virus. Online just isn\u2019t one of them anymore, but we need to move on from it cause it was declining the economy of colleges.",

Right now my school is requiring we get our booster shot and requiring us to get tested within 10-14 days of returning to campus. Theory is the reason they are having us get tested is so they can see how many of us are sick then decide to go online for a couple of weeks or not",
