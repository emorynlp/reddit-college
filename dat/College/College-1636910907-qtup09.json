I\u2019ve heard from many that they wanted independence but then they felt isolated. 1-2 hours away is enough that your parents will leave you alone but when you want to come home, they\u2019re perfectly fine coming to get you. It\u2019s not a trip they would want to make frequently so you will have independence and that safety option of going home.",
