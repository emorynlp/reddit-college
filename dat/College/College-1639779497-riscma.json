  "text": "I fucked up and I don\u2019t even know how?\n\nSo I am enrolled in a lab course right now and a lot of the assignments are supposed to be completed in teams of two. Me and my partner decided that we would just alternate on who does the assignment. At the end of the semester we have one assignment left, and   I decide I am just going to do it even though it was my partners turn because they started missing a lot of labs during the second half of the semester and I couldn\u2019t trust them anymore. \n\nHere is the twist though: I remember completing the assignment. I even remember sending a text to my partner saying that I did the assignment already. But I got my grade today, basically saying the assignment is missing/incomplete.The assignment is on a website that autosaves. So, I couldn\u2019t have forgotten \u201c to submit\u201d. \n\nI am so confused. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t trust my memory. Did I not do the assignment? Did it not save? Did I dream about and thought I did it? It was on the library computers using their WiFi, so I can\u2019t even blame my computer.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened which scares me even more. We had an assignment a while back and it was my partner\u2019s turn to do it. They never did it and we got a zero. But again here is the thing, I would have done the assignment had I remembered that we repeated that experiment. Like I had no recollection of doing that experiment. I was off the hook though because it wasn\u2019t my turn.",
