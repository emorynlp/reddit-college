  "text": "Dear friends,\n\nI started a new playlist with mathematical riddles which I intend to extend in the future.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfbradAXv9x4bJwtUzDX0onecVtu9mvBN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfbradAXv9x4bJwtUzDX0onecVtu9mvBN)\n\nI would be happy to hear your opinion on the riddles in the list, and ideas for future videos.\n\nJust yesterday a question on Reddit inspired me to make this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLaIM8L2dA&t=7s&ab\\_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLaIM8L2dA&t=7s&ab_channel=Math%2CPhysics%2CEngineering)\n\nThank you!",
