  "text": "linear algebra has been the death of me this semester. i bust my ass, but i\u2019ve recognized that i\u2019m not using the best study strategies, and i have a few ideas on how to study better for the final. for perspective, my midterm grades have been a B, A-, and most recently, a C. i need at least a B in the class, and the final is worth 30%. i\u2019m hoping for a B+ on the final (8 days until the exam), but i need some advice/uplifting stories to put this all into perspective. tbh, this is the hardest class i\u2019ve taken in my life and the class/exams themselves are really in depth and demanding to me, some of it just feels beyond my comprehension\u2014which is a difficult feeling since i\u2019ve been high-achieving in math/science up to this point. share what you\u2019ve got, i\u2019ll listen to anything. \n\ntldr: my midterm grades haven\u2019t been the best and i need to do well on my linear algebra final. any advice/stories are welcome.",
