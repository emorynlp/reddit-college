  "title:": "literally how can i eat in my campus\u2019 dinning hall without making myself sick",
  "text": "so i\u2019m a freshman and i live on campus, i really enjoy my college but it\u2019s mainly a commuter campus and so there\u2019s like 3 dorm halls and one cafeteria. lately especially, the food from my college dinning hall has consistently made me feel ill after eating it and it seems like everything just goes straight through me, i hardly ever feel satisfied after a meal. my college has a rotating meal station (that usually just serves some form of meat, a vegan alternative, cooked vegetables and some form of grain), a sandwich station, a stir fry station, a pizza station, and then like bread and waffles which are always available. i almost always either get stir fry or stuff from the rotating meal station. i hardly ever eat meat (mainly because i\u2019m worried it\u2019ll make thing worse, i bit into a raw piece of chicken once), so i\u2019ve mainly just been eating either pasta or rice with tofu and veggies, and i still end up feeling ill. i want to make my food but i only have access to a community microwave and a small beverage fridge, and everything i grocery shop for i\u2019ll have to pay for myself. any suggestions?",

      "text": "You should consult a health professional about this issue, maybe visit the campus student health clinic or equivalent.  Unless there has been a wave of students being sickened by the dining hall food, it seems unlikely that anything is wrong with the food itself.  So you should probably consult a doctor about why you're having digestive issues, especially since rice, tofu, and veggies all count as pretty bland foods.  Good luck.",

              "text": "Not a doctor, but the way I see it, there are a few possibilities:\n1) You have an intolerance or allergy to something in the food you're eating on campus. It could be something like the oil the dining hall uses to cook your food.\n2) The dining hall food may have some unintentional contamination. For example, you might have a gluten allergy and the dining hall just uses the same equipment for both gluten-free foods and gluten-based foods, but doesn't clean the equipment adequately before preparing gluten-free foods.\n3) You might also have a disease like Chron's syndrome.\n4) The dining hall may be too unsanitary to eat there.\n\nIf you are experiencing food poisoning, the local public health authorities will want to know about this so they can decide what actions are necessary (up to, and including, shutting down the dining hall)\n\nThe best thing you can do is: 1) Schedule an appointment with a primary care provider for diagnosis and treatment. 2) keep track of what you order and where you order it from, as well as how that food makes you feel. Then present these findings at your appointment. The provider will want this information to help them isolate the cause of your problem.",

              "text": "I'm glad you have a plan. In the meantime, then, depending on what your budget is, perhaps you could be creative about sustaining yourself from food you get from the grocery store. I'm guessing that you already paid for the campus dining, which sucks, but maybe you can supplement with what you think are the safest options from there. I'm sure the bananas or other kinds of fruits that you peel or can wash are safe. Maybe just plain bread or rice as well. There are a lot of meals you can make that are inexpensive, simple, and non-perishable. I'm thinking PB and banana sandwiches or buying cans of tuna or chicken and making a sandwich.",
