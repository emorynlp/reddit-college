  "text": "I was prescribed Adderall last semester but after extended use I hate taking it. I can manage my workload without it, but not consistently. I need help either getting through long days (12 hours) or working more efficiently in a shorter time span. Preferably the latter. \n\nAny recommendations? My current lifestyle/regimen:\n\n-6 hours of sleep a night, 7 if I\u2019m lucky\n-balanced diet, eating multiple small meals/snacks through out the day\n- 45 min commute each way\n-drink coffee/tea twice a week, I like using focus aid drink to push through the mid week slump\n-cannabis use on weekends; will use on weekdays if all my work is done for the day\n\nTIA!",

      "text": "The closest thing is nootropics - modafinil/adrafinil, phenylpiracetam, noopept, etc.  Personally they don\u2019t work well enough for me (and I\u2019ve tried everything), but I\u2019m guessing my add is just too severe, so I have to take adderall.  But you should definitely give them a shot, because adderall is terrible for your brain, whereas nootropics are the opposite (neuroprotective and increases synaptic connects iirc)\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve also heard good things about microdosing to enhance focus",
