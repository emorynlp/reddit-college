  "title:": "do professors dislike students that turn in assignments with a lot of detail and care, exceeding requirements for the assignment?",
  "text": "ive heard somewhere that professors typically don\u2019t enjoy grading papers that are higher in page number than the requirements and are a bit overly detailed. i genuinely can\u2019t help it, i\u2019m really passionate about these classes im in and i genuinely enjoy the assignments im given.\n\nis it annoying to turn in these kinds of assignments, or do professors appreciate students that put care and thought into them? this is a genuine question, i\u2019m not trying to brag or say i\u2019m better than anyone. i want my professors to like me lol",

      "text": "Honestly, I usually stop grading when I hit the page limit. So anything that is on the extra pages won't get read which can lead to a worse grade. This is because knowing how to write succinctly is actually more difficult that being overly detailed and because grading papers takes forever so I really don't want to read extra pages.",

Multiply that by the several assignments a semester and I'm using way too much personal time doing things that should've been completed during my 9-5. \n\nWord/page counts exist for a reason. \n\nI do take time to make my expectations clear and speak to the students individually that do this kind of thing. I make it clear that I'm impressed, but they need to follow the assignment guidelines.",

If a student exceeds a MAXIMUM page count, then I could see justification, but if it's a minimum count then you should find another profession. At the minimum you need to let the students know how you grade, so they have all the information they need to be successful.",

      "text": "Depends on the prof. Many times they put a page count for themselves for grading as it's not fun to grade 10+ pages per student when there is 50+ students in the class. Sometimes a page limit is because you might run into the same limit in research as well as knowing what information is important to keep and what can be omitted. Overall, it depends on the prof. It also depends on what you wrote. Is it accurate, does it pertain to the paper, etc.\n\nedit: Many also just stop once the page limit is hit and just looks for formatting issues. So most likely they aren't reading the whole things anyway.",

      "text": "If you're worried about how professors will feel about you handing in assignments that greatly exceed the page minimum, you could always just ask them what they think. \n\nIn my experience, professors who don't want you to write too much will give a page range that your assignments should be in, and you should try to get in the ballpark of that range. If there's no range and just a minimum or no range or minimum at all, then you're *probably* good but it still might be best to ask.",

For my writing intensive course I usually did this because I really liked to dig into the content, the professor loved it too as well but the class size was only 20 and he only taught one other class that was even smaller than that so he was able to analyze and give real feedback. If its a course with 100+ people and the professor teaches one or two more then I wouldn't bother. They won't have time to read your paper you put your heart into and one of mine in a class that big even admitted that he mainly skims to check if it follows the structure he wanted, if the citations are correct, and thats it.",

I have had a few that got so bad that it looped around and they undermined the basis of their decision for the assignment. \n\nEven though they started out correct, and would have been if they followed instructions, expanding beyond scope made them lose points.\n\nBasically, be aware of what you know, and careful of circular logic.",

Your prof should have made their expectations clear, so I would check the syllabus or email them to see what they want. \n\nI\u2019ve had other profs give word count limits and say that they\u2019re fine with giving a 15 percent margin. So for example, if they assigned a 1000 word paper, they\u2019re okay with you writing between 850 to 1150 words. For them, that\u2019s acceptable.  \n\nIt depends on the preference of your profs.",
