  "text": "I\u2019m in my second semester of my first year of community college, and I feel really overwhelmed.  I work 16 hours a week and am taking five classes, but I didn\u2019t think it would be that bad because my first one wasn\u2019t that bad.  However now I just want to throw my laptop away and just leave.  I\u2019m not struggling in classes at all, I have all As.  I just want to be able to enjoy life outside of school. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to stay motivated when it feels like I can never get caught up.  I\u2019m wanting to spend next weekend with my girlfriend but now it just seems like I\u2019m going to have to work all weekend.  Again.  And there is no end until December",

      "text": "Faculty here.\n\nSo, you've got two choices.  You might not like the two choices, but the situation is what it is, and if you want things to change, you've got to choose one of them:\n\n1. Work fewer hours so that you have more time to get your school work done and therefore probably more free time on weekends too.  Clearly, this depends on your personal financial situation.  If your finances say you can't cut back on your work, then this option's out, which means you're left with option 2.\n2. Take fewer classes each semester.  Clearly, with fewer classes, you'll have less school work and more free time.  Just make sure that reducing the number of credit hours you take won't affect any scholarships or financial aid you might be receiving.  Also, if you cut back the number of credits you take, it might take you an extra semester to graduate.  But, if quality of life is your main concern, then taking an extra semester might be a worthwhile trade for you personally in exchange for less stress and more free time.\n\nIf it isn't possible for you to cut back on work *or* cut back on credit hours for whatever reason, then unfortunately your only option is to tough things out.  Working a substantial number of hours while going to school is challenging; I've seen this is my students for years.  But thousands of students do it every semester, and you can too.  The best bet is to keep up with your work on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis so that you don't fall behind to begin with.  That feeling of always being behind and never being able to catch up can be quite oppressive.  If you can, it's best to avoid it altogether by not getting behind in the first place.  That's easier said than done, but if you work at it, it might make the load more bearable.\n\nGood luck.",
