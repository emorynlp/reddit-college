  "text": "We all know regular in-person tests are stressful, but what has been your worst online test? I recently have discovered my worst. Over a 45 page chapter, we had an open book test that we only had 15 minutes to take and was only able to look at one question at a time. After moving on from a question, we weren't able to review the previous questions/answers. There was only 15 questions but the answers were all in obscure places like the descriptions of images.\n\nI just feel like with the time limit and test set-up it makes for a very ineffective test. I would rather take a 45 minute  closed book test that I would be able to double check my answers.",
