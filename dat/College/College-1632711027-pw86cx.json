  "text": " I signed into a computer for my math class and was doing my thing. This girl sat down next to me which didn\u2019t bother me, but I did sit there because it was away from other people. She then asked me did I know how to sign into the computer, I was actually annoyed and didn\u2019t say anything to her for about 20-30 seconds because I was debating in my head whether or not I should help her. I decided to help her but only because she literally stared at me while I was looking at my screen, another girl must of seen my hesitation and came to help her. The reason I was annoyed because I thought out of all these open computers you sat down near me? I keep to myself on campus and don\u2019t really talk to anyone unless professors want us to be in groups for projects, does stuff like this happen regularly to you guys? I just thought it was ridiculous that she needed help signing in.",

If you were having a hard time with something and you had no choice but to ask the person besides you for help, and the person ignored you, how would you feel?",
