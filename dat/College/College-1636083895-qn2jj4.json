  "text": "Sorry if this doesn't belong here, let me know. Like the title says, I am a chronically ill student. I have Crohn's, among other things. I am transferring to a college with zero online classes. As a CC student I have always managed to avoid my active flare times with online classes. I am always very sick in the mornings. Fellow sick people, what accommodations did you ask for? I don't want to be unreasonable. \n\nOn another note, are there any resources available to chronically ill people in college? Campus is a 25 minute drive from my house. That doesn't seem very far but for me it is. I want to get a dorm in case of \\~emergencies\\~ but paying an extra 13k just cos I'm sick is a lil nutballs to me. Thanks fam, and again lemme know if this belongs in a different subreddit.",

      "text": "I\u2019m chronically ill also! Check in with your schools disability resource department. You are entitled to accommodations under the ADA. At my school we are assigned a DRC advisor who helps navigate the process. Some things I have on my accommodations are flexibility with deadlines, flexibility with attendance requirements when reasonable (ex: a lab or discussion based class isn\u2019t as reasonable as a quiz based class), ability to access/be sent copies of profs powerpoints, priority registration for classes since I also struggle with mornings so I can avoid morning classes at all costs, extra time for tests, and a waiver for the credit requirement for full time students so I can take fewer but still get all the benefits. I also have a parking spot on campus in a space reserved for disability parkings. My advisor was able to suggest things that people have gotten in the past that helped them, telling her what I struggle with was a great way to get her input. She\u2019s a pro and it\u2019s helped so much! Definitely find the department on your schools website and shoot them an email. They are there to help and make college accessible wherever possible\n\nETA: they can also be a great resource if you have a prof who won\u2019t give you the accommodations you\u2019re entitled to or is discriminating based on disability. It\u2019s unlikely to happen, but a great resource if it does. I would also personally try to get a  parking spot in a parking garage instead of a dorm. I can access a nearby bathroom (mine is connected to a regular lecture hall) and sleep in my car if I need to",
