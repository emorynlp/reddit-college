  "text": "Dear high schoolers: \n\nWe are all excited for you as you submit your apps and receive your letters of admission.  This is a big milestone in your academic career and you've got big decisions in front of you.\n\nHowever, r/college is not the place to ask admission questions, nor to ask which school you should go to.  \n\n* If you have questions about admission (questions about your stats or chances, help for an application essay, what to do if you made a mistake in an application, what to do in high school to prepare for college, where you should apply, etc.), post in r/ApplyingToCollege\n* If you want opinions on which college is better or which one you should go to, post in r/collegecompare\n* If you have questions about federal student financial aid, post in the [FAFSA Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cwufdh/fafsafinancial_aid_verification_questions_get/)\n* If you have questions about making friends at college, post in the [Making Friends Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d2uiny/how_to_make_friends_in_collegewill_i_make_friends/)\n\nEveryone wishes you the best and looks forward to seeing you on a college campus this fall.",
