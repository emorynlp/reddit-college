  "title:": "Should I take a full time job as a full time college student?",
  "text": "I (F17) am a senior in high school and sophmore in college (I'll explain that later) and never had a job before. My friend (F20) is a teacher at a preschool and is in need of a full-time teacher assistant. The job doesn't require prior work experience and minimum age for applicants is 16.  The downside however is that the worksite is an hour away from me and I'm worried about how I will be able to balance both work, school, and possibly a little bit of a social life. \n\nHowever, I personally really want to get the job. I get to work with one of my best friends and I love working with kids. I probably will get paid more than minimum wage and this experience will look good on my resume for future jobs. I know this will be difficult, stressful and draining. But I'm willing to find solutions and make things work out. \n\nIf I am being honest, I am a huge procrastinator and I struggle with being very lazy. That's why I want this huge push and struggle because I think that's what will be necessary for me to start building new habits and be more productive. I get a little teary just thinking about how hard this will probably be for me - but I still want to take the shot. \n\nThis opportunity came out of nowhere. I just found out about it today and I need to make a decision asap bc they need my answer in a timely manner. I spoke to my mom and she said it's good - haven't spoken to my dad yet. Friends have been giving me advice and their input. Most of the concerns come from the fact that I have to drive an hour. But I am used to driving far distances and often times drive an hour back and forth multiple times since my church is an about an hour away. \n\nI am at loss. I don't know if I will be able to handle this and it makes me feel afraid and anxious. But the other side of me desperately wants this challenge. I want to finally \"grow up\" and learn what it's like to have people relying on you and just be in a working environment. I know I need this, even if it's hard. But I still have doubts and concerns. My mind is 50/50 on this. I can't sleep because I've been thinking about this all day.\n\nNote: I am a high school student and a college student because I am in a program called running start. That is where I am able to go to college full-time (or part-time) and any credits that I get at the college will count for both high school and college credit.\n\nEdit: another key point is that I'm doing college fully online (no zoom meetings or anything like that) and am planning to do until the end of Spring quarter.",

Because you can't work as a qualified TA without 2 years of college work. Some states even want an associate's degree. You should probably just focus on school anyways.",

An hour and a half is a long way and once you start college full time, it\u2019s going be stressful to have this job that\u2019s far and have to worry about school. Also take into consideration how far the college you want to go to next year is.",

      "text": "I would consider the benefits for your career.\n\nIs this job related to the work you want to do? If not - the experience alone isn\u2019t really worth doing it. In which case, the money would need to be good, and I can\u2019t imagine being a pre-school assistant would pay more than most hourly jobs around town.\n\nYou also have to consider the overall time commitment. If doing this ends up cramming your schedule, you\u2019ll start to resent it and ruin the experience.\n\nIMO it\u2019s a terrible opportunity. Don\u2019t be lured in by the magic of \u201cfull time\u201d just because it\u2019s irregular pre-college.",
