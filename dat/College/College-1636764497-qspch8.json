  "title:": "How do I become an undergraduate research assistant?",
  "text": "I am a sophomore studying psychology at a community college. I love it and I'm certain that I want to go into research when I graduate. I have started to learn about the independent studies that the psychology department and the individual professors are doing and I would really like to join in as a research assistant. One study is being done by a professor whose class I am taking right now. I asked my advisor how I get into research and she said I need to just go to student office hours and ask the professor about their research and if they need a student assistant. That seems so intimidating to me and I'm certain they'll say no or think I'm annoying! I'm also worried since I'm only two years in and I haven't taken our University's psychological research methods class, which would make me much more inexperienced then other research assistants.\n\nBasically I'm asking, has anyone done this where they just ask a professor about their research and if they need an assistant? How did it go? Or if you are a research assistant how did you get your position? Please let me know! Thanks!",
