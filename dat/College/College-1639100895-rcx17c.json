  "title:": "Is professor's grading system normal? Just got first assignment back and never seen anything like this",
  "text": "Sorry in advance for length!!\n\nHi all. I got my first assignment of the semester back in my art history class on Dec. 5th (yes, the first assignment wasn't graded until the final 3 weeks of class). I was pretty shocked at how she graded my paper. I am nervous because I've submitted assignments since then before having seen this aggressive feedback so haven't had a chance to make any changes in my approach.\n\nCan you guys tell me if this is normal? I'll try to be brief: She goes into the paper line by line to physically edit the paper, changing words and sentence structure, adding clauses etc. In my opinion, she didn't improve it, but only added redundancy:\n\nEx 1. I wrote \"Transitioning to O'Keefe's 1965 painting...\" and she added the word \\*next\\* like, \"Transitioning **next** to O'Keefe's 1965....\" There are a few like this.\n\nEx. 2. She also randomly added the phrase \"**what might be described as**\" in the middle of one of my descriptions. It really just seems like extra words. Her class emails are literally 2000 words long, while only relaying a core idea or two, so it seems like maybe the wordiness is just a style she likes?\n\nEx. 3. She changed the plurality (I think wrongly?) in this phrase. Mine: \"The focal points of these works **reveal** a beguiling...\" Hers: \"The focal points of these works **reveals** a beguiling...\"\n\nThere are a bunch of edits she made like this, but hopefully these illustrate the situation well enough.\n\nIn office hours she skimmed my first draft before it was due, as she vehemently encouraged us to. She said \"wow you're a great writer! If you thought you were rusty, you're not.\" (I'm old and returning to college after many years). She loved my thesis, the works I chose, and the \"advanced\" ideas I articulated. She did mention my phrasing was clunky sometimes with poor word choice, so I tried to address that in the paper before I submitted it. She mentioned like a hundred other different examples where she thought \\*this\\* word would be better than \\*that\\* word, etc. etc. I wrote them all down and changed them, even though I didn't personally think they added any value to my paper. She frequently said \"by the way I'm obviously nitpicking here.\" She also went on tangents about additional topics I could address if I wanted to, even though they're not required for the assignment (How I would physically arrange the pieces as a curator, etc) Overall, her feedback was overwhelming and I decided I didn't want her to look at my papers before submitting them again in the future because it just confused me. I think I'm easily overwhelmed though lol.\n\nIn the notes on my graded paper, she wrote that I have a good start but my phrasing was clunky (still, I guess) and that my claims were vague, but also that I need to tone down declarative statements. She also said I need to condense where I was repeating \u2013 strikes me as hypocritical but I don't know if I'm being just being defensive. She gave me an 88 but I'm not sure which issues precipitated the -12 pts. If my content was good she just doesn't like my phrasing, is that normal to take 12 points off? Especially because in office hours she said her suggestions (which I took) were merely nit-picking. It feels arbitrary to me and rattled my confidence for the last two major assignments that are due within the next two weeks, as well as the assignments I've already submitted before having seen this feedback. I'm overwhelmed by receiving it so late, as well as her point deductions feeling arbitrary and unpredictable. Am I being too sensitive, or is she being a bad/weird professor? I just don't trust my instincts having been out of school so long before this. She is an adjunct and relatively new, if that is meaningful context.\n\nSo please tell me: is this all normal or is she a weirdo? I'm not mad about the grade (a little peeved she's only getting our assignments back to us so late into the semester though), mainly overwhelmed at the thought of not being able to control what grade I get because her qualitative assessment is unpredictable. Addressing it with her only leaves me more confused. Hit me with some perspective please. \n\nAnd thanks for reading all that!",

      "text": "It doesn't sound normal. That being said, some professors really do line-edit students' papers for whatever reason, suggesting the oddest and most inconsequential changes. Your case is extreme though. Good she didn't go too hard on the grading, in comparison to the scale of her comments.\n\nHowever, I think I know why:\n\n>She is an adjunct and relatively new, if that is meaningful context.\n\nDefinitely meaningful context! Many new professors feel a need to prove themselves, both to you as the student and to their fellow professors. Double this need-to-prove if they are an adjunct, low on the academic hierarchy. Most likely, being an adjunct, a random number of your papers which are graded by her will be reviewed by a higher-up professor to ensure she knows what she is talking about. She probably wants to look good for that, thinking, usually wrongly, if she goes the extra mile she will get a full time position.",

              "text": "The late-ness is surprising, given the circumstances, but by itself isn't necessarily uncommon. I've had professors take 10 weeks to grade a paper. Usually, in my experience, adjuncts and new professors return papers quickly (e.g., a 100 person class had all their papers graded within a week!) while full tenured professors work at whatever pace they like (e.g., a 10 person class had papers graded 8 weeks after submission, but not all tenured professors are that slow).\n\nIt is especially bizarre, and indeed antithetical as you pointed out, given the scope of her corrections and her position as recently-hired adjunct. However, in of itself, the lateness isn't unheard of.",
