  "text": "I'm looking into passing requirements and I've come across a lot of mixed responses on this. Without getting into specifics, even the wording for the passing policy at my school is oddly phrased, so I'm unsure. In general, is a D passing for a gen ed? I know it's going to be bad for GPA, but would the course still need to be taken again?",
