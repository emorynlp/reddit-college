  "text": "It\u2019s not the fact that college finals are harder, but they test you on how physically fit you are. These exams are for two hours and some of you may multiple in one day. You may think it\u2019s only two hours, but trust me you better be mentally strong and fit to take these exams. I remember taking my chemistry exam last year as a freshman feeling completed exhausted after finishing it. It was a 9 AM so I guess that played a role. Remember to take keep your sleep constant, maintain good mental/physical health and eat. Maintaining your health is crucial when preparing for finals. Try to avoid all nighters before a final because even though they help you study the material with more time, you are gonna feel very exhausted and this may make you do a lot worse than expected. So stay fit and I wish you all the best of luck on finals and ending the semester/quarter strong.",
