  "text": "I think it is a general consensus that productivity and efficiency are perfectly achievable without the help of software and apps.\n\nHowever.\n\nWhy bother doing everything the analog way when there are a hundred better ways to:\n\n* track your progress\n* track your streaks\n* manage your notes\n* schedule events\n* track your grades and study progress\n\nSadly, when we go into college/university, we are largely unprepared for the new type of study structure. This means that we have to learn to drive the metaphorical \u201cuniversity car\u201d on the go, as it\u2019s already running. Otherwise, we crash and burn.\n\n[This list of apps](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/productivity-apps) is in no particular order, but it covers some main bases that I believe are important for young people and mainly for students who are just now learning how to build habits. These include learning **how to schedule, email management, taking notes** and **effective studying, task management,** and **digital housekeeping.**",
