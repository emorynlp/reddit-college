  "text": "I currently have a 70% exact, and my major requires me to pass this class with a C, which would be 73%. The final is worth 200 points and will be curved, however the test is the national chemistry exam so it would be like 60-70 questions. I calculated that I need a 78% (or 46/60 correct) on the final and seeing how chemistry isn\u2019t my strong suit, I don\u2019t see that happening. I only have a C- because I did semi-ok in labs. How do curves work in situations like this? If I bombed the test and got a D but the national average was a C+, would my final be bumped to a C+?? We are being curved on the national average so idk, it\u2019s kinda confusing.",

Our class would be bumped to a 70%.\n\nEDIT: So let\u2019s say the average exam score nationally is a 40/60, he will curve that to be a 70% which is our \u201caverage\u201d even tho a 40/60 is usually a 66%. That\u2019s how I interpreted what he said to us about it.",
