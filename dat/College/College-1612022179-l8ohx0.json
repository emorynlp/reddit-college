  "text": "I\u2019m honestly just overwhelmed and school started last Tuesday. Technically I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve missed any assignments, but I\u2019m so behind on the material. I\u2019m honestly just struggling mentally so hard right now and can\u2019t afford to drop any of these classes. I was working 40 hours at my job for the first two weeks because I thought I could work full time and do the classes, but that put me behind and then I called out yesterday to do work, but I\u2019m so overwhelmed and have some unrelated mental health struggles due to trauma. What should I do?",

      "text": "A good rule of thumb is that one should expect to spend two to three hours per week on homework per credit they are taking. Some people take less, some people take more. I had a friend that worked something like full time in college, so it can be done, but it\u2019s hard and I\u2019d recommend trying to avoid it. That\u2019s one thing. \n\nSomething to try is the \u201cpomodoro method\u201d, which is basically 15 minutes studying, 5 minute break, 15 m studying, 5 minute break, 15 m studying, 20 m break, and then repeat. \n\nTalk with your profs like someone else mentioned. They want to help. \n\nPartial credit is better than no credit. Do what you can, move on for the moment if you get stuck on something and come back to it later, ask profs for extensions if needed. When they see folks are trying, they usually help.",

Remember, college will get you to the career you want, and your current job is not that job. To help manage classes, write down everything you get assigned as it is assigned so you don't miss anything. Then list them all in order- from most important to least important. (Or from what is due first to what is due last.) This is a technique I use to manage my everyday life anxiety. It puts everything you have to do in one place, and gives you a place to start, a step 1, step 2, step 3 and so on. If that helps but more could be done, write out a schedule. Spend an hour here, take 15 min break, continue until completion, take a shower to relieve stress, start this homework next, etc. Take care of yourself. Eat good foods, drink water, take a walk, do what relaxes you every once in a while. It pays off in the long run.",

I should\u2019ve known better than to let it get to this point, but I will absolutely not be dropping out like some people in these comments have suggested. That\u2019s honesty really disheartening and angering to see people suggest it. That job is not priority and will not be my life. It was also a depressive episode that got me to this point and I did go through the effort to speak to someone and be prescribed meds two days ago. I know that I can make this better, it\u2019s just the overwhelming panic of being behind in the first place and having to try and catch up while also struggling to focus or get up and do things due to an episode, but if I dropped out everytime  I have an episode, I\u2019ll have a shit life and get absolutely no where.",

Then cheak in (or stay on zoom and study buddy) to tell you did it. Also, first off, sit down and write down everything g you need to do and it's due date for the next couple weeks at least.

I would post up there for hours when I was behind in community college.\n\n4) make a plan, 1-5 things a day based on length. The idea here is to break it up into manageable chucks. Emphasis on the manageable! If you burn out you are fucked so take care of yourself. \n\n^ how I do it is a brain dump everything with dates in a master list and color code by urgency. Then I plan 3 days to a week depending on my anxiety level. I also mix in mild goals to break up the stress level. Last thing, do the small urgent stuff first, not only will it knock something off your plate, but you'll also feel accomplished and more set up for achievement\n\n5) it's okay if you need a break semester, your mental health comes first. I took a break semester to go to therapy for bipolar and PTSD. It's a tough question to ask yourself but try to be honest with what is too much, okay? Like its alright. It's going to be alright. \n\nGood luck and be well *hugs*",
