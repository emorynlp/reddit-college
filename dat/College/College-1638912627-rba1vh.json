  "text": "Im not sure what to do. I can't believe it took me /this/ long to realize just how bad my sight became, because I studied for my practical for physiology and realized that, on the test day, I studied literally blindly.\n\nLong story short, I literally had bad vision, saw everything pretty piss poor, because I had a big change in vision loss, and I'm very confident I botched it. (I didn't realize how bad it was mainly because again, I just got a pair back in May, and it kept getting weird)\n\nAnd it's only lab. I'm fine in lecture because it's recorded lecture. \n\nShould I just drop it or something?",
