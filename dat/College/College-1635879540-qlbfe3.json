  "text": "I know universities will post invites to some unique classes through the student's email but it made me wonder if there are zoom classes out there that anyone can join that are revolved around popular majors like Computer Engineering or Computer Science. The idea is that I'd like to partake in another course given the time just for practice, learn something new, and being in the learning environment.   \n\n\nCourses I'd be interested in are Physics 3, Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.",
