  "text": "Aight yall, I want to share cause these are proven tips to help reduce stress and help maximize studying.\n\n1. When stressed out, work out-  stress is the fight or flight, when you stress over test, you don't get the relief of the \"danger gone\" that happens after a fight or you run away. When you work out you release endorphins so brain feel good. Post workout, you \"trick\" your brain into thinking danger is gone. I do push ups when I cant focus until I feel beat and it helps.\n\n2. Nature- greenery and other stuff helps eases the mind, dont really understand why, but it helps ground a person. That is why you see so many nature pictures on hospital walls.\n\n3. Walking outdoors- helps ground a person, also does point 1 and 2.\n\n4. Confidence- its key, look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself you got this each morning, you a badass, remind yourself.\n\n5. HYDRATE- water is legit a miracle drug. Your brain is like 80% of the stuff. Helps neurons go faster and makes you feel better. Pee breaks are also good to keep the mind a rest in between sets.\n\n6. carbs- your brain is a slut for glucose, it prefers it instead of the other energy sources from fats and stuff. The brain also uses like 20% of energy by mass comparison or something like that, been a while since anatomy. It sucks energy, and loves its glucose.\n\n7. Sleep- its said a lot, has to be included here.\n\n8.relax- and I mean this before the exam. Get your sleep and before the exam, look over your notes maybe, then just accept whatever you will get and relax. Don't sweat it, you got it.\n\n9. Don't change answers- stress makes you second guess yourself, its been proven you are more likely to pick the right answer first when you can't decide. Something about the subconscious, I dont remember, thats been since 2013.\n\n10. Failure IS an option- and not terrible. You slipped up, fell off the horse, things happen. Review your mistakes, figure out how to improve, and crush it next semester. Dont make a habit of it though, there are consequences, it just isn't that bad.\n\n\nGood luck yall, see you next semester.",
