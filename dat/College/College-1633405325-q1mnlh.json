  "text": "I had a breakdown Thursday, Friday, and again today. The first 2 was over prob stats and this one I\u2019m currently going through is over A&P. I want to be a nurse and it\u2019s the only thing I see myself doing other than photography which is more of a hobby. Currently I\u2019m a ER tech and love my job and it\u2019s made me realize that there\u2019s nothing else I\u2019d rather do other than be a nurse. But I can\u2019t keep putting myself through this. These first 7 weeks of prereqs have been awful and my mental health has gone to absolute dog shit. I don\u2019t understand how I can study 40+ hours a week and still fail every fucking test I take. I do fine on quizzes and I feel confident with most of the information but I still fucking fail tests. It\u2019s extremely discouraging. There\u2019s a lot more to it but I don\u2019t feel like typing a longer essay than this already is.",
