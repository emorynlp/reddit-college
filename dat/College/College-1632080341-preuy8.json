  "text": "Hey everyone,  I wanted to ask for advice regarding degree choice. I am applying to the US, and Canada this year. After researching a while, I came to the conclusion that a business degree will work the best for me, as I don't want to \"restricted\" to a specific field for the rest of my life, I believe that a business degree is the most flexible. I don't know if I'm being naive but, I also **really** want to be self-employed in the future, and I'm surprised that not many of my peers feel the same way. Therefore I want my degree choice to enable me to do so potentially in the future. Honestly, I'm not even sure if a business degree is a good choice, since many people seem to scoff at business degrees and say that they are easy and what you learn is common sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom my current research, I've narrowed it down to, MIS, marketing, and Finance so far. MIS sounds interesting due to the technological aspect that it presents and with the world becoming more computer-based I think it's a good degree. Marketing sounds appealing to me because it feels like the best major to learn a skill and best enable me to run my own business in the future. And finance also sounds very valuable because of the very valuable skills you learn from it. Also I kind of am contemplating computer science too with a minor in business? i'm not really sure how that would work but it sounds interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really need some help, any advice would be appreciated. I tend to really take my time on important choices and I would really appreciate **any** input from you guys. thanks!",
