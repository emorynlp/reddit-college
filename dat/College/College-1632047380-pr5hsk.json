Getting a couple hours less here and there is okay, but always make sure you get your sleep (unless medically impossible- like insomnia). Your work will suffer if you don\u2019t. Your mind just won\u2019t work to its full capacity and this will impact your grades even if you manage to get all your work done.",

      "text": "I legit stayed up for 44 hours recently as a commuter college student. For context, I did this because I\u2019d needed to stay up really late to write a paper worth 15% of my grade and then attend an entire day of classes immediately after. My first class of the following day was at 9:30am and the final one ended at 6:20pm. I had to stay on campus, all day, with no sleep. Let me just tell you this: you can do it and stay awake with some coffee or some energy drinks and water, but you\u2019re going to retain very little from the lectures and you\u2019re going to have such a strong urge to sleep that you\u2019ll feel irrationally angry at everything the professor says. Then you\u2019ll have to make up for it with \u201csleep debt\u201d and you won\u2019t feel good the next day unless you get to sleep for 9-12 hours to make up for it. It\u2019s a myth that staying up all night corrects your sleep schedule so, ultimately it throws your entire week off just for one all nighter.",

I highly reccomend watching this video about sleep and good study habits, it recently helped me put a few things in perspective: https://youtu.be/c0fp7kB2vuU\n\nI have some horrible ADHD, and have experienced many major depressive episodes in my life. My mental health can easily fall into the gutter if I allow it to. Circumstances exasperate these kinds of mental health issues, as do habitual thoughts. However, at least in my experience, probably 50% is physiological. Eat healthy foods. Get enough sleep and establish good sleep hygiene. See a mental health professional to see if medication would be a good option for you. Exercise and get some sunlight. You will be much more productive and happy.\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you stay up for two days straight. You are probably in this situation in the first place due to poor time management (been there, it happens, and sometimes you really can't help it). Your body will have to adjust, and you will lose even more time, and you will probably have to do it again pretty soon. It's not sustainable.\n\nGet some sleep, accept the loss, and just do the best you can. Email your professors about possible extensions, and explain your situation to them ahead of time. They might give you extra credit options, extra time, or even just a bit more patience and understanding.\n\nAlso I hate to be an armchair therapist, but look up ADHD symptoms and see if they apply to you at all (disorganization, forgetfulness, poor time-management, \"laziness\"). Your comments remind me of how I was before I was diagnosed as an adult---it's an extremely misunderstood disorder (not all about squirrels and bouncing off walls). Again, self-diagnosis can be dangerous, but it might be something worth looking into.",

After a certain point you kind of catch a second wind and get this energy after being tired for several hours before. I'm not sure if that's an everybody thing or just a me thing. But then towards the end you get exhausted again and start having mini blackouts, like I'd close my eyes and 5, 10, 15 minutes would pass before I opened them again. Would definitely not recommend it unless it's for a big project that you're doing last minute, which is a situation you shouldn't get into in the first place. \n\nPerhaps try changing up your study habits, go to office hours, utilize academic counseling, etc. to be more efficient with your time. \n\nI get the whole thing with appeasing your mother, I'm Asian and there's a lot of internalized pressure to do well in school and all that, but after a certain point, you have to learn to prioritize your own well being. The purpose of existing is way beyond just pleasing your parents and taking care of them when they're elderly, no matter how many times you've been told otherwise. I've been in the place where it feels like you've failed completely and have nothing to live for just because your academics are going to shit, it's a terrible place that I hopefully won't ever be in again.

Now I limit the hours I work and I limit the activities I do during the semester. For example, I am an undergrad teacher assistant but I did not do research as I knew it would be too much. I also try to balance out my semesters; this semester I\u2019m taking a lot of easier classes as next semester I will only have a few hard ones. I also try to do studying as much as I can at school. I study in between classes and sometimes I will not leave until I finish my studying goals for the day. You also have to know what you can get away with and what you cant which again, takes a lot of practice and there\u2019s been times where I have failed things because I waited too long and gave up.",

I would recommend talking to them about this. This is too much stress for someone to put on themselves.\n\nI hope you're doing okay. Remember, no matter what you do (please get rest) you'll be okay.\n\nAnd there is actual studies proving that a lack of sleep and cramming will actually make you remember LESS than what you would learn normally, and you'll do horribly on assignments and tests without it. You might as well do your assignments, tests, studying ex. drunk as a skunk.\n\nAgain, please discuss this with someone. You and your health are more important than that. We are here for you.",

Can seriously mess with your mental health, my aunt did this unintentionally and it triggered psychosis it was very bad. What you need to do is start developing better time management skills. Make a schedule and stick to it. Instead of cramming for calculus for the week, start studying an hour or so every day weeks before. You aren\u2019t stupid if you\u2019re not getting it. Something just isn\u2019t clicking so I\u2019d suggest meeting with your professor or getting a tutor. You won\u2019t have to cram if you start studying right away. Seriously I\u2019d rather you lose some social time or study time than try to go without sleep for that long. If you really feel like you have to, I\u2019d say aim for AT LEAST 4 hours of sleep each night but ONLY for 2 nights in a row max. Your body and mind will thank you. Also, by some of your comments I think you\u2019d seriously benefit from some counseling or therapy sessions. See if your school offers them for free and try to go.",
