  "text": "But I\u2019ve never like, just skipped a class before. I\u2019ve gotten sick, in which case I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to class, and I think one time I missed a morning class after doing work throughout the night and sleeping through my alarm, but I\u2019ve never like, willingly skipped a class before. Given the holidays though, do students usually just leave early? I\u2019ve seen quite a few people just dip like now, but I don\u2019t know if this is the norm or not",

There was a professor but you never saw them, they were just available to contact in case of issues or questions. For certain classes you absolutely can teach yourself the material. For other classes its vital to have someone explain it to you. It also depends on the person which class is which. But, its possible.",

Why are you acting like its 1 or the other, learn from the professor or the textbook? You can do both. Missing a class in which the professor goes over sections 3.3-3.5 isnt the end of the world because you can study those sections on your own and contact the professor if you have clarifying questions. The bulk of actual learning is done on your own outside of class, professors dont spoon feed you material. You also have to do the work.",

(I did include a question that gave them 10 free points just for showing up, so I wasn't entirely evil, I guess.) The next year, I lightened up a little and made the quiz extra credit only. Now I just cancel class and make up a 'video analysis' activity that essentially amounts to watching something that is genuinely interesting and related to the material and then writing 2 sentences about it so that I know you were conscious for most of it.  \nSo, you may have professors who ream you on that day (and I am ashamed that I was one of those once), but I think that most will plan for many students to be out.",

I had to pay out of pocket and get a high enough GPA to get my financial aid back. I went to therapy for mental health problems as well. It wasn\u2019t easy to reverse the school\u2019s decision until I brought my GPA up and explained my situation.",
