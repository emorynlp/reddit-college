  "text": "what am i supposed to do when I'm failing a class so bad that there's no coming back from it?\n\ni'm a freshman. I'm taking a class that has nothing to do with my major because everything was closed when i got to register and i just needed to take something to fill my schedule. it happens to be a subject that i really dislike and the class time is really inconvenient for me so attending is difficult and when I am there, there's absolutely nothing keeping my attention. needless to say, i have very badly fallen behind due to missing work and missing class.\n\neven if i attend every class from now to the end of the semester, turn in the weekly homework, and ace all of the remaining exams, i will not make a passing grade. the professor does not accept late work and is completely unwilling to be flexible. is there even a point in going at all now? the class is once a week so only have a handful of classes left before the semester is over next month. should i try to get caught up to the best of my ability? or should i just give up on this class all together and focus all of my attention on the rest of my classes? I'm so lost when it comes to this sort of thing.",

If it\u2019s not pass midpoint which I doubt because it\u2019s November unless your school works differently then it\u2019ll show up as only W which wouldn\u2019t affect your gpa",

Just use it as an opportunity to realize you need to take every class seriously in college, even the electives that have nothing to do with your major.\n\nGo to every class you can next semester and don't skip classes even if its tempting.",

Just fail gracefully and keep studying. Does your school let you \"repeat to replace\" where you take the class over and you can replace your grade? like the F stays on your transcript but wont count towards your gpa.",
