I\u2019m of the opinion that you are an adult and can make your own decisions, so I don\u2019t take attendance for a grade. If you want to skip class once or twice, you might not miss anything that would substantively affect your grade. If you want to skip a lot, you\u2019d be unlikely to pass my classes (not because I give special points to attendees or anything - it\u2019s just how it tends to be). It all depends on how your professors are.",

Even if I got absolutely nothing out it, at the very least I would have some idea of where the professor lost me and work from there. Not to mention you never know what nuggets of information you will get from a professor that will be helpful on an exam.",

Attending and paying attention is good to at least be familiar with what is in the course, even if it feels like you'd be better off using the time for other work. You still need to spend a lot of time studying and looking at recommended material.",
