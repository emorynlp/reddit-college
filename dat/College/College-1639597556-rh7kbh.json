  "text": "I had a meeting with a counselor just now and I had already applied to a few CSU\u2019s for next fall and didn\u2019t realize I didn\u2019t meet the 60 credit requirement to do so and instead of me finishing my 2 years at a CC, I have to do an extra year which I really don\u2019t want to do. I graduated high school a year earlier than my peers and being ahead is like a big thing for me even though it\u2019s kinda messing me up. The only things that\u2019s keeping me going is the off chance that MAYBE one of the schools I applied to will still accept me. How do I emotionally deal w this? :(",

How many units do you currently have (or plan to finish by spring 2022? If you are able to wrap it up during summer you have a chance.",

      "text": "I was in the same boat as you a year ago, except I didn't talk with an academic advisor at all during my time at CC. I screwed up my credits by having enough to transfer, but not enough to finish my Associates degree and transfer agreement. I sucked it up and took classes over summer, and finished my fall and spring semesters this year. I'm still going to graduate a year behind my peers, but I don't care about that anymore. I'm still getting a degree, just a little later. If you can handle taking a max amount of credits, do it. Take classes over summer. Otherwise, just keep your head up. It sucks to think about, but all you can do right now is keep going.",
