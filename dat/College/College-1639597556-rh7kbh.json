  "text": "I had a meeting with a counselor just now and I had already applied to a few CSU\u2019s for next fall and didn\u2019t realize I didn\u2019t meet the 60 credit requirement to do so and instead of me finishing my 2 years at a CC, I have to do an extra year which I really don\u2019t want to do. I graduated high school a year earlier than my peers and being ahead is like a big thing for me even though it\u2019s kinda messing me up. The only things that\u2019s keeping me going is the off chance that MAYBE one of the schools I applied to will still accept me. How do I emotionally deal w this? :(",

How many units do you currently have (or plan to finish by spring 2022? If you are able to wrap it up during summer you have a chance.",

      "text": "I was in the same boat as you a year ago, except I didn't talk with an academic advisor at all during my time at CC. I screwed up my credits by having enough to transfer, but not enough to finish my Associates degree and transfer agreement. I sucked it up and took classes over summer, and finished my fall and spring semesters this year. I'm still going to graduate a year behind my peers, but I don't care about that anymore. I'm still getting a degree, just a little later. If you can handle taking a max amount of credits, do it. Take classes over summer. Otherwise, just keep your head up. It sucks to think about, but all you can do right now is keep going.",

      "text": "A part of growing up is learning that sometimes in college (im graduating next semester myself!) it doesn\u2019t always go according to plan. Sometimes you need to take extra classes, drop a class, retake a class because, well, shit happens haha. What im tryna say is, it doesnt matter how long it takes to finish it, just stick with it, you\u2019ll eventually get there. Education isnt a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. It\u2019s okay to take more time, 99% of people myself included take extra time to graduate. Get out of your head, no one but yourself cares about the pace at which you go. I suffered from that mentality as well initially, but I just tell myself that I\u2019m the main character in my world and just a side character in everyone else\u2019s. Meaning, everyone is so concerned with their own shit they dont pay attention to you as much as we may think people do. We\u2019re just side characters in their lives! Makes you realize how unimportant others perspective really is.\n\nAnd i went to a community college and transferred to an out of state school, trust me itll all work out \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",
