  "text": "Question. I was wondering how credit hours work in college? I was hoping to go to community college for a year and then transfer, but I need 30 credit hours before I can. I was wondering if each class is 3 credit hours an i were to take 5 classes per semester do take those classes the next semester an earn another 3 credit hours like you would in high school with the (.5) credits\n\nIf I sign up for example English 1101, which is 3 credit hours, do I take the second part the second semester of college and earn 6 credit hours for both semesters like you would in high school. or once i finish it do i completely forget about that class an sign up for new ones the following semester an only earn 3 crit hours for that class\n\nSorry for the confusion, first gen here.",
