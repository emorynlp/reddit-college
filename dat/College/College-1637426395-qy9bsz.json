  "text": "Hey guys! So I\u2019m going to college in the Midwest soon and man I heard it gets **cold**. I\u2019m from a *hot* country and my college advised all internationals to buy clothes after arriving in the States due to the selection, cost, and convenience. \n\nSo where do y\u2019all get your snow boots, thick coats, the whole shebang? Any specific retailers or websites? Preferably on the cheaper side. And what do you pair it with? (Jeans/snowpants?) (hat+scarf?) (thick shirts/layers?). I\u2019m completely clueless and new to the whole extreme winter thing. \n\nAppreciate any responses!",

      "text": "so [patagonia](https://wornwear.patagonia.com) is pretty popular, only problem i have with it is that even their used stuff is pricey for me. i got my winter stuff through thrifting mainly, with my coat coming from thredup.  if you do decide to thrift i can help you know what to look for. for context, where i live it gets below freezing every day in winter.\n\ni don't think i've worn snowpants since i was a child. they're suuuper bulky (for me at least) and i'd rather just wear a long coat or fleece-lined leggings under regular pants. i also have knee-high boots to help with that i guess.\n\nmy coat has a high neck and i've got a ton of hair so i don't really find the need for a scarf or hat but people definitely wear them. ear muffs too, especially if it's windy. you'll probably prefer wearing a mask too because it traps the heat from your breath around your face lol.\n\ndon't wear cotton. synthetics + wool + furs are all i would wear. cotton absorbs water and getting wet is WAY worse than getting cold. if you can wear all wools and furs, do that. pretty much any fabric that won't wick sweat or moisture is a hard no.\n\nalso get gloves. preferably leather or something waterproof in case you touch something icy or snowy. mittens are warmer fyi, especially if you get fur-lined ones, but phones exist. if you're getting fabric gloves you can get ones that have patches of stitching/embroidery on the fingers so it's easier to use your phone.\n\nsorry for the length, i'm not sure what you already know. good luck :)",

              "text": "A real quick primer for staying warm: \nMaterials don't insulate, they create dead air space which insulates. Fluffy sweaters will be warmer than a fleece jacket, given no wind. Air moving through that fluffy sweater will replace the air warmed by your bodyheat with cold air from the environment. To stop this you cover the insulation layer with a wind blocking layer. Now you're warm, but you can get TOO warm! If you sweat, you get the insulation wet, which does two things. First, water moves heat very efficiently, so it chills you. Second, water makes fluffy insulation stick to itself, it decreases it's *loft*. Making the insulation layer thinner, and less effective.\n\nLayers are the solution, layering let's you customize the thickness of the insulation so you minimize sweat, and stay warm. The second technique is venting. A big oversized wind block layer let's you flap the front of it sending cool air through it. It's a *bellows* effect, sending fresh dry cooling air through the insulation layer to stop overheating.\n\nMy favorite solution is using an air \"slowing\" layer instead of a wind blocking layer. A felted wool coat or jacket is my preference. Air can move slowly through it keeping you from overheating. This is the magic of wool, not that it's super warm, but it really helps prevent overheating.\n\nMy cold weather preference is a couple thinner layers vs one thicker coat. A ventable wind \"slowing\" shell layer overtop a wool shirt and a thin-ish wool sweater are more versatile and less expensive than a big winter coat.\n\nI was a third shift snowmaker at a ski resort, I worked 10:00 PM to 7:00 am making snow in Maine. We all wore several layers with a goretex shell on top.",

Great for switching between seasons. \n\nI would also recommend a coat that goes past your butt. If you plan to go to games or other winter activities having a coat that is long enough to sit on is amazing! It also keeps more of you warm! I have loved both Columbia and Eddie Bauer.\n\nYou will want a pair of snowboots for walks around campus, but also some cute buries for if you need to dress up, but stay warm. I like a basic black with a slight chunky heel. Matches everything and they keep me warm between stops. I thrift my cute booties and invested in Columbia for my snowboots. \n\nKeep a extra of gloves, hats, and socks in your bag/car. Great if the weather changes fast or if a friend needs them. I always buy some cheep gloves from Walmart, but keep a nice waterproof pair in my car or room if I need to shovel, clear a windshield, or if I play in the snow. Scarves are my best friend since I hate zipping up my coat to my chin. It's a preference thing.",

Carhartt beanies are the most popular hats for the age range. \n\nBest places to go for all these things: REI & Scheels\n\n\nIf you have a car: Never let your gas tank get below 1/4 in the winter, get some cat litter n keep it in your trunk, have a tow company with good reviews saved in your contacts. Always let your car heat up for 10-15 minutes before you drive it, if you don\u2019t have a temp controlled garage. \n\nThrift stores are a good place to check, REI has a killer sale right now, everything up to 25% off.",

But if you\u2019re bad at handling the cold, I highly suggest going for some thick winter pants, a wind breaking jacket with solid insulation and hoodie, and a nice, warm face mask.\n\nHonestly, if you get really cold, get a thermal insulating shirt/pant to wear under your outerwear. I have a thermal layer from the military and I love it. I could honestly wear jeans and a windbreaker in snow if I put those things underneath.",

It seems it\u2019s much (45%) less expensive in Japan and neighbouring countries (makes sense). The stores in my country are relatively new and few and I haven\u2019t been in a few years but yep, quite pricey!

Darn Tough or Smart Wool are the best out there. And don\u2019t forget some gloves.\n\nLived in the upper Midwest my whole life for the most part and that is my setup.

One thing I will say to get at least one is one of those Carhartt jackets.. super durable and comfortable. Probably just as popular there as there were here.\n\nI never really used snow boots per se, I substituted them with a nice pair of wool socks (smart wool I think?) and hiking boots or really just normal shoes  for places that were plowed I.e college campuses. I normally wore a fleece with a windbreaker or my pea coat I had. I just wore jeans to class or chinos for when I worked my job on campus. Probably would recommend getting long johns or thermal underwear to be honest. Me boys got a little cold on some days. Oh and get two pairs of gloves. One for your car when you need to scrape the ice off your windows and another pair as general wear. I usually forget my pair when scraping my car.",

Alpaca tends to be lightweight while being extremely warm. Layers are your friend. And earmuffs.",

I also LOVE the flannel lined jeans from Eddie Bauer they fit a little tighter than most pants because they\u2019re so thick so you may want to size up but they\u2019re very nice and warm when you need a little extra.",

When we got there, we went to Ross because we wanted to get real winter clothes for our parents and some friends. I couldn\u2019t believe the variety of clothes selection for winter, coats, jackets, puffy jackets, cardigans, light jackets, wind breakers. Honestly, you don\u2019t have to look deep into some places where you can go to Ross and get them cheap. Just buy them as you go you know, when winter hits get winter clothes and summer get summer clothes or whatever.",

      "text": "/r/femalefashionadvice has a side bar for layering when it's cold as balls out. Even if your a dude, it'll be useful.\n\nI'm Canadian, but most of the stores are the same as the US so, here's my suggestions assuming your dealing with 0c to -20c range normally. It gets harder when colder.\n\n* Get a locker. You might not NEED it, but it helps to have somewhere to shove your crap in Winter.\n* Your school will have tracked snow in winter in all hallways, if you swap out shoes indoors, be aware of this. Rip my nice shoes ;-; \n* Don't get wet in Winter. That's the number one rule and it sucks. That includes sweating. You'll learn you need layers because every bus and indoor place is boiling. Also get those small fold up bags, because boiling and carrying coat is annoying. Malls sometimes have lockers, but also you can just yeet it in a bag.\n* Go to Dollar Store ie Dollar General, Dollarama, Dollar Tree (note some of these are $5 and less not $1) - Go here and get some cheap thin gloves. Bonus points if touch screen gloves. Layer these under mitts or waterproof gloves when cold. Get 2-3. They get lost. Buy at least one cheap hat and scarf if needed. Buy yourself some fuzzy socks, and maybe slippers. It's cold at home! If it's super cold, get a ski mask as well.\n* Or go to Ardene / Clair's / Forever 21 / Urban Planet - Similar stuff as above, but often higher quality or more fashionable. Pick out some stuff you'll wear, get at least another either wind/water proof mitts or some winter rated ones. \n* Buy both a fabric scarf and a big normal scarf. Lots of heat escapes your neck area! The fabric one is good for extreme wind and cold, as you can wrap it around your face more. You look dumb, but whatever I have 15 min for a bus to show up and it's cold enough to get frostbite in 120 seconds. Big scarf is just cause you are warm, and hide your face in it like a turtle.\n*  Buy fleece lined leggings. Giant Tiger (I'm broke) was the place I got mine last, but many places will have some. Otherwise get some leggings in general, Old Navy has great ones, Walmart, so on. You layer these under jeans / pants when it's cold as balls. \n* Get one or two larger then average sweat pants. Wear these over your pants when it's cold as balls and take them off inside. Inside will be 20c to 22c so the leggings plan can sometimes leave you sweating. Ski pants also work, and are wind proof but unless your actively going out hiking you are unlikely to need it.\n* If your male or have smaller hips, you can get great winter stuff from work ware places. Fleece lined carhartts, jeans that are wind and water proofed and fleece lined, stuff rated to -50. Expensive, and very limited options in store (unless dude) but warm as shit \n* Buy some cheap crappy undershirts or camis. Quick to dry prefered. If it's cold enough, wearing them under your bra can help the my underwire is cold now uncomfortable bit. Either way, more layers good. \n* Buy at least one cheap blanket scarf / poncho thing. It's cheap, and sometimes your too hot for the sweater, but too cold for your tee-shirt. Wrap that around. In a pinch the scarves to bought work, but are less fashionable.\n* Skirts are a toss up. If it's not very cold but windy, you can usually get away with normal leggings and a thick skirt to break the wind. If it's extremely cold, wear the fleece lined leggings. Long dresses can also help just avoid maxis. This is only really useful in the city, if your hiking the pant layering is better.\n* Boots. If your REALLY stuck, you can wear garbage bags over shoes and tie them up. This is more of a solution if your in like Mexico and it snows, but good to know.  \n* You have to sorta penguin shuffle in boots when it's icy out, especially if they haven't salted / sanded the sidewalks yet. \n* Keep in mind when it's warm (-3c and up) sometimes the bottom of snow melts and top refreezes overnight, which means running over old snow drifts can get your foot soaked.  \n* You want 2+ pairs of shoes you can wear in Winter, if you wear the same boots 24/7 they smell. That being said, no rush. Also wear your biggest socks when shopping for them!\n* You will need to wash off your boots a lot, to avoid marks from the salt / sand / water.\n* Get a boot tray and mat for the door, as there will be snow in the boot sole that melts everywhere. \n* You can sorta get away with normal shoes it it's consistently cold, probably -10 to -15 for a few days, and you don't walk through snow / unshoveled paths. That being said, there's a risk to that and you can get frostbite wearing pretty shoes so, ymmv. \n* Thermal Socks, I like Smart Wool but honestly, just get a few. Most days are fine with whatever socks, but -40c is cold as balls. These are expensive. Also buy a cheap pack of extra socks, and leave one or two in locker. If your feet are wet, you'll be miserable. Worth it to swap them out so often.\n* Coat. Costco is my sister's suggestion (you need a membership) but honestly, this depends on you. _Generally_ avoiding fast fashion places (Walmart, Forever 21) will get you warmer coats, coats often have stuff talking about why they are warm and rating. North Face is expensive, Canada Goose is an expensive popular brand, any hunting or sporting shop will have medium ones. Until you can get a proper coat, I vote layer undershirt, top, thin sweater, some kinda windbreaker, oversized hoodie. The wind break layer should help. Otherwise if you have family here, ask if you can borrow someone's. A larger coat is chilly, but will work. \n* Coats with trimmed in waists and wrists, will be warmest. As well as ones that cover the zipper. Double breasted is actually very warm too. You can use a giant scarf as a belt (or a normal belt) to make them slightly warmer.\n* If using headphones with a cord, either get ones with removable cord or use cheap headphones. The extreme cold makes the cord more prone to breakage so replace the $10 cord not the $150 headphones. \n\nHonestly, the short answer is wear more layers. It also wouldn't be a bad idea to go to thrift stores and consignment shops to stock up on some cheap extra sweaters and stuff.",
