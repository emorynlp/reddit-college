  "text": "I have a meeting with my advisor on Monday, since I need to drop my stats class. Idk when I\u2019ll be able to take it again. I\u2019m in my fifth semester of a four year bachelor degree, and it\u2019s looking like it might take me five years. I\u2019m 22, friends my age graduated in may. My younger sister is in the same semester for a nursing degree, she\u2019s never not been on the deans list and will probably be graduating near the top of her class. I\u2019m repeating courses I can\u2019t pass, all because of a fucking math disability. Every adult in my family has at least two degrees they got in the typical four year span. I feel so fucking stupid. I wish I could go back and switch my major to something easier, even though my field is the only thing I\u2019m interested in. \n\nIs this normal? Am I overreacting?",

The average for a bachelors now is 5 years anyway. And besides that, comparison is the thief of joy, you should be proud of where you are right now. if you\u2019re not, then I\u2019m proud of ya op.",

You don't have to put your GPA on your resume, and once you get a few years of work experience it's kind of expected to not have it there. An employer 5 years from now won't really care what your class ranking is compared to your sister, they just want to see a degree.",
