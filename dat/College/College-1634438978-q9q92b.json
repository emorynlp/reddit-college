  "text": "I'm a college freshman, and I find the work extremely difficult, so I ask my TAs a lot of questions at every opportunity. I also email them 5-10 times a week. It seems to be working because my grades are fine and they have been nice about it, but sometimes it takes me half an hour to write an email or ask a question because I get so anxious and guilty about needing help. I'm afraid my TAs think I'm stupid and lazy, and I know that I'm supposed to be figuring out the material myself because this is college and I shouldn't need anyone to hold my hand. I hate asking for help, and I only do it as an absolute last resort after I have tried everything that I can because I don't want to be a burden, but it seems like the only real choice I have is asking for help or failing because everything is so damn hard. I'm terrified of getting to upper division classes and failing them and having to drop out because I'll lose my scholarship.",

      "text": "TAs are there to help. The questions that you're asking may be questions that other students also have. You may be helping your classmates by being the student brave enough to speak up. \n\nIt's good for the instructors and TAs to know what questions their students have. They can adjust how they're explaining important concepts and clarify things in advance. \n\nAsk your questions, relax, and be kind to yourself.",

      "text": "One of the biggest obstacles to overcome in college is asking for help. Learning to ask for help and realize that it\u2019s okay to do so is one of the biggest skills you can take away from your prerequisite/lower level classes. However, relying strictly on TAs wouldn\u2019t be the best idea because TAs aren\u2019t always going to be helpful in every single course. I recommend using an online resource to supplement your learning (I.e. YouTube/Khan Academy), or some of the facilities and online tutors offered by your school.",

      "text": "I am a TA and I would much rather the students ask me questions than not. It's why I am a TA so people can come in and ask me questions during office hours, the more questions the better, in my opinion, it shows you are interested in learning (or at least that's how I feel lol). Maybe ask the TA's advice on how to study better, so that way when you get to upper-level courses you don't need as much help. I always try to offer students advice on how to study for the course, like what worked for me etc.",

In fact it actually shows good work skills, because in academia/industry you are going to ask for help from your boss.\n\nIf you have a question which is too much help (like asking straight for the answer), the TAs will just say they can\u2019t answer it and everything\u2019s fine.",
