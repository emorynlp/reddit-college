  "text": "So i have studied two years in college and got my mechanical engineering diploma, and currently i am studying to get my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and all those years i have been in college thanks to a grant i got. Anyways this grant states that if i get a full time job i will have to pay my tuition moving forward. And I recently got accepted at my dream job, and its soo stupid because my university is asking me to pay this semester (fall) even though the finals are like in two weeks and i would move on to spring semester and I thought that the grant would and should cover this fall semester because i just got the job this week but it doesn\u2019t matter, i saw the tuition fees and honestly WTF!! Why is education soo expensive.. 860 USD PER 1 CREDIT!! And the minimum credits allowed in spring and fall are 12 .. so like 10,300 per semester.. this has opened my eyes to soo much and now i can honestly appreciate and feel for the people that try their hardest. In my country most people get that grant but alot cant get the grant (and most of them are stateless people) and it breaks my heart .. i wish i can do something. I stream and make content sometimes and i have decided to make all my donations go to fundraising for tuition fees because it\u2019s ridiculous and i know its hard and it would crush people\u2019s souls, like honestly imagine you just finished highschool and you are told you cant go to university because you cant afford it... its not much but its the least i can do.",

The same is true in the high-profile academic programs.",

Colleges became massive sprawling service centers.\n\nWhat pays for your campuses gym? Student center? Technology center? IT department? All the different type student services including staff? Parking structures where debt is being payed down and staff?\n\nAll these things aren't free.",
