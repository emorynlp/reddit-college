  "text": "Hear me out first!\n\nI'm surprised\u00a0but scared because I'm not as stressed as I should be. My fear grows as I read Reddit threads in\u00a0college\u00a0and\u00a0my\u00a0university's\u00a0own\u00a0student reddit page on how bad this semester is for them.\n\nI'm ahead of the material. I think that my time management skills (not bragging or anything) are superb, in that I'm not worried about due dates since I get everything done in an efficient timely manner. It helps TREMENDOUSLY that I do not have to waste time ***Commuting***.\n\nI just watch the pre-recorded lectures when they're supposed to be watched. For example, if I only have a cancer biology lecture on Mondays, then that's the ***only lecture content*** that I'll be doing that day. The rest of the day I spend doing coursework and assignments, and by the time I get to 6-7 PM, I'm relaxing.\n\nI'm in my fourth year of biology. Instead of doing a thesis, I chose to take more upper/senior year courses on physiology, as I hate research.\n\nI do get this constant feeling that I'm missing something ... but I'm not ...",

      "text": "Honestly I feel that the college experience depends *a lot* on the classes you are taking and the way they are structured. For my asynchronous class I have no Zoom meetings, 2 homework assignments every week, and an exam every three weeks. It's great for me. There are no everyday assignments that take up my time, and the quizzes are pretty easy. The biggest difference between my best class and my worst class is that the best ones aren't super demanding. No daily homework allowed me to spend time taking quality notes instead of worrying about what I have to do _that day_, and it is a lot less stress inducing than what I have in my other classes. I feel like the best classes I have recognized the reduction in productivity that came with remote learning and appropriately reduced the workload that we have to accomplish.",

Like real coffee from a keurig, not instant. I think I might try french press, or look for a job! \n\nI also feel like my profs got easier, and that I should have more credits, but I sat down and couldn't find any other classes in my major or minor offered this semester, or in general- I'm nearly done. I think communications in general is an \"easy A\" major, but it was also recommended to me by the college based on what advisors thought of my \"neurological preferences\", i.e., they claim it's as hard as any other just easy if you have the social studies kinda brain. Idk. My minor is environ and that still gives me pains.",

      "text": "At my school, I'd have to allow 10 minutes for a 5 minute walk because of elevators and getting stuck behind slow walkers. I'd have to rush to my next class if it was in a different building. The good seats would be taken unless you arrived 5 minutes early. Bathrooms were inconveniently located and sometimes there was a line. I don't miss any of that. Plus my bathroom is cleaner. \n\nMoving back in with my mom was tough at first (I'm a grad student and I had summer research during undergrad so I moved out at 19), but honestly it is better than with a random roommate who resents you because she liked living alone over summer and no one complained about her gross habits. I can take up space and exist here. \n\nI'm also in a cheaper CoL place. I buy the food for the house as my rent, and it's still less than what I was spending. I'm not the only one who cooks and we take turns. It's nice to not have to make food on busy nights or to open the fridge to something my mom prepared. It's also nice to know that my finances are going into her equity and that means less I'll have to help with if she doesn't have enough money upon retirement. \n\nIt is a lot quieter here and I'm used to the sounds like gunshots on the local range instead of ambulances and honking horns. It is much easier to focus. I used to have to go all the way to the library, putz around trying to find a seat, just to find somewhere quiet to concentrate. My mom's business space is far from where I study, and she works alone, so usually that works out.",

It\u2019s another 20-30 minutes walking from the parking lot, and another 10-15 minutes to walk to any given class, sometimes sprinting because the campus is so big. At the end of the day I\u2019ve walked/run up to six miles and am totally exhausted, not just from lectures but also from having hard classes all day from 7:30am until 5pm (curse you lab classes). On a good day I would have 4 hours to get homework done with a schedule like this, granted I neglect to cook for myself or workout or do any kind of self care. Though I\u2019d often take a huge chunk out of my sleep schedule to study until 3am because what other time is there?\n\nNow, I don\u2019t have to get up at 6am for class unless I want to\u2014and I do, to go workout like I\u2019ve literally never had the time to do. I have a guaranteed 8 hours a day to work on homework, go to class, take notes, and contact teachers for tutoring. I now can cook healthy meals for myself and save money. And at the end of the day I can get a full 8 hours sleep. For once college isn\u2019t forcing my health to decline, so I can actually focus on making good grades *and* being healthy. \n\nI suppose the downside though is that I have a hard time learning by reading and need lectures, but I am lucky only one of my classes operates without any kind of lectures.",

It's just nice hearing about someone adjusting and finding online school pleasant, instead of the constant tirade about online school being an incovenience and students not learning much from it. It's just a matter of adapting and finding what works best for you. Hope you have a successful academic year!",

There were no semesters or terms, every thing was asynchronous. Once I was enrolled, all my subjects and their modules were on the dashboard, and I can speed through all of them whenever and however I want. There was only one instance where I got to talk to my adviser, which was regarding my research, but everything was done through email. \n\nThat was the reason I had a hard time adjusting. I was used to the structured mode of education, and everything I was used to was not I expected.\n\nIt really depends on the person if you like a more laidback education where you have control over everything that you do, or, like me, who thrive on a systematic, week-by-week delivery of materials. \n\nThe very reason why I left that institution, despite them also offering college programs and being cheaper than the rest, to transfer to a diff uni with term system and a weekly objective. Win-win for me, at least I get to meet some people in this one.",

Hopefully after all this universities will see the value in having both physical and online classes to suit different types of students.",

I guess it\u2019s just about finding out what works for you.
