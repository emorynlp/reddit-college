  "title:": "why do some people not send answers?",
  "text": "I have a decent amount of people's phone numbers from my school, and when I ask for answers for a homework thing or something people just don't respond??? They'll respond to every text except if I ask them homework. I have this one friend here we would have normal texts first, but ever since I started asking him for answers he hasn't been responding? It's like I know you see my messages why can you not send me the answers to the thing? Now I'm not an entitled person. I understand other people don't exist just so that they can send me answers. But like why do people not send me answers when I ask for them? I did find one friend here that will send answers. She'll send the answers to anything I ask for and she responds fast too. That's a telltale sign if someone usually responds really fast and then when you ask for an answer they just don't respond, they're straight up ignoring you. Anyone else experience this issue?",

Usually in that case, folks are quietly studying together or asking each other for help with material, not just asking for answers.",
