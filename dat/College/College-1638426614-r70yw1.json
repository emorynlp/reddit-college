  "text": "I\u2019m going to try to keep this short because I don\u2019t want to write a book on here. \n\nBasically, I\u2019ve been living with the same people in my college apartment for the past 2 years. All was well and I was planning on living with them again next year. Long story short, that\u2019s no longer happening. Recently, I ran in to an old friend from high school and it turns out he needs a fourth roommate for next year. So my options now are live on my own in a studio apartment, or go live with this guy and his 2 room mates. I\u2019m curious what living alone is like, but I\u2019m only a junior and that seems like a big step in to the real world, so to speak.",
