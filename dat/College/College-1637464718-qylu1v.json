  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI know this seems like a very silly and basic question, but bear with me. I am a first year community college student trying to decide whether branching out from my local schools is worth it. There seems to be this romanticized ideal of \u201cthe college experience,\u201d but what is living in a dorm + on campus ACTUALLY like? Is it better, worse, the same as living at home and commuting?",

      "text": "You learn skills and become much more independent from your parents. It also allows you to have easier access to clubs/involvement on campus (free food) and also study spaces. Generally going to a school out of state is good too. Helps you develop a different mentality on various topics because of your interaction with people from different backgrounds and cultures (gets you away from a small town mentality where everyone thinks the same or likes the same thing).",

      "text": "It's expensive and you do put up with some bs. For me though I really enjoyed being in the thick of it. Eat, sleep and work all within a mile of each other. Going to speeches/events. Can decide on a whim to take a stroll through campus. It's a big difference when the \"full\" college life is at your fingertips rather than on the other side of town.",
