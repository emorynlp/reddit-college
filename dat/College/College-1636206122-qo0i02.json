  "title:": "Should I Come All the Way to China to Study at Tsinghua University?",
  "text": "Hey people!  \nso a little background: I'm a Syrian undergrad student living in Turkey, studying computer engineering at Turkey's top university. I'm in my senior year, so I'm preparing myself to pursue a master's degree in CS in another country.\n\nWhile looking through top world universities, I noticed Tsinghua being among the top 20. I read into it and tbh I was surprised that I've never heard of it before.\n\nThe requirements are very achievable, the acceptance rate for international students is about 95% (according to google), the university is ranked #1 in the world in CS, and there are scholarships that provide tuition, accommodation, and a stipend. Now, this sounds like a dream university, but also a little too good to be true.\n\nso my question is, is there a catch? if it's that prestigious but also has that acceptance rate, why isn't it more famous?\n\nAlso, I do not currently plan to stay in China after I get the degree, so, since Tsinghua is not very famous, would a degree from it be distinguished outside of China?",

It\u2019s like most people don\u2019t know how great your university it is even though it\u2019s a TOP uni in your country. My recommendation is to find a uni with a nice environment you like and consider if you don't mind having Chinese food and being able to enjoy everything being so Chinese. \nIf you prefer English-speaking countries, then go to Canada and Australia. If you want to experience some Chinese culture in English then go to Singapore. I\u2019m currently living in Taiwan, kids here are so hardworking to get into top universities here (maybe less stressful than Chinese students). Their top universities are nice tbh. Anyway, good luck.",

You might get by in school since many college students can speak a little english.\n\nThen there's the current pandemic which isn't ideal. If you or someone in your class gets covid you could be deported if not it could be worse. \n\nIf you think you can get pass this language barrier and (if you are Muslim) not practice your religion for 2 years.  Tsinghua University is a very good university for CS. It holds weight in a lot of places even in America. Not as much as MIT or some other universities in the U.S but in computer science a lot of technology companies will know Tsinghua. There is more risk to reward but that reward can get you far.\n\nMy honest opinion you probably shouldn't do it especially right now with the pandemic.",

You ask about whether you should go. I mean, why not? All the Chinese students dream to get into that university yet they have to have ridiculously high grade to get in and great competition , but it is the opposite for international student, the university even gave you money to go there. Maybe they\u2019ll even arrange 3 beautiful Chinese girls to stay with you lol. I have never heared that university is world\u2019s top 1 university for cs major though, but it has a high rank. It is the number 1 university in China.",

But every Chinese hiring manager (aside from 3rd or later generation that might not speak Mandarin anymore) will know Tsinghua University.\n\nhiring department at larger companies will see more international applicants, so naturally they will see more international degrees (including Tsinghua). At smaller companies, they probably will not know.",

(They are based on research production) As you said yourself, you hadn't even heard of Tsinghua. Decide if it's the best for your needs -- not where it is on a list.\n\n\\- First, check if they even have that degree in English\n\n\\- Also assess if you speak Chinese or want a long-term life in China. \n\n\\- If all those are true -- they have the degree you want, you got a scholarship, you want to work in China -- then it may be work it.\n\nIf not, probably not worth the crazy hassle it's been post-Covid.",
