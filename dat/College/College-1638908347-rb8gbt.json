  "text": "Canvas down for you? Here\u2019s why: \n\nCanvas is hosted by AWS (Amazon Web Services) and since yesterday they have been having API and console issues with their us-east-1 (Virginia headquartered) servers. \n\nTo put it simply, the platforms hosted on AWS that usually route to this region are affected. \n\nWhat else MAY be affected?\n\nAmazon\nAmazon Prime Music\nLeague of Legends\nRing\nDisney+\nAmazon Alexa\nPrime Video\nInstacart\nVenmo\nRobinhood\n\n*Note: The outage are focused in the US-East-1 AWS region, so it\u2019s possible that not everyone is experiencing the issues outlined above.",
