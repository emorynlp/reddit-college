  "text": "*So before I go further into this post, college can be super challenging and different schools/majors require a different workload.  I understand that college can legitimately be the hardest time of your life.  This purpose of this post is not to attack or single anyone out.  I suffer from several different learning disabilities and have experienced some of the challenges that many students face.*\n\nIn high school, I was a C student at best, and honestly, it was touch and go if I would even attend university.  After hearing many horror stories from older students I entered my freshman year terrified. I thought for sure I would fail every class, but I actually found it to be super easy. For the last four semesters, I have faced some challenging times but nothing on the level that other students complain about. I hear these stories about students staying all night for multiple nights during the week, or stories about students having total meltdowns during dead week and I get a bit puzzled. Like I said above these are all very real valid things that occur on college campuses, but I personally feel like some students make it a bit harder for themselves than it has to be. From my experience, I have noticed that even at my (and a lot of my classmates who I have discussed this with)  worst if we apply ourselves most assignments are very manageable. I feel like the elitist stigma we currently have regarding college creates a lot of unneeded anxiety for new students. Throughout high school, we are constantly trained to succeed at standardized tests that require you to over think.  I think this conditioning is extremely dangerous, and that for a large percentage of students overthinking is actually a bigger enemy to their education than even the most challenging of courses. I made a 19 on my ACT and finished high school with a 2.7-ish. I now have a 3.5 in college, and I feel like not being prepped for standardized testing has actually helped me.  My question here is do any of you agree or have similar experiences?  It has been very hard for me to find students who can relate to my experience.\n\nEdit: I think a lot of the negative comments just read the title and nothing else. I want to state once again that elements of college can be overwhelming and challenging. Struggles and break downs are ALL valid.  Once again the purpose of this post was to share how I feel over thinking and elitist culture affects students.",

I graduated with a 2.84 and had a 3.62 last semester and I\u2019m probably gonna have something in the 3.0-3.8 range this semester too. I feel like a lot of us students who\u2019ve failed like crazy in high school but come into college are a bit more prepared for the failures and get through them quicker then our peers who are used to success (especially when that success came easy).",

      "text": "Well first thing is that your professor can make or break the class. You can have a teacher with all the knowledge in the word but he\u2019s unable to get his message across to students. Some teacher might have a crappy grade policy. So the first thing is get a good teacher. Now when looking up teacher rating on rate my professor or word of mouth if they say a teacher is horrible ask why!\n\nIn my experience so far the teachers who are disliked tend to be the easiest. Often times they have attitudes and can come off as arrogant or narcissistic but they often make their expectations clear. Do this and you get an A and it\u2019s often times the easiest at least for me. \n\nNow teachers with a higher recommendation are usually more fun but you also want to make sure you are learning. So you need to determine what you need from the class. A gpa booster, learning the actual material or getting a gen ed out the way. Then you chose a professor base off that. \n\nShow up to class, most classes just showing up and paying attention alone can get you at least a C+ do homework and don\u2019t procrastinate until last minute. You had a month to write that essay and you decide to wait until the last two day. Why should I feel bad for you?  \n\nGet to know your professors, if you\u2019re friendly with them I generally find that they are more lenient in grading me and they are more likely to write letter. What I usually do is go up to them and ask for advice on something, even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t want their advice on. I feel like a lot of them are often times happy to share advice and they like you more. That\u2019s what I did in Calc II. I did not get a single grade over 80 and got an A in the class, there was no curve and there were a lot of kids with 90s average so just play smart. \n\nI feel the idea behind college is being able to manipulate your way through, why work hard when you can work smart.",

Any comparison to high school is already going to be skewed because you're required to attend high school and college is a choice. When I know I have an upcoming test that's going to be difficult, I start studying weeks ahead of time. In high school, I could study the night before a test and come out with an A or not study at all and still do relatively well. College requires independent effort that you may or may not notice you're putting in. I have a GPA of 3.8 in college and I had a 3.5 in high school. It's a small difference, but I assure you I work more than 3 times as hard in college.",

      "text": "I have had the experience of going through college twice. During my first time, I made a lot of the mistakes that all college students make. I cut classes, I procrastinated, I didn't do homework, I never studied throughout the term. So of course I was stressed at test time because I had no preparation. I put in all nighters right before tests and projects because I did no preparation and didn't manage my time wisely.\n\nTo me, it seemed like college was hard because I coasted through high school without having to study, manage my time wisely, or do homework, since I was a \"smart\" kid. When it came time for college, I didn't have any of the skills I needed to succeed in that environment.\n\nMy second time around, I had specifically learned how to manage time, how to study for small amounts of time daily and weekly rather than try to do everything right before big tests or deadlines. In contrast to my first college experience: I NEVER pull all-nighters. Though I study almost daily, I'm really only studying a few hours a day. My entire day of work is only around 4-6 hours, compared to an 8 hour job. And I'm getting a 4.0.\n\nPeople think that 4.0 students must be grinding hard in the library, but I swear to you, I have so much free time, I don't often know what to do with it. I don't work in the evenings, and my weekends are always free, and I usually don't start working until 10am each day.\n\nMeanwhile, a student struggling to get a 3.0 will spend hours upon hours in the library wondering why they studied for 20 hours for a test, and are barely passing. It's because they aren't being realistic about how they're spending their time. \n\nFor example a struggling student might spend 10 hours in a library but only like 1 hour doing work, and the other 9 hours messing around on social media or their phone. Whereas a student who knows how to manage their time will spend 3 hours at the library, and all 3 hours of that time completely focused. The 3 hours of focused time is more productive than the 10 hours of unfocused time, and the 4.0 student has 7 more hours of free time than the non-4.0 student.",

I\u2019m not saying tough major students need to stay up all night multiple times a week.\n\nSometimes though that shit is just necessary. Maybe I do have to stay up late sometimes because I slacked off for a day or two, but you need that to keep your sanity. I\u2019d much rather work until 4am once in a while than work from 8am to 7pm every day. I\u2019m not perfect and there are ways to go to bed early every day, but that takes an insane level of focus and a hit to your social life.\n\nBottom line, I\u2019m saying I think some majors are a lot tougher than you\u2019re giving credit. Hell I\u2019ve got a lab this semester where for 3 months, every TTh, we got lab projects that quite literally required us to be in lab for at least 6 hours those days. Not to mention having to write 20-30 page lab reports each month while doing countless hours of calculations. That class alone is regularly responsible for 25 hours of my time a week. I\u2019ve got another senior design class that takes probably 15 hours a week outside of class for our project that\u2019s worth half the grade.\n\nMeanwhile I\u2019ve picked up an unrelated minor and in those classes I don\u2019t got to class, only study the day before exams and score 90s. Some majors are incredibly time consuming. Some are not. So unless you\u2019re speaking from the standpoint of someone about to graduate from a very tough major, I\u2019d suggest you shouldn\u2019t criticize those who have to really bust their ass day in and day out.",

I just got in to my major (we have to apply here) and it is a very good but strict program in my school, I have been studying at least 2x as much this quarter. That being said it also depends a lot on your time management skills. You spend way less time in classes and the main thing in college is studying and doing work by yourself (that requires you to manage when to do it). I have fairly good time management skills and it is clear how much less stressful it is for me. I know plenty of people who to bed late to finish assignment, can almost never hangout because they are always behind, etc. I on the other hand, sleep 8-10h per night and have time to do all the fun activities I like.   Even then, I wouldn\u2019t say college is easier that hs at all. I went to a private college prep hs that was pretty serious about academics, but even then I had to put much more time in to succeed in college than hs.",

And they think I make it harder than it is or exaggerate or am hard on myself.\n\nI used to be a liberal arts major, and I thought that coursework was difficult.

You have to do a ton of practice problems, and I\u2019ve experienced where 1 problem takes me over 30 minutes even WITH help because they\u2019re that intense.

As for emotional breakdowns and crying, this is usually caused by being overwhelmed, so yes - if you\u2019re setting yourself up for these situations by skipping class, not doing homework, etc, then college will be hard. When I first started college, I heard all the stories about students pulling all nighters and studying in the library all day and night. However, when finals came around for me, I did just about as much studying as I would for any other test. I still maintained my same daily schedule, and I felt like it was any other school week.\n\nOverall: yes. Students make it harder than it needs to be.",

Either way, I'm back in a cycle of \"do everything at the last possible second during the week, then on the weekends completely shirk your responsibilities and try to recover from the five days of stressful bullshit you subjected yourself to\".

Other people really struggled because it wasn't second nature for them or they didn't really need as much effort to succeed in high school.

So yes, the actual schoolwork might not be a ridiculous amount, but if you're working a part time job, active in extracurriculars, and also trying to do schoolwork, it can be a lot to handle. \n\n(This isn't saying that everyone is like that or it's impossible to have a high GPA like that, but I think it's important to remember that the college experience can be very different depending on what you're actually participating in and doing.)",

I've never pulled an all-nighter and I make it a point to get ~8 hours of sleep every night.  I am allergic to procrastination and always have been, it stresses me out when my assignments aren't done at least a few days in advance.  My time management skills are excellent and my classes aren't too bad this semester, and it's still stressful at times.  In contrast, I have friends that work a lot less while taking harder classes, and they pretty much only sleep on the weekends because they are so busy.\n\nCollege is hard, and I'm really over people saying \"time management is key\" and \"you just need discipline\" when some people really do have it a lot easier than others in a lot of ways.  Stop making comparisons and wondering about why other people are struggling so much when it's not that hard for you.

I treat college like a 9-5 job, where I spend eight hours (from my first class) either in class, doing readings, or studying. As a result, I have free evenings and pretty clear weekends.\n\n- I keep a weekly to-do list on a whiteboard, and have daily to-do lists on my laptop. It\u2019s a great way to make sure you\u2019re being productive. Nothing kicks my ass into gear more than seeing its 2 PM and my done column is empty.\n\n- Work ahead of time, but in pieces. I had two weeks to write a philosophy paper. I did an outline on day 1, a thesis on day 2, and than a couple of paragraphs each on days 3-5. That gave me a week to check my outline with the TA, proofread, revise, and so-on. \n\n- Find a study place that works for you, and don\u2019t be afraid to have multiple. I find it impossible to sit in a library for five hours. So I\u2019ll grab a sandwich and do some work in the courtyard, then head down to the library, then grab a snack in the dining hall and do some light work there. Moving around keeps things fresh and it feels less pressuring than sitting at the same table for six hours. \n\n- Have something to look forward to each day. I can study contently if I know there is something waiting for me at the end, whether it is simply a milkshake or unwinding with an episode of Scrubs, or a trip to the movies with friends.",

But my thinking is just \u201clet\u2019s go ahead and get this out the way now because either way I\u2019m gonna have to do it and I don\u2019t wanna worry about it later\u201d. And also I know I\u2019ll be busy later, so it\u2019s better to get it out the way before I have to worry about any other responsibilities. It\u2019s nice when you finish everything early because then you just have so much free time without having to think \u201cshit I still gotta do X, Y, and Z!\u201d \n\nWhen I don\u2019t fuck around on procrastination, I definitely do not. An example of it is this whole semester. I\u2019m taking 12 credits (4 classes). One of them is an online class called International Studies 365 which is about interpolitical economies. The syllabus outline was simple: read 6 books (that she picked out), write 5 analysis papers. Four of those papers are five pages long and one of them is ten pages long because it covers two books. You also have to make two discussion comments on each book. The deadlines were February 6th, February 25th, March 27th, April 15th, and April 30th. Semester started January 14th and ends April 30th. That Saturday during the first week, I finished one book and turned the paper in, got a B+ on it. The next Saturday I finished the next book and got an A. A couple days before the first deadline I finished the next two books (this was the long paper) and I got a B+ on it. Then the next week I finished the next book and paper and got an A. Then I finished the last book and turned in the last paper on February 22nd and got an A on it. My course graded ended up being an A with two months left in the semester.\n\nSee I rushed and didn\u2019t procrastinate so I could go ahead and get rid of it. So I could go through the rest of the semester only having to worry about three classes instead of those three classes and an essay-heavy online class. Felt good to have a weight lifted off my shoulders.",

                          "text": "I pretty much went all in. On Saturday I would just wake up, get on my laptop, put on headphones, and start writing. Once I got started it was pretty easy. It took a couple hours, and that\u2019s because I get distracted easily and my mind wanders. But nevertheless I\u2019d finish in a couple hours and just email my teacher the paper. \n\nOn a couple of them I did break it up. Like the 10 pager I just went all in after finishing one book to write the first five pages. Then all in on the second portion the next week. The last two papers I just started them in the 1:45 gap I had between my second and my last class of the day. I decided to do the papers then so I could make early progress.\n\nOh I bet you\u2019re wondering how I finished the books so quickly too since the books were over 200 pages long. I abhor reading books and I get tired/bored pretty quickly. I\u2019ll read all day on Reddit but not a book lol. Anyway, the first book I listened to it on audible while I was in the car since I commute ~2 hours both ways twice a week. The second book I just looked up the Wikipedia summary and it had good organized points for what was talked about, so I was able to write a good analysis off of that and get an A. The third book I used another free trial on audible for. Then the fourth book I looked up a summary about it and wrote the analysis. And the fifth book I did the same thing. What\u2019s surprising is that I got a B+ on the books I actually took the time to listen to and an A on the books where I didn\u2019t listen/read a single word of. But that\u2019s prolly because my teacher was telling me she wanted the papers more analysis like. And that she\u2019s not looking for a summary on the book, but to kinda take an idea in the book and write about it and relate it to the real world and such because she\u2019ll assume you read it. \n\n\nI can send you a copy of one of my essays if you want to see an example of what I write. Never thought of myself as a strong writer, but I usually get As on most essays I write in and outside of this class. Even the upper level classes.",

One class in particular that I am taking right now is taught like a graduate level class and is double the work of any other class I have ever taken. My classmates and I easily spend 20hrs a week on this class between class, lab, study group, lab reports, and homework. \n\n\nOn the other side of things, the general classes everyone has to take were extremely easy. I got an A in those classes without much effort at all. I also took a fair number of nutrition classes for personal interest reasons and found those to require very little effort as well.

Especially in the first year because all you\u2019re doing is taking freshman 100(0)-level Gen Ed courses that are made to be so easy, it\u2019s really hard to fail. But some dumbasses still manage to fail them.\n\n\nAt least on the humanities side, they make the Gen Eds like introduction to sociology, anthropology, etc so damn easy. All you do is show up, and the professor puts the slides online so you don\u2019t have to worry about taking notes. And the quizzes and tests are usually online and they give you a couple days to do it. So you\u2019re just bound by the honor system.

I've had professors have us recall word for word what was said in the guest lecturer's speech or remember the name of a DVD someone was looking at in a video shown at the beginning of the semester on a final exam for an intro to theater class. \n\nPlus, a lot of freshman had to take calculus, which had a failing rate double of the amount of students who got A's or A-'s. Homework was 15 page papers worth 20% of our grades for our required government credits. Gen eds were really difficult for me and several other people because we picked our major based off of what we were interested in or what we were good at. So taking all these other out of major classes really hurt our GPA because they were unnecessarily difficult for being classes that we would never need to know about again.",

I've been a major procrastinator all my life, but ever since I learned this life hack, my grades have gone up. If you think about a small assignment you have to do that'll take a couple of minutes, then start working on that asap. Once you get the ball rolling on schoolwork, you might just end up doing other assignments and be done before you know it!",

                          "text": "I used to binge watch shows even though I got bored of watching TV because I just didn't want to do my work. But I tell myself now that instead of being bored during that time, why not finish up a 5 minute blog assignment and then I'll get back to the show? While doing the short assignment, my brain enters a focus mode so after finishing up the short assignments, I think what's another assignment that's due soon? Doing the shorter assignments helps me get the ball rolling and it's not too difficult to motivate myself to do something that only takes like 5 minutes anyways. As for social media, I'd say just cut it off. Hard stop. Ever since I stopped using social media, I have freed up so much time that I don't even know what to do with. Of course that time is now spent on Reddit, but this isn't nearly as addicting as Instagram or Snapchat would be.",
