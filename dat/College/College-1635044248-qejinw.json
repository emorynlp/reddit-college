  "text": "I haven\u2019t gone to a party yet, and I recently made some new friends (like 3 weeks ago). I finally feel like I\u2019ve met my people, we just click. I\u2019m a commuter, so it was hard to find my group, and even harder to go out. I want to go out for Halloween, but idk how to ask if I can go with them. Should I just ask straight up? Or should I wait for an invitation?",
