  "title:": "Should I tell my professor my performance has been bad because I found out I\u2019m going blind?",
  "text": "so earlier this year I found out I\u2019m going blind and ever since then I\u2019ve been super depressed and lost motivation for a lot of things, including school. My motivation hasn\u2019t returned and I have a lot of late assignments. Things are just getting worse. My professors have been really considerate and kind, and I did explain to them that I\u2019ve been having a lack of motivation but I didn\u2019t tell them that it is because I found out I\u2019m going blind. Is that something I should tell them or would it just be awkward? I told my professor I had an eye appointment where I got diagnosed with a sECOND disease threatening my vision and had to miss class and he asked me if everything was fine and I said yes lmao \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Yes definitely tell him or email him. I was failing one of my classes because I lost a family member to COVID. I emailed my professor a few days ago even tho final is coming up soon. Instead of failing me or giving me a failing grade, he gave me an incomplete so I have a year to make it up. I was super hesitant to tell my professor what was going on but one of my nurses convinced me to. Good luck and I hope you will be ok",
