  "text": "Hey everyone, so I was planning on double majoring in Political Science and Econ, and I have lost all interest in Econ. I plan on trying for law school after college, and I have a 3.6 gpa as of this semester. Will a polisci major be enough to get into a decent law school? Or should I stick with the double? Thank you!!!",
