  "text": "So I\u2019m taking online classes over Microsoft Teams at a community college. I have social anxiety and a group project would be manageable in person but I\u2019m particularly anxious about doing video calls or voice calls with team mates so I\u2019ve been avoiding them at all costs. I want to try going to my teacher about this issue and asking if I could do the project on my own instead because of my anxiety. Has anyone else tried this and what was the outcome? Any tips on how i should approach her about it?",

In reality most group projects are set their by the curriculum in order to fulfill some communicative policy by the department. Honestly though sometimes it's for them to grade less work too, Doubt they would want to add more to their plate.",

      "text": "If I may: what do you plan to do for work once you graduate? Many jobs are nowadays going to require virtual meetings of some kind (especially since the pandemic kicked up the percentage of remote and partially remote workers). It might be worthwhile to work through your anxiety, especially since the answer to this question is most likely going to be \u201cno.\u201d You will also be able to learn from the experience and perhaps manage your anxiety a bit better the next time you have to do a group project with virtual elements (which is probably about guaranteed at this point).",

I feel like if I asked any of my professors this they would say no. The point of group projects is working on something as a team, so by doing it alone you\u2019re not really proving that you can handle a project with others. \n\nAnd truthfully, just going off the way you worded this, it doesn\u2019t sound like social anxiety is some sort of debilitating thing for you that will make doing this project impossible. It comes off more like, \u201cI get nervous on video calls with people and I\u2019d rather not work with others\u201d",
