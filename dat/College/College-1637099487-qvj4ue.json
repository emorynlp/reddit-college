  "text": "So during the pandemic and now, I am doing online university, love it. Wake up at 8/9AM sit down on the laptop and make a cup of coffee just work casually quietly in my room. \n\nI'd have work done easily and I get to do it from the comfort of my own home. \n\nNow my mom and my relatives they think that online school/learning is waste and they don't even understand it. They just think it's being anti-social and not having a life so I do online school, tf. That's what they legit think and often on calls or whatever they say \"when are you going to physical school?\" or the \"why are you doing online school? you have no friends?\".\n\nThey say dumbshit like that. but I love doing from my own home cause \n\n1. if I were to go to a physical one im gonna have to pay gas often (I have a car already) but gas getting expensive.\n\n2. Im gonna have to pay high priced rent for roommates cause if you attend the local universities near my place it's far AF and your gonna have to rent in that university area and commute daily is like almost 2hrs.\n\n3. commute, I don't feel like driving that far tiring and too much traffic.\n\n4. save a lot of money doing online compared to doing in person. \n\n5. just me and my laptop that's it quiet, peaceful and I get the attention I need and can focus.\n\n6. and many more reasons \n\nPlus at the end of the day im still getting my education/degree.\n\nWhat about y'all?",
