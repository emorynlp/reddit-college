      "text": "Most of it is past work experience (not necessarily paid) but relevant to position I'm applying to. I then have 2 lines of skills (software I'm familiar with or tools) and then 1 for foreign languages, 1 for club leadership/membership, and 1 line optional for fun fact about me that sometimes is a conversation starter in an interview. Also, like 1 line at top for degree plan, 1-2 lines for relevant courses taken.\n\nI stopped listing my high school stuff past sophomore year.",

Internships if you have it. What one of the recruiters told me is most of the college resumes look really similiar.",
