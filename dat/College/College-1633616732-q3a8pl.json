I\u2019M ABOUT TO REACH MY BREAKING POINT!!! \n\nI never really liked going to school, and by picking a major that I despise, I don\u2019t have a set path post-graduation. Despite all of that, I know I will be alright and I\u2019m looking forward to getting the fuck out and starting my life. \n\nSend some positive vibes and good luck in your own college journey. \u2728\u2728",
