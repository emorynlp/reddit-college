  "title:": "[serious] My professor got pissed and threw a curveball at the class, then failed most people",
  "text": "*Sorry this is long but I would love some advice or encouragement*\n\nPretext: This is a chemistry prof who I really admired and respected. He's an amazing lecturer and makes classes engaging. I've learned a lot from him. We have multiple lectures a week and did a lab every week. \nEarly on in the semester, I asked him about potential volunteer or work opportunities. I have a year of lab experience working at a company, which I've told him about. After seeing my lab skills and performance in the lab, he talked to me privately to offer me a work opportunity on the condition that I ace his class. \n\nNgl, this has put an immense pressure on me and I have a lot of performance anxiety, but I still tried my best and feel that I understand the material taught in class. \n\n*This research project would potentially allow me to be published in undergrad which would be a huge boost for my career. My GPA is not the best, mainly due to having struggled with anxiety and ADHD. I only recently started treatment for the ADHD.*\n\nPartway through the semester, however, the prof noticed that some students weren't prepared for the lab and has progressively become more and more upset. It got to the point where he would lecture us in class and shame us about not being prepared (even though I, and many others, were consistently prepared).\n\nA big turning point happened after the first midterm; it was online and apparently someone cheated. Professor gave the class lecture about cheating but did not exclusively call out who it was. \n\nDue to this, the next midterm was in person and harder. I did above average, but the majority of the class did poorly. The average was about 10 to 20% lower than the first online exam. Again, prof gave us a very disappointed speech and implied that he's under the impression that a lot of people don't care about his class. \n\nOur final was supposed to be a 2-week take home exam for everyone to solve on their own. Due to the nature of the course material, it is possible to design an exam that you can't just Google the answers to. \n\nHowever, after that second midterm fiasco, he threw a curveball at us and told us we will have 2 exams in a week, cumulative. It wasn't even officially finals season yet so technically they would be two midterms back to back in the last week of classes, which goes against school policy.\n\nEveryone was extremely stressed. My friends and I went through all textbook questions and had a decent grasp on the material. \n\nHowever, not only did he give us a surprise exam, he actually put very difficult questions on the \"finals\". Given that I have ADHD and terrible test anxiety, the added time pressure and curveball threw me off and I failed the final. A bunch of high performing people failed the final.\n\nUnsurprisingly when I went to his office to see my exams, he let me know that due to my performance on these last exams, he cannot justify working with me next semester. \n\nIn spite  of my experience. In spite of my understanding. In spire of my lab skills. \n\nI felt crushed so I told him i understood and ledt to collect myself. \n\nI feel defeated and like a failure, even though I know that what he did wasn't fair. I've already talked to a bunch of my classmates and we all feel like we weren't able to demonstrate our understanding in this class. \n\nI considered emailing the prof. Is it even worth it? What can I even say to him at this point?",

      "text": "I would be very hesitant to work with someone like this- he has issues with his own emotional regulation and chose to retaliate in a way against policy. I think you dodged a bullet, however if you truly feel like you still want to work w him- it is worth a try to mention all experience you have again along with high academic achievements within that class, the reasons for your failing grade, and ask him to kindly reconsider and what the opportunity would mean to you. Worst he can say is no, which he already did. He might have a change of heart.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing your perspective! I think you are right and maybe this is for the better. I was mostly drawn to his passion for his research and this area of chemistry. There may not be other opportunities like this for me. But at the same time, I don't think it is worth potentially sacrificing my own mental health.",

      "text": "hey buddy, prof here and AO. Teachers do have bad days.. and sadly they can take it out on students even though it is not entirely the students' fault. I am guilty of it as well. I had a bad incident with a few students that slurred me with  a \"fucking boomer grandpa\" insult because I was trying to rant about kids playing games for 14 hours a day and not even 1 hour learning something.. things got heated and sure enough put me in a bad mood. I ended up rejecting a bunch of college applications just out of spite on applications that even hinted of proficiency in video games, valorant tournament winners, pro streamer, youtube content creator or what not in their extra curriculars .  Yes shitty days can happen ..and I am not proud of it... but yes a pissed off teacher can do a lot of damage.\n\nWait a few days and email or talk to him.",
