  "text": "So I\u2019m a month into college and I\u2019ve had a rough start.  Went home for a week for a funeral, got sick 3 times including covid, and had to go home because of it.  I\u2019ve been out of school for most of the month and haven\u2019t really been able to make friends.  How do I make friends now that everyone\u2019s already formed friend groups?",

      "text": "I had to miss a ton of college due to covid and joining clubs has helped a ton. Joining clubs is basic advice, but it really helps.  If you live in a dorm, talk to people you see in the hallway.  You\u2019re gonna have to awkwardly insert yourself into a few groups but it\u2019ll be worth it.  If you present yourself well, people will want to befriend you",

Each semester you go into new classes with new people so, don't think you'll miss out. \n\nJust go to places you enjoy and speak to people who you see share your passions. Just focus on studying and the rest will come by pretty naturally.",
