  "text": "I\u2019m gonna lead off the bat by saying this can be a long post. As someone that works professionally in Higher ed, and as someone who got their masters in student affairs and higher ed have a pretty strong understanding of how universities operate at their core. For you students out there, my plan is to lay a pretty decent foundation here to help you understand many different aspects of how your university probably operates, since you pay for it and are the reason these institutions exist. I\u2019ll say, I\u2019m not the expert on everything or every type of university, and my experience is entirely in the United States so that is who this will be most relevant to, but I\u2019m hoping I can bring some interesting info to you on this Sunday morning! \n\nFirst and foremost, universities are businesses at the core. Just like Target, Walmart, or Amazon, they have a bottom line that needs to be met. Your tuition and student fees pay this bottom line, alongside federal and state funding if your institution is public. The more students a university has, the better faculty they can hire, the more research they can pump out, the better alumni they can get who will hopefully donate, and the cycle continues. Your money is being put into a long term investment by the university to sustain itself. The biggest expenditure of any university? Faculty and staff. Let\u2019s break those down. \n\nFaculty are your professors and researchers who teach courses, contribute to scientific papers, and experts of a given field. Thing is, any bit of discovery or research faculty yield, their intellectual property in other words, belongs to the university. If I were a cancer researcher and made a massive breakthrough in cancer treatment, that belongs to my employer, not me. This is not an exclusive practice to higher ed, but consider how faculty are paid and tenured up front and how it is part of a larger system for an institution to protect their investments. \n\nStaff are everyone else. These are your custodial staff, dining staff, residence hall employees, student activities peeps, diversity center staff, etc. If the faculty are left brain, staff are right brain. Their job is to keep amenities usable, create safe environments for all on campus, and create learning/social opportunities outside of the lecture hall. I fall into this category. \n\nLet\u2019s stick with this left brain and right brain analogy. Left brain are your academic affairs team, they are focused on the classroom experience and your enrichment in the field you have specified. Your advisors, faculty and program chairs are gonna work to develop your academic capital.  Your right brain, student affairs, will work to adjust you to being a strong functioning member of a global society, helping you network and meet people you would never normally meet. They\u2019re focused on your social capital. These two parts of the brain are meant to work in tandem, but at many universities they grind up against each other. Some in student affairs view those in academic affairs as pretentious or uncaring. Some in academic affairs see those in student affairs as wasteful or unnecessary. I\u2019m not here to say who is right or wrong, but instead advocate that they need to work together to create the best experience for all. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about how your money breaks down further: your fees pay for all the above staff and faculty, as well as dining halls, programs on campus, sports and clubs. Sports are seen as big money makers on campus: this isn\u2019t always true! Sure, some very large programs (think Alabama or UT Austin) turn a profit on their sports programs, and usually the profit from these programs go into paying for other sports on campus. Usually though, sports programs break even on their costs or even subsidize the costs across the whole student body. Sports have become their own worst enemy: they need to fill seats and charge fees to sustain themselves lest they fall apart. \n\nAnother important thing to know about your money: it doesn\u2019t always pay for what you think it does. Some departments or offices on campus are auxiliary services. What that means is that they do NOT receive federal funding. Housing is a great example of this. All money that housing uses is *usually* only what is earned by students living in the halls. So your money goes into paying for the maintenance of all buildings, housing staff, programming etc. Parking is another auxiliary service. This is not to defend they high prices of living on campus, but instead to help explain why some of those costs are the way they are. \n\nOne last thing I\u2019ll cover here is power. The head of your university may be titled President, Chancellor, Dean etc. You may believe this person holds all the power on campus: this isn\u2019t necessarily true. Most heads of universities are tasked with two big things: build strong alumni relationships to get more funds, and build strong political connections on behalf of the university. These presidents or chancellors are truly political figures at the core and they have lots of different people in their ears telling them what to do: student governments, faculty and staff associations, alumni, parents, and the biggest of all, board of regents/directors. This board is where lots of power rests. I\u2019d recommend you learn who is on your board and what their backgrounds are: this can help you understand a lot of decisions made on your campus. Ultimately though, the power is in the consumer, and that is the student body. The ability to make changes as students cannot be understated. \n\n\nWhew. That is a lot. And it doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of all that is there. I\u2019m hoping that this helps provide some interesting information of how funds are allocated, how systems operate, and where the power rests in any given institution. As a student who is paying to uphold all these different things, I believe it is your responsibility to know how your money is spent and how you are being advocated for on multiple levels. My career is in supporting students through their higher ed journey and I love it to death. Because I love it so much, I really believe that it is my duty to be honest and transparent with those who pay my salary. Hopefully y\u2019all enjoyed this and finds use in it!",

When companies come recruit on campus, you take a an internship or a job then suddenly quit it (bc it was too hard), you'll be reprimanded by the school! Most students don't understand why...after spending $100K.  You get reprimanded because the companies PAY money to recruit on. Administration wants these relationships, especially with HUGE companies. But for some reason....even business sudents don't get this.",

The accounting may look lots like a business, but the element of profit is missing. The university may try to cut costs or to increase income, but this isn't usually at the detriment of its students--usually the goal is to decrease tuition (or increase it more slowly) or to allocate money for other things which will benefit the university. A business on the other hand might cut costs by charging the same price for a lesser service.",

You aren't paying for *your specific* lodging and meals, you're subsidizing part of the cost to provide those services to everyone. (Just like your tuition isn't paying *your specific* professors' salaries.)\n\nSome schools (like the one I work for) have partnered with outside companies to provide housing and/or dining services, so issuing refunds may not even be up to the university, but rather Sodexo or Aramark or whatever company they've contracted with to provide these services for you. Especially for the Spring 2020 semester, (1) not everyone was able to leave in March, and (2) the school/Sodexo/whoever still needed to pay the staff providing services for the ones who stayed.",

      "text": "There is some truth to what is said here, but I find myself cringing at some of the finer points. The left/right brain analogy is. . crude. \n\nTo add context, in the past universities mainly consisted of faculty. Faculty taught, mentored, advised, administered. They did it all, except cleaning and preparing meals. Over time there was a need for people to specialize in certain areas and institutions found that parents expected them to take care of their students in many various ways. This is called \u201cduty of care.\u201d Duty of care is the reason services at universities and colleges have expanded so much over the 20th century, and most especially in the last 40 years. Institutions are expected to provide for the mental, physical, and social health of their students in order to provide an environment that is conducive to learning. \n\nThese expectations coupled with dwindling state funding are two major forces in the rise of cost of attendance. In 2011, it cost an institution on average $12,000 per year to educate one student ($14,000 for universities, $9,000 for colleges). That\u2019s the price to educate them (teaching, student support, and administration). Not the price to provide counseling, health centers, student activities, or sports. \n\nInstitutions must offer these other services. It\u2019s both expected and can be contributing factors on whether incoming students decide to attend the institution, which yes, does affect the caliber of student and alumni population and the cycle of donations to keep the school operating and growing. This is all not to mention the institution\u2019s responsibility to their community. \n\nYes, institutions must keep business practices in mind for continued operation. But don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking education is exactly like any other business operation out there. Higher education has many more nuances as well as regulations that make it unique from other fields.",

And bookstores are changing into convenience stores as books go to digital subscriptions or \u201crentals\u201d or adopt an inclusive access program.

No such thing as a free lunch.\n\nThe trend in student housing is moving away from university provided services to private companies building and operating these nice student apartments with individual bedrooms and bathrooms and dining halls with greater diversity in meals. Those cost more to provide than the old three in a room, common bathroom down the hall, with everybody eating the same meal.  Many of these are built on university ground under a ground lease agreements without government bonds paying for the building. Therefore the price is higher than those old dorms when parents and grandparents attended colleges.

I was extremely fortunate and honestly lucked out in several ways. Through my undergrad and grad due to scholarships, merit grants, and tuition waivers, I was paid $8 to attend school over 5 years of my life. This is tuition and fees, income tax on the waivers, and books fees subtracted. Housing and living expenses were separate. \n\nI probably sound ancient, but I\u2019m 28. I graduated with my Master\u2019s 5 years ago. I\u2019m the first in my family to attend college, so it even being an option was a miracle. \n\nI work directly with students and I have seen extreme ends of the spectrum. I wish my experience was the norm. It\u2019s far from it. Some students have parents that pay for everything. Some get Pell grants (due to being very poor) and have to take out excessive loans to make up the difference. Some have parents that make just enough for them to be ineligible for federal aid but their parents have other financial obligations/refuse to help. The majority of my students face significant debt that will be with them for at least 10 years with how some payment plans work. These loans mean people wait to buy a home (or never do), wait to have children (or never do), or wait to travel (or never do). And if they have loans but did not graduate for some reason, it\u2019s even worse.  \n\nDon\u2019t take your experience for granted. And tell anyone willing to listen what the support you received has allowed you to do in life. So many people don\u2019t have that option here.",

We're not experts. We're mostly creative writing MFAs and literature MAs who just love teaching and writing.\n\n>Thing is, any bit of discovery or research faculty yield, their intellectual property in other words, belongs to the university.\n\nProbably depends a lot on the department and even more on if there's any sort of research grants involved, I'd guess.

Maintaining amenities that get shown off on tours will often take priority over maintaining things students and faculty use every day.\n\n>Let\u2019s talk about how your money breaks down further: your fees pay for all the above staff and faculty, as well as dining halls, programs on campus, sports and clubs\n\nI want to quibble over the terminology here, because \"fees\" has a specific use in college costs, distinct from tuition, housing, and meal plans.\n\n>think Alabama\n\nRoll Tide\n\n>One last thing I\u2019ll cover here is power.\n\nFor students, the most relevant wielder of power is usually going to be the department chair. Even to tenured professors, the department chair still has a lot of weight to throw around, and can usually force the troops to get in line. Their boss is the dean, but a dean is going to be reluctant to get into a fight with a department chair over a dispute between a student and a professor.",

                  "text": "Many universities, including the one I work at, require all incoming freshmen to live on campus. So it ends up being an essential service for nearly all students, even if just for a year or so, and only approximately 25% of the university student population at a time. And when they charge exorbitant prices, well above the local market value (plus requiring an additional, equally overpriced, meal plan), I'd definitely say that's an area they should improve.",

If you want beautiful dorms, movie theater style commons rooms, rec rooms, and food courts in the residence halls, you're going to pay more. \n\nI understand not every dorm is like this and there are some real stinkers out there. My college dorm had walls that would move if you leaned on them, and this was late 2000s.\n\nI still agree that the norms should be challenged, but so long as there are parents and students who demand more and more of this kind of resource, I don't know why universities would change.",

                          "text": "The point about it being a service industry and wanting the nice amenities doesn't really apply in this case though.\n\nThat argument only works if there is a choice involved. Universities add those extras as an excuse to charge students more, but those students don't have a choice. I'm sure if given a choice, some would still choose for the overpriced on campus residence with those amenities, but most would go for cheaper options. Hell, at least here, even with the \"extra\" amenities provided, they still are a good 50-75% more expensive than comparable off campus alternatives, and those off campus options don't require sharing a room, having an additional meal plan, or any of the other restrictions that come from living on campus.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand the studies that show that living on campus the first year improve retention rate. I don't necessarily have a problem with students being required to live on campus the first year (as long as there are exceptions for lower income students or those who live close to campus), but what I have the problem with is both requiring that, and only offering housing options that are so much more expensive than options in the surrounding community that it causes undo financial hardships on the students or making them take out extra loans just to pay for that.\n\nFor example, the absolute cheapest on campus option here is still >$10k for August-May. That is for a shared room with community bathrooms in the oldest dorm building still on campus. In the same area, for the same amount of money, I could rent a 2 bedroom apartment or house, with no roommates, for the entire year. Our mortgage for a 3 bed place fairly close (about 5 minutes) to campus is less than that for the whole year. And that's not counting the overpriced meal plans at over $4700/year, which is about $525/month. That's about the same as what my wife and I spend on both groceries and restaurants for the 2 of us.\n\nAll this could vary university to university, but at least all the major ones in this region, and all the ones I've looked at elsewhere have similar numbers, way above the regular housing prices in the area.\n\nI know there are some people that are always demanding more and nicer things in this area, but at least around here, people have been complaining about both the cost and quality (i.e. mold issues for decades) of the dorms for years. And yet apartments around campus are able to have much cheaper costs with no mold problems, and the same or better amenities.\n\n> I'd argue these shouldn't been profit driven either, especially residence halls. Those are essentials, and turning them into an engine to price gouge teenagers living on their own for the first time is unacceptable.\n\nThat post above basically sums up everything. You mentioned residence halls providing amenities beyond essentials so they are a commodity, but that completely ignores the fact that the students don't get a choice there. If they had a choice to live on/off campus, then I could agree with that, but they don't in most cases. Now, if people who aren't required to live on campus choose to, then that's completely on them. \n\nSorry for the long rant, I know you said improvement is needed, but it's much more drastic an issue than saying it's only essential to a portion of the university population or that they provide more amenities so you're going to pay more. It really is an epidemic (alongside the cost of tuition) that causes more and more student loans to be taken out by kids barely out of high school, having their very first taste of adulthood, sending them straight in to massive debt.",
