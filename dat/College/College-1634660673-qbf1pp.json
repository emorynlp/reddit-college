I feel as if I\u2019m clueless compared to my classmates and feel so dumb during assignments. I feel so insecure going to class cause I feel like I have no business taking this course cause I have no idea how to do certain things. I\u2019m willing to put the work in but need guidance",

      "text": "Definitely office hours. Also try to find a study partner/group, there are plenty of other people in the same boat. My roommate and I took it at the same time and it helped a ton.\n\nAnd don't get discouraged. At most schools, Organic Chemistry is a major weed out course. It's supposed to wreck the GPA or change majors of all the people who want to go to medical school but won't have the grit to make it through. Not sure if that's the right way to treat a class, but it's what colleges do. I doubt you'll use the specifics of organic chemistry for your actual career in nursing so persevere get a B if you can and move on.",

      "text": "i COMPLETELY understand where you're coming from.. i'm also trying to get into the Nursing program at my school and it's required for me to take introductory chemistry. i'm sure o-chem  is a lot more difficult but nonetheless, i understand your struggle. i struggled a lot with chem even back in high school so i hate this subject more than anything lol.\n\nnumber one thing i would suggest is office hours. my professor expects us to do most of the learning through our textbook and only skims through the important sections during lecture; visiting office hours allows your professor and you more time to review the material 1to1. \n\nlet's say your professor is terrible at teaching/teaching doesn't match your personal learning style.. someone in the comments suggested that you check out The Organic Chemistry Tutor on youtube and i second that! it's helped me a ***ton*** when both textbook and lecture don't make sense. \n\nalso keep practicing problems. keep reviewing, keep reading. constantly make yourself familiar with the material and it'll slowly start to make sense.",
