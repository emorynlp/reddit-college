  "text": "Basically my advisor needed to approve me to register for a course. It took weeks for him to get back to me and when I emailed him the necessary information back he never replied. I checked today course is still not registered so I emailed him again (at this point its been 2 months of me trying to register for this course) an automatic reply informs me he NO LONGER WORKS AT MY SCHOOL. I email the general advising for my major with all the info to register and they basically say \u201csore luck there\u2019s no spots wait and see if something opens up\u201d. \n\nThis would be okay if I wasn\u2019t supposed to graduate next semester. Now they are basically telling me to push back my graduation, internship and an entire cross country move for a course that they require ONLY at my specific school to graduate. I want to know who I can go to and beg them to let me take it or scream at so they have to let me? I\u2019m just frustrated and pissed.",
