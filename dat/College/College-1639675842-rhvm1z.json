  "title:": "My roommate was prematurely released from quarentine, but he wont weat a mask in our dorm",
  "text": "He was releaded from his isolation early (he had covid), after only ten days instead of the full 14 days, because the semester ends for him tomorrow.  I know this is only gonna last a day with us both here, but it only takes minutes to catch covid from someone who has it, and he\u2019s not wearing his mask like i\u2019ve asked him two.  I\u2019m double masked (wearing a kn95 and a regular cloth mask), but im scared its not enough because were in an enclosed space alone together.\n\nEdit: lol the 10 weeks was a typo, i meant 14 days, idk why i wrote ten weeks lol\n\nEdit 2: I mean isolation not quarantine, he was diagnosed with covid.",

Note that for someone who actually had Covid, it's called isolation rather than quarantine.\n\n*To calculate your 10 full day isolation period, day 0 is your first day of symptoms. Day 1 is the first full day after your symptoms developed.*",
