  "text": "Use active recall.\n\nactive recall is when you have to answer a question or solve a problem without any assistance or stepping stones to the answer(i.e. looking at the answer to a math problem before you start it). You are forced to recall the techniques that you are supposed to learn in the course and that builds **stronger neural pathways** which leads to much much much easier recall for the future.\n\nIf its trivial and you have to just remember a bunch of random stuff, use **flashcards**\n\nI only take notes on information I cannot access online, or formulas\n\nhowever writing down what you learned after class, turning your perception of the lecture into notes is an extremely effective way to pick up on a technique first try, or at least identify what part you missed.\n\ndon't take this completely advice literally. Mold it to your education. Obviously there is a time and place for notes but if you are taking notes in over a quarter of your classes, you're doing it wrong.\n\nMechanical engineering, undergraduate",

Studies have shown (if my memory serves correctly) that handwriting notes leads to better retention, since you can't transcribe and have to process what's important in real time.\n\nI agree with the other points, though. Active recall is a powerful tool; it's just not a full on replacement to note taking.",

                      "text": "[The studies beg to differ](https://www.usu.edu/academic-support/class/effective_note_taking). \n\n> Taking notes aids your comprehension and retention. Researchers found that if important information was contained in notes, it had a 34% chance of being remembered (Howe, 1970, in Longman and Atkinson, 1999). Information not found in notes had only a 5% chance of being remembered.\n\nTaking notes is a vital part of the process. *You* may have gotten away without them, but that makes you the exception.\n\nThis isn't a dichotomy. You can (and should) both take notes and use active recall study techniques. They're both important.\n\nEdit: Another important note from [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/)\n\n> These findings hold important implications for students who use their laptops to access lecture outlines and notes that have been posted by professors before class.  Because students can use these posted materials to access lecture content with a mere click, there is no need to organize, synthesize or summarize in their own words.  Indeed, students may take very minimal notes or not take notes at all, and may consequently forego the opportunity to engage in the mental work that supports learning.",
