Compared to the workforce, it felt like what you\u2019d imagine being a minor member of some large royal family might be like, with open-air fields and palatial halls to explore. It doesn\u2019t feel like that at the time, but I assure you it will once you\u2019ve graduated. \n\nAs to the experience of college itself it can feel a little weird if you\u2019re the kind of person for whom everything must have a defined rationale and end goal, and social events in college often involve people pressuring you to bullshit a statement of purpose for your enrollment, choice of major etc. on the fly. But being able to stay on campus while you figure out what you want to learn, as well as what you want to research, what you want to read about, and what you want to write about - that is absolutely worth it.",

When I changed my major, I remember feeling so frustrated that I had \u2018wasted\u2019 time and money studying other things, but my mom gave me the best advice: nothing you learn is ever a waste. You may think it might not make you money or whatever, but you never know how it\u2019ll develop you as a person. My mom went into school with plans to be a doctor and eventually switched to study music, and to this day she tells me she has no regrets about any of it.",

College is an investment into networking and you want to develop your social skills, with both men and women. Dating women casually will vastly develop this skillset (while not having to commit more once a week or every other one) and with men building friendships. The lifting is to keep you strong and health oriented and a part time job is to put some money in your pocket. I worked in high school to buy an Evo up front and now I'm a lot better off financially, while still being in school. I also recommend being in a co-op program if you're not already. Thatll help get you that 80-110k per year job, at a very young age, straight outta uni basically. College is about working your ass off and becoming the best version of yourself. Which is what many drop outs or anti-college people seem to forget. The degree is a good byproduct, but it isn't everything",

The reason is because the professor had 25 years of experience in the industry and had worked for Time Magazine. The professor did not just know the theory but put it into practice to great affect. He taught us through real world examples and experiences. Everyday I was excited to attend class because there was a guarantee that what was taught had value. There was no conflicting points, everything taught in the class lined up perfectly to current market conditions. In other classes with professors with no industry experience it's an entirely different environment.

Learning how to pull things apart and look at the arguments and methods is the main point of going to college for any kind of degree that involves theory.\n\nYou don't have to hang your hat on any of the theories - just understand how they 'work' and what they 'do' and how they can either help- or hinder- your understanding of whatever you're looking at. It's just a lens or a tool. Sometimes people use those tools to make bad arguments, sometimes those tools can be used to come up with really cool solutions or ways of looking at a problem.\n\nOne of the ways people make bad arguments with theory is through meta-analyses. Meta-analyses are only as good as the studies that go into them. I.e., as much as statistics are great and helpful and illuminating, you can also use them to lie. Sorting the wheat from the chaff is a great skill that is sorely needed in any field these days.",

If you are a leader in these clubs that will matter to future employers because they will see you have leadership experience and potential. If they see that you tried many things they will see that you are someone who is open to new experiences and is willing to attempt alternative methods or solutions. They will see that you are a team member by having participated in clubs and study groups. Most of all, it is about what you want and feels. Even if the things you do in college don't further your professional experience along down the road, will you look back on it fondly or will you regret what you didn't do?",

What I originally wanted to study isn't how I thought it would be- but I still have dreams related to this study...should I change or keep trying- if I change, how late is too late?, am I wasting my time/money- will this ever actually help me get a career in the field I want?, I'm so used to having personal time and now I have none- is this sacrifice to happiness worth it?. Questions upon questions and doubts upon doubts keep cycling through my head. \n\nOn top of that, I took way too many complex classes at once because I had no one to guide me- and now I'm stuck with them for the semester...I don't want to doubt myself, but I'd be lying if I genuinely didn't think there was a good chance that I'll fail at least one or two of them. This leads me to think doing all this is even more of a waste. I also just feel really behind because a few of my classes expect me to remember stuff I learned back in 9th or 10th grade in hs...which I don't remember at all. I'm so frustrated and it is taking a toll on my mental health :/ \n\nI was honestly learning more when I was able to study my passions on my own time...when I actually had plenty of time to do that. It just makes me really sad because I haven't been able to study my actual interests yet in school- and probably won't for a couple of years. \n\nI completely understand what you mean, even if it's all for different reasons.
