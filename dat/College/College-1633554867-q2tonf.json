  "title:": "Should I take different courses now? or this certificate later? even if I'll graduate later..",
  "text": "so I'm 22 and thought I was going to be graduating this year but I spoke with my advisor and she told me I still needed 4 more classes cause I transferred. I saw a video production certificate that interests me but I won't be able to take it until next semester and then another in a summer and by then I'll be 23 and I don't know if that's considered too late to graduate. I know there's no such thing as being \"too late\" to do anything but my brain still thinks so, and because I'm working part time I still feel like a failure seeing my friends work more (which is stupid I know). I already am taking 2 6-week courses so I don't know what I should. Does anyone have any guidance or advice for this?",
