  "text": "When I graduated from high school IGCSE, I was 16 and enrolled in a foundation course which I felt wasn't really right for me. The lecturers treated us like children, forcing us to take notes and repeating the same thing multiple times despite us already confirming that we have listened. I sat through that course for one term before I transferred because I got 2 Bs and a B-.\n\nFollowing that terrible decision, I made another choice which I'm still not sure is right. I immediately went to another college after having a draining first term and started over. The first term was semi-okay, subjects were draining and I did not feel like it was an improvement from highschool despite many seniors and my parents saying so.\n\nTerm 2 was when the lockdown browser was implemented. I heard about the damage it does and sure enough, it did. My computer had some functions disabled which took 2 weeks to fix. Certain teachers ask of the students to turn on the camera when speaking and I felt uncomfortable doing that but was forced to by the teacher. I largely gave up on this term except for one class I was interested in, the other subjects were too difficult and the teachers gave too much homework.\n\nI'm currently approaching the end of term 2, finals are in a week or so. I started this term when my friends started in CIMP (Canadian International Programme) and seeing their work and exams, it seems more suitable for me as it is also accepted in other nations, whereas my course is local only. I feel like shit knowing that I made so many terrible choices with my college education and I have contemplated asking my parents if I could be transferred. However, I have already done that and they gave me a lot of shit. Plus, I'm two terms deep into this current course. I feel lost and really tired, not sure what I should do from this point onwards.",
