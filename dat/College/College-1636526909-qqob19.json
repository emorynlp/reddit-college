  "text": "Okay so I\u2019ve been doing online school for 2 years now and It\u2019s been a rollercoaster to say the least. But, we\u2019re back on campus now and I have the WORST social anxiety\u2026it\u2019s so bad that I feel so tense the whole time in class. One of the 3 classes I have to take is called modern architecture and I liked it at first when it was online and then in person I\u2019m not even able to consume any of the information the professor is saying. There are girls at the back of the class who keep giggling and that just makes my anxiety 10 times worse and I\u2019m completely unable to participate because it makes my breathing extremely rapid. idk why im trying to explain anxiety to you but I completely gave up on understanding in this class and just choose to self study it at home. What can I do to pass time in class?? Obviously i can\u2019t watch netflix or something so??",

I\u2019m a straight A student but I simply can\u2019t learn maths during a classroom, I just skip and watch youtube videos lol. \n\nYou can do homework for some other classes or something, or play a mobile game.",
