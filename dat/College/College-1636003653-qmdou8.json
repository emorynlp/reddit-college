  "title:": "Should I buy noise cancelling headphones or a dry herb vaporizer (cannabis) to help me study",
  "text": "I am insanely stressed all the time and live in a less than ideal household \n\n\nThe arguements give me crazy anxiety because of what\u2019s resulted from them in the past \n\n\nAs a result, my studies have been suffering. Cause I get incredibly distraught and need some type of vice\n\n\nI was thinking either noise cancelling headphones, to drown out music and arguements, or a dry herb vape, so that I can start smoking to help me sleep (I get about 4 hours a night) and relax when my family is arguing. I was thinking maybe it\u2019d help calm my mind for studying too",

I have an xmax starry vape and I love it!\n\nAlso, the Calm brand melatonin gummies work even better. They have l-theanine and magnesium, they'll 100% knock you out.",
