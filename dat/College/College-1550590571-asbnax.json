Sure, it's a bother having to wait for the bus in the cold - I also ride the bus so I get it, especially with how cold our temperatures are (it was -31\u02da F when I was waiting for the bus this morning) - but wouldn't you rather go into campus and go to class on a day where you wouldn't want to do anything fun anyway?\n\nAnother reason I like going into campus on cold days is also because my office is far warmer than my apartment at home, because my neighbour controls the heat and he only turns it on when he gets home from work at 5pm. This means it's nice and toasty overnight, but staying home during the day is just not a fun time.",

              "text": "I have a space heater but it often blows a fuse if I have it on at the same time as my computer, TV, etc. or even any of my kitchen appliances. It's a really tiny bachelor apartment, and almost everything is on the same fuse, and blowing a fuse means going into *another* neighbour's apartment to reset it -- basically, it was a house that was transformed into three separate apartments, so one apartment has the heating controls, one has the fuses, etc. I actually don't think I have control over anything, but I also have the cheapest rent.\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter too much, because even if it were warmer at home during the day, I would still prefer to come into campus because I don't make any progress at home. If I stayed home more often, I'd just end up getting nothing done. It's just that the office being warm is something I do remind myself of every morning when I'm waiting at the bus stop if it's below -30\u02da outside when I leave for school.",
