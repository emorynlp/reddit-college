  "text": "I\u2019m unhappy about the people I live with. I\u2019m not a freshman so I live well away from campus and I don\u2019t feel at home here at all. I\u2019m jealous of my friends who have their own friends or just better people as roommates. I regret my decision to live with people I didn\u2019t know before (but covid and in-person school did make this hard). Does anyone else feel or has had to go through a year of a depressing or just bad housing situation? I wish I could get out of this. I\u2019m not happy here. Drop your advice or roommate horror stories",
