  "text": "I\u2019m in a managerial stats class right now, super basic, and my professor is awful. It isn\u2019t just me, the whole class is struggling. The class average on our last test was a 35, and the overall class average is a 55. She doesn\u2019t allow us to ask any sort of questions in class and we are all so lost. She snapped at a student who raised their hand the other day and told him to come to office hours. It\u2019s like she can\u2019t plan out her class time and needs to fit everything from start to end. Today she started class five minutes early and yelled at students who were \u2018late\u2019 even tho they were on time by university standards. Should I contact the department chair?",

      "text": "Remember, college faculty, unlike K-12 teachers, are only experts in their subject matter and may have had little to no pedagogical education. College professors don\u2019t necessarily learn how to teach. \n\nThe fact that she starts class early and doesn\u2019t allow for questions, telling you that you have to come to office hours, tells me she lacks appropriate  classroom time management skills. She plans her lessons with the intent to pack as much lecture into class as possible and therefore doesn\u2019t plan time for questions. Learning is not just about dumping information on students and hoping they catch it; it\u2019s an active process. \n\nYou also mentioned that the class average is 55 and the last test average was 35. Others have said that this will reflect poorly on her end-of-course evaluations, but if this is not her first semester teaching, she\u2019s gotten away with it before. My concern is that she might slide the grades. While this would be good for your grade, it won\u2019t be good for showing that she is an ineffective teacher. Exams are supposed to be a test of the teacher\u2019s ability to convey knowledge as much as the student\u2019s attempt at learning it.\n\nI agree with making sure everyone submits honest reviews (please do these in a rational and fair manner so you will be taken seriously. Respectfully lay out your grievances instead of just saying, \u201c[Professor] is a crazy, terrible professor whose class is bullshit\u201d).\n\nIf you are going to complain to the department chair, I also recommend doing so as a group. This will help convey that more than one student is having this issue. However, as others have said, this may be effective or it may not be, depending on the department chair and what they can do.\n\nYour other option is to stand up to her as a class, in person, but this just may make her angry, so be warned. Confront her, and don\u2019t let that responsibility fall to just one student. It often upsets faculty that students escalate an issue above their heads or wait until performance evals instead of taking it up with the professor themselves. Modern young adults seem to be really bad about avoiding direct conflict (I blame digital means of communication, because you can completely avoid face-to-face conversation), and sometimes you just have to suck it up and start a conflict (I say this as a millennial myself, who had to learn to not fear conflict. I have many friends who avoid conflict at all costs, and it\u2019s very frustrating). So hold her accountable in class. Don\u2019t raise hands; don\u2019t wait for her permission to speak, because she won\u2019t give it. Just as a class, agree that you\u2019re going to interrupt and address the issue. If she won\u2019t listen, escalate to the chair. At least you give her a chance to defend herself before going above her.",

It's your responsibility to learn by yourself and work on your assignments. Also most people just don't study enough. Never had problems getting good grades if I studied even on exams where most people fail and overall barley pass.  She already told you when you have questions ask her afterwords during office hours and people still don't get it. If attendance is mandatory just deal with it like an adult take notes ,prepare yourself if you struggle and learn at home. I don't think she teaches you something wrong but you aren't fast enough to understand everything. Well she doesn't owe you anything but you still need to pass this class I guess .",

You try to shit on my comment because of 1 or 2 sentences. Perhaps you need another brain I know I can't compare myself to others because I am not them. Also I don't think I am intelligent or have it especially easy to learn shit.

Just means you have to work extra hard.  It's an undergrad course, so there will be plenty of information online: tutorials, youtube videos, Kahn academy, etc.  If you aren't picking up the material from class, it's your responsibility to get it some other way.  It's not high school, the prof isn't there to spoonfeed you the information.  I know 99% of /r/college doesn't want to hear this, but it's the truth.",

Its not like this person is saying \"i dont get it give me the answer\". \n I have had plenty of professors good and horrible.   yet they were able to answer basic questions. Since this is a math/logic based class from what it sounds like, one would expect a certain level of questioning. \n\n  To foster the idea that this person who genuinely has no idea as being lazy is probably why no one answers questions to begin with. I would not be surprised if most of those students had the same question. \n\nAlso lets not forget most of the class is failing that says a lot about the professor. Their \"come to my office hours\" is obviously not working. Most likely this professor is going to get looked at anyways because of student evaluations and passing rates",

Professors do run their classrooms in different ways and technically, the professor is not obligated to actually answer any questions for you, *however* that she *snapped* at a student for asking a question is a concern for me -- *that* is what I would suggest someone go to the department chair about, but if it's not that student in particular that she snapped at (if it's just you or another witness), then not much is likely to be done.\n\nEssentially, to make a complaint that will be taken seriously when it concerns the professor's method(s) of teaching/running their classroom, the complaints must a) come from the person directly involved (so, for example, anyone she snapped or got angry at), and b) there should be multiple. One complaint from one student indicates to the department chair that *maybe* that student is overreacting or making it up (which is ridiculous, but still), especially if it's a student saying \"hey I saw this happen\" but nobody directly involved came forward. You need multiple complaints, and for the people directly involved to be some of them.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, when it comes to the class average, that will be reflected in performance evaluations. Many schools have students also fill out course evaluations each term for a professor, so if your school does that, then students will be able to evaluate her teaching -- but even without student-provided course evaluations, professors are often evaluated within their departments and a course average reflects how well they're teaching the content (so it will come back to bite her in the ass eventually). Not that all departments care much about it, but that's where the multiple complaints from students would add to the feedback.",
