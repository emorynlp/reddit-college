  "title:": "Should I switch schools to avoid my unrequited crush of 2.5 years, who I have an unhealthy obsession with?",
  "text": "I (24F) was accepted into the same college as my unrequited crush, who I\u2019ve had an unhealthy obsession with for 2.5 years now. I actually decided to go to my current school because of him. I\u2019m finally working on said obsession and my other mental health issues with a therapist, but I haven\u2019t made any progress yet. Due to covid and my mental illnesses, I\u2019ve never actually been on campus, and I\u2019ve only completed one class. I\u2019m considering attending classes on campus next quarter, which is Winter 2022. However, I know that I\u2019ll end up trying to get closer to my crush, even though he has blocked me on every channel of communication. Is it worth switching schools, which might help with my mental health and his sanity?",

      "text": "I'd transfer - like you said, you're only going to your current school because he's going there. Even though you'll be in therapy for a year by the time you start on campus, a year of progress can unravel very quickly depending on your mental health status in late 2022. \n\nYou can also wait it out until Summer 2022 and honestly ask yourself this: if I cross paths with him on campus, will I relapse? \n\nIf the answer is still yes by then, it's time to transfer. \n\nObsessions are hard to kick to the curb, and sometimes it takes drastic measures to work through them. Do what you know is best for you and your mental health when the time comes.",

      "text": "I switched jobs to get away from a man I was obsessed with and he knew it. He used to enable it to get me to perform at my job, (we were high pressure commission sales) he would be affection one day and if my sales slipped he would be cold. I would chase this hot and cold. \n\nIt was affecting my mental health and I knew beyond that job we had no future. If you\u2019re thinking of leaving to this point of creating a strategy, you probably should consider leaving, if you can\u2019t kill it. \n\nI couldn\u2019t, so I left, & I felt like I could finally move ahead. Like I could breathe. I still can\u2019t figure out what made him so spectacular in my head, but I can only say this now that I am not around him. I\u2019m in a professional program now and if I were seeing that man each day\u2014I would not be able to do this program. Do what you need to do to thrive and heal. Love you! Rooting for you!",

If you\u2019re anything like me, continuing going to that school and \u201cjust ignoring him\u201d is not going to work. Your mind will keep wondering \u201cwhat if\u201d and all your hard work on getting over it will get burned up. Our minds are not like most people\u2019s, we can\u2019t just \u201cget over\u201d something we\u2019ve become invested in, I see a lot of people in the comments saying that and it\u2019s more than that. I don\u2019t know if you have a form of OCD or maladaptive daydream disorder but I\u2019d advise talking to your therapist about it. You have to remember who you are before this guy, what your passions were, and give love to yourself because obsessions with unrequited lovers ruins your self esteem. Someone in the comments said \u201cdon\u2019t let this guy dictate where you go to college\u201d but honestly you won\u2019t be able to focus on your education when your mind is focused on him being nearby. My whole high school experience was ruined because I was obsessed with taking classes with my guy and changing my walking routes around school just to catch a glimpse of him. Please trust me, it will not get better on its own, you have to cut off all ties and constantly remind yourself that he does not love you and never will. It hurts like a demon but it will be worth it. You will get your life back. \nMy dms are open if you need someone to talk to who understands you, ppl like us are few and far between, and often misunderstood. Best of luck.",

You might find yourself passionate about other people.\n\nRemember that no one else needs to know this drama.\n\nI made this mistake recently, but again. I learned how many infections wounds I had from no self esteem from college years.\n\nI however had a guy who was going as far as wanting me to hang out over the summer. After he and I were flirting for 6 months. Then Snapchat block for 3 months. Then we would go back to talking again (hed unblock me claiming an accident) then he egg me on then block again on Snapchat. Again, I take can you meet my sister (who was my year) walk me to my dorm and talk to me at the bar (I wanted to take it slow) talking He then last year made comments seemingly like he wanted me back and my family (I confessed now, and due to life they hate him).\n\nHe got with a girl (first one i knew about) deleted fb (where I had him) and won\u2019t add me on insta (he going to say I guess similar to above, thought I was scam etc). And blocked my phone because again, lost my contact. And I finished it by blocking him on insta. In case.\n\nAgain my case he was egging me on, yet I wasn\u2019t putting out I guess. and he gets with so many girls.\n\nWork on yourself and don\u2019t drag this into other drama.\n\nI have in my situation 2 people I can talk to. And anyone that knew him didn\u2019t even know about me.\n\nI made the mistake of posting about it, if he went through my family or my dad work contact it was obvious what he would learn. And a bunch of people on fb deleted me.\n\nAgain, there is one that I would be concerned about making comments in the future to me or to someone I knew. and that girl dropped out of med school/phd after 3 years, trying to go to nursing school and had a broken engagement/new serious bf since then. And even my fake friends would say she was a fake person.\n\nSo I am not worried much but I might be forced (can\u2019t get around it) friends of friends. I am older than you by 2-3 years now. And again I am built in from this area. So there is a chance I meet his sister who doesn\u2019t know me. And will have forgotten.",
