  "text": "Been debating between going to WGU for IT/Network Security which would take me 1-3 semesters and cost around 4000-10000 since I already have all the Comptia certs and a prior degree.\n\nOr I could quit my job and apply to University of Georgia, which is the closest in person school near me. I kinda regret that my first college didn't have much of a party or dating scene, and I live in a retiree town where there's not much to do. The cost would be 25000 just for the schooling, and probably 40-50k when everything is all said and done, so huge difference in price as well as it would take longer 2.5 to 3 years. \n\nI'm 29 years old at the moment, and I've been working in IT for a year and a half, and I've been looking for a way to level up my career beyond help desk roles.\n\nSo, I'm not sure if I should just suck it up and continue my work at home job and finish everything quick online. Or will I regret it if I don't go to an in person university and live it up. Is the college experience all hype for the bloated cost, or will the in person uni give me a whole lot more opportunity for career, dating, and things to do?",

      "text": "At 29 and with IT experience, you\u2019d be better off doing online at this stage in your life. I\u2019d recommend a fully online program of a physical college rather than WGU. Penn state and ASU come to mind. WGU isn\u2019t bad but employers often have bias to online degrees because they still live in the Stone Age. The two I listed won\u2019t say online anywhere as well so employers won\u2019t be able to tell. If that isn\u2019t an option, WGU is still not a bad choice, it\u2019s quite good, it\u2019s just not the BEST choice",
