I thought I was doing really well.\n\nWell apparently not. Got my exams back. 63, 78, 78, 82. I did everything that I was supposed to. I did more than I was supposed to, honestly. And it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nWhat do I do when my absolute most isn\u2019t enough? I went to office hours, I went to tutors, I studied and studied, I felt confident with practice exams, I felt confident with homework, quizzes, all of it. And nothing. \n\nI can\u2019t do anything else. Why try if it\u2019s just going to result in those marks, for every class.",

      "text": ">Got my exams back. 63, 78, 78, 82.\n\nIt might help to recalibrate your understanding of the grading scale.  The scores you received are not objectively bad, they've average.  I understand how these grades might come as a surprise if you tended to receive much higher grades in high school, but college work is simply a different level of expectation and understanding compared to high school.\n\n>What do I do when my absolute most isn\u2019t enough?\n\nIsn't enough *for what*, exactly?  Getting all A's?  That's a nice goal to have, but it's certainly not *necessary* in order to graduate or get a job after college or whatever.  The 78's and 82's are fine, roughly C's or B's depending on the exact grading scale.  The 63 is a little more concerning, but certainly not unrecoverable based on your performance from here on.\n\nI think you're doing ok overall.  Just keep studying and keep working at it.  If you're taking a wide variety of subjects, it's not unreasonable to assume that you'll do better in some of them compared to the others depending on your particular interests and abilities.  So just keep diligently studying, attending class, going to tutors, etc., and do the best you can.  That's all you can ask of yourself.\n\n> No parties, no time off. Constant studying, day in and day out.\n\nOh, and stop doing this.  Nobody can work 18 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Research clearly shows that after a certain amount of work without a substantial break, our ability to learn new things, absorb complex information, and use that information to complete tasks falls off drastically.  So, there's a clear point of diminishing returns for someone who studies all the time.  I'm not saying you have to become a party animal and go out on the town 5 nights per week, but you should distribute clear periods of leisure throughout your week, even formally adding them to your daily schedule if you need to.\n\nGood luck.",

It is possible that you have a learning disability that would require Accomodations if your grades aren\u2019t reflecting your efforts. Just a possibility. I\u2019d make sure to go over your exams with your professors after each one to see what you did wrong. \nWhat year are you in? These classes are extremely challenging. Your grades could actually be average for the class (lots of STEM grade deflation) if your school is rigorous. All you can do is the best you can, which is what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m sure there is someone on campus who can talk with you about this, I\u2019d suggest the disability center (even if you don\u2019t have a disability). They\u2019re very helpful. \nBut constant studying with no breaks could be hurting your grades more than if you prioritize sleep, exercise, and a healthy diet. It may not be that you need to study more.",
