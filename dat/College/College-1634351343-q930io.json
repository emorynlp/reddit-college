  "text": "Having trouble with a class and I think it would be best to just withdraw from it instead of failing eventually. The question is, the last day to drop has been passed, and if I drop the class, it\u2019ll turn into a WF. Does this affect GPA at all? If so, how? Should I just take an F instead of a WF, or save myself the trouble and just drop it?",

      "text": "Pretty sure WF shows up as F on your transcript and calculated gpa. At this point it's best to stick the class out and try to make absolutely anything higher than an F. Withdrawing now IS failing. If you can make a D or a C that's better than withdrawing. Go to office hours, study, do the homework.\n\nAlso, individual schools may handle it differently, so you might want to make an appointment with your academic advisor.",

      "text": "Like the other commenter said, it\u2019s probably going to count as a F in your GPA (but check with your academic advisor).\n\nEven if there\u2019s no way to pull your grade up, it\u2019s still better to stick it out. You\u2019ll hopefully learn something, even if it\u2019s small, which can help you if you retake the class.",
