  "title:": "I'm starting two more classes this week. Any tips for keeping myself organized and continue getting Bs?",
  "text": "I'm currently taking three classes: Principles of Computer Science (CSCI 110), English Composition (ENGL 100), and College Algebra (MATH 140). This is week 8 or 9, depending on professor's start days (most weeks starting Friday or Monday). \n\nI have an A, a B+, and a B, and I'm happy with those, but I have to make sure they stay around that; I'm satisfied with anything above a C- or so. I just don't want D's or F's, even though D's are technically passing.\n\nOn Tuesday, my other two classes start: Student Success (FIGS 100), and Introduction to Trigonometry (MATH 146). I'm not sure how to manage my time to make sure I get all the assignments in before their due dates. I have a planner, but that doesn't tell me how long the chapter is or how complicated the math problems will be, so it's hard to know how long to spend on homework each day.",
