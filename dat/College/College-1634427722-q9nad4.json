  "text": "I had to kill a centipede at 2 in the morning last week and I found another one today. Normally I would've gotten my roommate to do it as she doesn't have an extreme fear of insects like I do but she was away for both times. I can't even find the second one's body so I don't even know if it's dead or if it's going to show up later.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on making your dorm insect-proof? If I find another I might die and I'm stuck here for another month-and-a-half (Technically longer but I don't want to think about the Spring semester rn).\n\nEdit 10/18: I saw another one I'm going to kms",

      "text": "Like someone else said, get a dehumidifier. Centipedes love humidity. Clean up after yourself well. No crumbs laying around and food sealed in containers when not in use. \n\nCentipedes however are beneficial and may indicate the presence of some other insects in your dorm. Centipedes are actually predators of roaches! And other bugs too\n\nMake sure entry points into the dorm are sealed as much as possible. No cracks in window sills etc.",
