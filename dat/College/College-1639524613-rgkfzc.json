  "text": "So I'm about to finish my BS after 2 attempts. This being my second. \n\nI have 3 total transcripts. I'm trying to determine my final GPA for my bachelor's. \n\nOne is from my first community college where I did very poorly finishing with a 2.3.\n\nOnly 31 credits transfered from that community college in Alabama to one in my current state of residence Texas. I finished community college in Texas with a 4.0.\n\nI transferred to my current University from that community college. 60 credits transferred from that one and that includes some from the 1st CC. \n\n I'm aiming to graduate University with a 3.7 from the credits I completed here. I completed 62 credits at the University. \n\nSo breakdown:\nTranscript #1: (1st CC) 2.3\nTranscript #2: ( 2nd CC) 4.0\nTranscript #3 (4 yr Uni): 3.7\n\nWhat would be my overall bachelor of science GPA as these transcripts include my required gen Ed and major related courses (neuroscience)?",
