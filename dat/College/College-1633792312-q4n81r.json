  "text": "Only on week 6 but I\u2019m going full time and working two jobs. I also have bipolar 2 and the mast two weeks I\u2019ve felt manic. I want to avoid my responsibilities. In reality, I think I just need a break though. Which isn\u2019t for a while. What do you guys do to motivate yourself? This is only my first semester, there\u2019s still plenty to go.\nEdit: spellcheck",

      "text": "Are you able to quit one of your jobs? That could make your life a lot easier. \n\nWhen I get burned out I try to think about what my goals are in the long run. It helps to realize that slacking off now will make life much harder in the future. Also, try to get your work done in chunks so you have some time to relax. \n\nTherapy could also help, especially since you have bipolar disorder. I know what its like to struggle with mental illness while in school, but if you get the right therapist, it can go a long way. Maybe also be open with your professors about your mental health issues and see if your school offers extensions for students with disabilities.\n\nOh, and one more thing: go to office hours if you are struggling to understand the material. Usually nobody is there, and I\u2019ve found it to be super helpful, especially if you come with a list of questions you have.",
