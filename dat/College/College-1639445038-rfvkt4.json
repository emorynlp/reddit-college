A big issue is there is alot of med school spots, then less residency spots and even less attending physician positions. Many have resorted to going up North to work. It can take months even years to get a primary care physician. Especially in the Maritime provinces. But a huge isssue is a majority of MD/DO holders can never work because of how few residency positions there are. \n\nOh and because of the shortage many doctors have resorted to treating nurses and aids poorly. So there is also a nursing demand because many nurses can\u2019t handle the toxic work environment created (has been around since the 90s i believe)",

Personally I\u2019m going to be taking 5 1/2 years (3 1/2 done so far) since I have a step daughter (4) and a baby due in the middle of next semester (have to take the semester off). \nAll that matters is that you finish you\u2019re degree. There\u2019s no time limit and you\u2019re not behind because it takes you longer. Go at your own pace. \nBest of luck on your future endeavors!",
