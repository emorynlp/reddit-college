And it is sometimes the same for other grad schools (expect masters).  Making this level of school unreachable for first gens too. \n\nI\u2019m grateful I only have to worry about school.

A big issue is there is alot of med school spots, then less residency spots and even less attending physician positions. Many have resorted to going up North to work. It can take months even years to get a primary care physician. Especially in the Maritime provinces. But a huge isssue is a majority of MD/DO holders can never work because of how few residency positions there are. \n\nOh and because of the shortage many doctors have resorted to treating nurses and aids poorly. So there is also a nursing demand because many nurses can\u2019t handle the toxic work environment created (has been around since the 90s i believe)",
