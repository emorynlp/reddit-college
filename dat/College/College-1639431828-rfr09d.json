  "text": "As final grades continue to roll in, I\u2019ve been heavily docked on one of my major writing assignments because I didn\u2019t \u201cmeet the page requirement\u201d. The last page is not full, but is well over half way filled with text, so I\u2019m curious what this subs experience is with this issue. In my experience throughout highschool and college, as long as you made it well into the last page, it\u2019s counted. I don\u2019t know what ground I have to stand on challenging this.",

I\u2019ve always just put in that extra 30 minutes to get onto the next page to get those points so I can\u2019t say exactly how many points those teachers would take off but I would say you have basically no grounds to challenge it.",
