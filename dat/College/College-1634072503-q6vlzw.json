      "text": "I can relate to the pbj sandwich dilemma \ud83d\ude02. I dont eat these anymore but Tina burritos are literally $0.40 each, i dont eat them anymore since they have alot of sodium like cup of noodles. Idk how they taste in the microwave but i would let them sit out a bit after taking them out the freezer and then put them in the microwave for a decent amount of time but not too hot so that it cooks similar to if it was in the oven.\n\nMaybe protein powder and then just mix it with milk. It aint much but it can make your tummy full for a while.\n\nThats rough man, i honestly cant think of anything else. Maybe some eggo waffles too lol.",

      "text": "Depending on rules, you may also be allowed a hot plate. Ikea sells an induction one for $50 CND.\n\nOtherwise rice cooker and slow cooker will help a LOT.\n\nKettle is also nice but less immediately useful for cooking compared to like, tea. \n\nMicrowave corn on the cob or fajitas (get rotisserie chicken) loaded baked potatoes, eggs in a cup (make when no roomates around and air out after) microwave pancakes. \n\nSteamed veggies in the rice cooker, oatmeal, rice cooker cakes, hard-boiled eggs, quinoa, dal, bibimbap, heat up soups (you won't get like, full cooking, but using a base and some not raw meat stuff can make better soups)\n\nSlow cooker will have dozens of cookbooks.\n\nHonestly. Stop by either the library or a thrift store, old how to cook in a microwave books are always at the thrift store here. They are very 80s, but still good.\n\nAlso /r/eatcheapandhealthy as well as [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/) and the [SNAP food cookbook](https://www.leannebrown.com/cookbooks/) both aim for cheap cooking. Sadly I think they mostly assume you have a stove, but you can adapt some of them.",
