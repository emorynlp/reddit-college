  "text": "My entomology class (bioscience gen-ed req) is gonna be a real squeaker. Not too worried about the final but attendance and assignments could really hurt me.\n\nMy ancient writing class (elective) might end up being an F or a D. I know i can write a fine-ass final paper, and test 2 shouldnt be an issue, but missing test 1 and my overall attendance will probably put in a failing position.\n\nBut hey, historical linguistics (upper div major elective) should be good to go.\n\nTake good care of your mental health folks. If you\u2019re feeling unsure early on, don\u2019t be afraid to take the withdraw. It\u2019s there for a reason. I\u2019ve been in college since 2015, but I\u2019m almost there. This setback is gonna hurt, but life goes on.",
