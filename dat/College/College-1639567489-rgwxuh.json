      "text": "What's your major and salary potential? If you have high earning potential, you should try and get through school so you can start making money and then pay back student loans quickly. If it's lower earning potential, probably better to avoid debt like the plague and go slower, get slightly better grades. Or if you're going to go to grad school you should probably take at least a semester or two to get the hand of school and learn what works best for you.",

          "text": "I refuse to take out more than $2,000 in loans. Initially, my school did cover most of my tuition, besides the loan and less than $1,000 I paid out of pocket, but most of my scholarships and grants were need based. Much like other people FAFSA put my EFC a lot higher than it actually is, doubling it from this year, so I got knocked out of the bracket for almost all of them.",
