  "text": "I've never been a particularly successful student. I went on academic probation my first semester and didn't do amazing the semester after, albeit I did have improvement. I got much better with classes in my sophomore year (nearly making the dean's list in my first semester sophomore year) and did alright in my second semester but not as well (COVID really burned me out towards the end). I have autism and depression, and managing them both in a college environment can be extremely difficult for me, even with help, leading to me going into cycles where I will feel completely unmotivated to do work, skip classes, etc.\n\nNow I am in the first semester of my junior year. Currently missing a bunch of assignments and have a few teachers that have no late work policies, hence tanking my grades. Also fell into a spell of depression where I skipped classes and forgot about assignments, hence tanking my grades more. That is not to say, however, that I have not been productive.\n\nOver the course of the summer, I was able to land a job remotely as a marketing intern for a logistics company, focusing on their social media and marketing analytics. I really enjoyed the job, even if it was a startup environment. The people were nice and I really enjoyed the work. I also spent a good portion of the summer trying to learn new skills in data analytics and marketing to bolster my resume and make me a better job candidate, something I felt that my college (the private New England liberal arts sort) had completely failed at preparing me for. \n\nEarlier in September, following the completion of my first internship, I got an offer for another marketing internship position at a major software company, which I accepted. I'm great with interviews and projecting my confidence and skillset to other people, offering help, among other things, and I was really able to make a good impression on my recruiters and hiring managers, something I had never been able to do with my professors.\n\nNow I am almost a month into my second marketing internship, and boy, this is amazing. I am finally putting all the summer effort into learning new skills, software, and techniques in marketing to help boost my image and make me a strong worker. I have always felt more enjoyment at work than I did at school, so for the first time ever I have felt appreciated for my skillset. My managers always let me know that I am doing good work, and we have lots of constant communication on how to improve the business. Overall, the technology, the people, the corporate culture, and the field have all been eye-openers to me as to what I am truly capable of, and now I feel at peace knowing that for once, despite my mental handicaps, I can be a truly productive member of society. This brings me back to college. \n\nDespite my success in the workplace, I feel upset about my performance in classes and bitter about the fact that I am being forced to do something that for my whole life has never benefited me in a positive way - sitting in a classroom memorizing gobs of information. It just feels like such an outdated model of teaching for the purposes of what I want to do with my career. I have learned infinitely more from my LinkedIn Learning courses on marketing concepts, R, Tableau, and other functions than I ever have in a classroom setting. Based on the wide pool of students available here, I figured I ask a few questions. What would be the best way to help my situation? I understand that college is necessary, but what can I do to make it easier for me to accomplish? And are there ways I could work with the system to make it easier for me to go through college? I am open to any and all suggestions, cause I am a bit lost. Much thanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Suck at school due to mental handicaps, overall disinterest in learning style, and much higher interest in pursuing career opportunities. Got a job I loved while in school and working it is much more fulfilling than being in school, making me more bitter and sucking more. Looking for ways to reduce or embrace my suck.",
