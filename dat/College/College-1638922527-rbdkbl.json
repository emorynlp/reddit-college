  "text": "Due to covid19 my son lost a lot of opportunities to do things like studying aboard. \n\nHe kept losing out on program after program because they limited size due to covid to only seniors and told him do not worry you have senior year. \n\nSenior year fall semester comes... and they denied because of covid they shut down the program from 50 seats to 5. This particular program is bulit into his major so he can graduate without it but he most likely can not do the experience let say over the summer.\n\nHe's a 4.0 student but he brought up the idea possiblly taking spring 2022 and fall 2022 off and returning spring 2023 in the hopes covid dies down or another shot at the program.\n\nI was always under the impression taking off is a bad idea. Anyone have thoughts?\n\nAs well as finnical aid would not be an issue here.",

Not just due to not actively using school skills, but because the things they do in the meantime pull them into the working world and they do not wish to return.\nSome classes seniors have to take for their particular major is easiest taken right after previous classes within the program",

      "text": "It depends on what your son decides to do with the year off. An internship where he can apply himself while learning in the real world would allow him to really appreciate school in addition to have a better idea of what do to post-grad. This is just one example, but I\u2019m just pointing out the fact that if he does decide to take the year off, he should make sure he is building some form of [identity capital](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-identity-capital-why-so-important-jason-hart), and not just working a pointless job or not doing anything at all. Wishing y\u2019all all the best!",

They could apply for an international master's degree program. They could do a language abroad program (to learn or teach). They could volunteer or work abroad after graduation.",
