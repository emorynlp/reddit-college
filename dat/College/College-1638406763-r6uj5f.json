  "text": "So. Quick recap. After HS I got pushed by mom to go for a associates to get access to university (, that's how it works here).\nI wanted a trade but was not legally able to decide for myself (Yea that's a thing).\n19, done the associates, bad grades, can't find a company willing to take me in, the year for trade schools started and I had no spot. My mom was happy cause that meant I'd have to go to university. Began a journey of bad jobs, alcohol and self hate for a year, enrolled into engineering but after 2 semesters knew it's not for me. Found my passion back for what I wanted to be, had the choice army or police. Pursued a career in law enforcement, took me 2 years of hard work (exams, pt tests, medical assessments, cognitive tests. You name it. Also going from powerlifter to endurance athlete)to land the job. It's yearly round bout 16000 applicants for 700 slots that time. During that process I had an accident and broke my back basically. Hid the injury, continued training, just before being sworn in I was hospitalized.\nShit end of the stick. \n\nNow here is my current problem:\nI picked up university at 23, again.\nI was heartbroken, my health declined. I had to do physiotherapy for over a year, was pretty much ready to kill myself since I lost my calling. I saw salvation getting a degree in a very specific field that tended to my liking. Like a golden ticket. Cause who takes a guy for a trade at 23 who on some days can't walk straight? Right?\nIt was hard, ngl. I study econometrics with mandarin and paired to political economy. I found something that appealed so much more... But it didn't make sense, like I couldn't answer the question of \"what you gonna do with it\". Which been the driving force behind my academic choices and quickly shat on by my family(gee thanks mom). Some see degrees that don't make money as useless, others don't. \nSo, initial problems with the language and amount of math I had to suck in.  Couple of failures. 3 semesters in rona hit. Picked the language courses up, still. Passed. Somehow...\nEconomy was a tough cookie but I managed since it's logic driven.\nWell. Long story short, 4 exams. 3 essays left.\nThat's round about 2 language courses, 3 courses from specialization and 1 course of economy.\nI had a veeeeery hard time passing mandarin,) (requiremet is to learn in 2 years what Chinese kids learn in 10 school years)\nWe had deficits, but they way they teach now? Simply ask you vocabulary, make you read 2 texts, maybe let you write something (all over zoom).\nNo they expect us to write an exam in full Chinese, as in on-site.\nI can't graduate without it. Failing postpones it for a year.\nI am literally contemplating self euthanasia. Wasting 3 years to be knocked out by 1 exam. Or rather even not being listened to, saying I should switch majors. Cause only less than 40 people make it every year. Fuck even people whos parents are Chinese sometimes fail. (, they also make the majority of the graduates lol) \n\nIt feels like year after year I got pressured to do more and better.Nothing I wanted was \"high\" enough or prestigious enough. Like who in their right mind things they doing their offspring a favor to pressure them to take on  fucking complicated things. Fun was made about how I want \"low jobs\". \nParents call it \"believing in me\", I call it academic/career pressure. Cause to them its a golden ticket. \nI even went as far to trace back steps. Realizing I never wanted that shitty associates. I would've been a damn good clerk, plumber, chemist or even truck driver.. I had many interests but none counted. It always had to be more.\nThe excuse? They wanted me to have freedom. Ironic, isn't it. Taking away my choices in the name of freedom.\nAnyhow. I am 26 now. On a make or break on my degree.. Probably gonna need to pick up a apprenticeship at fkn 27 to even be able to fend for myself.\nI feel ashamed. Not good e for anything because many times I was overwhelmed and fought through a workload that per say was too much for me. Can't shake the feeling of failure and being a societal outcast. Like. I'll be in class with 17 year Olds... \nI could've  done what I want 10 years ago. It just had to be more. I was obliged to want more. \nNow that I actually discovered it a bit for myself \n, that promised freedom, it probably will be taken away, replaced by a mundane job I would've been happy about years ago. Now it's like a bad joke. So yeah. I really really feel like shit. And want to die.",
