      "text": "I deal with a lot of depression/anxiety while also being neurodivergent and it gets really difficult. My main stressor is my toxic mom and school as well. School is completely manageable and for anyone else, it would not be stressful but I procrastinate a lot. I don't have motivation either so that brings me down a lot.",

      "text": "My biggest stressor is school. It\u2019s more so because I\u2019m a perfectionist and so I need to get good marks and obsess over my work. The stress I place on myself makes me fall into deeper depressions and triggers my eating disorder. I can also get overwhelmed by the amount of school work I have which causes me to have panic attacks.\n\nSchool isn\u2019t what caused me to have severe mental illness issues, but it exacerbated then. And I have no solution to this issue. Therapy doesn\u2019t work for me and I refuse to take medication. I\u2019m lucky enough to be able resilient and continue school despite everything with good marks. I just take things one day at a time and remind myself I only have a few more years left.",

But I don't study for college classes and neither attend them. My stressor right now: I have mid terms starting tomorrow and I haven't even gone through the syllabus. It's not caused by social media because I don't even use anything other that YouTube and reddit in that domain. It's just my professors sucks and don't know the stuff they are teaching! I've been creating my own study plan but it's different from the one in college. I don't know what will happen tomorrow \ud83d\ude13. Pray for me.",
