  "text": "I\u2019ve never been the most motivated student, and it seems to have carried over to college even though I enjoy the classes a lot more than high school. Right now I\u2019m at a 3.5, might go higher or lower depending on finals week. But even though if I fixed some habits I could get higher grades (fixing sleep schedule, fixing study habits, spending less time on my hobbies, etc), I feel no motivation to do it. Pretty much, I\u2019m naturally trying to do the minimum amount of effort required to keep a good grade, rarely more/rarely less. It feels weird seeing friends striving for a 4.0, and I kind of feel like a bad student sometimes. Like I feel like I should be striving for being a better student , but it\u2019s a fleeting feeling.",
