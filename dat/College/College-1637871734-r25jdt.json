  "text": "Hi everyone I was wondering if someone could offer insight onto taking a medical leave of absence ? I'm in my clinical year for medical lab technology, but since I started up on meds to mitigate my anxiety/depression ive actually gotten worse (4.5 weeks in) and am now having to take a leave of absence.\n\nDoes anyone have advice for what to do ? Has anyone experienced going on medication and how long did it take to feel better?",

They'll probably point you towards a specific student services office that will work with you to take a gap semester as well as work out some of your upcoming finals. I'm not going to say this happens all the time, but your case is quite frequent and schools definitely have an action plan.",
