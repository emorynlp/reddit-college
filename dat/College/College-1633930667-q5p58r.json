  "text": "I'm a senior and I just completely fucked up and missed an entire quiz that was due last night by midnight. I was going on absolutely no sleep and a 9 hour day at work and I was too tired to do school and didn't even think about the class. I feel so stupid. I never do this. I'm a 4.0 student. I just cannot do this anymore.",

      "text": "I know how difficult this can be, especially under so much stress among other things not relating to school. I would try and contact your professor and explain your situation, and hopefully, they'll allow you to do it. Usually, I explain what's going on, and apologize for missing the deadline and ask for an extension. I always say I would be willing to accept any late penalties because anything is better than a zero. I know some professors don't care, but I've met a lot who are willing to give you an extension especially if it's a first-time occurrence.\n\nDon't give up though! You're a 4.0 student, that's amazing! We can't be perfect all the time, try not to beat yourself up too much over this. I'm sure you can bounce back from this just fine. \n\nSending you as many good vibes as I can (:",

I did contact her and asked if I could get any credit for it, explained it's important to me to do well and this isn't like me and I've just been struggling a lot although that's not an excuse and it's still entirely my fault. I don't know if she'll say anything but I'm just like...don't know how I did this. I have 100s in her class otherwise but I swear if this means I can't get an A and thus ruins my 4.0 (it's really that easy) I don't know what I'll do",
