  "text": "My professor randomly assigned us to partners for a project and presentation that would be 45% of our grade. When I found out my partner I was concerned as I have noticed that the girl doesn\u2019t regularly attend classes, is more than an hour late to the classes she does attend, and has even shown up late to a class and stayed only 10 minutes before leaving. Mind you this is grad school and this type of behavior is not only unacceptable, but not exhibited by anyone else in the cohort. So we had two weeks to do the project and after one week she hasn\u2019t reached out to me at all so I took initiative and started getting everything set up for the both of us. She agrees to meet with me and I clearly lay out the work that she has to do, taking more than my fair share of work. She is super grateful for all the work I\u2019ve already done and we set an internal deadline to get everything done. She agrees to that deadline on three separate occasions but come that day, she hasn\u2019t done any work and tells me to calm down and stop texting her because it isn\u2019t due yet. The presentation deadline comes up first and the night before she hasn\u2019t done a single ounce of work so we clearly couldn\u2019t meet beforehand to simply run through the presentation. She makes her slides the morning of the presentation and they are not quality work. We do the presentation and she has no clue what\u2019s going on, reads off her slides without any commentary, and messes up her words a ton. This causes me to not be able to present some of my slides that were at the end of the presentation and really just threw off the whole presentation. We have the report due in a few days and I don\u2019t think that she will get any work done until the day it is due and it will clearly be subpar work as this isn\u2019t a project you can do in one day. I also will not have time to peer review her work and edit it and she won\u2019t even bother to look at the parts that I\u2019ve done I assume. I\u2019m going to talk to the professor and see if she will either grade our parts individually or let me finish the report on my own because I don\u2019t want my grade to suffer due to her lack of effort, timeliness, and commitment. Is it fair for me to do this or do you think the professor will even care? \n\nTLDR; Partner projects suck when you are assigned someone who won\u2019t do their work until the very last minute and clearly doesn\u2019t care what they submit. Hopefully the professor understands and allows me to be graded individually.",
