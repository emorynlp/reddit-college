  "text": "Hello r/college !!!! This is a throw away account of mine but thanks for all your help and stories over the past couple years! Im currently in a business class and need to gather market data for a clothing business idea I have to develop. This business is primarily aimed at anime fans and other nerdy type people, but any responses help! This data is just going to help me do the market data and finance portion of my project! It just asks for some basic demographic information, history with anime and anime clothing, and what you might want out of a company like this. Also it is completely confidential! Any and all responses would be super appreciated! I don't have a specific goal for responses but I'm hoping to get at least 50 more so I have some solid numbers. Thank you so much!!!\n\nLink to my survey:\n\n[https://forms.gle/85R8d5LFxqaH3Lbg7](https://forms.gle/85R8d5LFxqaH3Lbg7)",
