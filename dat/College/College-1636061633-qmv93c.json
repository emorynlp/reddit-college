      "text": "College is only the easy part of you aren\u2019t working at all and taking only a moderately difficult degree and have no major (bad) life events happening during those years. \n\nLife will have ups and downs. Some of my twenties were easy, some difficult. My thirties were pretty damn terrible and hard overall (juggling career issues plus a family/kid, a house flood, medical issues, etc.) I\u2019ll be honest though, my forties have been great so far! Everything is settling down and I finally have money for things I want to do. But the rest of it was more rollercoastery.\n\nBut no it won\u2019t be all bad or all worse than right now.",
