  "text": "I keep a folder for each class I take, and download all the readings, lectures, and powerpoints that the professor makes available to us. I am not just paying to learn, but I am paying for the material as well and so I like to download everything that is offered to us through canvas in case I ever want to look back at what I learned or want to look something up. But also, I pay to be exposed to new material and view it as my property too. Just like if a prof hands out paper readings or worksheets that are yours to keep, online material is yours as well so you might as well save everything allocated over the semester of learning. Happy studying!",

Or that they will never need their syllabus to prove the content of a class. But if they don't save those documents then they won't have the option to delete them 5 years after graduation.\n\nPeople should download all notes and keep electronic copies of original syllabi so they at least have the *choice* later on.\n\nIf they're worthless and you saved them, you can delete them.\n\nIf they're necessary and you didn't save them, you're stuck up shit creek without a paddle.",
