  "text": "Hello reddit i\u2019m in a bit of a tough situation. This is an anonymous account. \n\nbackground: I was writing a paper for a class when a student who had taken the class two years prior sent me a similar essay so that I could use it as a resource (obviously collaboration i\u2019m well aware of the ignorance). So I used his paper as a reference to my own paper (both papers are completely different and there is no plagiarism). \n\nSo I go to submit my paper on blackboard and genius me submits the former students, of course within seconds I submit my original work. The damages is done, I send an email to my professor right after admitting to using a former students paper as a resource, I maintained it was an accidental submission. \n\nSo I had talked to the professor about my options, and I wanted to have the academic board take a look at the case. The professor tells me he wants to submit it as contract cheating. Again, that was not the intent at all. \n\nI\u2019m just looking for advice, I know I messed up severely in this instance, but I did not obtain the paper for contract cheating as there are two separate, completely different papers. I\u2019m extremely regretful in my decision and I wish it never happened in the first place. I\u2019m not looking for excuses, I\u2019m simply here for advice on what to do. \n\nThe Questions: Should I proceed with using the board even if he tries to submit it for a contract cheating case? Is there enough evidence to prove this against me?\n\nI know there will be several people who will call me stupid and a moron, and I can\u2019t deny these facts. What I did was just downright stupid. Guys, please just don\u2019t cheat, my intent wasn\u2019t to submit his paper as my own, I merely just wanted to see a similar essay as a resource. It doesn\u2019t make it any better because I still cheated. Just don\u2019t cheat, this is my first offense and I already hate myself for my actions. Cheating is stupid, don\u2019t do what I did, I will be facing punishment and it\u2019s just not worth it. Bottom line, I cheated I accepted responsibility for my actions, I did not try to make excuses for my actions, I admitted it right away to the professor.",

      "text": "Clarification: how exactly did the previous paper serve as a resource if it was on a completely different topic?  I'm having a hard time understanding how someone else's paper could have helped you write your own paper on a different subject.\n\nIf you hope to win a case against you for academic misconduct or plagiarism or whatever, then you're going to need to tell the board in depth what you used the other paper for and explain how that doesn't constitute plagiarism or cheating.",

          "text": "clarification: The papers are for a philosophy class. The arguments are somewhat similar however the topics are still different. They share similarities in the argument, but I wrote my own paper. IE the structure of the argument is merely the syllogism of the argument. It was used to structure the schema.\n\nI can\u2019t go into the specifics but his topic is different however the arguments are very similar. Like I said though I wrote my own paper and only then read his as a comparative for formatting the argument. \n\nIn my opinion this falls under unauthorized collaboration without plagiarism. I am not lying when I say that the papers are completely different and share no similarities besides the fact that the topics and argument are similar. This isn\u2019t due to copying it\u2019s just that he creates similar arguments for his classes. Hope this helps.\n\nThe issue is the professor thinks there\u2019s an argument to be made about contract cheating.",
