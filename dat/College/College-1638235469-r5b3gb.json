  "text": "i don\u2019t like my current school, and am looking around for where to go. i\u2019m in between 3 or 4 colleges. some being in completely different areas that i\u2019m in rn. i\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the right move. one of the colleges is bc i have a friend that goes there and we still talk even after we\u2019ve graduated HS and well before i told her i wanted to transfer. it\u2019s nice having someone i know go to my school but i also don\u2019t know if i only want to go there just bc she\u2019s there. how do y\u2019all choose where you want to go? i don\u2019t want to transfer to a million places lol. i know the school i\u2019m at doesn\u2019t feel right at all for me so i understand that feeling. is there anything more i should look into and consider when it comes to transferring other than money?",

      "text": "You kinda have to assess why you are transferring in the first place and be more specific. Do you want to move farther out from home or do you want to be closer to home? Are you not feeling academically challenged or do you want to go to one that\u2019s not as rigorous? Not having the major you want or looking to one that has a better program? Or is it the environment itself? Is there no school spirit? Do you want more sorority/fraternity culture or not much at all? Is the big state school not what you\u2019re looking for or do you want to go to a big school from a small college? \n\nOnce you think about these questions, then take a visit to each of the schools. I\u2019m just now doing this as a sophomore in college and it\u2019s really helped me in having a feel for the school I want to apply to. Since I want to go to a school that is more rigorous and has more school spirit, I have a top choice and have another one I\u2019d like to go just in case I don\u2019t get into the first one. continue doing your research into these colleges since you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re looking for now and you\u2019ll find the right one soon",
