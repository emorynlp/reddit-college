  "text": "I'd like to state that no one has gotten in trouble, or reported, and for all intents and purposes, I'd like to know your experiences.\n\nMy friend is not the most talented at writing, and we both know it. Since we've been friends I've been reading over her essays and papers and giving her advice on where to make it more coherent or clear for her reading.  For example, something teachers and professors have done going over my writing, is to ask questions, ask for clarifications, or give an opinion on a section that doesn't make sense. I do the same by highlighting sections and asking for questions, or summarizing what I got out of it as a reader, so she knows what message her writing is sending. I make it a point to always have \"commenting\" mode on so that none of my suggestions are made in the document, and are just comments. I will occasionally change grammar/spelling mistakes but those will also be in comment mode so she has to go through and make/approve those corrections. Through these comments, I will also never give suggestions on how to write things word for word, as our writing styles are very distinct, and I imagine any professor actually reading these papers would be able to see where passages or sections sound very different.\n\nShe did not get into trouble for it, be reported, or face any negative repercussions for this, but when  I first started going over her papers, she once forgot to resolve all of the comments I made before turning it in. The professor made a comment that he could see someone went over her paper with her, but there was nothing that looked like plagiarizing or a case of someone writing it for her, so she got a good grade (better than what she anticipated).\n\nTLDR: Professor pointed out that someone looked over my friend's paper, but it was clear that I looked it over for her. Should I encourage her to be a little more careful about her submissions, or does it not really matter?",

      "text": "Well, you should encourage her to proof read her work.\n\nI have students go to the writing center and then hand in docs that have mark ups and track changes still there and it looks super unprofessional and half assed.  \n\n\nThere really is no telling what someone will think is ok based on the specific requirements (an exam in a writing class may have more strict regulations about \u201chelp\u201d than a paper in science class)\n\nBut really it sounds like you do this the right way and you might want to look into working in the writing or tutoring center. It is an excellent way to get LOR and stand out from the crowd.  In addition to being a real help to other students who need it.",
