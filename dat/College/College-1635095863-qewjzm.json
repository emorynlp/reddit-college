  "text": "Hey guys, I don't know if anyone is interested but I started a podcast talking about the mental health surrounding young adults, personally being a college student, I wanted to talk about all the burnouts and stress we endure on the daily basis. I speak about depression, anxiety, loneliness, mental exhaustion and positive affirmations. it's helped a lot of people on my campus and I was hoping to spread the message here, here's a link if you will like to check it out: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN5SpmvW8aXeZNdC93mZKgg",
