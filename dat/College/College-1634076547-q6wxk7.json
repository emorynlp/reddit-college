  "text": "We had a surprise activity in class today. I was really upset about it. I started freaking out. And typing in blackboard without thinking. I said I hated the teacher. He's the head of our department. I go to a small community college. I mean. I'm probably fucked right. I know they can monitor all private chats. I just was so blind sided with rage. I wasn't thinking.",

          "text": "I've researched and all I could find is that group breakouts are not recorded but the prof has the ability to monitor chats if they check a box. I think I am going to let myself calm down. Sleep on it and then make a rational decision tomorrow. Like you said he may not have seen it. I have thought about apologizing but I'm not going to do it while I am heightened like this. I mean. At the end of the day I said I hate him. It doesn't break school policy or anything but damn was it fucking stupid.",

If you notice a change in his demeanor towards you, or he grades you harsher than usual, you can talk to him. Otherwise there is a good chance he didn\u2019t see it",

It is nice that you at least feel bad about it. I suggest you do not bring it up unless they do. Next time in class, start a chat where you say you're feeling much better and can't believe how out of it you were the other day. That way the if your prof does read the chats they at least know you weren't yourself that day, and if they don't read them no problem.",
