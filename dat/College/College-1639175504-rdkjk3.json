  "title:": "quick question about trying to go back to college after dropping out 2 years ago",
  "text": "long story short, I dropped out of a SUNY 2 years ago back in january of 2020. I want to go back to college(CUNY) now hopefully for the fall 2020 semester. Would I qualify as a transfer student or do I have to start fresh as a new student? Quick background, I first started college in a CC for 2 semesters where I had 3.7 gpa. Then transfered to a SUNY for 2 semesters where I had terrible gpa(1.9).\n\n I really hope I don't have to go through the processes of a new student, like I might even have to retake the SATs",
