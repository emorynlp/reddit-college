  "text": "Posting here because I couldn\u2019t find a conclusive answer elsewhere in this sub.\n\nHere in the next month or so, I plan on utilizing my companies tuition reimbursement program to pursue an online degree in either business administration or cyber security. I previously attended college around 11 years ago, and accrued approximately $15,000 in Federal student loan debt. Those payments are set to begin again 10FEB2022. Assuming that the program I am to be enrolled in is accredited, and I attend school full time, will I be exempt from these payments until completion of program?\n\nAny literature related to this topic, under new / revised guidelines, would be greatly appreciated (if said information is available \u2014 I couldn\u2019t find much).",
