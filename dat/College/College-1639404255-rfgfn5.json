              "text": "What scholarships are you talking about? Several State schools I'm familiar with have a threshold of 3.0 or maybe 3.25. and as far as future job opportunities a 3.0 is really the most important thing with maybe a 3.4 being required by the most exclusive companies. I think you're doing great, you'll get better, and you'll be taking classes in your major which hopefully you'll enjoy more.",
