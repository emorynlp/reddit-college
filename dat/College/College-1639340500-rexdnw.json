Unlike you I don't know what grades I'll, this is my first full semester so I lack experience. But I feel I may be heading towards failure in one or several of my courses.\n\nSo at this point I have two options. Either I lose all motivation, or I double down and try to put every ounce of effort that I can into succeeding. It's pretty clear which option is the better one, I hope I'll succeed in following through.",

If you can pass this semester, the best advice I ever received was improving your time management. I'm still terrible at time management but if you put in effort towards it, you'll at least pass.\n\nOther tips:\n\n- really want to learn the stuff you're being taught\n\n- if you dont understand something, utilize google and youtube to give you a better understanding. It's amazing how much it can help having someone else explain it\n\n- dont miss lectures, and if you must, then make up for it with extra study time",

Although this is actually a common age for starting college in my country, but on the other hand it seems I've forgotten how to study. And college is so much harder than high school, I don't feel prepared at all.\n\nAny tips for time management? Other than spending less time on reddit haha... Exam season is coming up next month and I know I need to start preparing NOW if I want to succeed.\n\nAs for your other tips:\n\n>* really want to learn the stuff you're being taught\n\nMy degree is computer science and it is a topic I'm very much interested in (because I love computers and programming). But on the other hand it also requires a lot of mathematics which is what I'm really struggling with. I will probably have to *somehow* find a way to actually be interested in math though, because it's about a third of the degree.\n\n>* if you dont understand something, utilize google and youtube to give you a better understanding. It's amazing how much it can help having someone else explain it\n\nDefinitely agree on this. But if possible, talking to classmates can be even better.\n\n>* dont miss lectures, and if you must, then make up for it with extra study time\n\nI'm still not sure if lectures are really an effective use of my time. I try to go, but often times I just find myself hovering in class for 3 hours and I realize I haven't understood a thing. Then I go home and look at the lecture notes (that other, helpful people usually share), or the relevant book, and find that it is much clearer to me.",
