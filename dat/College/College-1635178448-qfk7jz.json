  "text": "Hey Guys my name is Sean and i am a freshman in high school. Recently we had an assembly and they told me about a site called raise me where you can earn micro-scholarships from your grades,, classes you take, extracurricular activities you do and many other amazing ways. Right now i haven't been keeping up well and still i have made $5k to Barry University. I am in pre ib so i get a slightly more amount of money but that doesnt mean that with regular classes and stellar grades you cant do the same thing, anyone could get there college paid for. The most at my school right now is 1 million dollars and hopefully by my senior year i can get that much. So if you are interested i have an referral link that will give us both $100 in micro scholarships, don't miss you.",
