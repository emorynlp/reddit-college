  "text": "I took a 3 credit intro to theater class last semester (needed for general education) and every time I think about how I spend $750 per credit annoys me. The class was Tuesday / Thursday but every week without fail the professor would cancel class one of those two days. The other day that wasn't canceled was spend reading a play or watching the film adaptation of that play. It was interesting analyzing 6 plays but I could have done that at home for essentially free.",
