  "text": "So abut a month ago I broke my clavicle by falling off my electric longboard going 40 km/h, and had to get surgery for it. I was constantly in pain for about 3 weeks after the surgery, had to keep my left arm in a sling, and was on medication that made me feel dizzy. Because of this, I missed 3 weeks worth of material and I have a midterm coming up in 3 days. I already submitted an academic accommodation request to the university and although it did get approved, it was only valid for use until October 12, since that was the day I got off my medication and was able to work again (arm still in a sling tho). I have a real analysis midterm worth 30% on October 27 (days from now) and I know I have to write it since it's past the 12th but I am 3 weeks behind since it requires a lot of practice to understand and I know I'm going to fail this midterm. So I decide to find someone off kijiji to write it for me since it's not proctored. Soon enough I find someone, and right off the bat, his messages sound rude (he's foreign, maybe he's just really bad at english? So I let it slide). Then it got to the point where I couldn't understand his english at all, and for that reason, he gets even more angry. At this point I've had enough so I cuss him out for it and he gets so triggered to the point where he emails the math department of my school that I asked him to write a midterm which he says could easily lead to an expulsion. He screenshoted our entire conversation and used it as evidence. Now my question is: am I fucked? Will I be expelled for this? The midterm date is yet to arrive but can I still be expelled for \"planning to commit an academic offence?\". This fucking sucks, if only I hadn't broken my collarbone I wouldn't be in this situation. Fml.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: the reason I'm 3 weeks behind is because I was told by both my physician and surgeon to rest for a month and take my medication (which had side effects of dizziness so it was impossible for me to study during that time).",

Assuming this is a first time offense, it\u2019s appropriate go with the minimum. \n\nBut all of that background info about you missing class for three weeks?  That reads to me as a student not focusing on (not owning up to) what they did wrong. My opinion: if you still have the opportunity to do so, do NOT include that information. Whether or not you meant it this way, it comes across as transparently manipulative.\n\nIf you get to discuss this with your professor, simply admit that you broke the rules and you are sorry for doing that.  You can indicate that there were personal reasons that factored into your poor choices, and that you are happy to provide more detail should anyone want it.  Keep your discussion focused on what you did wrong, the fact that you will not repeat this mistake, and that you appreciate their time in this matter. \n\nI realize this isn\u2019t the point of your post, but I\u2019m compelled to ask: you do realize that cheating on your real analysis test was not just against the rules but a dumb idea, right?  It would have been FAR better for you to have reached out to your professor and let them know that you were behind (perhaps even let them know why) and mention that you\u2019d try your best on the exam if other accommodations, like an extension, weren\u2019t available. You should even ask to meet to see if they have any suggestions about getting caught up. These conversations with students are infinitely preferable to the \u201cwell I cheated because\u2026\u201d ones. \n\nThere are at least three reasons choosing to cheat was stupid: 1) it wouldn\u2019t help you learn or get ahead, so you\u2019d still be fucked for the next tests.  2) It is always obvious when people cheat like this. Seriously: always.  You might get lucky and catch your professor in a tired mood where they overlook it, but trust me: it is crazy obvious. When I notice my own students doing this it tells me they understand the material less so than someone who leaves their test entirely blank. 3) you\u2019ve now likely annoyed or at least annoyingly inconvenienced this professor, and you still need their help for the rest of the class \n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound overly negative.  You are not the first to cheat, you won\u2019t be the last. It is still possible to recover your working relationship with this professor, but the cost will likely be an F on the test or perhaps for the course.  Those outcomes suck, but you can overcome both. \n\nI hope you\u2019re feeling better / fully recovered now.",

Since the midterm was coming up in 3 days, I didn't want to roll the dice on whether he will respond later or not respond at all and I lose 30% of my grade, so I resorted to plan b, which was obviously dumb, but I was angry at the fact that I was put in this situation and all I wanted to do was pass (which I know I would've had I not gotten injured, because I was preparing for this class during the summer and was actually really excited to study it. I'm a math major and somewhat decent at math). Also, the reason I was behind 3 weeks was because during that time I was ordered by my surgeon that I needed to rest for most of the day plus I was on medication that had dizziness as its side effect, so it was impossible for me to focus on any task. I used those 3 weeks for recovery. I do regret my actions tho.",
