  "title:": "My final that was scheduled today never happened and I don't know what to do.",
  "text": "I've been studying for this final hardcore for the past 3 and 1/2 days and probably only got 5 hours of sleep. This final was scheduled at 8 a.m. which is about an hour and a half earlier than our usual time that we take quizzes. This class is virtual by the way.\n\n8 a.m. comes and no final. After 10 minutes I email my professor and get no response. 35 minutes later I email them again and get no response.\n\nIt's now been an hour and a half since the scheduled time on the schedule day and I don't know what to do.\nI tried looking for the teaching assistant but he doesn't have an email listed to contact him. \n\nWas just wondering if anyone else had this happen to them and what they did because I really really need to take this final.\n\nUpdate: it was because of technical issues and he sent out an email saying he was sincerely sorry and that the exam will be open all day but the 2-hour test time is still there. I took the test and got a 76 on it which I was extremely happy about. He sent a message to me saying he was sincerely sorry for the inconvenience and stress he caused everybody and he will be adding bonus points on top of that.",

              "text": "Yea, in all likelihood there is some sort of emergency. As I'm sure you've already done, make sure you got the date and time for the exam correct. Otherwise, send an email to the relevant office and try not to stress too much about it -- not posting a scheduled exam is an extenuating circumstance which should not reflect on the students grades.\n\nGood luck, and I'd love an update for what ended up happening to satiate my curiosity :)",

                  "text": "I had a professor once who didn't open a dropbox for an assignment on Blackboard by the time it was due. It was an online class so all of us students just posted on the message boards and chatted with each other about the situation. We all emailed the professor about there not being a dropbox and then, the next day, several of us called the department office and got no info. Days go by, still no communication from our professor and no dropbox. Then, a week goes by and suddenly the professor pops up out of the blue and just says \"Sorry, I was busy with work and forgot to open the dropbox.\" WTF, is this not your job?! She was a lousy excuse for a professor, tbh. I did not leave her a very good review. How do you forget to open the dropbox and then not check your work email for over a WEEK?  \n\n\nHad I been that professor, I would have been very apologetic and probably would have just cancelled that assignment, honestly.",
