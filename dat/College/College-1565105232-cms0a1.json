      "text": "I would say get into the groove of using effective study technqiues. I was a med student at Cambridge when I came across this [Dunlosky 2013 review paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173288) about **effective study techniques** \\+ **active recall**, and honestly, it completely changed the way I study.\n\n(TL;DR: actively recalling facts with closed book spider diagrams/practice tests/self-explanation >>>> re-reading, highlighting, summarizing).\n\nI legit used to spend *hours* re-reading content and making open-book mindmaps (which worked in high school when the workload was much less). My efficiency hugely increased when I started actively trying to make connections, making closed book spider diagrams, etc etc. and it helped me be much more work-life balanced tbh.\n\nYou need to make use of **evidence-based study** techniques. The Dunlosky paper ranks 10 commonly used learning strategies from the least to the most effective ones according to cognitive sciences (i've listed the top 5 below).\n\n* To get the most out of your studying you need to use the most effective techniques when you're studying or making your resources/use education tools that are built using these principles.\n* Platforms I found useful included [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) basically, like Quizlet but interleaves practice using spaced repetition (super handy for learning long lists of drugs for pharma).\n* For **high school**, a platform like [Seneca](https://app.senecalearning.com/courses/add?type=Free&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=usa&utm_content=reddit-dunlosky) might be useful as it uses spacing/interleaving in its algorithms to retest you on topics you have struggled with previously.\n\nDunlosky's five most effective strategies (in increasing order) are:\n\n**5) Self-explanation**\n\n* Connect new content to stuff you already know. (e.g. how does what you learn about enzymes in biology relate to reaction rates in chemistry?)\n* Relating novel content to prior knowledge creates new connections and facilitates the development of schemes.\n\n**4) Elaborative interrogation**\n\n* This strategy involves asking and answering 'why' and 'how' questions. (e.g. why are enzymes similar to chemical catalysts? How do they both increase the rates of reactions?)\n* This requires thinking about a subject in more depth and detail, which strengthens connections in the brain.\n\n**3) Interleaved practice**\n\n* Interleaved practice means mixing up the order of questions across different topics. This is particularly effective for Maths and Sciences.\n* Usually, students learn strategy A, solve a series of problems that demand strategy A, then do the same with strategy B.\n* Interleaving would be to learn strategies A and B, and solve problems that can demand one or the other.\n* This way, pupils need to find out the right strategy from the problem itself, leading to a deeper understanding and better preparation for exams.\n* Basically, let's say you're going over triangles. in math. Rather than studying Pythagoras' theorem and then doing Pythagoras' theorem questions and then studying trigonometry and then doing trig questions, you should study both Pythagoras' theorem and trigonometry and then do a mixture of triangle questions based on both.\n\n**2) Distributed practice**\n\n* Distributed practice is basically like the opposite of cramming.\n* Research consistently shows that studying small chunks of content spread out over time is more effective than studying long blocks of the same topic only once. (tbh i still cram a bit for exams, but starting earlier>>later).\n* Try and make a study schedule as early as poss in the year and stick to it. Regularly review content.\n* Also working in small chunks is generally more effective than studying for hours at a time (a good technique is the Pomodoro technique, where you work for like 50 mins, rest for 10 mins, then repeat!).\n\n**1) Practice testing**\n\n* The most effective strategy according to Dunlosky is practice testing. It consists of studying and reviewing by answering questions and actively bringing information back to mind. We love active recall!!\n* When this is done, information is reconsolidated, new connections are created, and memory and understanding are strengthened.\n* Basically start doing practice questions as early as possible. Like if you cover photosynthesis in AP bio, go on the college board's website and find all the free-response questions you can on photosynthesis do them and mark them yourself.\n\nI hope this helps!! :-) If you can set up these study habits now, honestly the rest of your education (and working life) will be so much easier and efficient. I will say using active recall techniques etc feels scarier at first (at least it did for me) as I was worried I was forgetting something/felt dumb when I couldn't remember something etc - but once you get into the swing of things, knowledge picks up quicker and sticks around for longer. Good luck!!",

I didn\u2019t want to try and out effort into studying and assignments because what would happen if I did try and ended up failing? Well that would make me a failure wouldn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t think like that. Remember that making mistakes is how you learn and you have the potential to do amazing things if you just apply yourself. And that means putting your phone down and studying like you mean it, and going in with a positive mindset.",

If you have issues doing that, set a reward for yourself - go buy yourself a coffee before class or something. Just getting up and out of your dorm room at a reasonable time will really go a long way. It's easy to get sucked into wasting your mornings if you don't have class until noon.\n\nAlso, your college's gym will likely have a bunch of exercise classes (and the gym itself) that you've already paid for in your tuition.

Next, make sure that college will help you achieve what you want to achieve in life because it is a waste of time if you just go to earn a degree just for the sake of earning one. Consider your options carefully. If you can, consider community college since you'll get the same piece of paper for a lower price as a result of clearing prerequisites at community college. As for in college, get involved. Get involved. Get involved. Unless your goal requires grad school or professional school beyond undergrad, grades really don't matter as much as you think.",

Even if you miss that deadline, it's $8.99 per month for unlimited access to books, audiobooks, essays, etc. I'd check to see if they have my textbook here before buying. Alternatively, Google the textbook's name and try typing PDF at the end. I've gotten lucky like this.\n2. Check Dreamspark for discounted software for students. If your college participates, you can get access to discounted Microsoft software, Adobe, VMware, etc.\n3. Make a friend in class to help you stay caught up when you are out. My classmate and I exchanged contact info, and also used our phones to record the lecture for each other. \n4. Study. **Please Study**. Doing the work/homework will help you pass the exams. I've had to proctor exams and trust me, it takes way too much energy to cheat and not get caught. The dead give away is when the student looks in your direction to see if you're watching them. Most of the time I'm not looking until the student glances over at me, bringing the cheating to my attention. \n5. When pulling an all-nighter, I've found it easier to retain information if I have a nap in between study sessions. That's if you can get up after that alarm goes off.",

You're getting a restart on your social life essentially, so you have the opportunity to rebuild yourself as how you want. The social skills you gain and improve now could give you an edge later on in life.\n\n\n\n\nIf you weren't the social type in high school, college gives you plenty of chances to be social, so tale advantage of that. Go out, party, play around, enjoy yourself, but always, ALWAYS, within moderation. Keep your self control and don't forget you're going to college for your degree, not to party. Keeping that in mind, do try to enjoy yourself, you gain nothing by being stressed all the time with no chance to blow off steam.\n\n\n\n\nHit the gym once every while to avoid the Freshmen 15 lol",

      "text": "Hey. 1 month ago I graduated from my master degree. It took me 6 years (normal would be 5, but thesis got carried away). I lived on my own during those 6 years, 350km away from my hometown.\n\nWhen it comes to studying and classes, listen to me, because I skipped most classes and would only study 1-2 days before exams, and it got hard and stressful when it shouldn't.\n\n* Start by studying alone, then proceed to join a group of friends. By studying alone you will ATLEAST understand what you DON'T know. Then, you can ask your friends. They will probably know some things you don't, and vice-versa;\n* Idk how it works in the US, but in the EU, the final grade is usually decided by calculating the mean between the grades of 2 exams within a subject (say you have a 10 and a 9, final grade would be 9.5). So try to get better grades in the first exams, when the semester is fairly fresh, because things are gonna pile up towars the end of the semester;\n* Understand the meaning of MVP (Minimum Valuable Product), this works both for group projects and studying for exams. If there's not enough time left, focus on what's more important;\n* Do NOT skip classes like crazy. Sure you're gonna do it, if you're tired, or if you have to catch up on other subject. But teachers often tend to tell students (besides teaching what they're supposed to) what might appear in the exam;\n* There's time for everything. I know people that graduated from the \"hardest\" universities and had a decent social life, played sports and had good grades. I also know people that graduated from universities \"not so good\", and had a stressful \"Don't have time for anything besides studying\" life. There's no need for that. Just learn that there's a time and a place for everything;\n* It is NOT the end of the world if you fail a subject. In my 2nd year, I failed most of them because I started playing Counter-Strike 24/7. I managed to catch up in the following 2 semesters. But then again, there's no need for such stress.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I'm sure I forgot to mention some things.",

I work on homework/study every day of the week, except Saturday. \n- Get a solid group of people with a similar major, and study with them. Avoid people who just want to be social; they\u2019ll only want to talk and it\u2019ll be disruptive to those who are trying to grind. This will give you an opportunity to teach and explain the material to others, which is probably the most effective way to really pound those topics in your head. Do some studying beforehand so you can go into it actually knowing what you\u2019re talking about; this is a good source of motivation to actually study, and it\u2019ll keep you honest. \n- Ask your professors questions. Even if you understand the material, make it a point to visit your professors during office hours at least a few times leading up to a test. Don\u2019t wait until the day before the test to bombard them with material that was covered weeks ago. If you don\u2019t understand something, try to go by their office soon. This will also establish a relationship with the professor, who will then see that you\u2019re working hard, and will then be more likely to help you out later on. \n- Don\u2019t be one of the people who whine about taking classes and learning things, saying things like \u201cI\u2019m about to have a mental breakdown because of the stress about this psychology final.\u201d There are many people who would love to be in your shoes and have the opportunity to go to college, so don\u2019t take it for granted.

If I can do it without whining, anyone can. There\u2019s simply no excuse.\n- Don\u2019t be one of the people who talks about never needing the things you\u2019re learning. Job training occurs when you accept a job offer; you\u2019re in college, so do what you need to do to get done with college.\n- There\u2019s no excuse for not knowing/understanding something due to a lack of effort.

They\u2019ll help you. \n\nASK FOR HELP. Don\u2019t be shy. \n\nDo NOT buy your textbooks. Rent them from amazon, chegg, even the bookstore. Go digital if you can. Even cheaper. \n\nWhen writing a peer review paper, do NOT buy any articles. Go to the school library, they have ways to get them for free. \n\nDo not cheat.

They can help with notes you missed, double check if professors instructions weren't clear for an assignment, etc...\n\nSit in the front of class and participate as much as possible. As much as professors deny it, a familiar face to a name on a paper is harder to fail than a stranger's name alone.\n\nFor incoming freshman: make lock screen your class schedule and home screen the school map.\n\n\nMost importantly: GOOGLE CALENDAR\nset reminders for everything\nEven reminders for reminders",

I\u2019ve hosted a few with some friends with everyone bringing snacks from the dining halls, it\u2019s honestly as good as a personal theatre.  \n2. If you have a fun research project idea, you can probably get funding from your department. Wish I\u2019d known before I bought my own micropipetters. \n3. Aluminum foil can be molded into almost anything you need. I\u2019ve used foil to fix my bike pump, as a cake tin, as tins for souffl\u00e9s, as cutlery and china, etc. Weird Al Yankovic has the right idea.  \n4. You can at any point walk up to anybody, start up a conversation and make a friend. Go make friends and maintain those relationships! I emailed my botany professor a picture of a magnolia flower I found since I\u2019d never gotten the chance to see one in person before and her class made finally seeing one that much more of an exciting and appreciable experience.",

That way as you get closer you won\u2019t have to cram and the night before/day of you can just do a quick review session. \n\nMake at least one friend in every class. That way you have someone to share notes with or do homework together. Studying with a partner always helped me personally. \n\nIf you have roommates, set clear boundaries early. Communicate! Being passive aggressive behavior is annoying so if you have a problem be direct and polite and if it gets out of hand talk to your landlord for help. \n\nHave fun. Join a club or sport. Do some campus activities. Hang out with friends. Go to sports games. Go to a party. You don\u2019t have to do everything, but try to do a fun activity every once in a while to clear your head. \n\nTry your best to maintain a proper sleep schedule. Go to the gym or take a class that will help keep you physically active. Yoga did wonders for me. Helped my body and my mind. Try to eat healthy. Eating out is fun and cheap but learn to cook a few healthy meals. Take care of yourself. \n\nTake a water bottle with you everywhere. \n\nMy favorite way to take notes was to print out power point slides (if the professor made them available) and take notes on those. \n\nReview your notes constantly. \n\nTry to put your phone away in class. That way you can stay as focused as possible. \n\nAsk your professor for help if you need it. Go to office hours. If you make an effort that they can see, they\u2019ll be a lot more forgiving.",

I would always shoot for 10-15 minutes before class started. You get choice of seat, an opportunity to talk with the professor or other students if they are also there early and it's a great time to knock out a few homework questions too. This is especially helpful for your first class during the day. If you get in a habit of bring early on the days you may be running late you have that 10-15 minute buffer. \n\nAlways have a fork and spoon with you. I can't tell you how many times I forgot to grab one before I started carrying one in my bag. I would get all the way to the library and realized I forgot to grab a fork or it dropped on the way. \n\nGet a plant. Nothing big just a little one that can sit on your desk. College is stressful, you're going to have ups and downs and having something easy to take care of will bring some color and a little stress relief to your life.\n\nTALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS! Even if you're doing well in their class. They're there to help. Getting to know your professors can help you with research or job opportunities, be a letter of recommendation down the road. They're also more likely to give you that one point you may need if they know you personality and see that you made an effort.\n\nMake friends with the students who work in the food service places on campus. I did for 2 years and was more likely to give my regulars food that we were going to throw out later that day or a medium coffee when they ordered a small.\n\nYour grades in your major are more important than the grades you get in your gen eds. If you think you're going to fail a class drop it (Just stay above 12 credits to be full time) \n\nEnjoy college, it goes by fast!

      "text": "* Go to your lectures, even if you don't have notes or read the readings. However, knowing the increasingly busy schedule most students have, working part time or even full time jobs or extracurricular activities, make a habit of watching lecture captures (aka video recordings of lecture(s) ). If you're someone who prefers lecture captures, that's fine but make sure to recap with notes (hopefully completing the readings). Just don't forget.\n\n* Know how to actually take notes; in order for you to understand the course content better. Question the lecture materials; try to explain what is being said by both the lecture materials and the lecture itself in a way you can understand it.\n\n* 1st week of college semester; every subject, note down the dates of your assessment due dates & *times*... (the latter a lot of people I see forget, what might be a 11:59pm submission close time in reality is a 10:00pm submission before the upload crush, which might fail due to large amounts of students submitting at the same time).\n\n* For assessment research... my approach has been to do 2/3rds first (and compile a list of sources; maybe with a little abstract to explain what each source is about / saying) and then start writing, and then finish it with the last 3rd of research to consolidate your argument. YMMV.\n\n* **read the assessment criteria**. Again, and again, and again. You don't want to end up failing because you missed a small but important point on a 3,500 word essay or report. \n\n* Don't stress yourself. If your stuck on a topic or concept, ask for help. It's fine to ask for help. \n\n* If you can make it a habit, try to get your college work done while on campus so you can maintain a good work-life balance.",

Instead, go to your local target or supermarket and buy a bunch of healthier easy snacks - anything works as long as it doesn\u2019t take too long to prep. \n\nHack 3: Wear your flip flops if you\u2019re in a communal shower. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s got a nasty case of the fungus. \n\nHack 4: I highly recommend opting for a single room. Trust me, you\u2019ll thank me later. Even for social person, being stuck with someone who isn\u2019t a good thing. Especially if you\u2019re an introvert, you NEED your own room. The rooms are small asf. \n\nHack 5: Read. The. Syllabus.

              "text": ">What about the every 1 hour in class you should spend 3 more preparing in advance? \n\nThat depends on what classes you are taking and what your own strengths are. Some people think STEM classes are very hard, and will kill themselves earning a B in intro BIO. Others will take 30 hours to get through the 75 pages in a novel they are assigned for one day of English 125.  Then there's the difference in schools: you could be attending a non-selective, two year school that will admit anyone with a GED and asks very little of its students other than sitting in class a couple of hours a week (not judging, literally describing a local college) or you could be at a highly selective school where everyone in the room was in the top 5% of their high school class, had an ACT of 36, and is fluent in three languages. The expectations will be different-- and most students in the second type of school will be putting in more than a few hours a week outside of class.\n\nAt my liberal arts college people cite that \"three hours\" metric all the time, but it varies widely. I've had students who spend 20 hours a week just studying for a chemistry class and lab, and others who put that much time into their freshman seminar because they read very slowly or struggle with writing.  Our first year students self-report an average of 15 hours/week studying outside of class on anonymous surveys, which sounds about right for someone taking four classes.",

That's not counting low-credit electives like art, music, etc. where you might have a 1-credit class in addition (on my campus most students take four \"regular\" classes for 16 credits total, and then typically 1-2 of the low-credit electives as well for a total of 18).

Being a student is a full time job-- expect to put in 40 hours/week on average between classes, labs, homework, and required activities (even lectures, arts events, etc). Everything else comes second.  Then you basically have eight hours a day to do all your non-school stuff (work, eat, exercise, play, party, gaming, whatever) and eight hours to sleep.",

Normally, pretty much everything is the same in the two editions except chapter numbers might be altered, but everything else, including most math problems, will be the same. This can save you literally hundreds of dollars and can save you the hassle of having to rent books.",

Often times a lot of outlets and websites will have discounts/specials for college students.\n\nHit the ground running your freshman year. This is the time to build study habits, work out, and get a good GPA which will make your college career easier in the future when you have to worry about jobs/internships.  With that in mind, you should also try to find a job on campus which will help you buy things you want (games, alcohol, food). This will help you fill out a resume and get you potential references for the future.\n\nAlso, sit in the first three rows in a lecture hall. You're more likely to pay attention and participate if your prof is actually looking at you. With that go to office hours if you need help. Often times no one actually goes until near exams so you can get help from your TA/Prof this way.",

No, they aren't healthy options either, but my recommendation was really only pertaining to fast acting carbs and not the overall health quality of the food. I would sooner recommend steak and eggs for a test taker than a bagel if we were only talking about which meal would probably lead to better test performance. The steak and eggs don't result in a sugar crash.\n\nAdding in a health perspective too, you should avoid fast acting carbs and get a good amount of healthy fat, slow acting carbs (aka mostly plants with fiber), and fiber. Protein is essential to a healthy diet but you don't absolutely need it in the first half of the day, it's perfectly fine to wait till lunch/dinner if you usually try to make breakfasts very simple. Fruit is good but stay away from juice. If you are in a hurry and can't eat breakfast, buy a pack of tree nuts. They are very energy dense and can be eaten on the go.\n\nExample breakfast: 2-3 eggs, 1 cup greek yogurt with crushed almonds or other nuts, and about a cup of vegetables or whole fruit.",

Sitting down the first week of the semester and writing down your deadlines and when midterms and finals are for every class really helps in giving a perspective of how to manage your time for each semester. My last semester I had 6 midterms in a single week, plus assignments. I was miserable but I was able to plan ahead for it. I went to the professors who had assignments due maybe  a week or two before that hell week and and asked for an extension and they were more than happy to give it to me after I showed them my calendar.\n\nA step up is making a daily schedule with blocks, like in google calendar, for your semester. Write in classes, labs, work, time for the gym, etc. Having a visual reference of what your week looks like helps put in perspective how little time there is to waste.",

There was turning point where, rather than berating myself about being that person, I learned to accept that was who I was. Making peace with that instead of trying (and failing) to fight it really improved both my mental health and my time management, weirdly enough. \n\nI believe everyone should sincerely try what you suggest, but for those students who end up routinely doing their work the night before, that doesn't spell disaster.

This isn't NO Scheduling or procrastination. It is scheduling your tasks right before they're due so that you dont end up having to do two things at the same time or something. \n\nFor example- if you know you'll have to stay up all night to study, dont spend the entire day doing something else, sleep during the day to work at night. That time is for sleeping, not for watching that show you've been wanting watch or playing a game. You also make sure that you dont end up having to submit two assignments at the same day. If that ever happens to be the case, you're screwed if you dont have a schedule.\n\nSo, why would you want to schedule it that way? \nThe pressure. The pressure of having to submit makes you want to work harder and faster. \n\nMind you, this is a discipline that not everyone can benefit from.

The problem is, the science & math majors only tend to do 2-3 major courses a term whereas you have to take 4-5 engineering courses a term to graduate on time, which makes it *all* about how you manage your time. \n\nFrankly I think CS is a lot harder than engineering! I quite like coding, but the time crunch for the enormous projects you guys have to do seems ridiculous.",
