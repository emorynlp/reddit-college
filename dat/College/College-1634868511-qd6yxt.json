  "text": "I'm taking a course that is intro to a new software I've never used before and the class is 100% online. Our first assignment was submitted a month ago, we've done 3 assignments in total so far and I haven't received any marks back. This is my prof's first year teaching. His English is very difficult to understand and the assignment instructions are incredibly unclear and obviously written by someone with poor English. The questions are difficult to decipher exactly what is expected. I'm in a groupchat for the class and absolutely everyone is completely lost. \n\nI'm very worried that I am doing the assignments incorrectly or misunderstanding things but I have no way of knowing that. I'm worried I'll get to the end of the semester and find out I've done poorly in the class because of something I could have corrected if I'd known earlier. It's really difficult to learn a new software when we're building on things I don't even know if I was doing right in the first place. Is there anything I can do? Is it ok to email my prof asking for marks or feedback?",
