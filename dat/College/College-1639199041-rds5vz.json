  "text": "My mental state is a wreck right now and I\u2019m on the verge of failing almost all my classes. I definitely still want to pursue college, but I don\u2019t think I can continue on for a while when I\u2019m constantly stressed and anxious. I consider taking one semester off. \n\nI don\u2019t have a part-time job right now and I get the feeling I might be really bored if I took one semester off. I really want a variety of activities to do to preoccupy me.",

      "text": "You need to focus on yourself and what makes you happy during your semester off. Do whatever improves your mental health. Maybe use your extra time to meal prep healthy food, workout (even if that means just going for a walk around the block a few times per week), enrol in therapy if you can, and make time for hobbies you enjoy. Maybe even start a new hobby like learning ukulele or taking an art class",
