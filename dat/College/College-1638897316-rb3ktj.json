But I wanted to know whether or not it's that bad of a drive and is it really worth it. (Note: This is the closest college so choosing another college is out of the question)",

You could try to do it for a semester and see it\u2019s something you want to do long term. I would also take all your classes in one or two days if possible (i.e Tuesdays and Thursdays).  If If it does not work out, there possibly could be cheaper solutions than dorms such as living off campus with roommates .",

I know he loved it because he stacked his classes and only had them on like Tuesday / Thursday and he\u2019s a big music / podcast guy so I think he enjoyed the alone time to listen to whatever he wanted. Just depends on you! You can always try for a semester like the person said above and if it gets too much, move there next semester!",
