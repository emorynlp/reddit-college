      "text": "- Depends on the teacher, but most if not all teachers won't have any assigned seating so you can sit wherever you want. Most people pick a seat and stay there for the entire quarter or semester though, just to make things less confusing. Also there are some shithead professors who are like \"I'm locking the door after I walk in,\" so you gotta be wary of that.\n\n- In most classes I've been in it's fine to socialize before it starts. If you get there 5 minutes before class and there's nothing to do its perfectly fine to talk to your friend nearby.\n\n- It depends again, if a teacher relies heavily on labs or lectures (in person), then yeah there probably is. If the teacher doesn't rely on that stuff and instead relies on essays or quizzes then you probably dont *need* to show up to every class, but you really should.\n\n- I bring both in case I'm an idiot and forget to charge my laptop the day prior (which is usually the case). A laptop is probably better in general as long as you can type fast enough to keep up with a lecture. Trust me, professors will try to drag out some slides with lots of words on them, but they wont slow down or stop for notes or anything like that.",

      "text": "I was homeschooled as well, although I was homeschooled every year except 6th grade.\n\nFirstly, you sit wherever you want. It's college. You are an adult. You sit where you want to. However, after the first couple classes, people will always sit in the same seat or at least roughly in the same area.\n\nSecondly, socialize if you want to. Arrive a few minutes early, talk to people, and that is how friendships are formed. You never know how interesting (or uninteresting) your classmate is until you talk to them. You do not need to talk to anyone, but college gets boring and lonely really REALLY quickly if you do not. Professors generally like it when students know each other and they see students interacting.\n\nThirdly, yes and no. Usually (unless the class is 50+) for the first class or two professors will take attendance. They need it for college records and financial things. Afterwards, some professors do, some do not.  Large classes never have attendance. Small ones sometimes will.\n\nFourthly, depends on you. I've always been a pencil-and-paper person so I didn't bring my laptop. Other students will. Some professors (usually of small seminar-based classes) will not allow laptops though, often citing the fact that students learn better from taking physical notes as well as the fact that many students who bring laptops do not seriously participate in class. Do what you want do though, remember, you are an adult.\n\nIt does depend a bit on your major though, and most of my experience is in the social sciences or humanities, not STEM.",

      "text": "This is just a hodge-podge of advice.\n\nNever take an 8 AM class unless you need to in order to fit work into your schedule.\n\nScreenshot a map of the school on your phone and before the class day, make sure you know which building and which room your class will be in.\n\nScreenshot your schedule and replace your wallpaper as it for the first week. That way you can easily check the rooms/times without fidgeting with your phone much.\n\nIf you have a disability, talk with the disability center ASAP. It takes a non-zero amount of paperwork and documentation to get an accommodation. Usually accommodations help a lot. You don\u2019t want to put that off and be stuck dealing with it during the semester.\n\nCollege helped when I was more connected to the people around me. On the first week I made it a goal to try to know the names and contact info of at least two people in the classroom OR have a group-me / group chat set up with other people in the class. \n\nSometimes professors check for attendance, sometimes they don\u2019t, it tends to be in lower level courses where they do. \n\nSit wherever you feel comfortable. I noticed I was more engaged and had better scores when I sat in the front but not necessarily in the middle.\n\nThe first part of college is mainly finding out how to set your own schedule, how to study, and how you work. This is why you might not have many classes related to your major. That way if you screw up, it\u2019s okay.\n\n\u2018In college, success comes from three actions: GOING TO CLASS, DOING THE WORK, ASKING FOR HELP\u2019 - I can\u2019t remember where that\u2019s from but that\u2019s the premise of every piece of advice I\u2019ve gotten and it\u2019s the bit that helped me. \n\nIt is okay to fail. If you fail in any aspect, to get back on track, talk with your career advisor which is assigned to your specific major. Do not be afraid to ask for help.",
