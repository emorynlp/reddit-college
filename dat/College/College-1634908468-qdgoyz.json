Most people who take a year off tend to not end up going to school the next year. Is there a tutor lab on your campus you could take advantage of? Is your field math heavy? If not, I definitely wouldn't take the year off.",

      "text": "don't colleges have classes for early math? i remember my community college did, you'd take a test or show your SAT scores and  they'd have you start math at your skill level. if not, there's a lot of courses on sites like coursera that would work through it all for you.\n\ni don't see why you can't work out your gen ed requirements while you catch up on math. if that's your worry, don't let it stop you. there's good reasons to take a year or two to figure stuff out before going to college, but this doesn't seem like one of them.",
