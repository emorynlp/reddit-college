  "text": "Hello all. I recently decided that I want to go back to college after working since high school. I just turned 21 this November.  For more context, I went to college for a year after high school, but then started working because I didn\u2019t like college. Now I feel like I\u2019m probably screwed out of any money assistance because I\u2019m 21 now. I signed up for scholarships.com but that\u2019s it. My most recent SAT score was 1180 (is that good?) Besides FAFSA, what resources should I look at for getting aid for school?",
