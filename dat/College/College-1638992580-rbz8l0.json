  "text": "I'm barely passing my Spanish class at the moment, and it's really stressing me out. I already changed the grading option to S/U, but I'm worried at this point that I may not even get a 60% with the remaining exams. I've never failed a class, so this is stressing me like crazy. I don't know what to do.",
