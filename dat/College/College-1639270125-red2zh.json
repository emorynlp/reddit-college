  "title:": "Sorority girl asked for my notes after finals",
  "text": "Since it was finals season, I was nice enough to send a link to my google docs notes for everyone that missed class due to our professor being very clear that he will not be posting any Power-points or giving out any lecture notes if you were absent and you will have to ask your classmates for any missed notes. But I also turned off printing/copy+pasting my notes just in case someone saves it and sells it as theirs. However we took our finals on Thursday and this girl dm\u2019d me today to find a way to print them. \nI searched her name on Instagram and lo and behold her Instagram bio has her sorority in it. While I don\u2019t mind selling my notes to be saved and printed, I don\u2019t know what to do in this circumstance because I know some greeks saves notes from their classes and gives their notes to their fellow members(?). Giving her the ability to print my notes for free gives me a bad taste in my mouth but I do not know how to price it as.\nIf anyone has also experienced this what did you do and what price would you put it as?",

          "text": "Because it\u2019s a well known that they give their fellow members their notes for people taking that class and professor. If she asked before the final to print them I would just send her the pdf. \nBut I feel iffy because we just took our final on Thursday and there\u2019s not much of a reason why she would ask for the notes to be printed now after the final. It might be just me over thinking it however.",

              "text": "I don\u2019t think you are overthinking. What you are pondering about is completely valid. Because sororities do send their peers the work. But honestly charge her what you feel is fair for your notes. Also if I were her instead of trying to print the notes from you, she could have have just rewritten them herself tbh.",

                  "text": "Yeah, I decided to sell my notes the same price I normally do with exams. If she does give them to the sorority I would never know anyways so I\u2019ll give her the benefit of the doubt despite my original feelings of this situation. I would never use the notes again anyways and ended with a pretty good grade.",
