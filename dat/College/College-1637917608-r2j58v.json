  "text": "Then check out [citethis.net](https://citethis.net). It is NOT owned by Chegg and it doesn't have 40+ ads on the page.I found this on another Reddit post. (You won't really be able to find it on Google easily). It works great too.\n\n(Reddit post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/etvg76/why\\_are\\_nearly\\_all\\_citation\\_makers\\_chegg\\_services/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/etvg76/why_are_nearly_all_citation_makers_chegg_services/))\n\nI searched for something like this because I am sick and tired of going to 4+ citation websites only to find out that they are all the same cookie-cutter Chegg pages.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nSigned,\n\nFrustrated CS student\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys so much for your replies! I didn't know there were so many other cool resources for citing sources -- checking them all out now!\n\nWe should make some sort of megathread with useful citation resources and other useful stuff!",

It's one of those last-resort things for when you're \\*really\\* stuck on something.\n\nBut when it comes to finding a website to cite sources... it just gets very annoying when a majority of them are all owned by Chegg. I am willing to bet that they are all the exact same back-end, with each having a different front-end to make it look like a different service. It's pretty scummy in my humble opinion.\n\nAnd the ads. I understand they gotta make money and all (and that I can use AdBlock if I want), but they just make them all in your face. Ads everywhere.\n\nReasonable complaints, no?",

You can get kicked out of University for using it and Chegg will throw you under the bus (rightfully) if a professor goes to them for information. It seems like once every week or two someone gets caught cheating through Chegg. It's stupid. \n\nI personally don't think Chegg is a great idea. The thing is, it is very useful. You can get your homework done quicker and assignments finished faster. The problem is, if you're just looking at the problems and their solutions, you aren't learning. I don't care who you are, looking at somebodies solution and copying it down is not doing you any favors. I feel like the people who use it the most are screwing themselves over the most. Learning the material correctly is definitely a better way to conduct yourself in college.",
