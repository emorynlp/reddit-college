  "title:": "Dumb question: How do I cite multiple quotes from the same book for works cited?",
  "text": "I'm writing an essay for an English class about a book we read and we have to include 1-2 quotes for each body paragraph. I just wanted to know if I have to write the same citation over again for the number of quotes I used or do I just cite the book and author once? I'm pretty sure I only need to include it once since there are in-text citations with the page number and author but idk, I guess it's better safe to ask. Hope my question makes sense, thanks for the help.",

      "text": "I think I understand what you\u2019re asking. You cite the entire book in the bibliography one time, but every time you have a quote from the book in your actual writing, you have to cite the page number. The format depends on your Professor, so ask them what they want.",

      "text": "You must cite every quotation and paraphrase you use with an in-text parenthetical citation. What is included in this citation will vary by the citation system your using but APA is (Author Last Name, Year the work was published) while MLA is (Author Last Name, Page Number the quote/paraphrase is taken from). These parenthetical citations reference the full citations you place on your Works Cited page,  which you only need one of per work referenced.",
