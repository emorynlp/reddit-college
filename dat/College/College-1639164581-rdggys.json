I really want to go to Boston College, and from what I've heard, it is much harder to get into than Morrisey arts and sciences than the business school. Would a minor in Finance be enough?",

History is a fantastic hobby, whether that's documentaries, re-enactments, visit sites, reading books, going to museums, joining clubs, etc. Adding the stress of taking classes while trying to get into a competitive business school is probably not helpful and just runs the risk of you ruining your love for history because of negative association.",
