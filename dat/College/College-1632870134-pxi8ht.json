  "text": "I remember in almost all my middle and high school career I always ended up with bad luck group projects. Literally paired up with the kids that didn\u2019t care, lazy or just bailed out last second due to \u201cillness\u201d or \u201cfamily issues\u201d. (Yes, I remember one group team literally skipped school that day and I ended up having to present all by myself. They still got full points despite not showing up) My parents got so sick and tired of group projects (because they ended up helping me) that they begged teachers not to pair me up with anymore team projects during my senior year of school. They told me in college if I end up with a group project, do a Hail Mary on the project as \u201cyou can\u2019t rely on others but you can rely on yourself.\u201d \n\nWell\u2026. Ended up going through the same thing again. Last minute scrambling and I know major points will get docked. I\u2019m literally upset once again. My professor doesn\u2019t care despite emailing them 2 days prior to the project being due. They told me \u201cI have to be a team player\u201d and all that jazz. What\u2019s the point of group projects when they don\u2019t even reply back or plan out something? I waited one day at a coffee shop and nobody showed. Nobody! I\u2019m beyond frustrated with this specific class as the professor doesn\u2019t understand about personal lives and what not. I\u2019m tired and my anxiety has been sky rocketed all day. I took a major hit on my other classes investing time into this project (worth 30% of my grade) so I\u2019m just behind on everything. \n\nAnyone else just absolutely hate group projects??",

Turns into everyone complaining when I say I won't be able to work on my portion until Friday instead of Thursday. Saturday rolls around and everyone's making excuses for why they haven't even touched it yet. I've realized that as long as I do my job, I don't have a lot to worry about. This has been true throughout my life and the more I implement it the happier I am.",

      "text": "That\u2019s odd. Professors in college are usually firm on those who don\u2019t do work on a group project. Like if you call out a partner who doesn\u2019t do shit, they will fail that person for the project. But yeah I don\u2019t like group projects where my partner(s) are picked for me. I like to work with like minded people so I don\u2019t get screwed.",

          "text": "Unfortunately it\u2019s a huge deja vu all over again.\n\nEvery single group project goes through the same cycle with me: I got paired up, little to no contact from the group, me scrambling and falling behind other classes because this project is always worth 20% or more of my grade and I hate doing things last minute, end up doing the project alone and presenting by myself\u2026. No fault. \n\nIt\u2019s why when senior year came and a group project was worth 50% of my grade for my one history class, my parents had an emergency meeting, bringing in all proof of my past experiences and teacher responses (which were emails stating they will talk with the students but never did or straight up say I needed to be a team player or did nothing). We fought tooth and nail with the teacher and the adminstrative about it (which they\u2019re agreed to all my classes that senior year with no team projects since this stemmed throughout my 9-11th grade year) so having this cycle go again with the professor not caring is utter BS. Basically said I can write up a \u201cevaluation\u201d for the students but that\u2019s it, nothing will be done. I\u2019m done compromising with team related projects and will avoid future classes with team work projects.",
