  "text": "I feel so lost with my college path. Ever since the pandemic started, I started to slip. When I started my first semester online, I had a fallout with my ex and I let the breakup heavily affect me during the weeks. I'm baffled that I let myself be so broken over a girl. It didn't help that my major was Computer Science. I struggled a lot in my coding class and I ended up relying on a friend to help me with the exercises. For my calculus class, I failed it the first time. I said alright, lemme just re-take it next semester. \n\nNext semester came and I passed with a D, thought hey, I finally passed but I really didn't. I didn't realize you need a C or higher to pass. So third semester I retook it again but something happened. I didn't feel right in this major. I wasn't enjoying the coding and I relied on a friend to basically cheat my way. I once again was doing horribly in my calc class and there I decided that I would switch majors.\n\nOf course, I knew switching majors meant I would graduate late, that wasn't my problem, the issue was the cost. My mother is supporting me by paying out of pocket because I'm not eligible for financial aid, and at first I was scared to tell her but I knew it was better to tell her now than later.\n\nSo after that, I switched from Computer Science to Computer Information Systems and because of that, most of my classes were fall through. I dropped my coding class and just tonight, I decided to drop my calc class as well since I'm near the edge of failing. The only class I have left for this semester is a business class and the bad part is that it's also a fallthrough so no credits. \n\nI just don't know. I feel I screwed up my future for my career path and overall feel like a disappointment to myself and to my mother. School was pretty much my thing back then and seeing how horrible I done so far, I feel dumb and hopeless.",
