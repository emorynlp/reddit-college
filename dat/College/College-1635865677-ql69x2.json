  "title:": "Weird question about an assignment related to calling someone : do you think they would take the time to answer my questions?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m taking a class (probate law and real estate). I have an assignment that wants me to reach out to a local law firm in regards to probate/real estate. It\u2019s pretty simple questions like \u201cwhat do you like about your job.\u201d Etc etc. \n\nI guess my question is would a firm really answer my questions in regards to this assignment for a college course? I feel I would be wasting their time on the phone to answer 5 questions about their job and what not (and I\u2019m already a nervous wreck even calling anyone, let alone my\nown mom) \n\nHas someone ever done this type of assignment before for reaching out to a local law firm or some type of business to ask these questions?",

      "text": "My experience has been that people are way more receptive to college students than you would think. If you call and say you\u2019re a student with such-and-such college and ask for five minutes of their time to answer a few questions, it\u2019s very likely they\u2019ll talk to you.",
