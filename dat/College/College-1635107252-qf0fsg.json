      "text": "They're selected by committee at my college for most courses. When the committee picks, we try our best to balance multiple things:\n\n* Does it adequately cover the content? This is the biggest concern. Does it teach what we need it to teach, at the level we need to teach it at? \n\n* Quality of publisher's auxiliary components and ease of use, on both the instructor and student side. If the students uniformly loathe a specific homework system, it has a significant weight. \n\n* Cost. If we LOVE a book but it's $300 and there's another book that's good (just not as good) that's 1/3 the cost, we'd go with the cheaper one.",

I have landed on books/materials I like based on my own readings/reviews of those books as well as trial and error in prior courses. Some books don\u2019t work well for the students I have or the course format. Some books are just poorly written. Some are too easy, and some are too difficult.\n\nI also tend to make them supplementary to what we are doing in class and use older editions to make it cheaper for students. Our OERs are lackluster, or I would use those.",

      "text": "There are three things I consider when choosing:\n\n1. Cost. The book needs to be accessible and not break anyone's bank. \n2. How established is the book? In general, my preference is to use books that are considered 'standard' in my discipline, so I can be reasonably confident that students in my sections of an introductory course are exposed to similar content as those who may be transferring in from a CC or took the course from a different instructor in a different year. It also means that when students go out into the world, they should (hopefully) have a common foundation in the discipline that they can use to relate to others. My style as an instructor will inform how they approach and may even be critical of this foundation, but my students will be aware that it exists and able to use that standard language.\n3. Do I find it engaging to read, personally? If the book bores me, it will almost certainly bore the median undergraduate. \n\nPoint 2, since it generally favors books that have been released for some time, also tends to assist Point 1 as used copies have been circulating for awhile and it's likely that a pdf has ended up on the internet somewhere (not that I'd ever condone violations of intellectual property).",

          "text": "A chair of a department with five or six faculty, each teaching three to five classes?  It's virtually impossible for a chair to know the materials for every member of their department.  That said, there may be some departments where the department head has final approval, but that's not the norm.  \n\nMore often, the individual professor picks the materials for their respective classes.  For my classes, I take a number of things into consideration, including the suitability of the text, the accessibility of its content, it's cost, and it's length.  I've also started leaning towards OER materials, meaning students are spending far less when such materials are available.",
