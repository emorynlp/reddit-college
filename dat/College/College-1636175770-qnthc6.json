  "text": "So\u2026 Senior year, and I just finished with my second round of midterms/got grades back.\n\nI have failed 3/4 courses this semester. I\u2019m officially off track to graduate in 4 years.\n\n__But__ I don\u2019t feel sorry for myself, I don\u2019t event feel particularly discouraged. Here\u2019s why:\n\nI really shouldn\u2019t be taking 4 high level Econ courses at the same time, it\u2019s just how my schedule turned out.\n\nI\u2019m not a student by nature. I\u2019m going through college, but a formalized education environment does not work well for me. It never has, I don\u2019t think it ever will, and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve done enough great things in life and achieved enough to know I\u2019m not stupid because this doesn\u2019t click with me.\n\nI\u2019ll be grinding away at those last requirements at a slower pace that lets me live life and work on some other things at the same time.\n\nAll that to say if you\u2019ve been struggling this year, or in years past, it\u2019s okay. College really isn\u2019t for everyone, I truly believe it doesn\u2019t necessarily benefit a lot of people, and even if it does benefit you, it\u2019s okay to take your time finishing.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to take more than 4 years to graduate. It\u2019s okay to struggle. You are not less of a person for it. You\u2019re not a failure for it.\n\nI understand finances are their own issue, but my general advice is take your time. Don\u2019t kill your self for academia, you\u2019re not going to fall as far behind as you think.",
