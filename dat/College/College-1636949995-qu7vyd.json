  "text": "Hi everyone, I know this seems like funny/stupid question but I\u2019ve read a bunch of things about how crappy the food is and how bad of an effect it\u2019s had on peoples stomachs. \n\nI\u2019m a senior in high school now and am currently looking at colleges to attend. So far the ones I\u2019ve been accepted to have dining halls and from what I\u2019ve read, it makes people poop, like a lot. Im planning on rushing a sorority too and if I get into a house, I really don\u2019t want to spend my time actively blowing up the bathrooms because of the dining hall food. \n\nI want to see anyone has experience with this because if I\u2019m going to be walking around like a bloated balloon farting until I shit for the 3rd time that day, I\u2019ll skip on the dining hall and just go buy food from outside. I\u2019d prefer not to crop dust the university and other students. \n\nSeriously need advice because I\u2019d be mortified if I kept blowing up my dorm bathroom/sorority\u2019s bathroom.",

Sometimes my anxiety can cause it to flare up which I know is going to be worse in college so I\u2019ll have to figure out how to manage it. \n\nI asked because off campus food can be pretty expensive and the meal plan seems better financially.",

              "text": "If you've got access to a kitchen, it will be absolutely cheaper to buy groceries instead of the meal plan. The meal plan includes labor and utilities to make that food for you, it will be more expensive with lower quality food. \n\nI'm a vegetarian and I live in the sticks. I prepare 95% of all of my own meals. Buying whole foods is by far the cheapest way. Processed boxed meals are more expensive than real food. I buy a 50 pound bag of flour for 25 bucks which equates to 50 cent loaves of bread that are twice the size as store bought and a zillion times better. If you have access to an oven, making bread is so easy. I purchase old fashioned oats in bulk as well, they are incredibly healthy and easy to prepare. \n\nIf you have a kitchen, I'd seriously consider learning to cook if you can't already. It saves my partner and I a ton of money to take control of our own food. Plus, it's much healthier than anything we can buy.",

The college I\u2019m looking at does have a kitchen in the dorm so it should be easy for me to cook in. \n\nAlso, where do you buy Whole Foods like that from? Really the closest organic grocery store nearby would be an Aldi, the others are normal grocery stores with mostly packaged goods.",
