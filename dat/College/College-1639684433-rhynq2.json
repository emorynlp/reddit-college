And then F is 0 of course.",

A 2 credit class might not have as much an impact as a 4 credit class, but a F should still be much worst than a D, however i literally have no clue how much these credits impact gpa, so i have no idea which one would benefit my gpa the most. the fact that i have to even explain this is insane. u could\u2019ve just simply answered since u apparently know the answer, but instead u choose to be an ass, so why are u even on this sub?",
