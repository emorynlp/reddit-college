  "text": "I am going to a technical college and for the last 2 semesters my professors haven't been doing lectures. Due to distance learning. Its just read the book and watch this obscure video. It is very frustrating since I learn through instruction. I only have 1 semester left after this but I honestly feel like I haven't learned much because of this. Is anyone else having similar issues?",
