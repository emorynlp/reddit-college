  "text": "Hi! Right now I'm a highschool student in Turkey and I want to study the university abroad. I'm currently thinking about applying to european countries ( could be Italy, Germany, UK) but I'm so confused about the requirements and applications. I made lots of research on internet but I'm still not sure what do I need to do to meet the requirements and get accepted. Can someone who is knowledgable about requirements of European Universities help me I have a few questions. I won't take a lot of time. I know that their requirements are different from American Universities but I really need help. Thanks!",
