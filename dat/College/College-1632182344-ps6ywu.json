  "text": "How do you guys stay sane without having a single friend on campus? I know it's really not that deep, but it's been getting to me lately. I'm a senior and this is my second year at my new school as a transfer student. Last year, all the COVID precautions made it easy to keep to myself and go to class and leave. Now, everything's back to normal and I've never felt more like an outsider... \n\nI work part-time to support myself and really don't have much time to hang out on campus, and even if I do, I don't bother because like I said, it's lonely and depressing. I literally don't know *anyone*. I've tried talking to people on the first few days of classes (multiple semesters) but nobody is ever interested in anything beyond the stupid icebreakers. I actually met this one guy who happened to be in a few of my classes--we were partners for the icebreaker on the first day and chatted it up a bit. I was excited because it seemed like there was potential for a possible acquaintance, but then the next class he sits nowhere near me. It's five weeks in and I don't even bother anymore. I literally just go to class and go home. \n\nIt's very disheartening to see my college experience come near an end without having made a single friend throughout these five years. I know in the long-run it's good for me because I'll be graduating debt-free, but in the short-run it's really depressing and has a terrible impact on my confidence and mental health.",

I agree that you have more flexible time and you are not under your parents' control, but when it comes to socializing, it's depressing as fuck. \n\nI don't know ANYONE in college and yes I have tried my best to make friends, but at the end of the day people just don't want to be friends with me. Yes I talk to my classmates, yes I'm a friendly socialized person, but I tell you it's fucking pointless to make friends in college. I go to class then I leave asap. I study in the library then go home to do my own shit. I don't even try to make friends any more.\n\nOh and I tried to join some clubs, and on the first day of meeting, a girl yelled out loud \"haha you're too old\" in front of 30 people when I told them I'm 28.",

Living on campus is not to blame but instead my social skills.\n\nJoining clubs is a solution. I was always the guy that did try to small talk other students (with varying success rate). College is more about independence, and with that means that less people are going to want to talk to each other in fear of being a bother. Honestly it happens with adults - people are too afraid to ask each other to hang out because they think they're going to be annoying by doing so, since everyone assumes that they are busier than they actually are.\n\nAnd sorry to hear about the guy you were talking to, but I think maybe you should go talk to him - unless it seemed like it was a definite \"I don't want to talk to you\" sort of thing.",

After a couple years trying to make friends (and get depressed on the way becus I do have friends at home but that's a whole diffeerent world now), I don't even bother anymore. Unlike others, online class is my savior now! They kind of fit me somehow, I KNOW most ppl in my online class do not have any friends from their classes too becus we're all online and knowing I'm not the only one sucks in this feel goooooood. I also have extra time saving from commute so I start doing yoga + general exercise, call my friends and hang out with my family more often, read some books, pick up new hobby (tennis and learning Chinese) and start my small business. With the amount of homework and those extra activities trust me you don't have time to feel lonely, you'll wish for time to SLEEP. Keeping myself busy is a real thing, and it feels good to know I'm moving ahead instead of wasting time getting ppl to like me and hang out with me. I've learned that depending your happiness on People is an extremely risky thing, put your happiness in things you can MAKE it happen: your life, your career, your family. Friends will come occasionally and naturally, we attract ppl who are like us!",

And, if you do value your social life and have a good degree where you'll get a job, take out a federal loan to live off of and stop working for a bit. Or try to work on campus. Those jobs pay less usually but you'll be around more students throughout the day. I know it sounds like bad advice but my mental health and social life dramatically improved when I just took financial aid and stopped working so much because it relieved some stress. I know I'll have to pay it back one day anyway but at least I can enjoy the time now that I won't get back. After college, everything becomes about paying bills anyway. Again, this could be very bad advice and I had to take loans anyway because I did not have enough for tuition myself, but it's not the end of the world to do that.",

Everyone just goes to class and leaves afterwards. I tried to talk to some classmates in my classes but it always involves talking about hw or some random shit for like 5 min and then we never talk that much again. And none of them seems to want to do anything outside of class, maybe because my college barely has anything to do around here. HOWEVER, I did sign up for a few clubs and I actually hung out with some of them outside the clubs too. I\u2019m in a group chat in one club with some of the club members too. I have social anxiety but I forced myself to take part in clubs. All I can say is, clubs are your best bet for a commuter transfer student. It\u2019s like 90% guaranteed you\u2019ll talk to someone and make some connection at least",

I still do get lonely as you do. I wish I could go out for a beer with my buddies or just hangout whenever I wanted, but that\u2019s life, man. \n\nI didn\u2019t go to any clubs on campus to try and make new friends, I didn\u2019t put myself out there to make any new friends, it\u2019s not like I tried and failed, I just never tried at all. So, I don\u2019t get too upset about it. I accept that I haven\u2019t done much at all to make friends and that has left me with not making any new ones. I know more will come along in my life just like a new girl did. It\u2019s not impossible, but I\u2019m much happier knowing that things will take their course without letting it take over my thoughts and making me feel incredibly upset. \n\nGood luck finding your peace.",

And going to clubs I see people from classes and with multiple points of contact, I think the whole friend thing can work, even as someone commuting. I'm only like 2 weeks in, not 5, but I'm optimistic personally. Go join some clubs!

Worked part-time when I could but first pandemic year full time family caregiver.\n\n||How do you guys stay sane without having a single friend on campus?\n\n* First, a tl;dr:\n* Therapy\n* focus on classes, housework, caregiving, etc.\n* Music.\n* Going to parks or so.\n* After my grandpa died (non-covid, 'old age') and I was no longer as needed for caregiving roles for my family, I got a part-time job I absolutely hated but at least I was out of my house for 20-25 hours a week + commuting time.\n* Various forms of escapism:\n* Reading\n   * Especially more 'thinky' ones. Fantasy and scifi provide pleasure but stoic philosophy and self-help books engaged me deeper. Learning to disengage and be apathetic towards the world helps deal with the isolation. \n* Some video games\n* Youtube videos, esp ones with talking, to act as background noise\n\nThings that helped but might not be as easily available\n\n* Baking\n* Gardening\n\nStill fell into a deeper melancholy than normal but survived. I just kinda lost interest in life and hobbies but I stayed alive.\n\nTalk therapy really helps... I don't have a mental disorder or anything that warrants a special type of therapy or psychiatry treatment other than just checking in with an LCSW every coupla weeks. It's just general, vague talk therapy.\n\nEven with that, there is immense value in having a non-judgmental person listen and talk to you. I have a \"tough love\" family, so it really helps having that.\n\nYes, it does feel weird to \"pay to have a friend\" but well, you gotta take care of yourself. Right now mental health systems are a mess, but if you are seriously having issues with depression, staying sane, etc please consider it as an option.\n\nI think maybe also having family around helped. It's better than nothing, but not very supportive like a friendship.\n\nOne of my siblings is my best friend, although I am not theirs. I dropped them off at college this fall and its definitely much harder now.\n\nWhen I lived near the mountains I used to be really into the outdoors. I live 4-6 hours away now and I'm thinking of getting up at midnight to get to the lots before they're full, just to get away from things.",

I don\u2019t think if I commuted by car I would be able to do it but since I use bus and subway I normally use the time to sleep.\n\nIn the beginning it was pretty daunting having to think always with one hour each way in mind, and you don\u2019t have those situations where you forget something you can go home and pick it up so that\u2019s annoying. I\u2019m not the most organised person and I managed to do it, so anyone can! :D\n\nThe most common thing I use to do was spending most of the day in the campus (8h -19h) most of the days either on classes, studying or hanging with friends because that way I would avoid the worst hours of transit entering/leaving the city. I spent most of my semesters exhausted and there was times were I would fall asleep on classes but I know people who live 5 minutes away and they would miss classes or fall asleep more often than me, so maybe it has nothing to do with commute\n\nTLDR. Pretty hard and annoying to get used to in the beginning but you eventually get the hang of it and it\u2019s just natural kinda ahahah \nThe most important is to organise yourself and making sure your commute doesn\u2019t affect much your grades",
