  "text": "Hey guys, I am in need of a bit of advice relating to which car to buy in regards to college.\n\nI can either buy a standard Tesla Model 3, or I can get a Camry/Accord.\n\n  \nWhich decision would be smarter for college life, considering the ease of charging/finding gas?\n\nI feel like the flex factor of the tesla should also probably be taken into account, but I don't know how impractical an EV is in a college situation.",

Some schools don't. Try to learn if your school is one before deciding what car to get.",

The other broke college kids? The rich kids who won\u2019t care? I don\u2019t mean to sound rude but that should not impact your choice in car, ESPECIALLY as a college student.",

That\u2019s probably 1/4 of college tuition right there. An Accord or Camry is the better, more affordable choice no matter what.",
