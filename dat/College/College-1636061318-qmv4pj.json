  "text": "So I am a senior in highschool and all the talk is about college and I haven\u2019t even started applying for scholarships or to any universities. I honestly don\u2019t know what I want to do, i\u2019m not interested in anything that could actually get me a successful career in the future. i\u2019m likely going to pick something that will make me money in the future even if I hate it. I have no idea how applying even works, and there is no way I can even afford college but I really don\u2019t have any other options because I don\u2019t want to be stuck at starbucks or smth and living in my parents house for the rest of my life.",

      "text": "1. to apply to most colleges (in the United States) make a common app account and add colleges that you're interested in applying to.\n\n2. Have you taken your SAT/ACT? some colleges/universities are requiring that this year, but others are test-optional. \n\n3. do you qualify for any in-state scholarships that would cover part/all of tuition? \n\n4. you're going to want to pick a job doesn't make you hate going to work at 5am each morning, but also doesn't cause you to be broke.  you can always look into vocational/technical schools if you're interested in those.\n\n5. you don't necessarily have to know what you want to do with your life right now. most colleges have pre-requisites that cover basic math, foreign language, english classes, etc. hopefully in about 1-2 years you know what you want to do, but if you change your mind then that's alright too.\n\n6. you can apply for scholarships right now or even during college. \n\n7. you might need letters of recommendations from past teachers / counsellors depending on where you apply to. \n\n8. once you're done applying to colleges, make sure you fill out your FASFA form for the 2022-2023 school year with your parent/guardian. you're going to need their tax forms, your social / drivers license, etc.",
