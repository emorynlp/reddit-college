  "text": "I\u2019m heading to UNC in the fall and most of my classes are going to be a 20/25 minute walk from my dorm and my best friends\u2019 dorm is 15 minutes away too. I was planning on taking my bike to campus to get around (with a bike lock of course) but some people who I\u2019m not super close with say it\u2019s a waste of time and not worth it.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the responses!! I already have a bike but some #cool college kids who were too cool to get places in a timely manner had me feeling anxious about it.",

I don't know where you grew up (I grew up outside a city, so it wasn't common to see people bike to work) but there are cities where most people bike.\n\nP.s. even if it was \"lame\", do whatever you want. Half the time, \"lame\" choices (like studying in high school) are the ones that put you ahead everyone else. My most lucrative and beneficial choices were ones most of my peers didn't choose to make.",

When I\u2019m walking on campus and a biker passes by me, I hardly ever have them a second thought UNLESS they were way too in my walking path or being crazy for riding FAST through a crowded walking path. \n\nJust learn to ride responsibly on your campus and you\u2019ll be fine.

And anyone who\u2019s commenting on you driving a bike needs to mind their business unless they\u2019re going to offer you a ride to class.\n\nI recommend going to your campus before classes open and getting to know which areas are good for riding through. If you see any other bikers, ask them for tips on paths to use when it\u2019s busy around noon. If you\u2019re really worrying about others\u2019 opinions, then please just learn to not ride to close to pedestrians walking through.",

But in my 4 years at uni, I put almost 3000 miles on my bikes. I originally had a mountain bike, but it unfortunately got stolen from my shed (along with all my tools). So I bought an electric bike and keep it in my house. \n\nI don't understand how it would be a waste off time. Cycling is decent exercise, itll get you around quicker. I think the only thing I had to change was I would have to go around the long way, and avoid the middle of campus (library, dining hall, and student center) because the walking path was too crowded for me to feel comfortable. I was always worried that some students wouldnt be paying attention and step in front of me. \n\nI'd go for it, see how you like it, you dont have to continue biking if you dont want to. But if you dont take it, you'll never know.\n\nA lot of people at tarleton rode bikes, skateboards, scooters, hell we had a group that rode around on unicycles.",
