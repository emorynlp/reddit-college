  "title:": "Is a minor worth pursuing if it'll extend my graduation date? I have a job offer for post-grad, regardless of whether I get the minor or not.",
  "text": "I'm currently in the 5th year of my 4-year undergrad program. I'm working towards a BBA with a major in Marketing. Covid was kind of rough last year and I ended up going part-time and realized during that time I might be interested in pursuing a Master's in Data Science or Business Analytics. The requirements for these programs included a bunch of math courses I hadn't taken in the past, so I considered completing them all (which would extend my graduation by a year). To get a math minor at my school, there are 7 math courses we need to take; I'd be taking 3 of them for the requirements for the master's program so I decided to just go for the full minor, as that would probably look better on my degree. So, I went part-time last year and got the requirements for 3/7 of the math courses. I'm full-time now and planning to complete 2 during the fall semester, and the final 2 during the winter.\n\nOver Summer 2021, I also ended up getting a position as an intern at an insurance company. I met some amazing people who informed me about a 3-year rotational program the company has for new grads. They recruit for the program a year in advance; I got word of the recruitment and submitted an application. Found out there were roughly 700 people who applied and I was 1 of 40 who got an interview. Fast forward to the end of the summer and I'm 1 of 15 people who were offered a contract, so now I'll be starting with them in September 2022 for the first of my 3 rotations in the program. I was informed that the eligibility requirements for the program include new grads who graduate between December 2021 - August 2022.\n\nMy issue is kinda this: I have 4 courses left to complete for my BBA and 4 courses for my math minor. It's possible for me to do the 4 BBA courses this semester and graduate in December, or I could stick it out and do the math courses as well and graduate in April with a minor. My decision to do the minor was also influenced by the possibility of doing an international exchange (I'm from Canada and I would be able to go to the UK for 6 months). My school is set to make an official decision on whether the exchange can go forward in the coming weeks, as Covid caused them to cancel exchange for the last 1.5 years. They are set to make the decision after the official drop deadline for courses at my school. I'm currently enrolled in 6 courses because I wanted to wait until after their decision to drop the 2 courses that would be \"unnecessary\", and dropping after the deadline means I will only get back 50% of the tuition for those courses.\n\nI spoke with a friend and he suggested I should just drop the math minor altogether before the drop deadline and wait to see what happens with exchange. If exchange is cancelled, I'll have already dropped the math minor and be able to graduate in December 2021. If exchange is allowed to go forward, I'll have the luxury of taking 4 elective courses and focus more on travelling and having fun during the last semester of my undergrad. As for the master's, I'm not sure if this is something I wanna pursue because I mainly wanted a master's if I was unable to find a job after graduating. I've completed all the requirements for the masters and was just completing courses to get the minor now. If I chose to drop the minor, I feel like it wouldn't be a choice that hurts me in the long run.\n\nI'm conflicted now because I have a 3-year job secured for after graduation and I feel like the experience I gain from that is far more valuable in the long run than adding a minor to my degree. After the 3 years of the program, future employers will likely care about my work experience more than my education (especially because I plan to go into the corporate world). The minor seemed like a good idea when I wanted to do a master's, but now that I have a job lined up and don't need/want to pursue the master's anymore, it feels like I can get away without doing the math minor.\n\nI'm really agonizing over this decision. I have a differential equations lab in 1 day that I haven't even started studying for because I'm of the mindset that I'll be dropping the course. If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Let me know what you think, thanks\n\nEdit: I wanted to clarify. I'm currently in 6 courses this semester. I only need to take 4; I have 2 that I'm taking regardless of my decision, and then the other 4 are variable right now - depending on the decision I make, 2 of them will be dropped. The drop deadline for my school is likely gonna be before my school makes an official decision on whether exchange will happen or not. I've communicated my frustration about this with them, but they've told me they will make a decision asap. Due to covid, I kinda mentally accepted that exchange would not happen and that I would be good to graduate in December 2021. However, my school has communicated that exchange may actually be possible, so I've gotten my hopes slightly higher now. Regardless, I need to make a decision before the drop deadline and I'm leaning towards dropping the math minor and using the exchange term (if it happens) as an excuse to have fun in Europe for 6 months.

          "text": "Even with the possibility of an exchange term? The only reason I'm stressing is because the exchange term isn't confirmed yet, so I don't want to make a plan that relies on having that term if it is ultimately cancelled. However, the drop deadline is before they make their official decision so I have the chance of having exchange cancelled and also losing $1000 to non-returnable tuition fees. There's also the chance exchange goes forward and I make a decision to drop courses that could've been helpful. Tricky situation I'm in I guess lol",
