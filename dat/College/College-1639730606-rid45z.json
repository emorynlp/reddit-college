No company is going to want to hire someone that struggled in class - they need competent people (they usually balance grades with the rest of you. If you don\u2019t have extracurriculars, they\u2019re going to weigh heavily on grades)\n\nSo yes, work and study hard in school. Try your best to understand class material. \n\nGrades matter less as you go along with your career. But it\u2019s better to start it off on the right foot.\n\nMeeting ppl, going to events, and getting internships matter too.",
