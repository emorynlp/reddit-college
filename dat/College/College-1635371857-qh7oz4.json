  "text": "I'm a sophomore at my community college and I plan on transferring to a four year college next year. My major is going to be finance but I've been struggling with what minors I want to have.\n\nThe way my degree plan is set up, I only have to take a few classes to complete a minor in accounting. The classes for a minor in financial planning and in business administration are already included in my degree.\n\nI know I want to have minors in financial planning and accounting, but should I add business administration since I won't have to take any extra classes? Or is it too much to add 3 minors to my major?\n\nEdit: I plan on getting an MBA later down the line",
