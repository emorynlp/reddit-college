  "title:": "Am I at risk if I don\u2019t report the students next to me cheating?",
  "text": "I had a philosophy exam this morning and the two students next to me were writing notes to each other during the exam. They wrote in pencil on the exam sheet, erased the notes, and then wrote over them. The format was long-form essay responses. I don\u2019t know what the notes said.\n\nNormally, I would just forget about it since it didn\u2019t really affect me. But since I sit next to them and I did very well on the exam, I\u2019m wondering if I could be falsely accused of cheating or being complicit in cheating if another student reports it, the professor notices, etc while I didn\u2019t report anything. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard time, school sucks, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to cause someone to fail a class, but I\u2019m wondering whether reporting it is necessary to protect myself or if I\u2019m just being paranoid.",

          "text": "I disagree it's not his problem. What if those students cheated and do very well on the test. Well enough to be at the top of a bell curve, or raise the average enough to have the professor give no curve. What if the difference between 2% on the test or 2 people ahead of you on the curve causes you to lose a scholarship? Maybe it won't for you, but it might for someone in the class.\n\nMaybe I'm a self righteous stick in the mud who takes academic integrity too seriously, but it wouldn't sit right with me.",

              "text": "I believe that academic integrity is fundamental. However, when it comes down to cheaters, they know what they are doing. I've learned not to worry about what the next person is doing because they can decide on their own. Cheaters don't learn anything, and it comes around to bite them in the arse later when the class they cheated had essential information.",

      "text": "To be fair, IF they do falsely suspect/accuse you of cheating (already unlikely) they would have to reasonably prove that you did in fact cheat. Naturally since you didn\u2019t cheat, that\u2019s gonna be pretty hard to prove. I say totally up to you whether you report it or not, but I don\u2019t think you need to worry about either outcome turning bad for you :)",
