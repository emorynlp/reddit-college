  "text": "Don't know if you guys can relate or not, but here's the situation I'm in: Fairly easy classes, but due to outside factors, I miss a few assignments in a few classes. I get even busier with outside circumstances, always meaning to email my professors, but before I know it, another week goes by and I've missed a few more assignments. Now my grades have crashed *hard* and I'm terrified to ask my professors if I can turn them in late. I hate myself for letting it get this bad, and I know I won't let myself anymore. \n\nNot necessarily asking for advice, but do you guys have any experience with this? What helped you, because I feel so hopeless, like all of my other hard work is for nothing because of a couple of weeks of being busy and scatterbrained.",

      "text": "This happens to me too. I don't miss assignment deadlines at all but sometimes I'll be doing homework into the evening and I hate it. It drives me up a fucking wall and causes me some stress. \n\nThe thing is, you and I both know what is causing stress. It's not getting shit done when it needs to be. \n\nThe solution is so clear that it's hard to not know it. \n\nYou've got to get shit done beforehand. Not only will it improve your grades but the amount of stress I avoid is incredible. Now that I know this, I constantly make myself do it before hand. \n\nYou will stop feeling hopeless if you get shit done beforehand. The amount of work is no different whether it's early or late. You're going to have to do it anyways. There's no way out of it without failing. \n\nThere is no other solution. This is by far the simplest solution. Do it to treat yourself nicely. Do it so you don't have to stress the fuck out.",

      "text": "I'm working through a similar situation at work. I end up procrastinating during the week and then have to work the weekends. I would try to dedicate a day or two to just catch up on assignments if you can. If you take short breaks and try to work in 25 increments you might feel a little bit better. If you can just catch up you might feel relieved and a little more motivated because you'll be back on track.",

      "text": "When that happened to me I just dropped out and dealt with my \"outside circumstances\". Thats really your #1 issue here, whatever is taking up so much of your time that youre missing so many assignments, you either need to figure it out and have that stop being a factor or you should try college again at a time when it stops being a factor. Because even if you get all the current missed assignments squared away, its just going to happen again and your professors wont be as lenient",

      "text": "Personally, some of the best advice a professor has ever given me is \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to ask for an extension.\u201d Unless it\u2019s explicitly stated on the syllabus that there will be no extensions granted. The worst that can happen is that your professor says no. With regard to the stuff that\u2019s already late, I know it\u2019s really hard to show up two weeks late with an assignment, feeling terrible about yourself, but again the worst that can happen is that your professor says they can\u2019t accept it at this point. It\u2019s definitely not going to reflect more poorly on you to attempt to get them the assignment even if it\u2019s late, than to never turn it in at all. Just express the reasons for why things have been difficult for you lately, while also being humble and acknowledging that if they\u2019ll take the work and perhaps even penalize you somewhat less, that\u2019s by their grace. I\u2019ve also found that since COVID hit, professors and administration in general has been a lot more forgiving.\nAlso, I know that procrastinating and experiencing dread and self hatred about unfinished work is to some extent a normal part of life, but if it\u2019s escalated to this point, you might want to reflect about if it could be a sign of something like anxiety or even ADHD. Especially with the ADHD, people often don\u2019t have a great grasp on what it\u2019s actually like, and what the symptoms are, and so they dismiss their own experiences with it.",
