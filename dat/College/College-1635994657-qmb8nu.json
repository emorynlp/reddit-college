  "text": "I seem to always waver between the two mindsets. I\u2019m getting pretty good grades and feel like I\u2019m learning, I have very little free time and I maintain a fun social life and healthy lifestyle for the most part, but sometime I just feel the complete opposite and that I\u2019m wasting hard earned money if I happen to go out a little too much or miss an assignment by accident. Does anyway else feel the same?",
