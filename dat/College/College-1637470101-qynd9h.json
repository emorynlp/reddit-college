  "text": "So I've never been an A+ student, but I was a solid b, maybe high c, student in high school and I graduated with a 3.6 GPA.\n\nI ended up getting kinda depressed towards the beginning of the school year, and I fell behind in some of my classes. Then I got more depressed about my grades, and mix in some poor time management, and boom, it's all snowballing.\n\nNow I'm failing, if not close to failing all my classes. It's two weeks before the semester ends, and my grades are: 74, 61, 56, 68, 41, 71, and some labs that'll push down the 56 and the 68 even further.\n\nI feel like such a failure. I told my parents I was doing well and I haven't talked to my advisor to schedule spring semester classes cause I feel so shitty and embarrassed. No other freshman I know is going through this.\n\nWhat do I do? There's so much else that's weighing on this, too. Im trying to double major, I'm trying to move from my satellite campus to the main campus. I've never nosedived this bad and it's killing me to think about.",

      "text": "This is a tough situation, and it'll be hard to believe what I'll say, but it's true: this is not that uncommon. It's a situation that can be worked through with time. You can do better next term. The \"race\" to graduate in 4 years is silly considering that you'll live to 85. Your parents love and they'll take it in stride.\n\nThe things you can do are these: focus on finishing strong in classes you're passing or close to passing. Reconsider the double major, and see if you can lower your credit load next term. Consider getting help for the depression. Commit to improving your study skills next term.\n\nIt's all going to be fine, but it'll take a while for that to be as obvious to you as it is to me.",
