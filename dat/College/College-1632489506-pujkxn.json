  "text": "Hello everyone!\nSorry for my broken English,I'm not a native speaker.\nI'm looking for advice on what to major in. I'm currently studying BA in business administration but I don't like it because it is too broad and doesn't teach any specific skill especially that I would like to have a specific path to  follow. On the other hand,there is a new major in my college called electronic commerce. It focuses on digital business and digital marketing which I'm interested in and taking two courses about. It also teaches programming and technical skills which I would like to learn. But the issue is that it is  a new major in my country and it is not well known by employers . So I'm hesitated to switch even though I want to because I am not sure if employers will prefer to hire someone with a hybrid major instead of hiring someone with a full IT or business certificate. What do you guys think?\n\nEdit : we don't have MIS at my school or it would be my first choice",
