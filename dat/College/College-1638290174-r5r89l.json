  "text": "Hi, so I\u2019m studying a Pharmaceutical Science degree in Ireland. I\u2019m in my third year of study and my professor has accused me of taking information directly from the manufacturers lab manual which in fact I didn\u2019t, I idiotically used notes that I found from flashcards on Quizlet and used them in my report and submitted my report without citing, proofreading and checking for grammatical mistakes. This report is worth 15% of the entire module and I haven\u2019t yet sat my lab exam. I\u2019ve been very stressed out this year and have been dealing with COVID issues in my family so this is a first time offense that I take full responsibility for. Is it possible that I will be kicked out of college or have to repeat the entire module??? I\u2019m extremely nervous and looking for advice on how to deal with the situation. I\u2019ve never been late to submitting a report and my grades are overall decent with my GPA being ~3.0. HELP!",

I wouldn't go that route - it makes them think you think they are stupid.  Which pisses them off and might make them throw the book at you.\n\nBottom line - you're not getting kicked out.  Hopefully you can negotiate something not so bad, too.   But not if you play them for chumps.  They already KNOW you did it.",
