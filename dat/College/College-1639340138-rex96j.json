      "text": "It's mathematically possible but will require a lot of hard work. Depending on exactly how many credit hours you have currently and how many remaining to take, you'll probably need a GPA of around 3.8-3.9 for your remaining hours (assuming you have roughly 60 hrs completed & 60 hrs remaining), which means mostly As and a few (very few) Bs.\n\nGoogle \"GPA planning calculator\" for tools that will do the math for you.",
