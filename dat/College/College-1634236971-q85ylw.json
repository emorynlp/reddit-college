Both pay great too. \n\nHowever, don\u2019t just look at employment rates or pay and actually think about what you want to do. To me, accounting looks terrible. I know I wouldn\u2019t enjoy learning about any of it. \n\nI\u2019m a freshman computer science major and I actually enjoy learning the things we\u2019re covering.",

If you decide to major in CS and get through a year of it and decide you hate it, you\u2019ll have time to change your major. So you can experiment with both.",
