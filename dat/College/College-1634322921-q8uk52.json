  "text": "I\u2019m not even a science major. I\u2019m a public relations major but I am taking a biology class in order to fill the science requirement. \n\nThis class is stressing me out so much. I\u2019m crying after class over my grades. I fucking hate this. \nIt\u2019s so hard for a gen Ed class\n\nI\u2019m so frustrated and tired. I want to withdraw from this class and try again next year. My mom says there\u2019s no point in doing that because I will just have to take it again. But I\u2019m just so stressed. There HAS to be an easier way to fill this requirement? \n\nAnyone else relate? I just want to drop this class, but I know that I will have to just take it again. \n\nSo here I am, ugly crying in my car \ud83d\ude2d",
