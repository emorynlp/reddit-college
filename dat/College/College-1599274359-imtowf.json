  "title:": "Does anyone feel like they can't write a paper over the span of a few days, but instead do much better by writing it in one day?",
  "text": "I feel like when I come back to papers in English that are half-finished, I re-read it and decide to trash it so I can stay in one mindset while writing it so my feelings are more consistent.  My style of writing is influenced by my thoughts/emotions, and those change per day if not every few hours.  When my styles merge, they don't always match the same order of thoughts or make sense.  Is this common or not so much?\n\nEDIT:  Thank you everyone for the advice!!!!\n\nEDIT 2:  I also want to clarify because I think a few people misunderstood.  I'm not writing it all in one day as an act of desperateness or procrastination, but rather that I just prefer this way.  I almost never start late on something.  ",

I\u2019m one of those people who get As even if I write it at 4am the day it\u2019s due, but at a certain point it isn\u2019t about the grade anymore. You get the most out of improving yourself when you pace yourself and treat the first thing you come up with as a draft.\n\nThis might help you find some more consistency and uniformity in your writing style - at least it did for me. Good luck!",

I\u2019ve been forced at points to do the professor-preferred method of breaking it into several days and using an outline and all that - but it doesn\u2019t work for me. I have found that the flow of my papers is significantly better when I just sit down and write it all in one go. I saw an earlier comment that said they also do this, then read it again the next day to catch any mistakes. This is often what I do as well. For my English comp 2 course, I wrote a 24-page heavily medically based research paper in one night, in one sitting. And it may have been one of my best papers yet in my now four year, never ending collegiate career.",

      "text": "I write most of my papers an a few hours, but if it's a long paper, it could take maybe 5-6 to crunch out. I found that I've gotten progressively better at structuring my thoughts naturally without having to lay out a plan for essays, and I very rarely have to change words or fix grammar because I've gotten so used to checking my work as I write. Of course, I'll still read over it a couple times before I submit it, but my point is mainly that I do the best when I crunch it out in a matter of hours with no breaks. That way I don't lose concentration or have any change in the way I want to write. I've done a good handful of finals like this and gotten As on most of them, but in the past when I've taken a few days to write essays, they end up getting lower scores. As an aside, I also don't go through multiple drafts with my papers, but instead write the final draft immediately. It saves a lot of time for me, and I've always had an easier time skipping to the final draft instead of doing a rough draft. Perhaps it's just the way that I write that facilitates it, or maybe I've just developed that skill over years of taking shortcuts; who knows?\n\nSurprisingly, the same thing happens to me for studying. When I study for multiple days before a test, I do worse. It's probably because I'm trying to remember information for multiple days, or I'm trying to remember things that are ultimately irrelevant to succeeding in the class. On all my AP tests in high school and my tests on college, I've done best if I just study the night before and get enough sleep.",

      "text": "Throughout my later years of undergrad and all of grad school I pretty much averaged 10\u201313 pages a sitting. Like others have said here, I\u2019d spend a day thinking through and researching, maybe sketching out some ideas. Then I\u2019d take a day to bust out 10-13, which is the average length of most non-term papers in my field. After that I\u2019d spend a day editing which consisted of rereading what I wrote and doing syntactic and diction edits, restructuring, and even sometimes straight up rewriting sections or adding/ subtracting sections. My prep day and editing day were never full days mostly part of an afternoon and evening, but on days I wrote I\u2019d get up early have breakfast and write through the day and evening. \n\nThe key to this is first and foremost making sure our shit is together with ideas and evidence. How you do your writing won\u2019t make an impact if you\u2019re trying to prove the sky is green. The other thing is being willing to utilize writing resources. Anytime I had long stints of writing I ALWAYS used grammarly or similar software and asked others to read my work. Remember if you\u2019re too embarrassed to have a friend read your paper you need to think long and hard why you\u2019re about to give it to a professor. But the most important thing about procrastination, or doing a lot of work at once, is to just plan for it and give yourself time for fuck ups. I\u2019d give myself personal due dates just to give myself the artificial urgency to get it done.",

      "text": "For me, I have found that I write papers a whole lot better under a time constraint. I know it may seem stupid, but for that reason, if a paper is due on the 10th at 11:30pm, I normally don't start until the morning of the 10th. I do a ton of reading and gathering sources (most of the time) the week before, and then don't actually start trying to write until the day before at the earliest. It may sound odd, but I just write papers better, closer to a deadline. Its not like that with everything though. For example, math and physics, taking timed tests, stressed me the crap out. I \"can't\" do it (air quotes bc I can, it just stresses me), but with papers, I work way better closer to the deadline. It may be in part because I like to procrastinate, and it may just be in part that I actually do write more information dense and better papers when I have a deadline to beat. Not sure if I subconsciously take it as a change or what, but thats just how I write. Sometimes I would have a major paper due on the 13th at 8:00am, and I would start writing it 9:pm on the 12th. Most of my good papers are written in the span of a few hours. I feel like if I start a paper in the beginning of the week it just isn't formed right and it doesn't flow good. I can't keep my mind on it, and just drift to other subjects that I have. So I am 100% with you on that!!!!",

It feels better because you start and complete a task in the same day or within one big time frame, not actually because the quality of your writing is higher. \n\n\nYou said you just started college, so that makes sense to me. But please please do not try to write big, important assignments in that frame of mind. If you would write two entirely different papers because of your mood or the \u201cgroove,\u201d you get into, then neither of those papers are your best work or an accurate reflection of the learning and research you have completed. \n\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re struggling with a project, or it\u2019s just a  really big one: Write down your ideas. Check in with professor or TA if you\u2019re on the right track (this can be brief, in class if it\u2019s a small class or via email). Write an outline. Go to office hours. Write a draft. Go to office hours, and for the love of God don\u2019t just do this ONE day before it\u2019s due. Then write your paper with the feedback you\u2019ve been receiving.",

          "text": "Perhaps that's true for some or most students, but I've almost always gotten an A and sometimes even personal compliments from teachers/professors when I write papers, while I've kept to the method of writing an essay in a single day for several years now. Most of the papers I've written in the past year have been done in less than 5 hours with only a few exceptions that still didn't span more than a day. I outline in my head as I'm doing research, revise as I write, and work off that to write a final draft right from the start. Using this strategy, I very rarely have to make any major revisions to what I've written after I read through it for the first time. I've been developing and practicing this for years, and teachers have never been able to tell if it was written 5 hours before the deadline. Despite this, I usually don't wait until the last night to write a paper; I merely prefer to write it all in one day, as it's much easier for me to focus on and complete in a short timespan.\n\nI suppose what I'm saying is that you shouldn't fall victim to your own hubris. There will be students who can write fantastic essays in very short timespans, and plenty that try and fail. Since your students don't tell you how long they took to write an essay, you have no reassurance that you can \"always tell\" when it was written the night before. I have plenty of friends who will take a week to write an essay that is still riddled with errors, poor structure, and still appears to have been written in a matter of hours, despite their constant redrafting and revising. Remember that there will almost always be exceptions to the rule.",
