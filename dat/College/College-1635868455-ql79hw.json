  "text": "Thinking of applying to a course after I finish with sixth form to do alongside work for a year before going to university. Does anyone know what 'subject' would teach people about fallacies? I'm very interested in fallacies and debating. I'm currently studying English Lang/Lit and philosophy and they're never mentioned in either of them.",
