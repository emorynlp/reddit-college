  "title:": "Failing my classes and confused about my major/future",
  "text": "I am currently a second year student at a California community college. I began as an environmental studies BA hoping to transfer to a UC in 2 years. I aced all my classes my first year, falling in the top 10%, taking a few humanities, Bio, Calc 1, and English. Now my second year comes along and I want to switch my major to something more science based since I was never interested in the career opportunities associated with the BA in the first place. I see a counselor and he tells me I will need to take a bunch of sciency courses this year in order to transfer next fall.\n\nSo this year I am in Environmental Science, supposed to apply to transfer, and have a course load of Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus 2.  After failing a couple tests and quizzes, I came to the realization that I never had a science brain to begin with. I don\u2019t enjoy nor excel at solving science problems and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing with myself. The idea of studying and saving the natural world just appealed to me. But I have no motivation to study forces, integrals, and orbitals. I enjoy learning about the world from a more holistic perspective. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I would like to withdraw from all my classes, get a job and come back next semester to take an easier course load but at least knowing what I want to do. But that\u2019s my parents\u2019 money. I\u2019m so scared and confused and stressed. My parents keep telling me to just finish off this semester but I know I won\u2019t do well at all. I need at least a C in my classes to fulfill UC requirements which I don\u2019t think I can do. Any advice will help, I\u2019m extremely stressed right now.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the thorough replies! I\u2019m going to see a counselor and will likely withdraw from physics and calc, stay in chem and find a job.",

I went from a 1.8 GPA, having mostly terrible mental health days, a worsening chronic illness, and a horrible self image to a job I loved, more friends and therapy and medications that exponentially helped my mental health and physical health, confidence, and a 3.75 GPA at a wonderfully supportive university. \nIf you think you should withdraw. Withdraw. Sometimes things we think will be horrible or weak of us to do wind up being the best decision we could ever make.",

You are already significantly ahead of the game. But keep in mind that many universities don't recognize C's a d D's as passing grades. Don't be afraid to retake classes, I didn't get serious about college until I withdrew/failed at least 4 classes. It sucks and it's embarrassing, but leave the door open to succeed! I needed to work a few shitty jobs for a few years before I realized how important college is and how important it was to work hard at something! And if u do that in college, you'll be blessed with opportunity.",

      "text": "Honestly, you\u2019re not liking the science side of things because you\u2019re not doing science you\u2019re doing stress lmfao. A semester filled with science/math courses will kill your mental health.  \n\nI agree with everyone else when they say to take a break (I would only take a semester off, it\u2019s harder to get back into the school boat when you live free for too long). \n\nAlso, what\u2019s causing you to fail is your undecided major (you\u2019re not subconsciously motivated enough/ or you\u2019re uncertain of the degree) it\u2019s almost like how Bruce Wayne can\u2019t get out of the pit because he can\u2019t make the jump across the ledge in TDKR. He only succeeds and makes jump when he doesn\u2019t use the rope to catch him. \n\nIn this case you\u2019re Bruce Wayne, the pit is your life at the moment, the ledge is your crisis, and the rope is your major.  \n\nI think if you find what you desire what you want to do most, your purpose in the science field, you\u2019ll be able to pull yourself up. \nBecause it sounds like you\u2019ve already made up your mind about the degree you\u2019ve chosen. \n\nMy best advice to you is to let go of the degree and take a break to explore. \nDo everything you like to do, if it becomes a \u2018fixed ratio\u2019 (EX. working on an assembly line) then that\u2019s not the one for you [unless you like it].",

It not only looks better, but we can learn a lot through learning what we do and don\u2019t like. Sometimes, we even can come back from not understanding something. Talk to your counselor and ask for their guidance. Ask your professors on their opinion. You may not be the only one struggling.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone and this isn\u2019t the first time anyone has felt like this. You\u2019ll get through it and figure your life out.

I entered for a physics degree and aced the first few classes, but both learned what a job in physics will actually be like, and that my brain isn't wired for math and hard calculations. My second year I decided to explore other subjects, and found an absolute love for computer science.\nBasically, don't worry you're not the only person this happens to, I'd recommend looking into other majors as well.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, computer science isn't like math or physics in that it's not that you are trying to solve and recreate the correct solution. In computer science you are free to make the solution however you want. I really like it because it has a freedom in problem solving not present in other STEM degrees. It's more logic based and much less math based.",

I know how difficult it is, I ended up switching majors many times both in community college and then again once more at UCD, I even had to switch \"colleges\" within the college because I went from managerial economics to sociology. Anyways, I'd recommend taking these courses still but one at a time or at a slower rate, especially if they're difficult. I pushed through community college and UCD because I was so burnt out  I just wanted to finish, but I feel like my grades and sanity would've been better off if I had taken part time courses :) I'd say just don't be afraid to take your time and do things at your own pace, take courses you wouldn't usually think of and push your boundaries with which courses you chose so you can get a variety of experiences! I took Sociology of Immigration as an elective my first quarter at UCD because it was an issue I was passionate about and found that I liked studying soc much more! It's not necessarily easy to switch majors but I'd say it's better than being stuck in something you hate!",

Spent my first 3 semesters as a neuroscience major, spent two semesters as an Environmental Science major and decided to switch to engineering. Although the road to get there was tough, it has and will probably be the best decision of my life. DO NOT GIVE UP. Now thats easier said than done, however Physics 1 & 2, Calc 2 and chem are considered the \"weed out\" courses. Once you get past them, it's not so bad after that. I was in the same mindset as you (i.e I am not a science oriented person, I am not good at school...etc) but with the help from some friends, constant visits to the math help center and my best friend Chegg, I made it through and I could not be happier. I ended up transferring into the engineering school as Environmental Engineering (it was the least competitive and I barely had the GPA to get in in the first place) and then finally switched to Civil Engineering, which is what I will graduate with. I am currently a 5th year senior having to take 18 credits (max load) both semesters to graduate, but I have a job lined up where I will be making 85k right out of school. Hopefully you see this and if you have any more questions I am more than happy to answer them!",

Lots of good advice on here already, but I just wanted to let you know that those courses you listed are all heavily based math science courses, which are without a doubt my least favorite classes I have taken in my 3 years. I\u2019m taking physics now and when I tell you I couldn\u2019t care less about a course I mean it. I struggled hard my freshman year with General Chemistry but LOVED Organic Chemistry and all my other biology course requirements. Like others have said, taking these challenging courses more spread out may help you so much! I could\u2019ve never been able to take all of those classes in one semester. \n\nSo I guess my question to you is, do you enjoy the environmental science classes you are taking? If you do then I do believe you are in the right major, you just have to fight through these \u201cbullshit classes\u201d as my friends and I like to call them. If you do not enjoy the environmental science courses, then there are tons of other options to look at! \n\nHowever, try to focus on the now. I saw you\u2019re going to go talk to your advisor about spreading your course load out which is 100% what I would do.

I only failed a Pre-Calc class and had a B or better in my other ones. But this summer I just failed my Calc 2 class with a 68%.\n\nIn my programming class right now I'm just very very lost. I can't remember a damn thing from previous classes. I just turned in a half blank midterm and I'm gonna drop that class.\n\nThe calc 2 class I'm retaking is from 7:30pm to 9:50pm at night. And the professor is super boring. I hate it so much.\n\nEver since that summer Calc 2 class, I've had difficulty focusing on school and lost so much motivation and drive. I have super bad anxiety and multiple panic attacks. \n\nConsidering switching my major to Psychology. Which is completely different. But looking at code and all this math just gives me a headache. It's a real shame cuz I'm so close to transferring, only two semesters away. But I just can't do it anymore. I've talked to my parents and if I can't pass my classes this semester I'm switching to Psych major.",

Most universities do not care if you have W's (withdrawals) on your transcript unless there are more than three. I would recommend dropping two or three classes and focusing on the ones you have remaining (or the ones you're doing best in). I did this at my community college and now I'm at a CSU. \n\nAlso, if you're questioning your selected major then I recommend finding something new. And, don't panic about transfering so quickly. Just make sure that you enjoy your major and can see yourself finding a career in the related field. Good luck!",

Do some self reflection and ask yourself whether youre putting in enough work. \n\nI say this cuz i dropped my classes and quit school. I did come back but it was VERY hard. A LOT of people dont come back after they drop out. I would do this as a very last resort or you know yourself well enough that in the future you will come back 200% and with a different mindset.\n\nEdit* let me add that i know its a very stressful situation. I was in three semesters that i failed and dropped classes till i dropped out. I kept trying and trying but it didnt work out. I know all about the stress youre going through. Be honest with yourself because you will know whether youre giving 100% effort or not. If youre not giving 100% then its hard to justify it. If u feel like u gave it all and didnt work out then drop it and save your brain the stress and yourself the time. Good luck. Whatever choice you make will be the correct one.",

As it was explained to me, there isn't a difference in job opportunities if you receive a BA or a BS in a science field, as employers typically don't care especially if you have field experience from internships. For example, my school has Environmental Biology available as a BA or BS, either gets you a degree in Environmental Biology. I personally have no experience with this as I am doing a BS, but I enjoy the science & math heavy courses.\n\nYou know your situation best. I think it's normal to feel overwhelmed, especially taking all science and math courses for the first time, you're being thrown a lot right now with the classes you are taking. I'm a slow thinker, it takes me awhile to fully grasp concepts, so taking a biology, chemistry or physics, a math class, and an elective is about all I can handle together. However, if you are truly not enjoying anything out of any of your classes, I would say to take a step back.",
