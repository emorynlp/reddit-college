  "text": "I have a mathematics AS (2021, local CC), an AS in IT (2007, Peirce College), & almost enough credits for an AS in Comp Sci (2022, local CC). Comp Sci sounds like the better choice going forwards for a Bachelor's given possible salary & me liking technology, but I really do not know how to code and have to Google everything from syntax to how to do very basic things. I got an A in the 1st 2 programming classes but had some help from friends. In Data Structures I got a B there & only half the class involved coding things, with the rest of the class being drawing binary diagrams & writing research about algorithms. Meanwhile I tutor mathematics (algebra, calculus, stats) for my local community college since 2016 & have enjoyed that, however I didn't originally set out in college to do that as a lifetime career. Is thinking through the process of coding so different from mathematical exercises and proofs that one can excel in one but not the other? Anyway I am wondering if a math BS/BA is practical in the world of work beyond teaching. Is it possible to get a math BS/BA then get a more job-relevant Master's like in data science or something else technological? Is tutoring something someone can make a living off of & pay bills on or is it really only a part-time thing? Given that I changed majors a couple times already & ran out of financial aid doing all this sophomore level work, I now have to pay the remainder of my education out of pocket. I am considering SNHU online to try to Bachelor's done ASAP as I'm tired of being stuck at an AS level. Those of you who have done both maths & CS, which do you prefer and why? I know some people do dual majors but don't they usually have to make their mind up on what they want to do after college? Do employers care if you have both or just CS is fine?",

          "text": "OK. I guess I can do both, then. I figured at some point in the path to a BS the maths & CS diverges & there has to be much less overlap at the junior/senior levels unlike at the freshman/sophmore levels where the required courses were so similar (maths AS where I go for instance stops CS classes at Java 2 but continues on the maths side to take ODEs whereas CS AS takes data structures but only up to calc 2 as far as their maths requirement goes).",

      "text": "There are definitely people out there who are really good at math but just don't like the work style of programming. My brother is getting a PHD in math, and I remember a couple of his friends were trying to push him to take computer science courses, but he didn't find programming interesting. That might also describe you, but programming is also a new skill for you, it sounds like, so it may be worth it to continue to test it out and see how you do. A lot of people do end up double majoring in math and computer science, and honestly I think this may be a good fit for you. Although you may need to check your school's curriculum, a lot of CS majors can take very math heavy electives (algorithms, cryptography, optimization, etc) instead of programming heavy ones. \n\nData science might also be a good thing to look into, in which case doing statistics instead of math as a major could be a good idea.",
