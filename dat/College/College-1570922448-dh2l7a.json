  "text": "How do you deal with loneliness at college? I\u2019m an international student and I was raised with a huge difference in the environment/ideas for fun. I only have a few friends/people I know. Most people here just drink, party, or binge watch in the weekend. To make things worse, most people here are in state students and already know each other or have a lot in common. My roommates don\u2019t do anything but play video games, study, and watch stuff online. The only thing I can think of is going to the gym but I can\u2019t get over my social fears because I\u2019m small and skinny. \nThank you.",

Plan your day around it. Get your work out of the way so you can enjoy the 2 hours you have set out for yourself. Helps you feel like you have a goal to work toward instead of getting caught in that \u201cwelp... I can always study more I guess\u201d mentality. But it doesn\u2019t have to be movies! It can be anything! Video games, reading books, exercising, etc. I\u2019ve found the easiest way to make friends is to not focus on just that: making friends! Focus on what you love and the people who also love what you love will find you if you don\u2019t run into them first. (Also! Side tip that helped me a ton: People care about you a whole lot less than you think! I mean this in a good way! They are focused on themselves just as much as you are thinking about how they are judging you.) Good luck! I hope you\u2019re able to find what you\u2019re looking for!",

If you can\u2019t find one that you\u2019re interested in, then broaden your exploration to the larger community that your college is in. The public library might be a good place to start. You can also look into some local volunteer opportunities. Getting involved in the community outside campus is a great way to make connections, create a social support network, and get personal satisfaction, while engaging in something that has nothing to do with your academics.

As a lot of people have said, clubs, groups, etc. are great ways to meet people.  Another way that I've found is going with some people to meals together.  Just pick some people that you know and like, and go to dinner together.  Call friends/family at home too.  Just remember that if you really don't find your group, you may want to consider transferring.  I hope this helps!",

College drama clubs always need help with productions doing stuff like costumes, scenery or lighting. Do you have musical talent? Look for a band or choir. One of the best things about going to a college not in your home town/state is that you can be the person you always wanted to be with no one from your past there to say you aren\u2019t. As far as going to the gym, it is there for students to use. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask others there for helpful suggestions, especially if you don\u2019t know how to use a piece of equipment.  People at a gym usually don\u2019t care if you\u2019re fit, it matters that you are there trying. Wishing you the best!",

Once you get friends, or even if you don't, find out what's going on around town. There are usually Facebook or website pages for the city that post events. Facebook also has an events tab that can show you what's going on. \n\nYou could also try going to tea rooms or coffee bars and see what they have going on. Sometimes they have game nights which is a good opportunity to socialize too.",

Compared to High School it actually has been a bit better as I have made some friends but I still feel lonely and a loner. For me it was simply doing what I could to get out. I love basketball so I played pickup and had a decent friend in sophomore year. He left so I was a lone, but I found a job outside of school and made one friend right now. It's hard but best I could give you is try to get out that you think is right for you. I commute as well so I wanted to work to try to make some friends and do something and I have been doing it for over a year.",

      "text": "As others have mentioned, joining clubs is great. Try finding one friend who you have stuff in common with and start talking to them A LOT. They might have their own friends too, TALK TO THEM TOO! I was in a similar situation as you (except I came from another state) and this is what's helped me so far. I did marching band so a lot of my friends are from there. I also found friends in my own major. College can be scary when a ton of people are there just to drink and party. Not everyone is like that. I went to a party school and I easily found people who are better students than me. Also, something I've noticed about international students at least in my school is that they tend to always be friends with people from their original country. Maybe find someone from where you're from (if possible) and talk to them. That's what usually helps a ton of other people. Good luck!",

Personally, exercising in general does wonders for my mental health and makes me feel good. And trust me when I say that no one is judging you, they\u2019re focussed on themselves for the most part. Once you go a couple times, it\u2019ll get easier and easier. I hope you consider going :)",

These days I typically read stuff from Barbell Medicine and use their training programming. Taking ownership of my goals and having my training sessions be part of a plan really makes what everyone else is doing feel immaterial.",
