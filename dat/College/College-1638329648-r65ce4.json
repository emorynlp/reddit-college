  "text": "Hello, everyone. I\u2019m a senior in college right now applying to full time jobs in finance and whatnot. But I\u2019ve got a small conundrum. I really really really do not want any of the jobs I am \u201cqualified\u201d for and many of them expect at least a few years of commitment. I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s a relatively new aspect of entry level finance jobs since so many people ditch corporate America after only a few years. I just feel like I picked a major that doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. I couldn\u2019t care less about finance and I honestly see these last 4 years as the biggest mistake I could have made. On a good note tho, I have a 3.94 going into this semester and this semester will a bit lower but I think I could still manage to possibly graduate Summa Cum Laude. That\u2019s really all I care about whether or not it truly matters to anyone else. Just upset about the amount of time, money, and emotion I\u2019ve invested into this and it feels like I\u2019m not gonna get anything out of it. Guess that\u2019s kind of what happens when you pick your major at 18. I\u2019m embarrassed that I even took it this far and I abhor the kind of careers all of my mentors have now. If I could do it again, I think I would study biology with a minor in history and I wouldn\u2019t focus on grades as much as just plain out learning and having a good time in college. Scared of living my life just waiting for 5 o clock every day and feeling like I\u2019m what\u2019s wrong with the world lol. I guess we\u2019ll see what happens but I\u2019m just upset that I don\u2019t stand by any of the decisions I\u2019ve made in the last 4 years and now I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m mentally drained from pretending to care about business and finance. Let me know your thoughts and btw I don\u2019t mean to bum anyone out I\u2019m just an idiot. Peace \u270c\ufe0f",

      "text": "I know this isn\u2019t the best solution ever, but you could try getting a masters on one of these areas you are actually interested about and maybe change your career path. It\u2019s either that, do another 4 years of undergrad or just accept business jobs at least for now. \n\nAlso, have you done any Internships during your undergrad? If not, I would recommend trying getting a job in your field to at least see how you feel about the whole job environment and stuff. That could also benefit you when applying for masters programs, I believe. Good luck!",
