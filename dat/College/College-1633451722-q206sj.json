Not only that, but I have an \"exam\" that's basically a midterm Thursday. I'm terrified. I came into college wanting to do the best but I am so bad in these situations. Any advice?

If you explain your situation to the Professor, there is a good chance that he gives you an extension because everything is falling on the same day for you.\n\nI have had professors given me extensions when I was in a similar situation as yours.

You can do this. \n\nBreak all of the work you need to do into bite-size pieces. No need to overextend yourself and do them all simultaneously. In these situations I like to bang out the stuff I can do early to buy myself time for studying for exams. I'd say spend a few days ripping through the paper and presentation. That last week you can spend working on the exams. \n\nYou'll be just fine. Go to tutoring, office hours, whatever you need to do. You may find that some of these projects didn't take as long as you think and you have extra time.",

(Don't forget to cite them if you're planning to quote them)\n* The group presentations are a pain if they don't want to cooperate so I recommend telling your professor about the situation and just do the project yourself (Solo) or find another group (Very unlikely to find another one but it's worth the shot if they agree to let you join in).\n* Ask if it's possible to postpone the deadline to make a breather for yourself.\n\nThe comments in this thread are actually helpful for you to improve what's necessary and what to do next.
