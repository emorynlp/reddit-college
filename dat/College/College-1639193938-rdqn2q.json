      "text": "Most graduation statistics are counted for 6 year rates, as even though 6 years is seen as lengthy and uncommon, students who haven't graduated by 6 years rarely will ever graduate.\n\nThe graduation number impacted by many factors, whether it is a public, private non-profit, or private for-profit, the size of the university, the selectivity of the college, and the difficulty of the college. However, trend lines are not easy to discern. Many highly competitive private non-profit universities, like UChicago, Georgetown, Princeton, Cornell, and Johns Hopkins have, have high graduation rates. Public universities generally have lower graduation rates. Many small colleges with a nearly 100% admit rate also have fairly respectable graduation rates. For-profit colleges have abysmal graduation rates.",

Some graduate early because they had extra credits from high school, took summer courses, or just grinded on 18 credit hours per semester. Basically, there are hundreds of factors that go into whether you can graduate in 4 years",
