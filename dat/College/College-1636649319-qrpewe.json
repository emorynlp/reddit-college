  "text": "I\u2019m a senior, and I\u2019m going to university for Computer Science, but if I were to choose a subject based off of pure interest, it\u2019d be music composition/theory. I love it, but Ive heard that it\u2019s probably the worst degree, and I honestly don\u2019t know how my family would feel. So, is a music degree as useless as everyone says it is?",

      "text": "Yeah it is pretty useless when it comes to finding jobs. I see it as something that you pursue when you already have a stable career or rich parents. Even then. But it also depends on the college you go to. If you\u2019re going to a private liberal arts college that costs 50k/yr. it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a music major or an engineering major, you\u2019re an idiot regardless.",

Even if you don't major in music education, you can expect to make some or more likely most of your income teaching.\n\nThat being said, most of my music major friends are living a decent middle class life-style (own a home, have a spouse and kids in the suburbs) and are doing okay. But I cannot emphasize this enough: all of them teach as their primary means of income.",

I tell people only major in music if you can\u2019t see yourself in anything else.",
