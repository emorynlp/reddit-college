  "text": "Does anyone\u2019s school use this? Especially for math class you can\u2019t use rate my prof because they just say it is taught by staff. It is released after a certain date or at the beginning of the quarter. Some of the professors are horrible and some are angels. It\u2019s like you get what you get kind of thing. I think they do this because everyone uses rate my prof so the people who have priority will register for the good professors and then no one will want to take the other classes so they are not full. When you look at the ratings of the professors it is really obvious that they are horrible. \n\nSometimes they will just cover up a bad professor without random selection because they are that bad. Nobody wants to register for their class. Once it is released it\u2019s too late to switch because the other classes are full. \n\nIt\u2019s so bad they have to hide their names. What a shame.",

      "text": "I attended a school in DC sometime ago, initially the engineering school was everything promising in my eyes. In reality, none of my professors spoke adequate English, some were in their first years living in America & well some were just down right horrid teachers.\n\nTeaching is like learning, it should be renewed and freshened every couple of years to make sure all focal points are met concretely. Yes it\u2019s something all college students experience. From Community college to Ivy League. Trust me.",

If not, I'd gtfo if I were you. How can you be successful in your future endeavors if the profs are that bad across the board?",

              "text": "I absolutely do not have enough information to answer this question.\n\nPeople who get their teaching assignments at the last minute may not be very prepared to teach that class - they may not know the subject matter well and they may be scrambling to put together course materials at the last minute. I certainly think that my teaching is better in semesters where I'm able to prepare farther in advance - like anything else, work done at the last minute is rarely your best work. This is especially true if it's not a course that you've taught before and not your area of specialization. They may be writing all the lectures, exams, assignments, syllabus, etc, with only 1-2 weeks of notice. If they're not given materials from the department, then it can take a *lot* of time to create them. It can also be very difficult to write \"good\" homework and exam questions and unfortunately sometimes you only discover that a question is ill-formed or ambiguous when students misunderstand it. If you teach the class again, you can improve that. If you're given another new course to teach instead, you run into the same problem again.\n\nThese could also be the courses that the department is scrambling to fill at the last minute and so there are fewer adjuncts who are still available, etc. These adjuncts may also be teaching multiple other courses at other colleges or have a full time job in addition to this course. That's going to really constrain how much time they have to put into a last minute course.\n\n(This all, of course, sets aside the very reasonable question about what you mean by \"bad professor\")",
