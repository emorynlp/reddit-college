  "text": "Does anyone\u2019s school use this? Especially for math class you can\u2019t use rate my prof because they just say it is taught by staff. It is released after a certain date or at the beginning of the quarter. Some of the professors are horrible and some are angels. It\u2019s like you get what you get kind of thing. I think they do this because everyone uses rate my prof so the people who have priority will register for the good professors and then no one will want to take the other classes so they are not full. When you look at the ratings of the professors it is really obvious that they are horrible. \n\nSometimes they will just cover up a bad professor without random selection because they are that bad. Nobody wants to register for their class. Once it is released it\u2019s too late to switch because the other classes are full. \n\nIt\u2019s so bad they have to hide their names. What a shame.",

      "text": "I attended a school in DC sometime ago, initially the engineering school was everything promising in my eyes. In reality, none of my professors spoke adequate English, some were in their first years living in America & well some were just down right horrid teachers.\n\nTeaching is like learning, it should be renewed and freshened every couple of years to make sure all focal points are met concretely. Yes it\u2019s something all college students experience. From Community college to Ivy League. Trust me.",

      "text": "that's really sad they have to hide the fact they have widespread notoriously shitty professors. not to sound like a snoot, but is this school reputable and in your budget means? If not, I'd gtfo if I were you. How can you be successful in your future endeavors if the profs are that bad across the board?",
