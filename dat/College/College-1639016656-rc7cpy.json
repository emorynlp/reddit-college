  "text": "I transferred from a community college to university and found out I still have a few gen ed requirements to take. I want to save some money and take those gen eds at my community college then transfer the credits over to the university. \n\nMy question is that since I already graduated from the community college with an associates will I still get financial aid? especially since I won\u2019t be a full time student there anymore and I also did not add my community college when applying for the fafsa 2021-22 form last year since I assumed I would not be returning. I did however add the community college when applying for the fafsa 2022-23 form. Is there any way I can still get financial aid for spring 2022?\n\nThanks!",
