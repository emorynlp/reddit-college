  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to maintain friends but I think I\u2019m just not entertaining enough of a person to have one. Keep getting blown off. \n\nIt just sucks when there is one person on campus who i think cares about me as a friend. I\u2019m a freshman and I hope along the way I\u2019d make friends, but I\u2019m honestly feeling defeated because all of high school and now college I\u2019ve felt fake friendships and people who pretend to be my friend because they feel bad for me. \n\nI just wish people would be honest. I\u2019m more hurt and humiliated if you pretend to like me.",
