  "text": "I know I'm not going to get a job remotely related to my major (environmental science) when I graduate even though it's what I want to do. I'm a senior with a 3.2 GPA, one non-competitive internship at a nonprofit staffed by volunteers, and no research experience even though I tried for years to get a position, and to make matters worse I'm very shy so not about to make up for it with my networking skills. Honestly, for those of us that aren't at the top of our classes, what are we supposed to even do when we graduate? I feel like I wasted so much money honestly and I'm already depressed since I can see the years of stress ahead. I'd appreciate some advice from anyone who was once in the same place.",

Make sure u tailor your resume to fit the job description, even if you have to highlight volunteer work or classroom learning.  Persistence and endurance will get you there. Don\u2019t give up on your dreams, ever.",

      "text": "Honestly, what I\u2019m seeing is you have a pretty good GPA and an internship under your belt-don\u2019t sell yourself short. The majority of college graduates in the world were not top of their class, and end up doing just fine :). Persistence is key- and, if you need a little bit of a break, it\u2019s okay to go into a \u201cless prestigious\u201d adjacent field, or any job you could gain applicable skills, and come back to it. There\u2019s no one straight path to success, not to be a cliche but it\u2019s all a journey and your experiences will build up and benefit you along the way.",

You first need to work on not viewing yourself as that because you are not low-tier anyway. 3.2 GPA is pretty good and you already have one internship. Some students don\u2019t even have one internship. Stop doubting yourself because you\u2019re just going to create mental road blocks for yourself unconsciously.",
