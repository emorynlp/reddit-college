      "text": "I can\u2019t offer the best advice myself, but I can say that there\u2019s a bit of a gift just in having people to miss at home like that. I\u2019m much closer to my college friends than my family so I pretty much go through the opposite experience going to and from college lol. I know what helps me get through being at home/away from college is just reminding myself of how much of a blessing it is to have people who care about me so much, thinking of how sweet seeing them again will be, and making an effort to keep in touch over text/calls/etc to combat the physical loneliness.\n\nThe more I leave and the more my strategies repeat, the more that being alone feels only temporary and that boredom and loneliness become much more distant threats. Hopefully they can also help you overcome homesickness! :)",
