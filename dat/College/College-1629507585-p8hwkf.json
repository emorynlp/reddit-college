  "text": "Hey guys, I want to know everyone\u2019s opinion on this. Please no rude comments either, I just want your genuine opinion/advice. So, currently I am a 24 year old graduate student studying engineering. I live at home, and my father pays for all of my things- tuition, car, trips, food, bills, and everything else. I worked a little bit in my undergrad but then quit my job to focus on school instead. I\u2019ve never payed a bill, and according to him, I shouldn\u2019t worry about it because school is number one. He claims that he will fund me until I am on my feet working as an engineer. However, after talking to some people, I\u2019m starting to have some doubts. I have had people/friends legit get mad, telling me I am not independent, I will struggle in life, I need to be a real adult and work while doing school like everyone else, ect. My friend told me I should take out loans like her instead of my dad paying for my tuition, because that\u2019s what a real adult does. Personally, I like living at home and not working while doing school but I\u2019m starting to feel really bad and judged over it.\n\nTl;dr some of my peers disapprove that my dad fully funds me while I\u2019m in school, saying that I am too old to be doing this\n\nDo you guys think I am letting people\u2019s comments get to me too much and that I am doing the right thing? Or do you think me and my dad\u2019s mindset is bad? How did all of you deal with finances during school?",

      "text": "Idk bro, people will have different opinions on maybe why they think it\u2019s bad. I agree, have the most fun with the experience before you become an adult because being an adult sucks ass. At 18, I had to start transitioning into that phase to pay for college, worry when payments were due and etc. My buddy had it worse, having to deal with legal problems when it came to his apartment. So it\u2019s just up to you, don\u2019t rush into adulthood, you\u2019ll never get to be a kid again, but at a time, we all need to start making our way towards our own lives or else we (a majority) won\u2019t function properly. You can\u2019t be thrown into the adult world in an instance, with everything, baby steps helps us transition :)",

Keep doing what works for y\u2019all, and just make sure your dad knows how grateful you are and how much his help is appreciated. If other people\u2019s comments bother you that much, just don\u2019t tell others about how your financials are held.

      "text": "I'm in a semi-similar position, although I have thousands of dollars in savings from chapter 35 due to my father's disabilities. And I have to say, your finances and how you live should be none of anyone's business unless you choose to share it. Who cares what someone has to say about how you live your life? A lot of people get help from others in various different ways, nobody ever seems to talk about the advantages middle class students have over lower class students. I've seen students driving Porsches, Audi RS models, Maseratis and blowing their allowances on luxury goods and I'm like who gives a damn as long as they're a good student and not cheating their way through college?\n\nPeople are bitter and you're just going to have to ignore them. People have this idea that you have to struggle financially to know how good you have it and to mature in life and get through college, but that's kind of bullshit. It's like everyone learns that shit from TV shows and movies and assumes that anyone privileged is an entitled, spoiled brat. And, sad but true, it wasn't too long ago that most of the people going to college were already well-off.\n\n> My friend told me I should take out loans like her instead of my dad paying for my tuition, because that\u2019s what a real adult does.\n\nThis made me laugh. That's what a clueless and desperate student does. Lots of people have to because they have no other choice. I took some out because I'm not gonna burden my parents with that shit. But if you have the means, why should you do that? Put yourself into thousands of dollars of debt for years so you can be bitter, living from paycheck to paycheck because you think it builds character? Give me a break.",

I learned to just not mention how much I got in financial aid.\n\nI promise you if your friends had a parent that was willing to pay for everything until you stood on your own they wouldnt be taking out loans. Do not ever take out loans you dont need. Just make sure when the day comes when you graduate and have a job, start paying for your own stuff. Right now it makes sense because you are focusing on school but once you have a job, paying for your own stuff helps you mature financially and not take money for granted.",

BUT.. this is after college btw, not during cause that'd be stupid. I had financial aid cover my 2 yrs at my CC so I graduated with $0 debt and I enjoyed the experience. So because financial aid paid for my classes/tuition, does that mean I'm not independent?? NO, no it doesn't lol \ud83d\ude05 you're fine, just keep on living & learning!",

Everyone also hates seeing the previous generation\u2019s hustle, grind, and generational wealth in action.\n\nWe can literally talk endlessly about the causes of certain societal disparities and other bullshit. What matters in your case is the reality of the situation.\n\nDon\u2019t use the opportunities you have just because others don\u2019t have them. Are you a good person for donating time or money to a homeless shelter? Of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean you forfeit your own house because someone else doesn\u2019t have one.\n\nThe people you\u2019ve talked to in the past are envious, plain and simple. Like everyone else is saying, enjoy the free ride while it lasts; **just be prepared for it to stop sooner or later.** For your own sake that means preparing yourself for the inevitability of personal, social, and financial independence once you\u2019re on your feet as your father promised.\n\nOne last caveat as my own personal opinion: please do this for your own kids too. A friend of mine is extremely resentful toward his own father who is extremely well off because *his* college was paid for, meanwhile he insists his son pay for it on his lonesome out of a lame \u201ccharacter building\u201d excuse.

The logic is that, if you don\u2019t have to worry about these, then your full focus can be on completing school. Of course a lot of my people make below American minimum wage so they qualify for financial aid. The kids get their classes fully paid while getting free room and board at home and food. For those with money and don\u2019t qualify, their parents pay for their tuition until the young adult  is able to work. \nYou just work hard and do your best for you and your dad. When you feel like quitting or not giving your best, just think of your dad\u2019s sacrifice for you and keep tugging along. As some have already said here, keep that info to yourself since some folks can be jerks about it and for those who pry then judge you after, ignore their opinions.

It\u2019s hard for me to explain how exactly these conversations formed without verbally saying it to you, but basically I got comfortable with some of my very close friends so I shared and they would share their finances and beliefs with me as well. These friends had low paying jobs with a ton of student debt so obviously there were disagreements \n\nAs for the internship, it paid me $25 an hour. So it was decent pay for just an internship.",

One of my \u201cfriends\u201d (not friends anymore) took out 80k in loans for a theatre degree because they thought they were going to become a movie star with it and make millions. For my birthday, my dad put 70k in my investing account and I got very excited and told everyone at my birthday. Stupid mistake- trust me, I know. As you can see where this is going, a lot of tensions arose from the friendship because of different beliefs and lifestyles. But we were best friends, so we told each other everything and I kind of regret telling them about my finances now. I also kind of believe that with how their life turned out they changed as a person and became bitter after graduation. Oh well.",

So I would consider working while studying so you learn to balance multiple things at once. It is also very important to learn the value of money. My brothers ex girlfriend is in almost the exact same situation and once she moved out on her own and was forced to start paying for things her life started to crumble around her because she had 1) no coping skills because she was handed everything her whole life and 2) no understanding of how expensive life is. She is now under extreme mental duress because of these things. \n\nMost people would kill to be in the situation you are in so talking about it comes off somewhat condescending and a little bit inappropriate in context to most college students situation. Knowing that you don't pay for anything can bring up feelings of jealousy because why should one person have to deal with loans well into their adult life when you don't ever have to deal with that. It is very much a privilege not to deal with student loans and acting like it's a casual thing is kind of insensitive.\n\nLastly if I was in your shoes I would feel massive pressure from myself to put my degree to use especially if that degree came from someone else's pocket. I would consider getting a job and paying for as much as you can because if for some reason you don't end up in a field where you use your degree you will likely feel massivly guilty because someone spent a very large amount of money on something you arnt even using.",

Just realize how truly lucky you are - it is a huge struggle for some of us to attend university because we're supporting ourselves. \n\nMy funding comes through the Chapter 35 DEA benefits - I get a bit of money every month I'm enrolled because my dad passed away when I was 18 as a result of military service. Using that and my boyfriend's job, we are able to make it, but barely. We live together and must engage every situation frugally. With my dad being gone, and my mom not making enough to help, it is up to me to make it through. Without the military benefits, I would not be able to go to university. I'd rather my dad was alive, but I'm thankful for the opportunity. \n\nThank your dad and succeed when you graduate! Do well for yourself and those around you. Always be grateful.",

In fact, I don't think you ever will struggle with anything because it's all being handed to you. By the time dad stops paying your bills, you'll have enough money to pay someone to do anything you haven't learned how to do for you. You'll probably end up with a warped view of how the world works and vote accordingly, all while claiming that you got to where you are with nothing but hard work and your own sweat, when in reality, you couldn't have done it without daddy's money.\n\nHaving said that, I don't think anyone would turn down the help and free money if it was available to them either.

Your father is working hard to pay for your college because he cares about your future. Don't let your peers turn this into a negative thing. Appreciate it, but don't flaunt it either. The friends from college I still have are the ones who are/were financially struggling but didn't give me shit either when they heard my college was being paid for.

I'm not saying this is what you are doing , I'm just saying that most of the time I see students who are getting full rides, they are 27 still getting their bachelor's degree, and are not super diligent.  I think many people, students included, notice this behavior as more common than not.\n\n I don't know why people know or are asking about this stuff to you though.  I might consider that you might be giving off a 'vibe' about something, which is why people are inspired to ask.  Also, as with most twenties people these days, way too much over sharing.  Stop talking so much, start filtering what you say.

      "text": "I understand what you\u2019re going through. All through undergrad, my parents supported me. When I went home some weekends, I\u2019d help by working at their restaurant. Now in grad school, I have an assistantship, but the stipend doesn\u2019t pay like a full time job, obviously. What my stipend doesn\u2019t pay for, in terms of my bills, apartment, daily expenses, and fun things (concerts, going out to eat, traveling, etc) then my parents cover it. I live comfortably and have never felt like I couldn\u2019t do fun things because of my financial situation. And I am very lucky for that.\n\nSo while it\u2019s not exactly the same situation, I kind of get what you mean. I understand and appreciate the privilege of having my parents as my security blanket. And, like you, other than my assistantship job, my only real responsibility is school. When I go home, I work my ass off at my parents\u2019 restaurant, the restaurant I grew up in. My parents don\u2019t pay me, not that I would ever accept. I think you\u2019re letting other people\u2019s comments get to you. \n\nFor my situation, it\u2019s very common and natural for Asian parents to support the child until they\u2019re into their career. I held 3 part time jobs at one time before COVID, just little odd jobs, because I wanted to and some of the jobs sounded fun so I wanted to give it a try. It was never out of necessity. \n\nIn situations like this, I think it\u2019s best to just appreciate what you have, but with the personal questions, don\u2019t try to humble brag. Recognize that you\u2019re in a blessed position and you deeply appreciate what things are just given to you when others have to work very hard for. \n\nAlso, DO NOT take out loans if you don\u2019t have to. I think that was spoken out of jealousy. Due to scholarships and assistantships through college and grad school, many people are surprised and in awe that I\u2019ve never had to take out loans. This is a good thing. Do not let that person tell you otherwise.",

I could understand if you lived in an apartment and needed help while getting through school, but if you\u2019re at home I think you could stand to pay for something even if it\u2019s minuscule to get used to it. It\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t have responsibility, but in time once school is done I\u2019m assuming he\u2019ll hand things back to you and it\u2019ll be like a 0-100 move. But that\u2019s just my two cents because I too live with a roommate who\u2019s father pays for virtually everything yet she still finds things to complain about whereas I pay for everything and work full time and just do not get how she can find time to complain when she legit has nothing to worry about.",

I feel quite blessed to have had that opportunity to focus solely on my studies. If I ever become a parent and am able, I would like to extend the sake possibility to my children because I think they shouldn't have to stress about things like that when they are studying for their career degree.\n\n The downside to having that luxury is that I feel that I was unbelievably unprepared for reality once I got divorced (for unrelated reasons). I had no useful work history and scrambled to find a job that paid minimum wage. I got lucky because Covid came around and I qualified for the pandemic unemployment, but without that I would have been struggling at the time. I ended up scoring a decently paying job that pretty much only hired me because they were desperate and I had a degree. I had no working knowledge of how to be an adult other than eat and work. I still don't know how taxes work and I have no clue how to budget. Now that I'm in my masters program, I have no clue how to balance school and work. If I could go back I'd definitely educate myself on the reality of finances and the such, as well as get a part time job so that I under that work-school-life balance better.\n\nStarted rambling a bit there. I empathize with your situation, but definitely educate yourself on how the real world works before you're just suddenly out there without a clue like me.",

The way to do this is to learn some boundary phrases - \"Oh, don't really like going into detail about my finances and such. Anyway, *redirect to new topic*\". If it's known you live at home, you can mention you're fortunate to be able to, but you don't have to give info about your family dynamic or how that relates to your finances at all. \n\nMost students should know those details aren't really their business. I'm a senior in undergrad and even after 2-3 years I know better than to ask my closest friends how much financial aid they get, how in debt they're gonna be, if their parents are paying, etc. I've picked up on some of the info over the years, but still just have a vague understanding of their situations. And that's okay because it's literally none of my business. \n\nAs for the independent/dependent conversation. Maybe just always be open to doing chores, helping with errands, etc. \n\nYou are avoiding the cost of renting, so be appreciative. Acknowledge that others may have more difficult financial situations, and consider paying it forward in the future if you can in some way. Celebrate now your good fortune and make the most of it.",

      "text": "Taking out loans instead of your dad paying is a stupid idea.  It comes from people being frustrated with the system and thinking that if they have to suffer so should you.  Not having debt will be freeing as an adult, and we should be trying to find a way to help more people do that.  My parents paid for my tuition and I never needed to take out a loan.  Some of my friends have expressed jealousy over that fact, but none of them blame me for taking it. \n\nBut, there are benefits to having work experience even if it isn\u2019t related to your chosen field.  It helps you shake the dust off and learn how to act professionally in an employee/employer relationship.  Maybe you got enough of that while an undergrad, and you\u2019ve got some specialized skills now.  I\u2019d grab a summer internship if you find one that\u2019s a decent fit. \n\nI will say that I\u2019ve known people who never held a job until after graduating.  They struggled to find work at all.  Not because they didn\u2019t have skills, but because the whole employment process was so new they didn\u2019t know how to navigate it.",

A couple of my friends always kinda make fun of me for \"living off of daddy's money\", while they fully support themselves financially.  I am by no means living extravagantly, and pay for anything extra (fun things like theme park tickets, new laptop, PC parts, etc) with my own money from previous part time jobs/internships.  I always tell people that make fun of me that this is my dad's decision, and always has been.  My dad has been able to build up a college fund for me since I was very young, and wanted me to not stress about finances while I was in college.  At first I felt guilty about this, but I've come to realize there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nBasically, if your dad is doing this willingly, there is zero problem with it.  There is nothing wrong with being financially dependent on parents until you graduate and get a full time job.  Enjoy grad school, enjoy life, and enjoy not having the stress of paying for things!  \n\nBest wishes!\n\nEdit: Also, I'm sure you already are grateful, but don't forget to thank your dad!  I can never say thank you enough to my dad!",

Like, get a loan, to fund your education. Come on that's not so smart, like after finishing education you got a liability to pay for at least a couple of years (well depending on the terms though) that for me is not financially smart. Your Dad is ok my dude, he knows that he still has a responsibility to assist you to be on the right path. Yes, you might feel a bit embarrassed about it, but that's how he expresses his love for you as their child. So my advice for you, make sure you get that degree and the best job position. For you to show how thankful for an awesome parent you have.  \n\n\nBut maybe a little advice is maybe to get smart in terms of financial topics if you have the spare time. Just to be a bit more ready when you start out in life out of education.",

I do fear I might end up in a bad financial situation due to lack of budget knowledge and I definitely don\u2019t want that to happen. Currently I make 18k a year so I\u2019d like to somehow break that into investing and the other things I buy",

Theres a bunch of templates online and probably offered by your uni if you want a spreadsheet or Notion database or smthn\n\nI'm guessing you won't actually be spending *your* money on these expenses so you can just apply the budget to what your dad gives you and continue to invest/save the rest",

      "text": "So with you getting everything paid for, having a roof over your head for free, probably get your food cooked for you too, not having even a part time job, you should literally have no worries in life, but school.\n\nWith that, I doubt many women or men find this attractive because you aren't being independent meaning you have to have someone else take care of you, so why would they think you could take care of them? I'm not trying to be judgmental, but this is how I am thinking of it.\n\nBecause you only have one priority, I would say you should be absolutely dominating your classes with outstanding grades and possibly even taking on extracurricular activities. If you aren't, then compare yourself to your friend who has student loans, paying for rent, paying for her own meals, etc., and she is somehow carrying this 3.0 GPA....Well, that's a lot better than you having everything taken care of and you getting a 3.7 GPA.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, she will be able to succeed with pressure on her. She knows this because she is doing it right now and her grades are the proof. That is what employers, peers, and subordinates want to see.\n\nOf course, you could say you did the same stuff as she did (paid for your own bills, took care of yourself, etc.), but I think it would show when you did get the job, or you did start trying to date while working 40 hours a week, and you start breaking down.\n\nYou're in your developmental years where you learn how to be an adult and how to adjust to this thing we call life. Sure you may have it easier now, but there's a reason why so many parents don't coddle their child as soon as they hit 18 or graduate high school. It isn't bad parenting. It is learning how to live on your own.\n\nI worked since I was 16 and before I graduated high school I had 3 jobs. Dropped everything and joined the military. Now have certifications, 90% done with a degree (3.8 GPA), while working on two other degrees, and work a 24/7 job as a soldier.\n\nMy father threatened to kick me out of his house if I didn't get a job at 16. By 17, I was driving and paying rent. As a kid, I was given chores and was paid for it. (a bag of leaves was $1 and in the fall I hustled. Made a good $20/day working from 6am to 8pm)\n\nMy point is, could I have been where I am doing as much as I am right now if my father didn't raise me how he did? Absolutely not. No way. I've gotten more ambitious as the years passed by and am now coming up on my 22nd birthday. I hope to have a PhD before 30 and am making beyond 125k supporting a wife that I married early this year and a child that I plan on having next year.\n\nWhat you have right now isn't luck at all. I would in fact call it a sabotage because you aren't learning anything different than when you were a child/teenager. Your dad could ride this out until the day he dies, then you inherit everything he has including the house. Possibly might not even need to work. Is this luck? Is that the dream life everyone wants? The simplest road a person can take would be that. That's not at all what I would want especially if I were to have kids. My kids would learn the exact same thing as I learned from my father weather that be your dad or my dad.\n\nNext thing I know, my own kid is getting picked on and he hates me because I don't want him to work or be independent. Than with you as a father, how would you even educate him? You would just teach him what your father taught you because that is what we do as a generation. We just pass knowledge down.",

Yes, I have a high gpa and an engineering internship along with research, but I do not care to compare my gpa or extracurriculars with others. \n\nAnother thing- I am not trying to attract anyone and currently I do not care about dating, which is something you brought up. Solely, I am trying to do what\u2019s best for me. Yes, I do have an inheritance but I do not want to even think about my father\u2019s death. \n\nYou\u2019re making it sound like I don\u2019t want to work in the 10th? paragraph- the point of getting an electrical engineering degree is so that I can get a job and work. I\u2019m not sure why you assume I wouldn\u2019t want to work. I think you have a point of learning things, and for context I make 18k a year plus I have my tuition fully funded by grants. I live in California. I am applying for another grant that I hopefully get, but assuming I don\u2019t get it and I just have 18k a year, what do you think I should do with that money? Dad wants me to stick all of it in my investing account, it sounds like you might have a different idea.\n\nAlso, congratulations on your military endeavors. I\u2019ve always wanted to serve but was permanently disqualified due to a medical condition",

Not my intention at all and was just speaking my mind.\n\nI often compare myself with others because that kind of gauges me where I should be (below average, average, above average). Doesn't mean I should be doing that though, but it is another perspective to see from which is always nice to consider.\n\nI didn't say you were into dating, but it is one of the many accomplishments a normal person has in life so I just factored it in. \n\nI assume you wouldn't want to work because you haven't worked yet. You stated you work briefly, but then quit. Your father didn't force you to make that choice. You made that choice on your own. The fact you did quit told me you don't want to work. You father just telling you to quit is more of an influence. Just like how my father told me if I didn't work, I would get kicked out. He didn't force me to get a job. He just influenced me in a specific direction.\n\n18k a year isn't terrible, but you have to consider that you are living in one of the most expensive states. The last thing I want to do is tell you what to do with your own money. I'm no good at giving advice to people especially when I still have a lot to learn myself. All I do is speak my mind and it is up to whoever it is directed towards how they want to take it.\n\nMy military accomplishments isn't special to anyone, but me. Thank you for the recognition, but it really isn't necessary. I merely stated it to make a point. That point being nothing in life is impossible. However, a large part of what makes things possible is how you grow up and what you learn along the way.",

I don\u2019t regret it though, because I loved my job and made some amazing friends.\n\nCalifornia is expensive, so realistically there\u2019s no way I can fund everything with 18k. With how much you worked and military experience, I would assume you know a thing or two about finances. As some people are suggesting, I could start out small and pay of small bills with my 18k.",

I know a few people who could care less about the money and more about the environment they spend half of their day in.\n\n18k is definitely not a live able salary. You'd probably make it to 6 months (in cali) if you are lucky enough before you moved back in with your dad so I wouldn't suggest that unless you got a job. You're kind of in a pickle because you can't really financially support yourself now that you've been living off your dad for some time and you don't really have any real world experience. What I would do is invest, but in a different way. First, max out your IRA (6k/yr) and try to keep that up from here on out until you retire. After you maxed that out for the year, I'd set up a emergency fund for you. Traditionally, you do this first, but you have your dad to fall back on plus how many accidents can happen to you if you don't have any bills or anything you know? Your emergency fund should be like a good 5k that you can build on whenever you move out and in the case of a disaster, you have it there. I would put this in a investment account like betterment. They keep it for you, but keep it in the stock market. In the need of emergencies, it will be there. However, if you don't need it, it will just continue to grow. So at this point, you gotten rid of 11k. I would buy a cheap car than. Budget should be no more than 2k. Get a good nice little car that will be good on gas. The older, the better is how I see it because it would be cheaper insurance. Nothing older than 2000 though or else you'd be making repairs on it constantly. Also depends on make and model though.\n\nSo....You got a car, you have your IRA funded, you have an emergency fund setup to fall back on if your dad can't help or if all of a sudden he kicks you out, and you still have like 5k. You could spread this around in different investment accounts, could buy yourself something, possibly save it for a down payment on a very cheap house, really its up to you at that point.",

In these places it is extremely abnormal for students to have jobs.  Not only are they incredibly successful, well educated, happy, and not-exhausted, but their countries are doing much better.\n\n*I assumed you were American given that we have this notorious problem and attitude here, so forgive me if you are not.\n\n** I am also aware that it is technically possible to get through college without loans and exhaustion alone via scholarships and financial aid.

Even though there\u2019s not really anything wrong with your parents paying your way (although you should be building credit in your name and building up actual work experience), it will make people angry that they don\u2019t have it as easy as you do in life. \n\nI have a very close friend who was like you when we were in college. She had never worked a day in her life at age 21. Anything she wanted at all, her parents paid for for her, even if it was $10. Meanwhile, I was working three jobs and in school full time. Yeah, it fucking sucked to have to go through all of that and pinch every penny and have to constantly see her just using her parent\u2019s credit card to pay for anything at all she wanted. I love her to death, but it\u2019s just not a nice thing to have to experience when you are struggling yourself. Worrying constantly about money can really fuck up your mental health. \n\nMy advice is this: do not mention anything about your finances to your friends, and don\u2019t act like you understand the financial problems that they have to face. You are very very very privileged. If your friends are complaining about bills or rent or loans, just be quiet. Also, start building credit in your own name. The comments that you are not independent are accurate. You should consider taking some steps to at least experience a little bit of independence from your dad.

Getting experience paying your own bills, keeping a job, taking care of yourself - these are all things that you have to learn eventually. Your dad fully funding you *is* taking away that experience from you. What happens when you graduate and are fully on your own? Are you going to be prepared? What are you doing now to ensure that you are? You\u2019re going to be taking on a full-time job, your own bills, and your own housing all at once. \n\nThe comment about taking out loans and paying your own way is a bit extreme. You should not take on debt when it\u2019s not necessary. But it is smart to look at what lines of credit you have open and how you are building your credit score (if you are in the US) so that you can qualify for big items in the future, I. E.

Credit score takes time to build so starting now will make it so you have a good credit score when you\u2019re buying a house or something in the future. Also, credit is NOT money so do not treat it as such. If you don\u2019t have the cash you don\u2019t buy stuff unless we\u2019re talking mortgage and big stuff you pay over time. Get a credit card, put a recurring monthly charge on it like phone bill and let it sit for a week or two so it registers then pay it off before the end of the month. Missed payments harm your score so avoid them.",

If you don\u2019t experience those mistakes you can\u2019t learn. It\u2019s always good to have support to prevent them, especially destructive ones, but things like not budgeting your money, your time, forgetting to turn the AC off when you leave to save electricity, forgetting to go grocery shopping, learning to pay your taxes, remembering to make your credit card payment, all these little things get perfected through trial and error. If you don\u2019t experience them you won\u2019t learn, and frankly imo, the sooner you learn the better. The real world is harsh and there will not always be people to hold your hand, so the ones who learn to walk through it themselves earlier will always have a leg up on the competition. At age 24, not paying any bills, it is not likely you have built up much of a credit score or credit history whatsoever. What happens in a few years when you want to get a mortgage? The people who have been on there own paying bills with better credit are going to be approved for more, make higher offers, get the house you want to get, etc. \n\nI don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m talking down to you at all, I\u2019m younger than you (22) and also a grad student, but I\u2019m reading some of these comments on here and want to make sure that you have at-least one person (a few others have produced meaningful and beneficial advice as well) that will tell it to you straight. You should want more responsibility, more independence, more experiences and more growth, so you\u2019re best prepared to tackle the world on your own when the time truly comes.",

Consider all possibilities and try to gameplan for them. What if you meet someone, want to start a family and need to buy a larger house? What if that someone has average or below average credit, and when you marry, your combined credit scores are in that range? Then the same situation can apply, you want to purchase a house and start a family but the lack of credit can hold you back. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to get started early, to understand what your goals are and what you want to do, and consider all obstacles and potential threats and do whatever is within your means to minimize them.\n\nAs for your \u201cfriends\u201d, you should view them as whatever they are to you. If they\u2019re emotional support, view them as emotional support, and *not* anything more. If they\u2019re people you can trust and view as financial advice, view them as such.

You don\u2019t owe anyone a full infomercial about yours family\u2019s income/ social class etc. As for your friend telling you you need to be more independent, I wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone outside of your family regarding personal financial advice. For starters advising someone to take out unnecessary loans for no reason is absolutely horrible advice and can cause tremendous damage to yourself finically in the future. The bottom line is your friends won\u2019t be affected by your financial decisions so they won\u2019t suffer from their bad financial advise the same way you will.  Therefore they are more likely to be jealous/give bad advice because they aren\u2019t benefiting at all and don\u2019t feel as important. You sound like your an educated person so I would continue to use your own judgement as well as educate yourself more about personal finances, it\u2019s never to early to practice budgeting  as well even if you aren\u2019t totally affected by your expenses.",

Some people might be genuinely concerned but it sounds like their comments are coming from a place of jealousy. The support you\u2019re receiving from your father offers you a chance to still take the initiative to gain some skills on your own but the difference is that you actively have to learn, like start getting an idea of finance and things like that.

Graduate school funding is very different to undergrad. Having a full ride scholarship as an undergrad is *nice*. Having a full scholarship plus living expenses plus academic allowances as a graduate student is practically a requirement, and those research grants are hugely competitive. People who don\u2019t get funding generally don\u2019t get to do a PhD. That career path is shut off to them, possibly **forever**. \n\nSo to be so blas\u00e9 about funding and to just throw around the fact that you have no uncertainty in funding and, in fact, don\u2019t even need the grant because your dad is going to pay for everything, is hugely, massively insensitive. You can\u2019t flash your cash like that around people who are financially holding on by a string and seriously expect them to be *happy* for you. \n\nYou\u2019re rubbing their misfortune in their faces by offering up this information when it\u2019s absolutely not required. You\u2019re being a bit too open with your financial privileges. If you have money, the polite thing to do is to keep quiet about it. You\u2019ve been breaking that unspoken social rule... a lot.",

Do you realize how incredibly lucky you are?\n\nUnless you're like from old money and have lived in rich communities all of your life, I think it's not hard to realize this. My parents are pretty upper middle class and are willing to help with anything. But my dad grew up dirt poor, most of his family is still dirt poor, and my mom grew up in a house of narcissists. Never did I feel like my privileges were just normal and that all people live like this. It gets annoying to be reminded of how privileged you are when you already know, like what do you want me to do? Empathy and perspective goes a long way, but if someone have a problem with me for how I grew up and live then I don't know what else to say other than get over it.",

And it's your choice to mention these things that make it seem like you're punching down.\n\nIf you want to feel better you could take out loans and if you actually know about investing know that you could beat the low interest rates so throw it in there. This way you can claim you also have student debt but it's a white lie in a sense since you actually have the whole amount in your investing.

You CAN do this, as you said you did, for fun, for experience, for connection, but you don\u2019t HAVE to. You won\u2019t die if you don\u2019t. Your friends will. They have to work to sustain themselves, like most people. They have practice at this. They are likely worried that you won\u2019t have enough practice with working and thus won\u2019t do well being an employee and that you won\u2019t want to because you have someone to fall back on. \n\nIt sounds like your family has a decent amount of money and your friend\u2019s families don\u2019t. This is not your fault or theirs, but it is incredibly tone deaf to go around telling you friends that money doesn\u2019t rule your life, when most of your friends will be in at LEAST college debt for an average of a decade. Money rules their lives because they don\u2019t have the luxuries you do, and it can be very hurtful to tell them things like this, even from a kind/neutral place. It points out a lot of inequity within higher education when they just want to see you as their friend.",

          "text": "Thanks for the response. You\u2019re right- I don\u2019t HAVE to, so then my question is, why do these people want me to struggle the way they do? Like, why do some people care so much that I\u2019m not working? Currently, I get paid to go to school because of my grants and my teaching assistant job, but instead of paying bills I put all that money into my investing account, but I feel like that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business and I do not owe anyone an explanation. I do not go around telling people my finances anymore, but some people will ask me very nosey questions and because of past responses I am very hesitant to answer.\n\nOne more question for you regarding your comment about not being a good employee, and please be honest and tell me if my thinking is warped/unrealistic. I am studying electrical engineering, and I have this belief that I will land a very high paying job out of school, and because I have no student loan debt and a fat investing account that I will never struggle financially in life. I actually care so much about finances that I don\u2019t ever want a kid because I fear that a child will be in the way of my wealth, and even the thought of being poor gives me anxiety. Do you think that there\u2019s a possibility that my life won\u2019t turn out as wealthy and glamorous as I hope it will, and that some of these people could potentially be right about me struggling?",

              "text": "I appreciate your willingness on this topic; it\u2019s a difficult and uncomfortable one. \n\nFrom the way I see it, majority of working people (Americans in my case) are told that having a job makes good character. This is false in a lot of ways, because a person is not a job, but it\u2019s also true. There are parts of work that you will never want to do, but you will be forced. Your friends want you to practice at this so it\u2019s not harder later. The more used to being used as an employee (overworked on salary, not getting benefits, doing other people\u2019s jobs, etc.), the less painful it will be when it happens. Rip the bandaid off, right? \n\nIt\u2019s good that you have worked on sharing your financial status and keep it up with the uncomfortable honesty. \n\nI commend you for not wanting to have a child in poverty, but the way you right this may sound to some that a poor childhood is no childhood to be had, when this isn\u2019t the case. Nonetheless, I understand where you\u2019re coming from: I have ALWAYS been poor. I hope I won\u2019t be because I am working to change my place in the world, but a lot of privilege helps this. Please correct me if I am factually wrong here, but I believe you need to acknowledge that you have always had money, and that money breeds money. If you have a life changing event, ex: your kid needs insulin, you won\u2019t struggle to get that. You will likely have good health insurance, potentially from you job. Your friends will, and they may not be saying you\u2019ll struggle FINANCIALLY in life, but personally. You may be losing relatability with your peers. It sounds like you\u2019re riding out your childhood as long as you can (happens in poor families too). The thing you can\u2019t have truly realized is the beauty of being independent, but I hope once you do, you won\u2019t be able to get enough of it. \n\nThere is insecurity in self-reliance, but there is also power. Try and see things from your friends perspectives.",

I did a sports bar job and it was nothing in comparison to what some of my peers had to do.\n\nTo clarify the conversation, the exact comment was \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever able to live on your own or budget because you\u2019ve never had to\u201d. Obviously I was offended and didn\u2019t know what to think. Now, I am not friends with this person anymore for a lot of reasons but that\u2019s a different story. Back to the topic- I completely agree with losing relatability. And I started noticing this once I graduated from my undergrad. A lot of my classmates seem unhappy and stressed, and  for me I am having a very fun time and genuinely love what I study. I asked someone about how people are enjoying graduate school if they have to work and worry about bills, to which the person replied \u201cgrad school isn\u2019t for fun. All I did was work\u201d. And yes, I do work extremely hard in my studies, but I feel a complete disconnect with my peers. I honestly kind of wish I went to the private university close to me because I could have related more to the people there.\n\nYour comment about me not having to worry about medical bills really relieves me, because from some of the comments I have gotten and seeing how some of my peers struggle worried me that I might hit a financial rut later in life. I would like to be independent, but right now I only make 18k a year and have to do my school full time so it\u2019s very difficult",

You should know how expensive your lifestyle is because what if you can\u2019t attain it when you get a job? Are you okay with your dad supporting you forever because he built you to have this lifestyle? Engineers make good money but depending on the spending you have it may not be enough. \n\nI\u2019ve had friends like you and I\u2019ve been your friend, I\u2019ve never told them my feelings like your friend did but my friendships never lasted. My privileged friends never understood why I couldn\u2019t go on an expensive trip, why I had to drive instead of fly, why I couldn\u2019t go out for drinks for a night because I was close to my budget. They would get mad at me for not doing these things. It was frustrating that they couldn\u2019t understand not everyone had the money they did and in the end it just wasn\u2019t worth being friends with someone that couldn\u2019t try to understand my financial situation when it came to not being able to do certain things. I hope you aren\u2019t like this with your friend. Being friends with someone who is privileged is hard, because you\u2019re constantly trying to not be jealous. But when that friend is also almost flaunting that they have money and you don\u2019t it just hurts.",

I cut them out, for a lot of reasons. Long story short, they became extremely mean and critical. Finances aside, they would trash talk everyone and everything, and some of the things they said about others were extremely inappropriate. They would make fun of others' careers, appearances, etc. I cannot elaborate because I need to keep my identity hidden, but I have a theory that in college they had very high hopes to be successful, and when that did not happen and they had to start paying loans with their low paying jobs, reality hit and they became bitter. Neither of them got the jobs they thought they would get. One of them would say very passive aggressive things to me about studying engineering (they have an arts degree), my career path, and my lifestyle. I think both of us had very different viewpoints and we both had underlying tensions due to different lifestyles.",

Going into financial debt for no reason is reckless and sounds like the advice a person badly in financial debt would give. It\u2019s ridiculous and irresponsible to take loans out and get your own place rather than doing what saves the most money and causes the least amount of difficulties for you in the future.",

If you make the argument that you want to stay home and let dad pay to save money and reduce/eliminate debt, then the \u201cbut can I also have an apartment\u201d addition undercuts that argument. That would only seem sensible to me if his dad lived far from where he was going to college, or it was just far more convenient to be in an apartment to the point that dad insisted on it. I would feel those scenarios justify it.",
