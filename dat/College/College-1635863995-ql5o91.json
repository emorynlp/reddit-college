  "text": "I'm a senior in HS and I have a 4.0 weighed GPA, I'm good at every subject and I'm well rounded. My favorite subjects are english and biology. I want to enter the medical field but I hate the amount of schooling. I like law but I want to work hands on. I like engineering but physics and math arent my strong suit. I just feel like I need recommendations for my degree/career path.",
