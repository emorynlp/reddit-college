  "text": "I failed my first two tests miserably(48% and 45%)in one of the most difficult classes I\u2019ve ever taken. I took my third and got an 82%. We have three more. I honestly don\u2019t know whether I can pull a higher grade than the 82% as I was sure I had aced it. I don\u2019t have any other assignments to raise my grade. I\u2019m a senior this year and I\u2019m actually supposed to graduate this semester. I don\u2019t know what to do if I can\u2019t pass this class. It\u2019s literally the only one left that I\u2019m struggling with(except my senior project).",

The questions I missed on the last test were not his definitions and he wanted me to provide more info despite not asking for it in the question. It\u2019s like you have to read his mind in order to get an A. Also\u2026some of the info he provides is dated. So you can\u2019t go off new stuff.
