  "title:": "Would a professor accuse a student of cheating for this?",
  "text": "I have a class where there are lots of online quizzes. I did good on most of them (perfect score) but on the last few I did bad on them. These weren\u2019t on lecture content but they were based on papers and activities we had to refer to and answer questions. \n\nFor this I\u2019m just stressed that the professor or TA will see that I got so many straight 100s from the beginning and then just got a few bad scores in a row. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m just wayyy overthinking this but I\u2019m still very stressed out. I get anxious about this kind of stuff often and meet regularly with a therapist about it.\n\nDoes this look weird? Would a professor accuse a student of academic dishonesty for this or am I just being completely paranoid?",

A lot of tests, whether standardized, finals, benchmarks, etc., you can guarantee that there is a high chance that teachers and professors will throw in deductions (also known as a grading curve) in order to regulate percentage of those who passed and failed exams in the past or present to avoid any suspicion that students are cheating in a way. \n\nOtherwise, either the board of educators or institutions themselves would do \"The Rock Eyebrow Raise\" and say that the school or college is just giving students a \"free pass\".",

Even if your prof does grade your quizzes themself (versus the computer doing it), they aren\u2019t going to be thinking you were once cheating but aren\u2019t now. \n\nThey are real people who know you have other real shit and other classes going on\u2026not to mention when the new wears off and you give less fucks toward the latter part of the semester. \n\nHang in there. Definitely keep going to your therapist. Work on this pattern of thinking, bc I know it is horribly anxiety-inducing. I promise you\u2014it\u2019s not even a thought. You are just fine.",

But it all show itself come exam time when you don't understand the material. Such as in math, code, physica etc; where the answers are usually online. But goodluck doing well on a midterm or exam looking up every answer. Which I still do to make sure what I did was correct, but i figure out the problem on my own at first. I'm very good at memorizing a bunch of information, but that's no good to me at the end of the day. Quizlet and chegg are notorious for having a lot of right answers and so a lot of people fall into the trap of copying it, then trying to understand it later",
