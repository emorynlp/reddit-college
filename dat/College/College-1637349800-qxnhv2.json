  "text": "Hi! First-year here, and honestly, I'm drowning... I'll admit I haven't put my all in this semester as I promised myself. I think I shoved the \"do better, be better\" narrative onto myself that I don't recognize myself anymore. I'm in this never-ending bubble I can't seem to get out of.  I'm also the first in my family to have no setbacks to finishing college, so there's a lot of pressure on me. When I share my feelings, no one tries to understand it's always \"what are you complaining about\" \"you should be happy,\" or \"no, you're just lazy,\" \"you have it made\" I get it. To survive in the US definitely as a POC, you need the capitalistic essentials. I'm just.. not interested in college itself right now, and I hate this constant feeling. I don't want to disappoint my family, but mentally I'm beyond burnt out. I love learning. I feel like it's impossible to escape learning with the times, but I can't help to feel like college... isn't for me. Not to second guess, but maybe it's just a bad semester? Maybe, I need to work smart and not harder? Or maybe, I need to do what makes me happy unapologetically? Outside looking in, I'm on a full-ride, halfway through my general requirements due to taking college classes in high school, and should be thriving. Truthfully, I've rarely felt excited about school. It was never something that motivated me to the highest. I'm afraid that it never will be... My mind is all over the place, and it's quite ironic cause it's possible I may have OCD lol. The masculine urge to drop everything and move to Germany...ugh.\n\nIn all, I'm overly tired, angry, and pissed off about the whole situation. I know I can't be the only one feeling like this but i thought I'd share :)",
