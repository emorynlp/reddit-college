  "text": "I live in a classic triple with communal restrooms. There is **always** someone coughing profusely in the restrooms and hallways (a lot of the times without masks on). We have something called the \u2018frat flu\u2019 going around where people are symptomatic, but do test positive for Covid.\n\nI know I can\u2019t really control much about this situation but do you guys have any tips on avoiding getting sick (flu, cold, Covid, etc.)?\n\nHere are somethings I am/planning on doing:\n\n- Take showers and use the restrooms at low-traffic times\n- Double masking (especially in the 400+ people lectures) and changing masks frequently. \n- Washing hands often and using hand sanitizer.\n- Try to get take out and eat in the dorms (now outside since my roomate is sick).\n- Spend as less time in the dorms as possible.\n-  Sanitize my phone, keyboard, stationary, etc. frequently \n\nNote: I have high-functioning anxiety, so I apologize if I sound a bit intense. I\u2019m also very anxious about this because midterm season is right around the corner.",

Colds go around college dorms like a wildfire lol.  Make sure that you're vaccinated for both covid and the flu, and if you're scared get tested for covid as soon as you can, and ask ur friends to get tested.",

I\u2019m aware that the probability contracting covid here is lower than if we all weren\u2019t vaccinated, but i really want to take extra precautions for not only me, but for my roommates, family (especially my more susceptible family members!), and in general, anyone i come in close contact. \n\nlectures with over 400 students are a bit scary for me and though the lecture is recorded, many students with obvious symptoms still come to class. i am very much considering not going to the lectures, but i have a solid study group where we bond and share chemistry notes and info. i can understand why those with symptoms want to come to class but it\u2019s pretty a lot of people at risk. even my professor let us know before classes started that we should simply not come if we are sick bc the professor himself is older and would not be able to lecture at all if it were to happen.\n\nsorry that this became more of a rant! it\u2019s a bit daunting to be in this pandemic world, especially with midterms coming up!",

      "text": "I recommend spending a bit of time reviewing what scientists have proven regarding Covid-19. Unless you utilize brand new N-95 masks each day, face covering only provide up to 10% effectiveness in stopping the virus and often significantly increase the risk of exposure (due to improper use ... i.e. double masking). Covid-19 does not survive very long on surfaces, so disinfecting surfaces won't help much. Hand sanitizer is also not very effective, but it is better than nothing.\n\nThe only effective ways to avoid falling ill are to maintain a healthy life style and limit your exposure time. That means maintain a healthy weight, get 7-8 hours of sleep nightly, eat a proper diet, and maintain safe social distances from others (or limit how long you are around those who are ill).",
