  "title:": "Does anyone else get discouraged when people who cheat on everything and learn nothing make better grades than those who put the work in?",
  "text": "I know I am furious about it. I used to never care if people cheated, but a classmate made a comment that sent me over the edge. I should mention I am nervous as hell this time of year because I need to maintain my GPA to stay eligible for classes. So I take my grades super seriously lately. \n\nBut there are a few people who blatantly cheat on everything and never learned a single thing all semester except how to say 'no comprendo' to every single question (I'm talking about a Spanish class) and then laugh about it with their group. Those guys also all have A's. \n\nOne guy mentioned to me that he bets I have a high grade if he can get a 90% for the class. I was instantly furious because my average is less than a 80 even though I bend over backwards for that class and need the B to stay in school. \n\nIs it normal for people to get discouraged like that? You freak out over this class yet someone else barely remembers they're in it and they are the one with the better grade. I'm really not sure how to feel or if I should bring it up with the professor. ",

Cheating should still have a punishment but in real life you'll be only mediocre if you can't get smart and figure out things with resources others might not have. If you want to tell the professor go for it, it's their own fault for blabbing.

It was a lot of listening comprehension and vocabulary building.  Basically, you have the vocb of an average 18 month old -2 year old in that language.  \n\n101 level class builds on that.  You start learning to read and write common sight words, vocabulary building and how to properly string those words into sentences.  \n\n102 level classes is where you start reading simple children's books in that language (like cat in the hat in French for example) and easy chapter books.

      "text": "Jesus, this isn't difficult.  The entire premise of \"snitches get stitches\" is horse shit.\n\nI would record them talking about their cheating and their methods and then go and report them.\n\nWhy?\n\nExample:  I remember working for a forensics firm early in my career.  I am a military veteran and I have a high work ethic and know from my training that if I did not operate to the best of my abilities that people could die.  I bring that with me to every job.\n\nI had to work with a guy, we'll call him 'Ruben' who would kiss ass and brown nose his way through the work day.  He was substandard in his work, but boy did he love going to the gym.  He was really great at time management:\n\nWhen to take his supplements, when to eat, when to hit the gym, and what to do at the gym for that day's training.\n\n'Ruben' was promoted to my level. Partly because the upper management loved his pillow talk (they had no boots on the ground) but mostly because he was ineffective at assisting clients, maintaining chain of custody on evidence, not causing spoliation of said evidence, and was just a shit head socially.\n\nAt first, since he was made my problem I would monitor him and then try to mentor him.  As I said, he had great time management skills - only great when they benefited him directly.  I tried to harness those skills to turn him into a bad ass forensic analyst.\n\n3 months in and I was able to prove through reporting and his time sheet that he was doing next to no work. I kept the coaching going and tried to encourage him, however I now babysat him.  Hourly.  He had racked up some hefty charges for the company for mishandling data and not doing the basic things like notifying customers of data was received.  (Note: at this point I think he was stuffing one of the upper management ladies.  I was undeterred as she had made a move on me while working with the RCMP a year prior [she was in my hotel room while I was out to dinner. I took a picture of her when my buddy and I got back. She said she wanted a cigarette, I told her to get out of my room.])\n\nAfter 6 months he was doing only what I assigned him and he was deeply hating me.  He reported up the chain and to HR that I was making work a hostile environment for him.  We had a meeting with myself, HR, and Ruben which also included my manager and the lady from upper mgmt that he was screwing.  I was told to back off.  I was also told that there would be an investigation and that the meeting would reconvene after that was complete.\n\nAs soon as we were back to our area, 'Ruben' turned to me and said \"Yeah, that's right. You don't get to tell me shit anymore. Have fun doing all the work, bitch.\"\n\nI set my phone to record (it was already in my lap) and spun my chair and said \"What did you just say?\"  and the dumbass repeated himself adding \"I have better things to do than the daily bullshit anyway. I can do what I want, just ask (upper mgmt he was screwing). So MERRR!\"\n\nHe always made that stupid sound effect to try and sound funny.  I just said \"Okay, Ruben.\"  Spun around, saved the recording and sent it to my work email and personal email and then saved that off to a hard drive.\n\nTwo weeks later the head of HR came all the way from NY to weigh in. I had brought all of my reporting (my work vs his work - the amount he had already cost the business, the audio, as well as the time entry records for both of us).\n\nI was interviewed alone a final time, and nothing felt better than ratting that sonofabitch out to the head of HR.  I showed her everything, wrote the timeline on the whiteboard for her, and explained in great detail how he was nothing but a slow burn on the business and was having a work affair to boot.\n\nPlaying the audio was icing on the cake.  HR's eyes were so wide I almost laughed out loud.  Almost.\n\nSince this was HR I don't know what else she had, however she did say that there was a specific complain about me (by guess who) of which I shared the RCMP pictures and story and my friend (who no longer worked there) was very willing to talk to her about it.  I was thanked and that was all I heard about it formally.\n\nIn a week, both of them were let go. The faces on them when they were escorted off the property by security were amazing.  And they totally blamed me. \n\nEspecially because of the nasty-grams they both sent me.  Awesome to read.\n\nSo please, if you know someone who is cheating - please rat them out.  You are not here to do someone else's work for them and earn them a grade, or a paycheck, or anything. You are here for you.  If they are cheating the system they are indeed cheating you as well.\n\nThink about it this way - these are the people who are going to be helping to run the country or taking care of their elders when the time comes. Do you want some lazy assholes around forcing YOU to have all the responsibility? \n\nOr do you want people that are going to do their fair share?\n\nRat out cheaters folks.  Don't give someone a free ride you worked hard for.",

That said, it's also possible for some people to breeze through a given class with minimal effort while others work their asses off to earn Cs. The line between that and \"cheating\" is clear though; academic dishonesty is vile and should be penalized harshly when found. Better still, though, to design assessments so students cannot cheat. I don't know how that's done in Spanish, in this case, but it's quite simple to do in humanities classes...real papers and the occasional one-on-one oral exam make it very easy to determine which students actually know the material and which do not. I'd assume the same would be true in language study.",

It may seem that way, and they may get away with dishonesty or laziness sometimes, but life and decisions catch up with you. My specific area of expertise is health-allied majors. There tends to be a comeuppance at some point in a lazy student\u2019s journey. Sometimes it\u2019s after college when they\u2019re coworkers and supervisors know them for what they are.  \n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that cheaters very often lie about their grades- I\u2019ve heard knuckleheads bragging about how well they did on an exam before or after class and I know full well they did horribly. \n\nI\u2019ll also point out that I don\u2019t broadcast what I think of a student or when I know they\u2019re cheating/phoning it in. So to other students it may seem I don\u2019t care. Quite the opposite- behind closed doors and in the gradebook I can make sure things remain fair. But professionalism has to be maintained.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m seeing in other replies that people want to know how these thing bite the cheaters in the ass. The first example that comes to mind is licensure exams. Imagine spending years in college and your gpa looking great but you can\u2019t pass licensure because you didn\u2019t actually learn.

I\u2019ve been through so much and especially in this major you can\u2019t afford to cheat because you\u2019re only cheating yourself. Not only will you end up killing a patient but the information you always comes back to haunt you. You get through one exam but that doesn\u2019t mean you can pass the class. \n\nI will say OP that I wonder if the teacher is part of the reason it\u2019s so easy to cheat. I don\u2019t want to blame her but I also took Spanish class and the people that sucked at the subject still couldn\u2019t rely on cheating to get an *A*. It must be that the course is relatively easy but even people like you can struggle to grasp the content and that\u2019s okay. \n\nYou have a bigger issue than the cheaters and as other people will probably tell you you shouldn\u2019t waste time feeling bad about the cheaters. All you can do is go to you teacher, report the teachers, as you are *ethically* obligated to do (even in my school, students always report cheating because they feel the same way as you. You don\u2019t have to name them by name. Just tell your teacher you have been observing cheating in the class and they\u2019ll take care of the rest), and go to your teachers office hours and tell him or her about your struggle, and get help with changing your study habits.

Kind of ironic that our honor code prohibits professors from proctoring their own exams because the students \u201cshould be trustworthy,\u201d which basically means everyone can cheat. I\u2019ve never cheated on anything - I feel morally wrong thinking about cheating and I\u2019ve known two friends at school who were suspended an entire semester for relatively trivial acts of cheating so I\u2019d never consider doing so for both reasons. Unfortunately, many people at my school aren\u2019t necessarily book-smart but are instead clever when it comes to cheating the system. Test banks are rampant, answer sheets are stolen from professors\u2019 offices and photocopied, and students use methods from writing hints on a Vitamin Water label to flat-out whipping out their phones mid-exam to get the edge. Literally everyone I know has admitted to cheating, and most of them do better in school than me. Just shows that honesty and integrity don\u2019t pay, unfortunately.",

All of the upperclassmen, myself included, can't do a damn thing about it but we all know that person is going to crash and burn in professional school. A good GPA isn't everything, but you know it would be nice if professors who SAW students cheating would actually do something about it. or at least listen to students who tell them that a student was cheating off of them.

      "text": "When I was in college that would have driven me nuts too.  And you have every right to be furious.  A lot of the other comments here are playing the \"it'll bite them in the ass\" or \"you're in college to learn and grades don't matter\".  And in some respects that's true.  A person putting in the work will get more out of the experience.    But college isn't just a learning experience in today's society.  A college degree is the cost of entry into almost any full time job, whether you learned anything or not.  And when you get out of college, your prospective employers will absolutely look at your GPA and request your transcripts.  They will then judge your resume against the very people whom you're so frustrated with.  And before they even call you and talk to you to find out if you know anything, they will put your resume on the bottom of the pile.\n\nThey aren't doing that because they believe that GPA is the be all end all, but because when you're filtering thousands of applicants, you have to filter down somewhere.  And companies rightly-or-wrongly assume that an accredited University will have an honor code and enforce it to filter out cheats.   And so they may hire someone who doesn't know as much as you, but got the same degree, and had a better GPA, which companies are more or less forced to use as a surrogate for capability.   If you're lucky, they'll look at your course by course grades in your transcripts and realize you performed well in those classes, but if your classmates are cheating in general classes, they're probably cheating in major classes too, so they'll still look better on paper.   If you're unlucky, they'll hire them before even interviewing you.  They'll then get the on-the-job training that they need to do the job, and by the time the employer realizes the person is incompetent, they're either trained enough that they find something they can do anyways, or fire them and learn that your University graduates people that don't know anything.\n\nThe academic honor code is what ensures that your degree has value.  If cheating is rampant and obvious, you need to report it.  To your professors.  To your department chair.  To the ethics office.  Anonymously if possible, but with persistence if not.  If you allow the grades that you're judged against to be knowingly diluted with cheating and allow them to unlevel the playing field, you're hurting yourself as surely as they're hurting the integrity of your institution.  It may be hard to report people, particularly if they're friends, but academia is the ultimate situation in which you are judged against your peers, and like it or not, that judgement is predominantly based on grades.  So you really have to decide if their friendship is worth letting them get away with cheating that system.",

Because the cheating ring was so widespread, it meant that their concurrent and previous grades were called into doubt as well, so they retroactively failed every single course they'd ever taken.

It's not likely they would ever be accepted to a law program ever again, plus their GPAs are 0 now.\n\nOur degrees have to mean something, and so any time someone is caught cheating, the automatic punishment is failing every single class that semester with the cheaters' mark.

Karma doesn't *actually* exist and the only ramifications for cheating are going to be imposed by other people when they get caught, either caught in the act or caught out by their lack of knowledge and utter mediocrity. \n\n>There are cheaters that never get caught and therefore thrive.\n\nThat's like saying that there are murderers or thieves who never get caught and therefore murderers and thieves who do not get caught do not get punished in life. Yeah, the mafia boss who doesn't go to jail is gonna thrive. But that doesn't change the fact that you risk getting caught if you engage in that behaviour, that it's socially unacceptable, and that it can have far-reaching negative impacts on the community as a whole.

If they can\u2019t handle their course load and are constantly looking for shortcuts maybe they should go  seek their Professor for good methods to study the class efficiently. They will be able to give the best study hacks for their class after all. Many also lack time management skills which the professors could also help solve with them. If they\u2019re not willing to put in the effort they really shouldn\u2019t be in college and should fine other avenues to get a job or education. After all college isn\u2019t the *only* option, depending on potential career. ",

Try to make these things that you can also do for an exam, i.e. headphones and music may not be a good idea.\n\n - Have everything organized before you start so you're not constantly getting up or changing track. You'll forget what you're doing and then it'll be 3 hours later and you're vacuuming the kitchen. \n\n - Live your life by a to-do list and rough schedule.

Don't set goals too lofty. \n\nYour study hours will seem inflated if you're actually spending very little of it studying.

You could even end up getting your dream job over someone *with* more experience because they would assume you have more people skills because of your language abilities. Just consider it from that perspective",

                          "text": "I get what you\u2019re saying but look at what you said. Connections *and* portfolios both count. However, if you have less on your portfolio, better connections, and bilingual skills, that could put you over someone else, because in this world, it\u2019s who you know, *not* what you know. People want to hire people they can trust and that can do the job, yes, but in many cases they want people that can interact with people from different cultures well, which will lead to a more cohesive workplace and unit, leading to happier and more productive employees. I know especially in art you need a portfolio, so yes continue to work on that. But that doesn\u2019t mean that if a job says they\u2019re looking for a bilingual person or they\u2019re preferred, that you won\u2019t have a shot even if your portfolio is a little lacking because again in any job, people skills are important, and even in visual effects you may be working with others in teams. You won\u2019t be working by yourself. You will be interacting with people from different cultures. They definitely would not hire someone with less language skills than you unless the bilingual requirement was preferred rather than required, but if you\u2019re working for a foreign company that is essential for workplace communication. If you have nothing on your portfolio then yes I agree you probably wouldn\u2019t get the job (but you probably would have other problems then), but that doesn\u2019t mean the other person would because they would have no clue  what\u2019s going on. The job market is extremely competitive. A language can\u2019t be taught in a day so that would give you an edge. A foreign company *needs* someone to be able to reach their target audience in the desired target language to be able to function. \n\nIf you\u2019re up against someone that has a better portfolio *and* language skills, that\u2019s a different case, but if someone has less connections and/or language skills than you, that will be to *your* advantage. You *may* even get the job you want if someone has a more extensive portfolio then you and even connections, but lacks the language skills. What I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t exclusive to STEM. It\u2019s based on other factors too like how well you impress the interviewer with the skills that you *do* have. I\u2019m not saying a portfolio isn\u2019t important but connections and/or people skills trump whatever you have on your portfolio or resume, in any career field. Every company is different and it depends on how willing they are to teach and invest in you. At the end of the day you will have access to more jobs because *you* put in the effort. I can\u2019t necessarily convince you though. \n\nBy the way, learning about the history of Africa isn\u2019t necessarily useless either for visual design. You could get inspiration for your visual art from African culture easily. How do you think artists get inspired even visual artists?",

The classes that won\u2019t help me get that job I\u2019m doing well in, but I\u2019m actually struggling with my major.\nI ironically am doing well for my \u201cget it done mentality\u201d.  I honestly would have took a less practical approach if I did actually care about those classes. \n\nSorry for prolixity but essentially what I\u2019m saying is the reality of college is different. Being efficient is more important than actually learning, and that is to say not to cheat but focusing on the benefits of your Gen ed classes seems impractical. ",

                          "text": "If you\u2019re struggling with your major, I suggest you start going to all your professor\u2019s office hours if you haven\u2019t already. They may not give extras credit but they will tell you how to study for *their* course. I\u2019ll give you an example from my own life. I was behind on watching lectures and studying for this one class. It\u2019s a very hard class too. I went to my professors office hours and told them about how I\u2019m struggling in the class and I\u2019m behind. They told me I was studying the wrong way. I was supposed to jot down the points in the lecture that I didn\u2019t get and then go back to *those* specific points instead of rewatching the entire lecture. When I followed that advice my study speed improved significantly. I was covering material at a faster rate than other peers. Of course my example probably doesn\u2019t apply to you but I\u2019m saying that yes, college is about studying efficiently and yes you may have to dedicate less time for your gen Eds and I don\u2019t disagree with that. I also am going to college for a specific job and I understand the struggle. I too am barely passing my classes. \n\nI\u2019m just saying it doesn\u2019t have to be a battle btw your gen Eds that you\u2019re doing well in and your major classes that you\u2019re struggling in. You may think you\u2019re studying efficiently now but maybe your professor can help you study *more* efficiently and in the right way. If professors are not a good resource, and that\u2019s very possible, you can always ask tutors if your school has them. Another tip that may be useful for you is to study the material within  1-2 days of each lecture or even on the day of the lecture. You will learn it faster that way and your future self will thank you. ",
