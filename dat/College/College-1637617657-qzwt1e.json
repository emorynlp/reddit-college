  "text": "So I'm about to finish an unnecessarily hard weeder course at my school and make a fully searchable study guide that I use on exams. It doesn't have any exact exam questions and is all based on \"legal\" sources that can be used on exams. I'm about to finish the class but have friends that are going to take it after me. Is it considered dishonest if I share my study guides with them when they take the course if I've already completed the course and know what content is tested and what isn't?",

      "text": "Read your school handbook. It should say what they consider dishonest. Personally I don't see it as dishonest but end of the day Im not the professor the dean or the principal and like shit is it pays to read the fine print of the policies and the due process and whether they'd consider it a violation that way you can mount a defense and use as much as you can. Don't feel intimidated by professors deans etc if you need help or think your being ripped off at your school know. At my school they didn't say anything about office hours and didn't make mention of collaboration which really left me picking up all the work wondering why college is like that when in high school the teachers hand me the study guides and I'd get As.",
