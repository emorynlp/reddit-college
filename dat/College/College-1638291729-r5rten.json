  "text": "So my daughter is getting ready to go to college.  She's been accepted and the FAFSA has come out.  The school has sent her a letter showing her anticipated financial aid and what is left over to be paid.  That amount is $15k.  My wife and I are not in a position to help her financially as I am still paying off my loans from college.  You see, my wife had our daughter young and we are still basically starting out.  I'm curious - where do others go to get loans to cover this gap?  TIA!!",

      "text": "I'm afraid I can't offer specifics, but if she's accepted then she should have full access to student resources. When you have time, Google the student resource offices of the university (like student business services, student financial aid offices, etc). I'm forgetting exactly what the services are, but I know for sure there's a resource where she can meet with different types of advisors specifically for financial needs.",
