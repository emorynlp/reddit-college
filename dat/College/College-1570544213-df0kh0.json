  "title:": "I overslept through my 8AM Chemistry",
  "text": "I hope this doesn\u2019t sound too stupid, but this morning I overslept through my chemistry class that starts at 8. I\u2019ve never had a problem with this in the past, but this morning I woke up at 8:45 and the class ends at 9:15. I felt that it was not worth going, as by the time I had gotten to the class it would\u2019ve been over. \n\nI thought it would be best to email her and apologize for missing lecture, and that I look forward to next class. However, I\u2019m worried that this will look worse on me, considering I didn\u2019t miss a test or a quiz. I have also already gotten the notes from class today.\n\nMy professors attendance policy is that there are no make-up quizzes, make up tests for excused absences, and that regular attendance is expected.\n\nIs it worth emailing my professor at this point, or should I just move on?",

      "text": "Unless your class is really small don't worry about it.  Stuff happens and it really doesn't matter in the end.  Usually saying attendance is expected is a pretty standard thing because nobody can say \"yeah just show up if you want, I don't care\".  If it doesn't hurt your grade and attendance isn't mandatory it's not a big deal.   \n\n\nMaybe if it helps too, I've had many classes where I missed a good 25% of lectures due to it being in the morning and having to deal with stuff like working nights or just studying too late.  I still did well and the professors still really liked me and would often be happy to talk to me after class.  Granted for some I ended up explaining my situation when it got really bad but it was still not a big deal as long as I kept up.",

It's impossible to not have at least two classes/week at the same time at my uni, so noone really cares, because most students just have another class at the same time and they attend that one instead. Even if it's a class where there is a paper you have to sign that you are there, you can probably still miss some classes without it being a problem.",

I found lectures to be a big waste of time as I got more busy, but that's just how I learn. Some people learning better by listening to lectures",
