      "text": "I also am not that great at cumulative exams. However, if your professors pass back your midterms or if you can still access them online, I suggest going over those as part of your studying. Good way to remember what you were being tested on for each part of the semester, and what you should focus on studying most. And you can always learn from your wrong answers. Good luck with your finals!",
