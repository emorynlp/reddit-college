  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and sophomore housing applications start very soon ( my college does it early for some reason ). Anyways, me and my roommate were a random assignment (because there was major problems with the housing application). I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail but we don\u2019t have anything in common and after a few weeks some major and minor issues started to arise with my roommate and other people on my floor. While these issues were going on, a friend of mine (who happen to live on my floor) asked me if I could be her roommate sophomore year since her roommate\u2019s going to be a RA. Without hesitation, I said yes. Now how do I tell my current roommate that i\u2019m rooming with someone else next school year?",

It was nice knowing you.\u201d The things I learned about growing up is 1) you don\u2019t owe anyone anything unless you are employed by them, they birthed you, or they are paying your rent\u2026currently. \n\nIf you\u2019re closer than just roommates, you can tell her nicer, but that\u2019s the outline.",
