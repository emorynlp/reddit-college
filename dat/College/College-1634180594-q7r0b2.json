  "title:": "Getting Through Senior Year in a Major I Hate",
  "text": "I'm a marketing major in an extremely difficult business school, and it took me until junior year to figure out that what I really want to do is be an English teacher abroad and do translation work (yes I know it sounds so much less worth it than to just do marketing now that I've put all the time into it, but words cannot express how much passion I have for language and how much hate I have for business) but I couldn't change my major since I was too far along. I have just this year to go, and I've already completed part of the semester, but I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to get through this. I want to spend my time working on my TEFL (English teaching certificate) but I have literally zero time besides my schoolwork. Plus, my classes require tons, TONS of passion-filled projects because I am a senior which I genuinely cannot muster up the motivation to care about.\n\nAny suggestions on how to get through this?",
