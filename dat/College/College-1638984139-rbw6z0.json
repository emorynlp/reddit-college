  "text": "Finals are in about a week and a half and classes end next week. I have one more exam before finals on Friday (Biochemistry) and I cannot focus on the material to save my life. It shouldn\u2019t be too bad, a lot of it is review, but it\u2019s super frustrating trying to study, but just physically being unable to focus. Anyone else struggling with this?",

      "text": "My finals are today and in the upcoming few days and it has been a real struggle to study in a constant state of panic. However on my most productive days, I would suggest that helps me abit is writing down a checklist as well as a daily schedule. The schedule helps me stay on track while the checklist gives me positive affirmations from being able to tick a task off the list. If focus for long periods of time is difficult, break them up into smaller bits. Try the Pomodoro technique (many apps for it): 25 mins study, 5 min break.\n\nGood luck! Hope you have a better experience with finals than I do right now :')",
