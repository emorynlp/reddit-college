  "text": "I'm taking a sociology class, and as interesting of a class as it's been, I can't for the life of me make progress on this 10 page paper due in less than 48 hours. \n\nFor some context, I'm a STEM major, who rarely takes humanities and social sciences. I took this sociology class as a premed requirement but ended up genuinely enjoying it a lot (a good, engaging professor can do wonders). \n\nI'm often able to sit down for several hours of nonstop grinding orgo/physics practice problems or bio flashcards. But when it comes even to writing a short paper, I can't do it. \n\nAnyone else relate? Tips?",

Also helps if you have a conversation about it with a classmate/friend/TA.\n\n\nFocus on trying to get all your thoughts out on the paper, doesnt have to be good or have grammar or make sense at all, just vomit it out on the paper. It can be edited later.\n\n\nThis is similar to the above mentioned tips but remind yourself what you like the most about the class/topic. Write as if you're explaining it to someone, it takes the pressure off of being scholarly. \n\nHope you do well!",

      "text": "(I'm drunk rn so take everything I say with a grain of salt)\n\nI tutor college students for english and essay writing. The best analogy I have for it came from my sister that seems to click for a lot of people I tutor.\n\nThink of an essay like a skirt: long enough to cover the important parts, but short enough to keep it interesting. Keep every paragraph between either 4-6 or 4-7 sentences, ignore the 3-5 rule entirely.\n\nOnce you find your three points for the body paragraphs, come up with one or two talking points or mini subjects that relate to those points individually. For example, I had to write a debate/informative essay based on two articles devating on the importance of naps in a workplace environment in different countries and if it was something the U.S. should implement, whether it be in agreement or against it we had to choose our side and write an argument. My three points were: workers health, engagement in the company, and functionality. My talking points per paragraph were, in order, mental health, lower turn over rates, and higher performance among individual workers. \n\nBefore I got those talking points though, I researched my original three points, and chose those three talking points as they were the easiest to back up with the  \"evidence\" found. Once you've got these down, write down a couple paragraphs of whatever comes to mind per point and then chose what makes the most sense together and boom, you have got your essay.\n\nThen all you really need to do is summarize your body paragraphs into a conclusion paragraph and also write your introduction. Your introduction is suppose to draw people in or put the question in their head that your body paragraphs will answer while the conclusion is basically a tl:dr. They should be the only paragraphs that are less than 6 sentences, but still keep them at 4-5 sentences.",

Is it a reflection-paper type deal, do you have a prompt that's asking you to answer a specific question, or is it more free-range (you pick the topic)? Regardless, to help get past writer's block, I focus on writing my thoughts free-form. Poor grammar, no spell check, just get your thoughts down on the paper. Do not even CARE if it's bad, just write 500 words on the topic to get the gears spinning. I often find myself becoming so bogged down with the formal rules of academic writing that it can stifle progress, so I start with getting some content first then spend some time rewriting and accurately formatting everything.\n\nThen, once you have the gears spinning and your thoughts down on paper, write one sentence about what your paper is about in response to the prompt. That will form the outline for the rest of your paper. From there, get to get at least one paragraph defining specific terms that will be referenced in your argument. Then, use the rest of the paper to walk the reader through your line of thinking. \"One reason why I'm arguing x is because y . . .\" This can be anywhere from two or three paragraphs, to many, many more depending on the requirements. If it's 10 pages, you'll be looking at ~3,300 words (double spaced), which might seem like a lot, but once you start working in context on top of your argument, it'll eat up words like nothing. Best of luck with the paper!",

If you can\u2019t think of something, look up the prompt and see what other people think, look up different sociological perspectives of the prompt, ask classmates etc. (citing anything you used as inspiration).

      "text": "OMG YES. I EMPATHIZE AND UNDERSTAND THIS SO MUCH the exact same thing happened to me this semester. I\u2019m a stem major and I hadn\u2019t written a paper in like two years until I had this gen-ed in history. \nIt stinks if this is at the end of your semester, because to be honest the only way I got back in the funk of writing essays and papers for this class was just by doing it. First essay we had I flunked, second one was much better in terms of ideas flowing. \nMy best advice tho would be that you can\u2019t think of it like a problem. There\u2019s no equation sheet to check, no step you might have calculated wrong. You (or at least \u201cI\u201d) have to just get it out, put down the words, and THEN go back and fine tune. Let your brain flow and tie the ideas together as it naturally sees fit, even if the sentences and structure aren\u2019t perfect. Then just edit/make sure you\u2019ve included the ideas you needed to and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine :)",
