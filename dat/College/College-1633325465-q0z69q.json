  "title:": "Is it too late to start college at 20?",
  "text": "I graduated my highschool at 18 but dropped out for a year to prepare for the medical entrance exam but unfortunately I procrastinated a lot and failed to clear the exam twice thus wasting 2 yrs of my life. Now I'm 20 and decided to start a bsc course this year. I know that I've fallen behind my peers by 2 yrs, I feel so old \ud83d\ude2d now. I just wanted some reassurance that I'm not too late to start my college now. To think I'll still be studying while my peers graduate college saddens me a lot :( and I still have to look for jobs after I finish my college. I'll be almost 30 by then (3yrs bsc+ 2yrs msc + 3yrs doctorate(if I opt for teaching profession). I wouldn't have come to this point if I started it 2 yrs ago\ud83d\ude1e\n\nEdit: Everyone seems mad at my post lmao but I'm from India and 28 is the maximum age limit to get a govt job. You won't understand unless you're indian and you'll never know how tough it is to get a govt job here and I won't even be done studying by 28",
