  "text": "I tried doing online and it didn\u2019t workout for me bc of how much money it was. In high school I got straight A\u2019s, actually my whole life I\u2019ve had good grades except senior year. I stopped showing up to presentations bc I was tired of having to go through the anxiety and do a poor job. I skipped class too. Anyway it\u2019s kind of late right now, my point is, do any of you have any tips? I just don\u2019t want to deal with that anxiety of teachers calling on me and doing presentations. Just want to get in and out but I know it won\u2019t be like that so what do I even do?",

      "text": "If you have a doctor, you can ask for beta blockers that is meant for performance anxiety.\n\nThis requires a partner. Practice staring your partner's eyes. This will help you desensitize people staring at you when you give a speech. The more you do the exercise the less anxious you feel.\n\nTry imagery. Close your eyes and imaging you are giving a speech in a first person's perspective. Imagine that you are confidently and successfully giving a speech while your class is watching you. The more vivid that you imagine the better this exercise is.",

          "text": "OP, I definitely think this is worth asking your doctor about. This would be an off-label prescription, but if current therapy is not enough then what could it hurt to ask.\n\n [Here's an article about using beta blockers for anxiety. ](https://www.healthline.com/health/beta-blockers-for-anxiety#benefits) [And here's a link to the systematic review and meta-analysis referenced. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724794/pdf/10.1177_0269881115612236.pdf)\n\n\nHowever, it's mostly looking at differences in using propanolol and benzodiazepines for anxiety.\nFrom the discussion:\n>This systematic review and meta-analysis shows a lack of well-designed clinical studies. This limits the scientific evidence and allows neither firm conclusions in favour or against the use of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders, nor recommen-dations for informed decision-making in clinical practice.",
