      "text": "The early-career technology-worker market is saturated to the point that any graduate who has nothing on their resume other than their degree is likely to have at least SOME difficulty landing meaningful employment.  \n\nMany who graduate with nothing but a degree find themselves on a Help Desk with HS graduates and AS degree-holders earning the same pay.  \n\nGraduating plus:  \n\n* One internship doing real IT work for pretty much any employer.  \n* Two certifications.  \n - One technical.  \n - One soft-skills, or technical.  \n* Participation in Competitive Hacking or CTF.  \n - Doesn't matter if you are a Cybersecurity career-seeker. It's an important and in-demand skill.  \n* Participation in clubs or meetups that grant you conversational awareness into how businesses use technology to address business-problems.  \n\nIf you graduate from a university in the US with an IT or IS degree, and you are still scared of Linux, you fucked up.  \n\n\nIf you haven't investigated Career Development Programs and Early-Career Engineering acceleration programs, then you're hurting yourself.  \n\n\nYou are working on a Bachelors degree in technology.  \nDon't focus on the same entry-level certifications that the High School graduates are grinding on.  \nThink higher.  \n\nYou already took a class in operating system concepts and project management. What the hell is the A+ going to teach you?  \n\nYou already took at least one 4-credit class in Data Networking and probably another class in Network Security. Grinding out the Network+ no longer impresses me.  \n\nStrategically, there can be good reasons to pound out the Security+ to help you qualify for Federal / DoD opportunities, so that one is never a bad decision.  \n\nI'd push you towards more challenging content such as:  \n\nRHCSA, CCNA, CWNA, AWS Solutions Architect, Splunk and Palo Alto content.  \n\n\nIMO: IS/IT graduates should be landing Full-Time employment in the $65k ballpark, plus proper benefits. Adjust that salary for higher cost of living areas.  \n\nIS/IT will pretty much always get paid less than the typical CS and CE graduate, but not by a huge difference.",
