Whenever I do them, I feel terrible and I have a harder time remembering what I studied. \n\nWhat works for me is to make a quizlet and use the \u201clearn\u201d feature and study for an hour or so before I go to bed. When I wake up the next morning I study for 30-40 minutes and I feel confident enough to take my test. \n\nThis might not work for everyone but it really helped me for my finals.",
