  "text": "Anyone have any knowledge on the consequences of dropping a class? I've never considered dropping/withdrawing from a class in the past 3 years but I really want to do so for this class as life is super hectic right now and I'm not putting in acceptable work.\n\nIf it matters at all I'm on a 3.5 GPA and am only a few months away from being done the degree. I'm also on financial aid if that matters at all.\n\nI'd ask an academic advisor but I don't think they're in on weekends and I need to know if I'd be comfortable dropping the class via the automated bot or not.\n\nIs this going to tank my GPA? Am I going to have to pay for the dropped class before being able to start my next class? Does the class just get moved further down in my schedule? Any past experiences or knowledge is helpful.",

      "text": "You'll have to pay for the classes before you can get financial aid again/start the next semester. And it doesn't tank your GPA. While some classes can be taken during a certain semester there really isn't a list of classes it moves down. I dropped two classes last summer and got two Ws. They are on my transcript but my GPA is still 3.96.",
