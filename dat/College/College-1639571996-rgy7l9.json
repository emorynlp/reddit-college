      "text": "WGU, sounds like a perfect fit for your scenario. \n\nIt\u2019s completely self-paced and they have a term start on the first of every month. That said, you\u2019re still gonna do the same amount of work as a traditional class. It\u2019ll just be on your own time and you can complete the classes as fast as you want. \n\nAlso, so go just for the refund because if you leave without completing the course you may have to pay it back.",

      "text": "Yes to the first part, but the second will be more difficult to pin down. Usually these colleges are very 'excited' to charge you way above the norm and try to get you to take out as many loans. FAFSA also has deadlines so it's not as though you can fill it out and anytime and expect aid.",
