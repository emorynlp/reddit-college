                  "text": "The fact that you think an 18 year old opinion piece that confuses conjecture as fact constitutes a source makes me think you're trolling, but I'll bite.\n\nFirst and foremost, the article that you linked deals with elite private colleges - so let's focus on them. These colleges all have endowments that equal hundreds of millions of dollars at their lowest, and tens of billions at their highest. Already, we can see that the motivation to \"scam\" students is pretty preposterous. The reason why financial aid programs are so generous at these colleges is simply because it fits the mission statements of the institution and their benefactors - to provide a world class education to good students irrespective of their background. These colleges generally design their aid packages with debt-free graduation in mind - they don't want any student to graduate with significant debt. Of course paying students help with maintenance and revenues, but the additional money they gain from charging the wealthiest students full price is minimal when one considers the capital gains to their endowments.\n\nIn fact, a lot of private liberal arts colleges actually subsidize their tuition fees - even to students who pay \"full\" sticker price. I know of at least one college that spends around $125k per student, and \"only\" charges around $75k.\n\nThe second falsehood is the idea that this is some ploy to redistribute wealth. Even if we discount the ridiculous notion that this accurately reflects the motivations of elite colleges, the fact still remains that financial aid for college is not an effective means of wealth redistribution. If you attend Harvard with a household income of $20k and are charged no tuition as a result - your household income is still $20k. What's more, poorer students don't burden richer students because education is generally a non-rivalrous good. Let's say a Harvard professor is earning $100k for teaching a class of 5 students. If we have 4 rich students paying $24k and 1 poor student paying $4k - the rich students are still $1k better off due to the presence of the poorer student. The argument exists that more students detracts from the quality of education, but this generally isn't an issue at top colleges becaus they tend to exercise quality control by means of being excludable.\n\n\nThe third lie is the idea that the true purpose behind this grandiose and improbable scheme is to redistribute wealth specifically towards URMs. These financial aid policies are targeted to assist students who fall under one category - those with low and middle household income. There are no bonus cash prizes if you're black, gay, or a refugee. All in all, these financial aids target the exact opposite of an underrepresented minority - they primarily benefit working and middle class Americans.",

I also think I'll be able to get a need-based scholarship from my housing provider on account of the increase in gift aid I'll be receiving.\n\nI decided to add a minor that will require me to take four more classes. This way I will have four more chances to boost my GPA, forge relationships with professors and TAs, and interact with other college students (even if classes end up being online). I'm afraid of not being able to find any job if I'm not in school, and at least if I'm enrolled I can continue working at my work-study job whether it's remote or not.",

      "text": "Tuition and fees are two different things. Reducing/eliminating fees for services (like a rec center) you can't access from home makes sense. Some fees-- like tech fees --might be reduced but not eliminated, since most of that money is going to maintaining servers, support staff, and software licenses rather than the relatively few public computers on most campuses.\n\nTuition is a challenge though. For most schools tuition revenue is what keeps the operation going, and labor costs are 60-80% of the operating budget at many schools. From our experiences this spring faculty are finding it takes 2-3x the hours to run an online course properly. So if we were to cut tuition dramatically that would mean either big pay cuts-- for faculty who are working more hours than normal ---or laying off many faculty, which would mean far fewer course options.\n\nAs the parent of a college student I'm sympathetic: I'd want to pay less for an arguably lesser experience online. But as a professor I also see the real challenges of making major tuition cuts, which would have effect of dramatically decreasing course offerings which would further limit progress to graduation for many students. In my family's case we have decided that if fall 2020 is mandated to be online our student will take a leave of absence for the semester and work on taking free classes from home (or a few gen ed requirements from the local community college).\n\nThere's also this simple fact: without tuition revenue in fall 2020 there are a number of schools that will simply go out of business. If it went all year that number would likely be in the low hundreds. While the $$$ price tags and personal bills are high to individuals, there are several hundred us private schools that have been running deficit budgets for several years or are borrowing to balance budgets. They will be gone if there is a major drop in revenue, especially after the refunds this spring. Public schools will be more safe as they can (usually) rely on appropriations from legislatures to at least remain in business, but major cuts will happen regardless.",

      "text": "Honestly if you think about how tuition first of all is broken down... sheesh. They charge for activities most students don\u2019t even utilize, they charge for so much. I\u2019m not saying it should be FREE BECAUSE OF THIS but if it were up to me tuition should at least be cut in half. Why? I can\u2019t use the library, I can\u2019t access any in person help/counseling/tutoring, I legit can\u2019t use half of the experience of what college actually is. But at the same time, you\u2019re still given assignments by teachers who still are working like they normally would. (grading assignments/creating tests... they\u2019re still doing everything they have to do) I\u2019m not one to complain due to being in Community College (it ain\u2019t expensive but it\u2019s not exactly free either) but for those in expensive schools you guys should get like 80% off. because aren\u2019t those shit box dorms they try selling you on like $20,000 anyways? Roughly around there? (Meant in no offense but I\u2019ve definitely seen how bad/cramped some of them are) \n\nReason why I say 80% off for more expensive school too is unless there\u2019s a scholarship of some sort or a grant of some kind, it usually means the student/students parent(s) (in most cases) have the means to put them through such expensive schooling. But that does NOT mean exclude them from a heavy discount just because they have more money available for school. They\u2019re also losing out on the experiences as a regular student would too. And not for anything any live-in student should get their dorms for the spring semester at least refunded 50% because I think technically most school cut off about mid way through this semester. \n\nBut fuck do I know, right?",

Quality online education is more work, and requires more services, than quality f2f education.\n   1. This might depend on class. an online intro to art history course doesn't need as much specialized services/tools/software as intermediate statistics with lab. And I have no clue what chem and bio would do for their labs.\n2. With all the international students gone, your tuition might go up because your university need to sustain itself. In the past 10 years, many public universities were able to maintain low tuition cost because of the tuition international students brought (out of state tuition). With them gone, and almost-guaranteed further drop in state fund, your cheap tuition might no longer be sustainable. They will need to either raise tuition or **lower education quality (e.g., hire more adjuncts than full time TT professors; layoff faculty/staffs; furlough; reduce services to students, etc).**\n\nNow, most public schools would not increase tuition. This would look bad on state politicians, which would negatively impact their electability. But the chance of lower tuition is almost 0.\n\nHere are what might happen:\n\n1. If your university is a large public university, such as Purdue University, then they might 1) lower enrollment bar to get more students; and 2) lay off non-essential instructors/staffs.\n2. If your university is a small/medium regional teaching university, then they might 1) lay people off; 2) furlough; and/or 3) become so unsustainable that they disband and be absorbed by other campuses nearby.",

Also I have been fortunate enough to have a relatively good experience during online classes. They still suck because labs don't translate well to online at ALL, but my professors have been super accessible and understanding during this time, almost all of them hold WebEx meetings during when we normally would have class to go over material/answer questions in addition to office hours, but it's never mandatory as not all students can be there. And they are being super understanding and flexible with deadlines as well. But I realize that's not the case for everyone",

      "text": "I (staffer) have mentioned this a few times in threads on this question, but just to reiterate. Your tuition isn't just paying for your credits at the quality you expect. Tuition is mostly for your school _to exist at all_.\n\nPut aside the fact I literally mean schools couldn't run if they lost a chunk of tuition revenue. Here's a more mundane example of what tuition reduction would mean. I was in a meeting today where the topic of looming departmental budget cuts came up. It would mean not renewing contracts with a number of our teachers, many of whom teach classes required for our majors. There's a very real chance that we may not be able to staff a required course in the fall, or if we do, it will be taught by someone unfamiliar with the topic and already overworked. This is _without_ the loss of tuition revenue... manageable, but already losing the quality of education. But cut tuition...to balance the books schools will lay off instructors and, in turn, eliminate many classes because they can't be staffed or supported. The remote class that's not up to expectations simply doesn't exist at all.\n\nAnd I'm not sure students have heard the unbudgeted costs of COVID-19. One school that was up front about the costs was MIT: as of mid-April, it had spent or returned $50 million since January. That was the cost of \"providing the technology to enable the sudden shift to remote teaching and working, supplying financial assistance to help students leave campus quickly, refunding student housing and dining fees while making sure contract dining workers and others are paid through late May\". That's before the hit it will take in lost endowment income, cuts in government grants, and less private giving.\n\nThis crisis is _really bad_. Unfortunately the math is that for your schools to stay open, they're going to have to keep tuition where it is. Some of you will decide it's not worth it and walk away, and that may well be the right decision for you. But for those that stay in school, probably with a noble exception here or there, there will be no tuition reductions.",

Tuition losses would generally impact my staff at my institution, and that will make the whole operation that much worse in terms of quality. I wonder where students think the money comes from. It will be massive layoffs, worsening unemployment, and long term damage to higher education. Then the students will have a more competitive job market and likely be unemployed themselves. \n\nIf I were in college I'd take the semester and remember it forever... Unless I were already part time or at a commuter school already. Maybe I'd reduce my course load. I'm sure it depends on many factors.\n\nPlus let's be honest. How fun is a semester off going to be with nothing open? Students probably won't be employable unless they want to work in a grocery store... They've got teeth in their argument but I think higher education typically does pretty well in recessions. I got a few masters degrees when there were no jobs to have.",

Third -- and this is really important in student demands around tuition and COVID -- that money was already plugged into a budget. A school might get many millions of dollars in returns on its investments, but the school planned for that amount and budgeted for things like scholarships, dorm maintenance and construction, and all the other stuff that tuition _also_ supports.

One could argue they are paying more but thats a semantic argument about direct versus indirect costs per credit hour.\n\nMy state school doesn't have a summer requirement, but our merit scholarships are designed to have students complete a 4 year program with 30 credits a year.  The student can choose to go hard with a 15/15/0 plan and take summers off or go 12/12/6 and while getting less financial support during the summer.\n\nMy personal plan is to work Full Time at the school and take half or three quarter time work loads.  If I can pull off 6/9/6 in the first year I'll be over the moon.  It'll probably end up being 6/6/6 depending on how well I can gear shift to being a student and an employee.",

Enrollment is particularly high in graduate programs during recessions. Whether that happens this time is yet to be seen since the economy is damaged by a virus that will drive courses online rather than decisions made by the finance sector.",

But by far much much more of it can be done alone online than is currently done.\n\nBut even those classes with vital in person skills would be easier if done in public labs rather than in transfer locked, high tuition colleges with requirements that one takes that universities sole in person prerequisite.\n\nI'd say probably upwards of 80% of classes could be done remotely in one way or another. With only the most practical of classes being ones one should take in person.\n\nLab safety in Chem 101, in person yes. But also should be open to anyone at any time.

Most of my colleagues have not taught online before and this was a huge learning curve for them.\n\nBut I hope students don\u2019t judge online education at their university based on this semester. At my university we had two weeks to switch to remote learning. That\u2019s 2 weeks to move my 400 students online. It was intense. If we go online in the fall, we have a lot more time to figure it out. All of my colleagues are taking classes and certifications right now and the rest of the semester to prepare for a possible remote fall semester. Meanwhile, I am developing 3 different syllabi for 3 possible outcomes in the fall 1) totally normal in person semester 2) all online semester or 3) hybrid, half online and half in class. \n\nI get that you\u2019re missing the college experience and this SUCKS! I miss my students and campus so much and I hate the idea of not being on campus next year. Communicating with your professor about your concerns with online learning could help a lot!",

If everything stay online, then schools will need to subscribe to things including: more online storage, online proctoring services, specialize software, upgrading server to meet student demand, etc. **What you had was probably the bare-bone version.**\n\nHere is an example of my department's struggle. In our intermediate classes, we teach students how to use software such as SPSS. When students are on campus, they can access SPSS on most of our on-campus computers. But when off campus, students don't have access to that anymore. So our students have two options right now: 1) get SPSS and other software on their own (which luckily IBM extended SPSS' trail period for now); and 2) use our remote lab services.\n\nSo if we have another online semester, then we will need to either: 1) charge students for the cost of SPSS license or have the students swallow that cost on their own; and/or 2) upgrade our server so our remote lab capacity can handle all the students.",

These fees might include:   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Technology and equipment fees** are designed to cover the  cost the university incurs to buy equipment and maintain current,  functioning technology. Technology fees can vary dramatically from  school to school. Some charge around $40 per class, while others charge  upwards of $100.   \n>  \n>**Access fees** typically go toward things like cloud  services, VOIP expenses and all the costs associated with fostering an  interactive learning environment. which on-campus students are not  required to pay.   \n>  \n>**Graduation fees** (sometimes called conferral fees) are  charged for students who are graduating and receiving a degree. These  can be around $100.   \n>  \n>**Assessment fees** pay for the exams used to assess a  student's aptitude and course placement in the online program.
