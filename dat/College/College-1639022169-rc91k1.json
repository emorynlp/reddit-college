  "text": "As everyone's dean/president has said at least one time this year: \"This year has been difficult\".\n\nThe beginning of this year was probably one of the worst I've ever had. I went through a major depressive episode. All of my classes were online and I was failing. I withdrew from Calculus I my grade got so bad but I managed to bring the rest of my classes back up to at *least* passing grades. Unfortunately, this provided one excellent right hook to my GPA. Summer rolls around and I take two online courses to blow off steam. This encompassed Calculus I and Intermediate Programming with Java. I finished with a D in Intermediate Programming and passed Calculus I miraculously, but with the help of my phone. This term comes and I'm back to taking a full course load and with Calculus II; shocker. I have *NOT* done good in 75% of my classes and I just *know* even if I pass 2 of my classes, my GPA will sink to a 1.98. This will put me on academic probation with my university and just the thought of this makes me want to vomit.\n\nI have been in college for 3 years now, almost 4, with 60% of my degree done (because I went to community college then transferred to a 4-year with my AA) and I'm feeling extremely stressed about everything. My Pell grant is gone due to an extremely high, and in my opinion, inaccurate, estimated family contribution, I'm failing out of this semester and I feel like I'm not moving forward. I will have to retake most of my classes from this term *again* next term and it makes me feel like I'm letting all of my family down. If I take more time off, it'll put me further behind in my time to finish my degree. If I transfer back to community college, I feel as if I won't be a good candidate for future jobs and my family won't be as proud of me. I have to work near full time to keep up with bills and balance a relationship and now work enough to pay student loans for next term until I file as independent on my next FAFSA.\n\nIf there is *anyone* who has been in a similar situation, I would love some advice on how to continue. I don't want to drop out completely as I *want* my degree, but it's getting hard going at it head on and trying to balance everything.",
