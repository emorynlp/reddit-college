  "text": "im a high school senior and i just kinda assumed you needed to major in zoology, biology, animal science, etc. to be a good vet school candidate but now im seeing that you can major in anything as long as u fulfill the pre vet courses. \n\nso im rethinking majoring in biology bc im scared it will be hard since im not great at math. and im also interested in other majors so ?  would it be best to stick with biology anyway or could i choose another",

      "text": "I know someone who got into and went to a top vet school with a degree in music, so that implies that the answer to your question is \"no.\" That being said, you're going to need to ace your prereq courses if you want to get in, and if any of those courses require math you should be actively trying to improve your math skills so that you can do well in those courses.",
