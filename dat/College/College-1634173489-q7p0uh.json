  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am really struggling writing my introduction for a research paper. I will be conducting a small experiment for the paper. I have all my sources and even an outline down for how I will organize the introduction, but I can't seem to coherently put all of this information together. \n\nIf anyone has any tips on writing an introduction for a research paper, it would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "Your school probably has a writing center, you should go there.\n\nWhat you want to do in the intro is explain to the reader all the things that PhDapper said.\n\nBut one tip that I use is to write is really simple (and not so elegant ) first to get you started.\n\nLike - I wanted to find out what the different theories were on how you age.  It turns out that some people think this and some people think that.  This is important because ..\n\nThen you can pretty it up after.\n\nThis helps if you dont\u2019 know where to start.",
