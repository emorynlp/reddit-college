  "title:": "Wealthsimple Cash: $50 For Signing Up - Takes 2 Minutes (Canada)",
  "text": " \n\n    Works for NEW and EXISTING users of Wealthsimple Cash. Takes 2 Minutes                                                                                       \n\nWealthsimple Cash is Canada's very own Cash App/Venmo! There are zero fees, and they even have their own VISA card coming which looks pretty sick and has many perks as well! It's better to get in early as the $25 promotion is only for a limited time, and while signing up you can grab your unique \"$tag\" before anyone else does!\n\nSign up using this link [**http://ws.cash/invite/$kevinhuynh**](http://ws.cash/invite/$kevinhuynh) or enter my code **DJSBHP**\n\nAfter using my code, go to the promotions tab, then enter \"COLLEGE\" for an extra $25 on top of the first $25. Enjoy!",
