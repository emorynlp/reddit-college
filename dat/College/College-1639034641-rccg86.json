  "title:": "So I have had a bad semester...",
  "text": "\\*\\*\\*\\*I only have one week until the semester ends, so there is not much I can do at this point\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am an Accounting and Finance major and have currently have completed 87 credits, and on my way to completing 150 credits to be eligible for the CPA. I am a transfer student, so only 27 credits (that I have completed at my new university) count towards my GPA. I have a 3.541 and based on my calculations on how this current semester will end, it will go down to around a 3.1 or 3.2. I took an intro finance course during the spring in which I had gotten a C- and retook it this summer and got a B+. This boosted my GPA from 3.4ish to my current 3.541.\n\nI was initially taking Intermediate I this semester but had to withdraw due to my low grades. Another class I was taking (Investments) was a co-requisite and I had to withdraw from that as well. I currently have a D in Cost Accounting (I have taken my last exam already and that is included), two B-'s (Corporate Finance and Intro to Real Estate), and an A (Intro to Law). My semester GPA most likely will a 2.6, and if I continue to have the same grades in the three other classes after taking my last exams, I will have a 3.25 GPA. I still have three more semesters left, and I have to retake Intermediate I, Investments, and Cost Accounting (Because a D clearly means that I did not understand the material).\n\nI definitely could have done better if only I grasped a better way of studying for accounting courses because the ones I had taken at my community college were far easier than the ones I am taking now. I have already bought a practice book for Intermediate I, and I plan on going over it throughout winter break before the Spring semester begins.\n\nThroughout this semester, I felt uneasy applying for internships because of my low performance and now I am even more stressed. I had gotten messages from recruiters because my 3.541 fit the requirements for their positions, and from what I've seen, most of them require a 3.2-3.3 minimum. I am unsure about the possibility of me getting an internship due to my poor performance this semester, and even more so about a job after college if I do not get any internship experience. I will still be applying for internships everywhere and see what happens. I do not expect to get into a big 4, so anywhere would do because I cannot be picky at this point.\n\nSo, what do you guys think?\n\nAm I doomed?\n\nOr is there hope for me if I pick myself back up and do well the rest of the three semesters that I have left?",
