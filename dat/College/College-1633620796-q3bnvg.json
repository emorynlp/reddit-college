If you show them that you want to pass too, a lot of the good ones will give you all the resources you need to pass. Another thing is to keep your syllabus\u2019 on hand for all your classes so you can make sure you aren\u2019y forgetting any important dates",

There will be different solutions depending on your problem.\n\nIf you're skipping classes and turning in assignments late or not at all, that's one thing.  If you're failing tests because you don't understand the material, that's another thing.  And so forth.  \n\nSo explain what specifically you're having problems with, and we'll be able to give more specific advice.",
