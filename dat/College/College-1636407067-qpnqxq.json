I spent too much time on my other classes and didn\u2019t do much research because I had to read on top of researching and assignments. There was no time. \n\nAt this point I feel like BSing it and making up fake claims and evidence. Just reading articles and pulling information out of my ass.",

      "text": "lol bro ive made research papers in 3 days and gotten an A. you can DO this OP that is a lot of time.\n\nStart slow first by looking up all your sources and gathering them into one page (so all your references, links, etc.). Then from there pick out the ones that are gonna be relevant the most to your work. So if your paper is about marxist paintings in mexico, then don't use sources that talk about marxist paintings in russia, etc. \n\nand that will hopefully help you for your project. I hope this helps!",
