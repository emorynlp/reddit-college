  "text": "I'm in a high-level polisci class that is my own personal hell. The professor running it doesn't teach, really, she just assigns long research papers to read and instead of telling us what we should have learned/why these are important, she just asks people for what they think was important and lets that be class. If she has slides, they're bare bones, and that's when she's actually teaching and not having students present on the essays they read the day beforehand. The course content feels like we are rehashing the same ideas over and over again for situations that are entirely context-dependent in real life. I am learning nothing I couldn't learn in a YT video. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd today we talked about the final exam. It's going to be short answer and essay format. Normally that isn't an issue, but she is offering no guidance as to what we should be studying. She said there would be no study guide or direction on her part and she said it with a smile like she thought it was just the best thing ever. I'm already screwed because I don't even have the ability to rely on what I remember in class--it's so asinine and boring that information just passes through my brain like a sieve. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCOVID took away my entire college experience and replaced it with a bunch of time-wasting garbage that exists only because they need these professors to do something other than sit around and work on their pet projects all day. I didn't get to do study abroad like I always wanted. I'm about to graduate and I realized I picked a major that gives me no practical skills. I am trying to learn Russian but I'm not smart enough to learn it fast enough where I can put it on my resume. When I actually had time in my schedule I tried to apply to on campus jobs and organizations to get skills and experience but I was rejected. Everything is coming to a head in this semester and I want to write a big F you to this professor on the final. It's unfair and I know this is a lot of me targeting her with anger just because I'm unhappy but I hate this class so much, it's like a tiny little microcosm of everything I feel is wrong with my university experience. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, someone tell me why I shouldn't just blow off this exam and do poorly simply out of spite for her and her class.",

      "text": "Honestly, that sounds like a perfectly normal higher level social sciences seminar. And that prof won\u2019t care that much if you do poorly. She\u2019s probably had students fail before and will have students fail again in the future. So you\u2019ll give yourself a worse grade than otherwise expected and fume and spend a lot of mental energy on this and lower your gpa, and she\u2019ll shrug her shoulders, write and F on the exam and keep going on with her life not really caring that you failed the exam.",

The professor isn't going to care.",
