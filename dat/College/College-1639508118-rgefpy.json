  "text": "I am 0.11% away from an A and he refuses to bump my grade because it would be unfair to the other students. \n\nI tried telling him that an A was a better representation of my level of effort and enjoyment of the class, I tried telling him my grades are very important to me because I'm trying to get into a competitive program, and I tried telling him that he could give me extra points on my paper because grading a paper is often subjective but nothing has worked. \n\nI'm going to pursue getting an A until the very last day that grades are due. Please give me any ideas on getting him to bump my grade?",

      "text": "Agh I fucking hate 89s. Most professors will bump up if you\u2019re past 89.5 but I\u2019ve had two that didn\u2019t budge. It\u2019s awful but if the answer is no, it\u2019s best to just accept it. You\u2019re not going to get anything from bothering him during a time he probably has a million other students asking the same thing and whatever grading he\u2019s dealing with.",

I would probably reply with a thank you and put it to rest. \n\nThere could still be a chance, but you will kill whatever chance is left by pushing the issue. Profs can be easily agitated with this stuff. \n\nGood luck I hope you get the A!",
