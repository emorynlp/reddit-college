  "title:": "Considering stopping pursuit of astronomy major due to hating math classes at my college",
  "text": "I applied to a couple of schools based on their astronomy programs. I've always enjoyed astronomy as a kid and even now, I'm fascinated by it. While I still don't necessarily know if I'd like to do it as a career, it's still something I'd like to partake in.\n\nI got into some really good astronomy programs at some schools (CU Boulder, UAZ, and UVA were my ultimate choices after narrowing them down) and ultimately committed to UVA after discussing it with an astrophysics professor there. \n\nBecause I'm out of state, I'm paying full tuition, but because I'm in the honors program, I get to bypass general requirements. I'm applying for a  scholarship where I'm double-majoring in environmental science and astronomy. I learned that I couldn't double major in astrophysics (BS astronomy) because it was a death sentence, and the professor that I spoke to said that I could maybe take some astrophysics classes in combination with regular astronomy classes. The only thing was that my lack of physics and calculus credits was a crutch that held me back from doing the intro to astrophysics route.\n\nI took AP calc bc and AP Physics I in high school and got decent grades (90s). My physics teacher did not explain things well and, because of that, I generally hate/am afraid of physics. Additionally, I loved my calc teacher, but I did it over quarantine, and I ended up speedrunning the second semester and not passing the exam. \n\nI know I have to get through calculus and understand it to do astronomy and physics, but apparently the calc track here is not regarded as favorable among students, and physics has an even worse reputation. I'm treating calc like a prereq, which is exactly what I did NOT want to happen. \n\nAll in all, I really love astronomy and my astro class so far and know it's something I'd like to do, but don't know if I'm capable of doing it due to hating the math class and hearing that the physics course is terrible. I feel like not having a leg up for these subject areas in high school and not having the best time in class will hold me back. Should I drop the astronomy idea?",

      "text": "Unfortunately, yes. I was an astrophysics major and really struggled with the more advanced math classes, too. The truth is that without math and physics, there is no astronomy, especially if you want to go to graduate school (and if you wanna work in astronomy related fields, you will need graduate school).",

      "text": "I would say that it would be worth holding your options open and trying at least one semester of calculus (usually counts for general education) to see if possibly you would get it better in college. If you got a solid first half of ap calc, your preparation should be fine for calc 1. Then you could make up your mind with a bit more solid evidence, instead of spending a lot of time wondering \"What if?\"",

Everything is in much greater depth, which would be fine, except it\u2019s a \u201cflipped classroom,\u201d so we learn things before we come in and do busy work in there. I like my professor a lot, and I know I\u2019m a strong math student, but the discrepancies in what I was taught in high school and what\u2019s being taught here are quite large. I\u2019m trying my best to like the class, but I dread it every week.",
