Merchants are charged a around 3% interchange fee (depends on your card) on every transaction, however the prices are the same regardless if you pay cash or credit. If you aren't using a credit card, you are paying for someone elses credit card rewards.\n\nKeep in mind though that if you make a late payment and are charged interest that entire benefit goes away essentially.",
