      "text": "I think this question is worded poorly, but given the OP's comment under PhDapper I think I understand it.\n\nWhy do men drop out at a higher rate? I would hypothesize finances (and ultimately how we view education).  \nThere is a lot of pressure on men to get a good paying job that will last lifetime. With the rising cost of a college education coupled with the realization what STEM isn't a guarantee to wealth, the hourly wage of a plumber is much more attractive. Our society mostly sees education as an exercise in getting a gateway into a higher-paying job. This is actually a fairly recent way of looking at higher education but nevertheless it is the standard viewpoint today. If one is prioritizing only the high-pay-job outcome, college isn't a particularly good bet. Yes, if you are pretty good in your major (regardless of what it is, I know many very wealthy philosophy majors) you will most likely make more than if you didn't go to college. But what about those who aren't geniuses, what do we do with the people who are just good at math, but not great? Far too many CS majors/Engineering majors/Business majors (all considered high-paying majors) end up in retail. Financially then, college doesn't make sense. Not to mention the fact that many people are pushed into college who probably shouldn't be.\n\nSo, college isn't anti-men or pro-men. Broader circumstances such as financial issues, cultural mentality, societal ideals on the role of men, and stubborn stereotypes which push college as a necessity, mean that men drop out from college at a noticeably higher rate than women.",
