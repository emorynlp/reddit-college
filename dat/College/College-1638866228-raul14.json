  "text": "I'm 21 and I want to change majors. I feel like I'm going to be so behind if I do it. If I do change it I'm planning on taking as many classes as possible per semester plus summer classes but I'm not sure if I will be able to finish in 2 years. I don't want to graduate at 24-25 but I'm not passionate about my current major so if I stay in going to be miserable. What do I do?",

      "text": "Something I learned is that it\u2019s never about how long it takes you to get there, it matters about actually getting there. I think it\u2019s good to look at what you\u2019re planning on changing to and create a spreadsheet of everything you need for that degree. You can see which classes could be taken in summer rather than a normal layout. And you can try to see if the workload will be good enough to manage that you can graduate on track. But if it\u2019s not manageable, I wouldn\u2019t let it discourage you from changing degrees. Ultimately, if that major change will make you happier and more confident about what you\u2019re going to school for, the time it takes doesn\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re going for what you want to do. Hope this helps you OP",
