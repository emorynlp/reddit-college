Faculty professors are actual professionals instead of overworked TAs, who are super flexible and understanding. \n\nCollege is cheap and affordable and the facilities are so nice. Transfer into a public college with almost 100% acceptance rate, got giant scholarship. Even cheaper than community college!\n\nStudied a really good field cyber security. Studied abroad in Germany and saw Europe and China. \n\nNo one cares that I bunked college m. Fucking no one. \n\nYou\u2019re not the first person to suffer in their first year. Honestly, you\u2019re a dime a dozen, and something here isn\u2019t working. You can pay out of you ass at your current college to find out OR you can go to community college or work for a year while you figure things out because it\u2019s literally SO normal to be in the same boat.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy. At first I cried and I felt like a failure who had fallen of the path. Now I realize that I\u2019m not special or anything. I\u2019m just a normal person, and after I stopped chasing prestige, I became much happier being just ok.",

      "text": "I would suggest not dropping out. Instead of looking at what you struggle look what you accomplished. Even passing one class is major success (i mean you practically aced an advance level course). Go with your own pace. Of course your mental health is most important but dropping out decision is an emergency thinking which in long run not a viable option. \n\nI have had my fair share of crawling out of stress and depression because I was failing dramatically. Talking to someone really helps and numbs the panic which then goes away like you never felt it. Pour your mind here if you wish, but just you know its not the end.",

      "text": "Most colleges have an option where you can take a leave of absence due to mental health reasons to allow you time for yourself without having to officially drop out and stop pursuing a degree. If you know for sure you'd like to drop out and not return, you can typically contact your advisor for assistance. If you're interested in returning once your mental health is better, reach out to counseling services or your advisor for assistance with taking a semester or two off. \nGood luck and I hope things start looking up for you! Remember that school is not a requirement to be successful in life and it does not need to be the reason your mental health is declining. You are more important than a degree",

My brother found this out about a year after he started at a new school. His first school he was really augering in by the end of spring term and finished with a gpa between 0 and 1. He's graduating from the new school **with honors** in December and has been on the dean's list twice. He's much happier and more confident and everything is different for him. I hope the same for you!",

At the point of where you want to re-apply, you\u2019d have to get accepted to come back in (they will accept you). If you don\u2019t re-apply, you don\u2019t go back. But at least this gives you some wiggle room incase you change your mind. Good luck and I hope things start looking up for you... college is really tough on mental health.
