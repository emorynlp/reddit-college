  "text": "\u2026i missed my final exam. \n\ni misinterpreted the exam schedule this week and totally forgot about it. it\u2019s inexcusable but i emailed my professor about it and i\u2019m hoping and praying he understands. \n\nthis class was my easiest too, i don\u2019t know i slipped up. i\u2019m so upset at myself. i\u2019ll still pass the class but with a C but i know i could\u2019ve ended up with an A if i took it.\n\nedit: i sent a follow up email. i\u2019m not sure why he has not responded yet.",
