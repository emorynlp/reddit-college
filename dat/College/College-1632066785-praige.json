I'll stay in and get my shit done, study, and make sure that at least three days a week I'm in the gym making sure I don't feel like a piece of shit everyday. Hopefully one day friends do come, but until then, I'm going to at least feel productive and making sure I don't let my mental health go to shit",

Others just made new friends. Im now a junior and it kind of sucks doing nothing on Friday and Saturday nights but let\u2019s focus on ourselves and hopefully new friends will come. Ive made some study groups from people in class and joined some clubs in the meantime",

      "text": "I was in a similar position in sophomore year. All the friends I made freshman year branched out and met new people, I was left behind. I still hung out with them occasionally, but a lot of times they were busy with their own stuff and I was lonely. So I poured myself into my work, went to the gym, etc. Looking back on my college years as a graduate, sophomore year I was at my healthiest (physically wise) and had the best grades. Yet it was definitely the worst year out of all them cause I was bored and lonely. \n\nWeirdly, what ended up working for me was going on dating apps. However, I did so with the hopes of meeting new people, not starting a relationship (I tried bumble BFF too but that didn\u2019t work out well). Towards the end of my sophomore year, I went on non mainstream apps, invited people to a movie I was interested in seeing, and became great friends with a pretty fun guy. I introduced him to a friend of mine and we ended up having some great times together junior year. \n\nSo I would recommend you try to make friends. Doesn\u2019t have to be this way, and you don\u2019t have to make a lot. Even just one new, high quality friend can change your life.",
