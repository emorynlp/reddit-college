  "title:": "Is there any way to get free dorms?",
  "text": "My living situation has recently become unfortunate. I have no job and need to find a place to live. \n\nIf i get a job then my grades will dip. In the past I got straight F's while working. Also, where I live a full time job can't support an apartment because the minimum wage doesnt match the housing prices.\n\nMy school has a thing where if you become an RA you get free dorms but unfortunately the process is very long and wouldn't be in effect till next fall. \n\nI didn't get any financial aid but I also didn't write that I would be dorming. Was there even a dorm question on the fafsa? Would that change the amount I got? Can I resubmit saying that I will be dorming and hope to get more money? Are dorms even open in the summertime?\n\nBasically if anyone knows any programs or any ways to get free or discount dorms I would be very very grateful. Thank you",

      "text": "Living on or off campus does not change the amount you get from FAFSA. I would take to your school. Stuff like this happens and schools have to help students out all the time. That being said it probably won't be free or discount unless they have reduced fees setup. Can you do loans... if it means not having a place to sleep the debt would be worth it.",

I accidentally put that I was living off campus, when I wasn\u2019t. After I got way less money, I rechecked and saw my error, fixed it and they readjusted my financial aid to accommodate dorming!",
