  "title:": "Is it worth the hassle to try to convince my lab professor to round my Bio lab grade to an A-/90?",
  "text": "Alright so my Bio lab grade is an 89.46. It\u2019s close to an 89.5 where the grade gets rounded to a 90. The lab grade is 25% of my final Bio grade and idk my Bio grade from hw, quizzes, & exam but I feel it\u2019s at a solid B rn since I rarely get below an 80 on my quizzes & exams. I would really like a B+ as my final grade so is it worth the trouble to convince my Bio lab professor to round the 89.46 to a 90? It\u2019s only 0.4 points but depending on my Bio grade from exams, it could possibly make a difference but I\u2019m not sure",

      "text": "In general don't ask for a grade to be rounded. Faculty generally know that students who are close would prefer the higher grade already and you don't gain a whole lot by asking but do risk developing a bad reputation and it may not even make a difference in this case in your overall bio grade (you should calculate what this is .The grade breakdown should be in the syllabus and you should be able to get reasonably close unless you have major/a lot of assignments that haven't been graded yet).\n\nQuite a few classes will curve or have a minor bump for students who are close. Others won't, but asking doesn't usually change it either way.",

The hw, quizzes, and exams are graded as whole numbers by the lecture professor while the lab professor grades mostly everything as a decimal. If the final grade won\u2019t be affected at all with 0.4 points, then I\u2019ll let it be.",

Do you accept the B+ in the class, or do you ask for another round of double rounds? \n\nDo you not get how absurd this is?",
