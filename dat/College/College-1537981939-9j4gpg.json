  "text": "I have a 7 page essay due on Sunday, and I found that if I have a drink before I start writing, I'm able to output much more than usual.\n\n When I'm sober, I'm anxious. I always try to find the perfect words to write on an essay. I'll write a sentence and say \"hmm that doesn't sound right\" or \"no no no my professor won't like this I should redo it.\" \n\nBut when I'm tipsy, I'm bold. I have much more of a \"I'm gonna write this and you're gonna f\\*cking like it\" attitude. I can type sentence after sentence without stopping and not care about perfecting it, while using complex vocabulary and maintaining a formal tone. \n\nNot saying it's for everybody.. but if you're apprehensive like me when it comes to writing essays, give it a try.",

It's one thing to notice your work flows easier if you are relaxed and another thing to believe that you must drink or drug in order to relax. When you believe you must drink to get your work done or that you do your best work while a bit tipsy... Then you are playing with fire.\n\nKnowing what makes you effective is a blessing. Even if it's drugging or drinking. Now you know the barriers to success. Those crutches will not work forever and they will begin to cause separate issues. \n\nI guess the message is pretty simple: don't get lost in the sauce. ",
