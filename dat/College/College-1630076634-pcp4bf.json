  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman and I feel like I\u2019m drowning in work already, and on top of that, I\u2019m the least intelligent person in each of my classes. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in any of them. I\u2019m only taking 5 classes rn and I don\u2019t have a job, so I shouldn\u2019t be struggling this much. High school was hard for me but I was able to do well somehow, but college is a completely different story. I feel like I\u2019m gonna flunk out of all of my classes and I have no idea what to do\n\nEdit: dropped a class and feel a bit better :)",

It was hell there for a while and the burnout was real, but if you make sure to just keep moving forward with the work no matter what, you\u2019ll do well. Being online last year every day was pretty much get out of bed, eat, wash up, and then get on the computer and work \u2018till it\u2019s time to sleep lol (keep your sleep schedule on track btw, it does help). It\u2019s expected to be taking lots of classes and then struggle in freshman year because there\u2019s so many prereqs you have to get out of the way so you can move on to future classes. Now in sophomore year I can take fewer classes and stil be on track.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t give up! The first few weeks are a huge change, and you need adjustment time. Also, colleges all have tutors, who can help you with any class and your study skills. You\u2019d be amazed at how many people don\u2019t know how to take proper notes. Note taking, reading, studying  can all be improved with better study skills. You can ask your professors, TA\u2019s, Peer Mentors, RA\u2019s, or other students about where to find the best help. (Plus, there are usually posters or flyers in all the buildings telling you where you can find a tutor). Usually for 100 level freshman courses, there is a peer mentor (a student who has taken the class already) who is there to help, and assist with reviewing for exams or just to help you out. If you\u2019re in the honors college, you can go to your honors advisor for help. \n\nAlso, if you notice other students in your classes who seem like they take great notes, do well on quizzes/exams, and just seem like they have a handle on the material, don\u2019t be afraid to ask them to study with you. Group study sessions are great, and you should try to take advantage of them if you get the chance. \n\nBut it\u2019s so early in the semester (just 5 days!), you really don\u2019t have to worry. Everyone learns at different speeds. A lot of people don\u2019t take a full class load, and you should just focus on doing your best. Try not to compare yourself to what everyone else is doing too often. Just have fun!!! :)",

If you have electives take fun electives that you would love to have memories of. College is a time for you to explore and gradually build your career, so don't be so hard on yourself at the same time study smart to make the grades. Professors are always there for you (most of the time, unless you run into a bad one) so make sure you always take down their office hours and emails. \n\nI personally loved that my university was an expanse of space I could virtually explore any topic and take a few hobby classes to take off the edge of college classes. I would go for 5 years if you are able to afford it, I think it's worth the stay to get ready and build yourself for the next stages of your life.",

After you understand what they want from you, you can put in the effort required and not overthink it.\n\nDon't compare yourself to classmates, they could be failing for all you know.

      "text": "When I transferred I was also maintaining a full-time career.  I met with my TAs to let them know and ask for advice about how to manage the workload.  One of my TAs told me how to read like a grad student.  Read the opening and closing summaries. Then read the first and the last sentence of each paragraph in the body.  If you have time go in a read the parts you don't understand/detail relevant to the material you'll need to know.  \n\nRecord the audio from lecture.  I used the recordings to clarify my notes or better understand something I didn't catch at the time and I'd relisten to lectures before a final.  It was amazing how listening before a final would help with recall to answer questions. Or provide the points to write papers. \n\nPut assignments, deadlines then schedule studying/work time on a calendar and set reminders.   Review the syllabus and find out what is worth the most points, due dates, and what must get done (incrementally) to keep you afloat.  Don't procrastinate and prioritize your workload before you start.  Decide if you don't have time to do everything, what must be done so the time you spend is spent on the most important tasks.  This allows you to be strategic.   Occasionally you might have to turn an assignment in late but talk to your professors. Communication is everything.  \n\nAlso, college is an adjustment.  Stretching and doing something new sometimes feels impossible because you've never done it before.  It feels overwhelming, just know you are not alone and that what you are experiencing is normal.  Also, you are smart enough and have what it takes (a lot of people also experience impostor syndrome.  I did too.)  you just need time to figure it out so be patient with yourself.  Good luck.",

You may feel like the least intelligent person but other people probably feel the same! \nIf your professors offer office hours, go to them! Talk to them, ask questions, voice your concerns. If they aren\u2019t willing to listen to you they aren\u2019t a good professor.  And professors remember students who go to their office hours and are visibly putting in effort. \nAlso go to tutoring! Don\u2019t be ashamed to get help! \nAnd finally remember that grades are not a measure of your intelligence, but rather a measure of your ability to follow instructions. Good luck and hang in there!

I can tell you about some things that helped me organize it all (because it is a lot to take in)\n\n\\- get into the habit of using a planner. i've tried all types from digital to physical. it's what works best for you.  but i will title it the class and write down what i need to do for that class and i will (try to) put it in order from priority to not priority but you get the just.  this way when i go through it i can see i have crossed it off and completed whatever for each class and you feel accomplished seeing so many crossed off. sometimes ill write small things like \" look at email\" just to cross it off lol\n\n\\- i started putting my assignments/quizzes/exams  into google calendar or Notion and making a widget for my phone home screen that showed me what was due. this helped A LOT.  this was something that was such a big help for me and it took a bit to do but TRUST ME it helps!\n\n\\- i like to follow instagrams called STUDYGRAMS? theyre fun ways to see what other apps, tips and tricks other students are using and i have learned a lot from that \n\n\\- talk to your professors. meet them in person or online. email them and show initiative.  ask tons of questions and see if you can talk to some graduate assistants that could give some of their own personal advice.\n\n\\- the transition from high school to college is .. in my mind.. a culture shock... it is a whole new way of living and adjusting and you will find what works best for you over time. it will take trial and error and i know we dont want to hear that but that's life and the good with the bad is all to be appreciated because it helps you grow :)\n\n\\- its easier said than done but try not to be so hard on yourself. you are in college and you are going to do so great and meet a boat load of amazing people and professors and have so many doors open for you that you would never have imagined!\n\n\\- the transition from remote learning back to campus will impact you in ways you cant quite explain. i know this first hand after my first week back- and im graduating w my masters this semester... and a few of my fellow student friends have mentioned this. but one step at a time!\n\n\\- the big picture is overwhelming. theres a lot of information thrown at you this week.  But, its everything that you can handle. i really feel that getting organized is the best way for you to calm the heaviness you are feeling. i also am saying this because i feel overwhelmed and i know this is how i feel every first week of a semester lol.\n\n\\- when you study... this is important.... set a timer... study for 45 minutes and take a break for 10-15min. studies have shown this is the most effective way to study, retain information and not get burnt out. \n\n\\-\\^ also its consistency. when you are learning a subject make sure to go back to what you learned the week before and review when you have time. this way you can pull it from your memory which increases the chances of it staying in the \"long term\" memory part of your brain. i have studied the book \"ultra  learning\" as well as the relation of quality of sleep and studying retention and i like to learn about the most efficient ways to study and learn overall.  Don't get me wrong I have rewatched an entire semester of lectures the days leading into finals etc and it works for me but the consistency over the entire semester is what will help you most!\n\n\\- get outside, whether its a short walk or sitting outside to call a friend and siting in the grass... it helps A LOT\n\nI hope these help you and maybe help someone else. if you want to ever chat please message me i would love to answer any questions you might have I have been at UNLV since Spring 2019 and I've gotten familiar with a lot here.  Also, sorry if it's written with typos anywhere lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Veronica",

If it is science classes maybe that is not the major or class for you. You can change classes the first 2-3 weeks of school and maybe you should pursue general Ed requirements first.

      "text": "im just starting my second year now, the first year was definitely rough for me, i won't lie to you. i got worse grades than i was getting in high school even though i felt i tried much harder. it was really frustrating. it wasn't until this past summer semester that i felt like i got ahold of it, and i went from taking 5 or 6 classes to 2. taking a smaller amount of classes helped me figure out how to do better in them, because i had the time to try out different strategies for studying/doing homework. if you can, try to drop a class, and definitely don't give up yet. try to keep a positive attitude; i am pretty pessimistic in general myself but i realized recently that having a positive attitude towards getting the work done helped a lot (even if you have to force it/fake it a bit!) having a negative attitude just makes plowing through the work feel so much heavier. one of the best things i can advise you to do is make some kind of weekly planner/to-do list, or have someone help you make one for all your assignments for the week. it can be overwhelming to look at all your assignments at once, if you break them up into smaller portions you can just take it day by day. personally, i had my boyfriend make the schedules for me so that it wasn't just me i had to be responsible for, but also the person making the schedule. this made it easier for me to actually feel i had to do the work in a time of online school and self motivation which i am not always the best at. it's a big change, college is definitely a lot harder than i was expecting it to be, but eventually im sure you'll get into the swing of things! good luck!",

There's a ton of pressure to go to college, and it's really not critical to having a fulfilling life. I went to college right out of high school and I wasn't ready for it. I floundered for 3 semesters and then dropped out for a couple years. When I went back it was something that I'd had a lot of time to think about, and it was my decision rather than something I thought I had to do because people were telling me to do it. Now I'm graduating in May. Seriously, you can always go back. Don't grind yourself into dust if you aren't sure right now",

      "text": "Starting college and adjusting to college life can be an overwhelming experience, especially during the pandemic. Please don't be so hard on yourself.\n\nWhat type of school are you at? Community college, state school, etc? For many students, going to community college can help with the transition. Don't listen to people who look down on students who go to community college. It can be extremely helpful to help students get adjusted, allows them to explore different majors and career paths (and it's way cheaper/sometimes free too), and you get professors who are specifically interested in teaching and mentoring students. Honestly, I wish I did this when I was in college but I somehow felt ashamed of it at the time.\n\nYou may also want to talk to an advisor or counselor who can give you personalized advice. This is a common feeling for many freshmen. You may want to consider starting as a part-time student to ease into college. Don't feel bad about doing this either. You may have signed up/put in classes with difficult professors or professors who don't teach the way that you learn best. Your experience may be different if you take the same class with a different professor in a different semester.\n\nIf you are struggling a lot, take this as a sign that something needs to change but it doesn't mean that you are the problem or that you are less intelligent than your peers. You just need to figure out what works best for you. Reach out for support in your college. It is their job to help students!",

A good practice that I do personally is that every 30-40 minutes while studying I take a 5-10 minute break away from my computer, studies, etc. Always schedule time to relax. Your brain is putting in a lot of effort while studying, you have to give it breaks. As for feeling the least intelligent? Don't worry, if you look away from everyone who's coming out with answers to the teacher or leading group discussions, you'll see two other students being quiet because THEY ALSO FEEL LIKE THEIR THE LEAST INTELLIGENT. You're doing fine, its a new experience, once you get about another week or two in, you'll find a personal groove you can jam to. Don't give up, your adapting and thats the most stressful period.",

I wanted to drop out the first month because I felt I was struggling more then my class because I took a gap year and a lot of people didn\u2019t. It took about a month to get into the swing of school and understanding that a lot of people are in the same struggle boat! I noticed a person shared 4/5 of my classes with me and we became friends right away! Only to find out we were in the same sinking boat! We had each other to keep pushing through the exams and studying! And when it came to second semester and I finally hit the \u201cI CANNOT DO 5 CLASSES AND SUCCEED HOW I WANT\u201d wall. It is better to drop a course then to fail it! If you feel you are struggling and cannot do your best work while under so much stress DO NOT feel like you have to keep pushing just because you don\u2019t want to feel like a \u201cfailure\u201d or like you \u201ccannot do it\u201d because you can do it! Sometimes there is just an overflow that you cannot handle, and not a single person in school would/should judge you because we\u2019re all in the same struggle boat that is post-secondary education. Keep pushing and you\u2019ll find the right pace and strategies for you!",

In my first quarter of freshmen year, I really struggled. it was hard to get used to the idea of living on my own and being able to do what I wanted instead of HAVING to sit in my room to do homework on school nights. As happy as I was for the freedom, I also missed my family and pets a lot and that was hard to get used to.  Maybe you should have started with a smaller number of classes/ and taken an elective class pass/fail. You can still drop a course without consequences. Who cares if you are taking a lighter load? it is better than doing badly.\n\nAlso, colleges usually offer free tutoring in any subject. Find out where that is and do not be afraid to reach out. You should also talk to your professors or TAs... and be sure to visit them during their office hours or email them with any questions. Let them know feel that you are struggling and would like some extra help. You can even ask them to go over a paper and help you figure out what you need to fix - you just have to finish the paper a few days before it is due so that you can email it to them/ bring it to their office. Most of my TAs/professors were willing to go over my paper ahead of time and tell me what I needed to fix to get a good grade.  If you are struggling to find on-campus tutoring, don't be afraid to reach out to me. I can help you understand any subject but math or chemistry (evil evil courses!). Finally, ask some people in your classes if they would want to form a study group/ be your study buddy. Having someone to study with can really help!\n\nI would try to get through the first year at least before you decide if college is right for you or not. Everyone struggles in their first year - especially their first semester.  Don't feel bad if you believe you are behind your peers. That is very likely not the case, but if there are some people who are ahead of you, it is probably due to their high school preparing them better than yours did (some fancy private schools are called college prep for a reason!). That is not your fault, and you will soon catch up.\n\nReach out to me if you have any questions/ need some encouragement. I was a double major n history and sociology and also took a lot of psych courses.",

      "text": "Other people have already made these points, but just so you hear them again:\n\n1. A lot of people feel like they're the least intelligent person in class. It's definitely not just you feeling that way, and it's more than likely not true. I know this is easier said than done, but know that it's okay and normal to feel like you're going to flunk, but that it's still important to put in the work and not give up too early. Don't sell yourself short!\n2. At least where I went to undergrad, 5 classes at once is actually a lot. Now I don't think freshmen are even allowed to take 5 at once. So definitely don't beat yourself up if it feels like you have too much to do. Plus, if the drop period isn't over yet, I'd seriously consider dropping a course. Especially if it's one you know will be offered again, and/or it's either the hardest one you're in or the one you're least interested by.\n\nGood luck!",

If you find yourself really really stuck you can drop a class, this will give you a W in a transcript but once you take the class again and pass it the W gets replaced with whatever grade you got. However, make sure you know how this will affect your scholarships/financial aid. A lot of these have minimum yearly credit requirements, but you can catch up on credits over summer because they do count towards that year\u2019s credits.

The kind of patience you need right now is hard to muster when you are fresh out of high school.  Blinders on, whole focus kind of patience.

Don\u2019t indulge that part of yourself, it will sap up your precious energy that you need to succeed right now.  It\u2019s an immature part of yourself that you don\u2019t need.  You\u2019re in college, maybe if you were begging for food in a slum, sure, but you should think about your position in life.  \n\nIt\u2019s also a part of the test of college; will you just get frustrated and engage in some sort of escapism - partying, drugs, dropping out, etc - when the going gets tough or will you prove that you can handle whatever is asked of you and complete the task?  \n\nTalk your professors, they want you to succeed.  Don\u2019t be a jerk though, sob stories are tiresome and should be a last resort, just tell them where you need help.  Office hours are invaluable, use them.  \n\nDoes your school have tutoring and/or a writing center?  Use them.  \n\nGot extra cash?  Spend it on tutoring and conveniences that give more study time like microwave meals.  \n\nDON\u2019T PARTY, stay away from alcohol and hard drugs.  Don\u2019t forget to exercise and get outside, even just walking plenty or studying in a park.  Keep going to therapy.  \n\nPick up mindfulness - Thich Nhat Han\u2019s mindfulness books are definitely available at your school or local library.  \n\nAdmit defeat only when you are defeated, you haven\u2019t even made it to midterms!!!  You MUST steel your will.  \n\nThe most intelligent people in your classes could also very well be the the worst students - getting good grades is more than being \u201cintelligent\u201d (which is very subjective anyway).  Even still, there\u2019s a lot of dumb motherfuckers out there, if you really think you are the least intelligent person in ALL your classes then you jumping to conclusions - i.e. not being patient.

I would just stick to 3 because those 3 would literally take up all of my time. And I would  go out very rarely during the actual semester. By the end of my undergrad, I was completely burnt out. \n\nMy advice would be to drop courses if you can, and focus on just school if you can.

If you have even an iota of interest in your classes or other majors offered by your school, you should stay in college. If you simply dont care and would be equally happy practicing a trade like plumbing or working as a waiter, then you should do that. There is not necessarily any advantage to going to college if you can spend the years working in an industry you can build a career in. My friend went to college for four years and got a degree in english. When he got out, he worked as a waiter. It went great for him, he worked his way up, and he ended up managing a couple restaurants. I think he still values having gone to college\n Its where you make great friends and develop a work ethic. So college is right for you if you care about those benefits and are interested in the subject matter. Again though, there is nothing wrong with not going to college if you genuinely do not enjoy any aspect of it and have an alternative plan.\n\n\nYou shouldnt stop anything just because your self esteem is low. You can only continue and try your best, and if you fail, at least you failed while trying. That is an accomplishment itself because it takes a lot of fortitude to work when you feel like you arent good enough. But i promise you that you can do this. I got a D in one of my classes my freshman year because i didnt try hard enough. After that i started breaking problems down more and finding a more manageable study method. What major are you in?",

                  "text": "[Edit: the below advice may not be super helpful if youve already been in the workforce for a bit. If you have, the main thrust of my advice is instead to read the two books mentioned below. Read \"1L of a ride\" now. Read \"getting to maybe\" two weeks before law school starts.]\n\n\nIf you can get a position working in law in the area you are interested in, it is a very good idea to take a year to work in that role before law school. It will give you perspective and experience that will be invaluable in law school (though it is not the secret to high grades). Additionally, law school admissions committees are looking for people with unique experiences and spending a year in the workforce is one way to give yourself that kind of experience. \n\nIf youre trying to do K-to-JD (go straight in from undergrad), law school is completely doable without taking a gap year. But being in law school is like being sent adrift in an intellectual sea. It helps to know where you came from and where you are headed. To extend the metaphor, law school will steer your boat toward a rocky shoal to capsize if you dont have the perspective to zoom out and find the direction that's right for you.\n\nIt is worth noting the lsat isnt very much like law school. It is an entirely different manner of testing. If you dont do well on the lsat the first time, it is worth it to take it again and probably join the workforce for at least a year. \n\nBefore youre in law school, i highly recommend you read \"1L of a ride\" cover to cover. I also highly recommend you also read \"getting to maybe.\" And by highly recommend i mean, purchase and read those books soon after getting the news that you are admitted to a law school. You cannot skip reading either of these books, cover to cover.\n\nI will give you more specific advice if you can give me more specific info about your situation (what you want to practice, where you want to practice, your undergrad school and gpa, etc).\n\nMy last piece of advice is that law school, while truly rewarding in many instances, is in equal measure torturous, frankly. I generally do not recommend going to law school unless you are certain you like the field and certain it is the kind of work you will enjoy. That is why it makes sense to work as a paralegal for a year to determine whether it is for you.\n\nTo reinforce this point, I know many highly successful attorneys by objective measures (law review, big firm, etc) that were not happy in law school and arent happy at their jobs. I also know successful attorneys that are happy. Before going to law school, i recommend doing everything you can to determine whether you will be happy/find meaning in the work/be proud of what you do.\n\nIf you have any other questions, im glad to answer them.",

                      "text": "Thanks for the reply! I graduated college 10 years ago (I can't believe how much time has passed!). I graduated with a 3.8 - a double major in history and sociology. I am currently taking several paralegal courses in the hopes that after this semester, I will have enough skills to get hired at least as a legal assistant and possibly as an entry-level paralegal. Then I will continue taking classes to meet the paralegal certificate requirement/ become more hirable while I study for the LSAT. \n\nI have been working as my own boss - doing freelance writing, tutoring, pet sitting, trimming weed - whatever gig fell into my lap. I also took a bunch of vet tech courses and then decided I would NOT be happy working as a vet tech. Or I would, but I would be constantly broke because vet techs barely make above minimum wage and the work is hard on your body and on your mind. I had thought about going to vet school but I just am not good at advanced math and chemistry. My brain just does not work that way,  Plus in the long run, I don't think I would be happy dealing with humans who do not treat their pets like they should be treated or do awful things like putting them to sleep just because they are over having a dog. (DId you know that veterinarians have one of the highest suicide rats in the USA?)  So now that I have marked that off  I am ready to stop fooling around and actually have a steady source of income. \n\nYes, I realize the LSAT is its own beast. I actually think parts of the test are pretty fun. I have been taking it untimed and have scored fairly high (170) so my main worry is picking up the pace so that I can answer all the questions in the time limit.. I want to get as good of a score as ISAT so that schools will be generous with financial aid. \n\nI am not sure what field exactly I want to practice in. I am leaning toward criminal law so I can help fight  AGAINST/ dismantle the war on drugs.  But I am also interested in immigration law. I am going to try to get hired by one of those firms when I seek paralegal work.",

In fact, I tried to do too much back then and had no outside support so I eventually dropped out, and now I'm finishing at the old age of 30, haha. College is much more difficult than high school and it's a big adjustment for most people. \n\nThis is a good time in your school career for you to learn to practice self care while locking down your time management skills. It's not a good time to cram your schedule so full that you're overextended and burn out. Try to find some support and study groups, go to tutoring sessions and office hours, and imo take fewer classes as you adjust to college. You'll be okay!",

Granted I took 5 years since I worked through college but by my last year I had 2 or 3 classes per semester, and typically only one or two of them would really give me a hard time. Along with that, you get more interested in them as you get deeper into your major. Most people like college more and more as time goes on, the first year or two is always the worst.\n\nI literally got depressed for a bit during my freshman year.

Once I started working through things, then I started to do better.\n\nOne of the biggest causes of imposter syndrome, and one of the biggest problems you may encounter, would be perfectionism. Don't try and be perfect at everything. You'll never feel adequate with that mindset.\n\nAnd trust me, you're not the dumbest person in your class. You're 5 days in. Keep studying, attending office hours, etc and you'll do fine. There will be some cocky students who won't do this and who will fuck up their first exam. Those kids are the dumbest in your class.",
