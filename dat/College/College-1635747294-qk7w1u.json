  "text": "I\u2019m currently enrolled in my last year of classes. I\u2019ve always had anxiety since I was a kid and I\u2019ve learned how to handle it for the most part. But lately I\u2019ve been really anxious about my courses. I am doing well in all of them so far getting grades no lower than 90. However I keep having anxiety that I am going to continue doing all my work but that at the end of the semester I\u2019m going to find out I failed the class. I don\u2019t expect my quality of work to get worse or anything but I just can\u2019t let the anxiety and panic go. Is this level of anxiety normal and if anyone else has dealt with this what did you do to stop the anxiety.",
