I think it just heavily threw me off as everyone is usually quiet in this cafe and most go to the dining hall for socializing like that since it is a bigger area with more seats and this area is more commonly used for those who need internet but arent near the library",

      "text": "I think it depends. During peak hours, you can't expect people to be quiet in something like a cafe. That being said, if you come in off-peak hours and it's quiet, it would be rude to be super loud. In general, the conversation you're having should be kept at your table. However, if you really want a quiet space, go somewhere like an academic building or a library where.",

It is like 9am, typically this area is quiet unless someone has to take a class online (which I understand as this area is promoted for the internet use for people to work or eat). I probably should've just gone to the library but Im so used to it being quiet here since it is where me and a lot of other do work in the morning",

My college has a big eating hall which is where Im used to people going for convos or if they have a big group since tables only range from 3-4 seats here",
