  "text": "Hello, I'm a 26 male who's been out of school since 2013. I recently have been wanting to start college but I'm worried since I've forgotten a lot of school stuff since it's been almost 10 years. I was looking into medical fields and I have been looking into MRI tech recently but I'm scared if I start college I might end up messing up a lot since it's been a long time. What do you guys recommend that I can do or are there any classes that I can take that would prepare me for college?",

      "text": "I\u2019m older and have been out of school way longer than you, and I\u2019m telling you you should go for it.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that without a degree I\u2019ll forever be stuck in the shithole job I have. And times are changing. \n\nNow, to get just a decent paying job you have to have a bachelors. I\u2019m not even talking about comfortably living, I\u2019m just talking about not having to live paycheck to paycheck.\nPerhaps I\u2019ve set the bar pretty low but that\u2019s definitely a dream of mine.\n\nWill definitely be worth it in the end. And if you mess up just try again. There\u2019s absolutely no rush, so long as you get there eventually your good! There are resources and people that will be more than willing to help you. And I even come here for some help sometimes myself.\n\nI would definitely go to school.\nI would start off part time though, assuming your working, and work up from there. And even if your not, I wouldn\u2019t just jump right in full time as that could be too much of an overload too soon.\n\nI\u2019d talk to someone like an advisor at the school to see where exactly your at and what classes/prerequisites or the like you\u2019d need to take first to get you up to speed.\nRegardless of what degree you go for, start small if you have to. Doesn\u2019t matter how much refreshing or what have you that you need. Once you get the ball rolling you\u2019ve already improved yourself by a lot.\nAnd if by chance you find out later school is not for you, then you\u2019ve still improved yourself by trying. So now you know, and can work towards something else if you so desire.\n\nI would definitely go. Don\u2019t let that kind of mindset slow you down. I regret allowing it to do that to me for so long and wish I wouldn\u2019t have let the fear and procrastination hold me back from all those years.\n\nThere are tools to help you, it might be hard, but it\u2019s not all going to be. If you try then you e just won half the battle.",

      "text": "As someone a year older than you and just started on their bachelor\u2019s, go for it! It\u2019s an adjustment for sure. I ended up speaking to my professor of my first class after running into him, and he said that typically, older students end up doing well. It took me a long time to get to where I am, and for the longest time, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with myself. It\u2019s working out for me way better than the time I went right out of high school, so I\u2019d like to encourage another older 20-something to do the same!",

          "text": "Can confirm: graduated high school 2014 and went to college January 2015. Failed 3 of my classes and dropped out. Just started going back again in January 2020 and it\u2019s going amazing in terms of grades and GPA which is all I care about. \n\nIf you want to do it OP, just do it. Don\u2019t let the fear of forgetting everything from high school hold you back because chances are you didn\u2019t. And if you did there will be classes they\u2019ll have you take to get you back up to speed. \n\nBut also past gen eds, there\u2019s a very real chance you won\u2019t need things like hardcore math or English Literature knowledge for whatever major you choose.",
