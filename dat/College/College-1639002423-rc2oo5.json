  "text": "I know the typical questions about how to make friends have been asked many times, especially on this sub. But what I would like to do, especially with the next semester coming up, is branch out and find more friends. Typically, I eat meals alone but that doesn't really bother me because I am sometimes busy and need to eat quickly. I do have two platonic friendships with two girls but I'd like a little variety in my friendships as I feel like it's socially risky to only hang out with one group of people. I've talked on and off with people in my classes but haven't gotten very far in becoming friends with them. Do you have any tips for expanding your social circle?",

Then ask to do something outside of school. Hit up the campus corner or do something fun, topgolf, bowling, shoot pool, etc.",

There just hasn\u2019t been a lot of opportunity during covid to be social and connect. I\u2019ve made some of my closest friends at work. We seem to bond over the ups and downs of the job and even after I left the job for another, Ive maintained great friendships w these peeps.",
