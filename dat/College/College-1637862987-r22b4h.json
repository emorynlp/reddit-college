  "text": "I'm currently a 10th-grade student and I am planning on AP Calc BC next year. I thought that it was just s regular AP class where if you get a good score, you get the credit in college. However, it says:\n\nPrerequisite: \u201cA\u201d average in Honors Pre-Calculus or teacher recommendation from Honors Pre-Calculus \\*Dual Credit at Waubonsee Community College available MTH 131 and MTH 132\\*\n\nHow does dual credit work?
