  "text": "Pay well as in starting at least at 50 to 60k.\nI'm almost done with my associates in Psychology but lately I've been debating on what I want to do with myself career wise. I will be pursuing a Bachelors next fall but I don't know if I want to continue Psychology or just finish off with a different bachelors and get working because of the cost of college. I've always struggled with this.\n\nI've tried the medical field and I don't like it. I've thought about Marketing and HR.\n\nAny recommendations would be helpful. Thanks",

      "text": "Engineering as a whole has the best starting salary. Computer, Electrical, and Chemical have the highest starting salaries I believe. Computer science is also a great option.\n\nBusiness has a lower starting salary (but could probably meet your 50k range), but has the potential for a higher ceiling. Engineers start higher and is a very stable job, but the ceiling is lower. About 6 years from now I'll probably top out my easy career growth unless I go into management. There are still a few more levels beyond that but they are much fewer and further between. Business, if you're willing to put in the time and chase the right job titles and salaries, can be extremely lucrative 10 or 15 years down the road.",

                  "text": "Not OP but I am also a computer science student. Generally, I would say my classes have been divided into programming and math/theoretical. The programming classes are generally learning some kind of theory about computer science, and then apply it using code. This can span many different sub-fields of computer science, including computer vision, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, databases, etc. Then, there are the more mathematical/theoretical classes, which are either run of the mill math classes (calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics), or theoretical computer science, which is basically the math behind how computers work. But the math is often more \"logical\" than calculus, if that makes sense, it's more like a brain teaser than doing rote integrals and derivatives.\n\nThere are a lot of online courses that teach computer science. If you're interested, I've heard good things about  Harvard's free course on EDx, complete with assignments and tests.
