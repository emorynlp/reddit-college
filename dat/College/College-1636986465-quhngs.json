  "text": "Hello all, \n\nI am on my last semester of University, and am currently set to graduate this December, I also got an amazing job this semester that was full time and because of that I am not going to be able to pass one of my classes, I neglected it too much. The thing is, I don\u2019t need the class, I already have all the necessary credits to pass, I just need to complete my capstone, which I have nearly have, yet, I don\u2019t like failing, I know I didn\u2019t need the class, and I can\u2019t withdraw from it since it\u2019s too late, but I can\u2019t shake off the feeling from failing, how do I get over this?",

      "text": "You could always try to reach out to the teacher and see if you could get some sort of credit for the assignments or see if there\u2019s some way you could earn extra credit. Or even retake the class at a CC for shits and giggles after you graduate. \n\nBut really, just take it as a learning opportunity on the consequences of when you don\u2019t hold yourself accountable. Also, focus on the bigger picture. You may have failed one class but you\u2019ve almost graduated college and got a degree. That\u2019s more than 61% of Americans can say who only have some college credits.",
