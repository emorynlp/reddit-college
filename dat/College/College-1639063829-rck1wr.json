  "title:": "Organic chem Professor has a final exam on blackboard due a day earlier than scheduled and announced.",
  "text": "Also made instructions confusing. Claimed to be open notes but then says that notes are against honor code. Then states it needs to be taken during synchronous class time although she said we could take it whenever beforehand\u2026 not to mention that time would be 8 am tomorrow, not today when it\u2019s now due. I asked and sent two emails and have not gotten a reply. I\u2019m furious because it\u2019s not unlike her to make these mistakes and be last minute about posting things resulting in many mistakes. I also suspect many questions will be on material not covered very well. Should I contact my advisor? Would it be reasonable to ask for a curve that either the professor or the department chair could give?",

Luckily minutes after posting this she replied to one of my emails and tried answering one of my questions, although she said she had already fixed it, referring to the announcement that she fixed the date even tho it posted and is still not fixed. Would\u2019ve been nice for my other 3 questions to be answered.",

          "text": "Sorry to bother you, but I guess I have a new better question about the situation. If she does not move back the due date to when it\u2019s supposed to be due and we don\u2019t get it done by tonight, does she have the right/ability to fail us on the test if she chooses rather than extending it to the proper due date? Like would she be technically required to fix it since on the syllabus, announcements, and school wide registration and schedule system states the exam is tomorrow?",

While I get that this is frustrating, this is cutting your nose off to spite your face and will get you nowhere.\n\nYou can email the chair and complain about the date and explain that you already emailed the professor and got not reply.\n\nYou should so the exam",

I just find it unfair for not only myself but also worry about my peers who aren\u2019t as cautious checking assignments and/or due dates under the assumption the already scheduled exam date is accurate. I will get it done tonight if needed but I\u2019m busy doing work in a lab today that I scheduled because I knew my organic exam was scheduled to be due tomorrow. Thank you for your help again.",
