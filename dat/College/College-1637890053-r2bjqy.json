  "text": "Hey! I\u2019ve always done school from home with note paper that I put into a two inch binder for each class, as I have some texture issues and cannot STAND the feeling when my hand touches the coil of the notebook. I\u2019m going into university next year and know a binder for each class just won\u2019t work. Any recommendations for cheap non-coiled notebooks that are college-ruled? I can only find ugly composition notebooks that are wide ruled :\u2019(",
