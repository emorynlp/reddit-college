  "text": "We had an exam worth 1/4 our grade. I got a 60, I spoke to others and most received under 69. I said in the class group chat that it was hard for me to sleep with such a low grade but at least we are all in it together........ Or so I thought. Turns out at least 8 people (that I am aware of) put in writing in the group chat they cheated. The exam was on the computer in class with the prof walking around, it's a large lecture hall. People had google and the power point slides out on different tabs and got C+s and B-s. If a large enough portion of the class passed then the professor most likely will not curve or reevaluate the difficulty of the exams (first time professor). I'm fuming!!! I have half a mind to tell the prof now that I have confessions in writing, but my mom said don't be that person. My college is also filled with students that do indeed say snitches get stiches. I texted with 2 other students who got the same grade as me and they said exactly that, but I am wondering if that should even count when it's a room filled with biology majors in a class mandatory to go to med school, PA school, and nursing school. I just don't know what to do to the point that I already couldn't sleep one night and had a panic attack.",

      "text": "Update: My professor hinted that she knew people cheated, I didn't even tell her but I was in a class of 40, and this was a class group chat with 30 people in it. She just said everyone do the latest homework, trust me. Then she took me and 3 other students aside and said she knows she isn't the best at narrowing down information on the slides (400 + slides per exam, at most 50 questions) so the four of us will decide what is important since we are active participants in class and have shown the most dedication to being in a health care field (we all did healthcare jobs/ extracurriculars other than being students). Also from speaking to them before none of us cheated and all got under 69. Now we four get to choose the slides the professor bases the test questions on (we still need to choose 100 slides in all and no repeat information for at most a 50 question test).",

This prof has never been a prof before (at least in under graduate) and this is a sophomore level class. If she thinks the exams difficulty is fair it would not change for the other 3 making the class more difficult than it should be compared to the quality of teaching, expectations, and not to put down the school I am at but it's considered a school for those people you wonder how they passed high school. It's more about that the grade will not be curved and the level of difficulty for the rest of the semester. If the hard working students were getting C+s on the exam and someone cheated to get an A I'm fine with it. It's the repercussions of her thinking it's all ok.",
