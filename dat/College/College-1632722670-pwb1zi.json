  "text": "Ok so things kind of suck right now and my family is relocating, I still live at home with them to save money so I'm going with them and also because I want to leave my current state so I might as well grab the free ride.  \n\nThe problem comes with my school situation, I'm in the first semester of my second year and I haven't exactly met the transfer requirements, for units and gen ed, my gpa is fine, for the 4 year in my new state so I'm assuming I'll need to do lower division there as well. \n\nThe problem is, I can't find any resources online for how to do this and everything that turns up is always about transferring to a 4 year which I don't really think is an option for me ATM.\n\nSo if anyone has any advice or instructions about that I'd GREATLY appreciate it, thanks\n\nI REALLY don't wanna lose 3 semesters' worth of credits [I'd like to at least salvage some]",
