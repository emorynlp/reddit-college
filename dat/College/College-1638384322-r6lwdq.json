  "text": "This is my first term of freshman year. My college is very rigorous. Not Ivy League level, but close. My professor is known for being one of the most difficult professors in the department.\n\nI missed 1/5 of the term due to a serious circumstance outside of my control. While I\u2019d rather not disclose the specifics, I was not able to go to class or do homework during this time, resulting in missing assignments and reduced understanding of the content. \n\nI had a B+ in the class until I bombed the final. My final grade is a B- and the class average is a B. I feel very discouraged. I like math, but I don\u2019t want to wreck my GPA if I am bad at it. I was considering majoring in math, computer science, physics, stats, or economics, but now I don\u2019t know. \n\nI have a few questions and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can offer some advice.\n\n* How bad is this B-? Am I blowing it out of proportion? Or am I not taking it seriously enough?\n* How much would this B- effect my chances of getting into a good grad school?",
