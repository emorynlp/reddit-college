  "text": "I'm currently finalizing my undergraduate thesis, and I'm considering dedicating it to my sister who passed away last year. I know that, because it's only a bachelor's thesis, the only person who will likely read it is my advisor (unless I use it for a grad school application, but that's undecided), but it's more so just something that I personally want to do. Would this come off as pretentious, or am I just completely overthinking this?",

      "text": "Personal answer: How could such a touching dedication be considered pretentious? Your sister was likely there through all your previous school days. As you close this chapter to your academic life and strike out on a new adventure, thanking your sister for her part in your success (and for coming along for the ride) is an incredibly sweet gesture.\n\nProfessional answer: I've read doctoral dissertations dedicated to parents, spouses, siblings, children, faculty, advisors, God, even pets. No one would look sideways at your dedication.",

          "text": "I think I overthought it too much and was worried that including a dedication for this would come off as me taking myself too seriously or something, simply because it\u2019s not a postgrad thesis or dissertation, it\u2019s more or less just a normal paper that happens to be 15 pages. \n\nYour comment helped calm me though, so thank you for that. She was excited to see me graduate college one day, since she never did herself, so being able to dedicate something like this to her makes me feel like she\u2019s still cheering me on, in a way.",
