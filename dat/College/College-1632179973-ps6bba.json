  "text": "I am taking a higher-level proof-based math class and while **preparing** for my midterm I came across this question in the book that I could not solve. I looked up the solution online and understood how it is to be done. \n\nFast forward 2 days, my IN PERSON math exam had the exact same question and I obviously knew how to do it. I used the same method as the solution I saw with similar numbers, notation, etc. Of course, I wrote it in my words, so it's not the same as the solution online word for word, but very similar (it's math!). \n\nThis was kind of a hard question in the exam. Did I just get lucky??",

      "text": "It's surprisingly difficult to come up with good exam questions for math-related classes.  For this reason, professors often \"borrow\" exam material from other sources.  \n\nThere are several aspects of this to consider.\n\n1. You did not have advance notice that any problem would be on the exam.\n2. Every one of your classmates had the same ability to access the material you accessed.\n3. Your intention in reviewing the solution to this specific problem was not to gain an unfair advantage, but to understand how to solve problems of this type in preparing for the exam.\n4. Your professor could have written his or her own exam, but chose not to, because s/he is lazy.  \n\nSo you got lucky.  I suggest you not raise this with anyone in your class, your professor or any graduate student involved in assisting with teaching the course. \n\nHowever, knowing now that your professor *borrows* exam material from this specific source, you know that future such exam questions might also come from the same source.   Consider whether your intentions may change if you looked up the solutions to future problems of this type in the future.",

We were also allowed to bring an A4 piece of paper with us to the exam with whatever we wanted on it. While I was studying I came across a question that I really couldn't understand without a lot of trouble so I wrote a condensed version of the solution on my cheat sheet in case we had something similar in our exam.\n\nWe had the exact same question. I could just copy my solution directly from my equation sheet and be guaranteed 100% on that question. And we had <10 questions, so it was a big chunk. I told the professor what happened after I handed it in and he said it was fair game: you do the study, you might come across questions that are reused that year.\n\nYour professor knew this was a possibility when they used questions from the book. If anything, it's to reward people who go to the effort of studying.",

That is deeper than surface level knowledge, but not 'super in-depth'. I would argue if you can originally come to the same conclusion up till your associations organically, from scratch, then you have deeper understanding because you have combined rhizomatic-like thinking into liner construct so as to work backward to the start. Like collating the roots of a flower until there is an intersecting point to the base of the stem, and going all the way up to surface level.\n\nTo create a new species of flower using the structure of the previous flower would be even more depth by virtue of understanding the blueprint. But to recognize that the flower has roots and to be able to understand that you can apply these roots to another flower so as to create this new flower... it isn't the same as being able to construct a flower of another species using the same base of knowledge. In other words, connections and application supersede the \"pattern\" in question: the pattern is part of connections, association, and application but only a smaller subset. \n\nJust me 2 cents anyway.
