  "text": "Should I not go back to school if it takes longer than two year to graduate and im 26? I dropped out mid way when I couldn't figure out what I want to do with my life.  I struggled with depression anxiety and didn't know what I wanted to study due to worrying about job prospective if I study certain subjects.  I have no idea what to do if I don't go to college since education is all ive known in my life. I am 26 and I am afraid I am too old to back to study in school. I am a woman and men told me education is useless for women because we are meant to rely on men and be a housewife lol.   (but wouldn't they judge me if I dont have a degree too?)  People  will judge me for staying in school too long while others are working. I feel so fucking behind in life and I don't know if it is wise decision to work towards my degree in my rest of my 20s. I do not want to work in dead end retail jobs because I know I can do better than that. Any advice or insight will be helpful. Thanks.",

      "text": "No its never \"too late\" to get a degree, *especially* if youre still in your 20s. Youre going to be 30/40/50 anyway, might as well be those ages with a degree\n\n>men told me education is useless for women and judge me if I am still in school in my 20s.\n\nThats misogynistic bullshit. Whoever told you that doesnt deserve to even be in your life, what kind of backwards ass perspective is that?? Fuck them\n\n>People will judge me for staying in school too long while others are working. \n\nWhat people? Why does their judgement matter? Its *your* life, you cannot and should not live it for the expectations of other people. If you do that you are guaranteed to be miserable",

      "text": "It might depend on the degree - it's worth it if you get a degree that qualifies you to be paid really well.  One great situation is if you get a decent paying job working for the state or for some company that offers tuition reimbursement benefits - then you go to school free while earning a living.  It's just a tough schedule...  \n\nRemember, it's okay to take just 2 classes at a time, and really go through it in a chillaxed way, taking your time.",
