  "text": "Hello [r/college](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/)\n\nI am an Australian final year electrical engineering student (graduating at the end of 2022). I failed a subject in 2019 (vector and complex calculus if anyone is wondering). Even though now I am doing fine academically, with a 5.14 out of a scale of 7.0 (where a 5.0 is the minimum score required to apply for most internships) and have secured internships across both 20/21 and 21/22 summers, I regret not trying harder in 2019 for several reasons.\n\n* I will be graduating later than my cohort, taking 5 years to do what is normally a 4 year degree. This leads me on to my next point.\n* I don't know too many people as my friendship group has graduated from university at the end of this year. While I keep in touch with my friends, this makes things such as honours project (what Americans would call a capstone project) harder. I have talked to some acquaintances from my university's rocketry team to see if they are interested in working with me but I haven't received any guarantees yet. Additionally, I have asked some of my fellow interns to see if they're interested in working with me on the honours project.\n* I ruined my last summer of freedom before COVID struck, at first trying in vain to study for the supplementary examination, and then in a depressed rut after seeing that I failed the supplementary examination. I just have this nagging feeling that if I pushed myself a little bit harder in vector calculus that I would have enjoyed my last summer of freedom before the pandemic.\n\nAny help in terms of making new friends at university after my friends from my cohort have graduated and forming groups in honours (capstone) project would be sincerely appreciated. I also am asking for advice for how to come to terms with ruining my 2019/2020 summer which was the last summer before COVID-19 hit.",
