  "title:": "Is this Enough of a Reason to Transfer?",
  "text": "I am currently a freshman marketing major that goes to a school in Chicago, and am considering transferring. It's not that the situation is bad, but it could be better in my eyes, I feel that part of that lack of experiences is because I commute from my home almost an hour away to save money. Part of me though is not satisfied here, I have a great urge to go to school somewhere out west in a place where I am within reach of nature and natural stuff, and in a place where I can experience something new. Chicago is awesome, but I lived here for a long time and feel like I would be better suited somewhere else. \n\nI guess I am looking for any input on if this is enough of a reason to transfer, and maybe any recommendations of schools with good marketing programs that are either in the west or in/close to an area with an abundance of nature! Thank yoi=u",

I know that all the California public schools have a crazy out of state tuition, but I was looking more towards a private school and getting financial aid, and I know that some public schools give out a decent amount of aid.",

I\u2019m also a freshman who wants to go out of state, but I chose CC two to save myself two years' worth of debt. \n\nIf you need a change of scenery, then by all means look at transferring elsewhere. But keep in mind that transfers generally receive less financial aid from universities. And if you aren\u2019t from a low-income household, don\u2019t expect to be getting much.\n\nYou should ask yourself if an extra year and a half of debt is worth it in the long run.",
