  "text": "The course I\u2019m talking about is Data Structures.\n\nI just got my midterm score back and got a 39 on it. It\u2019s worth 20%. I haven\u2019t been able to submit the programming assignments all and the one written assignment I have is probably going to be >50%. Assignments are worth 30%. I still have a few more assignments left which I\u2019m trying to make sure I start early for if I can.\n\nThen there\u2019s the final exam. It can replace my midterm grade if it is higher, but I also have to make sure I pass it. The reason for that is there\u2019s a rule: \u201c(0.3 * written homework percentage)+(0.7 * final exam percentage) must exceed 50% or you will receive a grade of F in the course\u201d.\n\nI have heard from others who took this course that it is hard, but it\u2019s been just constant busywork with keeping up with assignments and material. I really want to pass, but that final has got me worried since there\u2019s this \u201cexpectation\u201d.\n\nI just want to assess at this point if it\u2019s still possible to pass this course.",

      "text": "Haven't been able to submit assignments or have made choices that have caused you not to do them? My guess is that doing what you call \"busy work\" was actually scaffolded small assignments to help prepare you for the exam. I would suggest withdrawing getting your shit together, learning new study habits, and coming back to try again when you are ready to put your all in. Even if you can technically pass, do you want a c on your record when you could try again for something better or risk a D/F and have to retake it anyways?",
