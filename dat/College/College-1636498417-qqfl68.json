  "text": "Background Info: I am currently a sophomore in my undergrad, hoping to get into a grad school (but it\u2019s not likely).\n(Anyways, on with the \u201cstory\u201d)\n\nIt hit me last week. There was a mini-seminar ran by professors to educate some students on what their grad school experience was like. I know this sounds dumb, but it never got me until now, at 19 years old, how hellish grad school is going to be. And honestly? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for it. I\u2019m not competitive enough to be the best among a group of peers. I\u2019m not the best of the best. I\u2019m not..anything. Out of 8 BILLION people, what do I have to offer? Nothing! My hopes and dreams are crumbling around me as I just am a bystander watching it all fall on top of me. \n\nAlong with that, something happened today that made me break down and cry as I sat down and thought to myself for about an hour what I\u2019m even doing. Not in my field or in college, but living in general. Basically I was in my zoology class (I\u2019m a bio major) and we were dissecting a shark. Sound cool, right? Well, honestly, I was a bit grossed out and didn\u2019t touch it much. I helped explain what parts we needed to find and observe separately to my lab partner who did more of the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d. By the end of it I questioned how I could be so squeamish when a few years ago I wasn\u2019t like this at all. My partner joked that I\u2019ve gotten weaker. That got me thinking how much I truly have gotten weaker. If I can\u2019t be willing to get my hands dirty or stick my arm up a shark, HOW am I expected to thrive in a biology field or an outdoor field research type thing? \n\nI feel like I\u2019m on the wrong path. I\u2019m just the same somewhat-suicidal, anxious, terrified-of-failure perfectionist I\u2019ve always been. I\u2019ve spent more of my life anxious and scared than I have happy. If this is the rest of my life, then what is the point? \n\nI haven\u2019t done an internship yet. I only have about a 3.7 GPA. I\u2019m terrified of driving. I obviously can\u2019t dissect animals. And I want to be an entomologist or virologist. What is my future? Is there even a future worth living for me? I may be a bit dramatic but I just don\u2019t see a point to this anymore.",

      "text": "Take a deep breath. You'll be fine. \n\nFor what it's worth, I feel you on this, and I'm *in* grad school. I absolutely love what I do, but some days I feel exactly like you do now. \n\nI think it might be helpful to realize that there are *way* more career paths out there than you're even aware of yet. I have an undergrad degree in the performing arts and am pursuing a career in biostatistics. I didn't even know that biostatistics was a field when I was your age, let along what a biostatistician does (by the way, there's no grossness involved in biostatistics and you should look into it if you like math). \n\nWe're led to believe when we're young that being the \"best\" is the most important thing. It's not. The most important thing is that we're \"good enough.\" A 3.7 is most definitely \"good enough.\" \n\nNot only that, but it's totally normal to not know what lays ahead of you and to be afraid of it when you're 19 years old. You're totally new to being an adult and it's all being dumped on you at once. Not only do you not have to have all the answers now, but no one (aside from yourself and maybe your parents) *expects* you to have all the answers.\n\nTake it one day at a time. You might not have it all figured out right now, but you'll get there. If you put one foot in front of the other and keep pushing, everything will be okay, even if it doesn't feel like it.",

I'm doing \"good enough.\" And I sometimes feel like a failure, but people tell me I'm doing a good job, so I trust them. It's important to reality check yourself sometimes-- I know many, many people who would be extremely jealous of a 3.7-- an outside opinion helps put things into perspective.\n\nI somehow manage to come across literal geniuses on a regular basis, and it skews my perspective. I want to be like *them*. We all want to be the 4.0 student who studies at a top school and \"wins\" at life. Life doesn't really work like that, though, even for the people we perceive as the most \"successful.\" We're all just human, going through life doing human things. It is what it is, and it's okay.",

I try to tell myself that, but I can\u2019t. Hell, I go to a liberal arts college. An ARTS college for SCIENCE. In the middle of Indiana. I\u2019m certainly not #1, not by a long shot! But I can\u2019t stop holding myself to a standard of perfection. Anyways, I don\u2019t want to keep babbling. Thank you for your advice, I really appreciate it! And I hope your college experience proves to be successful. :)",
