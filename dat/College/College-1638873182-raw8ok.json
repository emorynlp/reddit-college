  "text": "I had this happen and when I explained the teacher didn\u2019t care. Honestly I would\u2019ve loved to blown in her face with the amount of times she wasted time asking about other students kids.\n\nNow when other classmates get in late, they\u2019re late you continue with the class we\u2019re all adults here. Thanks god it\u2019s the last day of class I plan on confronting her next time when I return in campus",
