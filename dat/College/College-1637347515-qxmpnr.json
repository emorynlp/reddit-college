  "text": "For my class, we were assigned a 5page essay due the 14th at midnight. The date got extended to Friday the 19th. I just assumed it was due Friday at midnight as well. But I just reread it and I missed the fact that it said \u201cdue before Friday the 19th\u201d. It never mentioned a due time other than that. Should I email my professor or the ta? Or just turn it in before midnight like I had planned?",
