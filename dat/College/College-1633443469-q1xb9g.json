  "text": "Seems like no matter how hard I try to remain aware, I find myself hunched over like Quasimoto within minutes of sitting down. \n\nI can feel the strain on my back/neck getting worse, as well as notice difficulty breathing while sitting with poor posture. \n\nDo you think it could be due to my desk being too low, or not the right chair?? I thought so too, but I don't think I've ever sat at a desk that didn't have me slouching in minutes. \n\nThanks !",

Once you've gotten a comfortable posture, align your paper so you can see it and write. Most desks are uncomfortable, and often really old and not ergonomic whatsoever! You'll inevitably find yourself sliding into a slouch, so just keep that mental image of a soccer ball in your mind, and readjust.",
