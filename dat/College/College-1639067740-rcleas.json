  "text": "I met with one of the adults/recent graduates that works in the writing center at my university recently to go through a website I made for my thesis (first digital thesis done in the department). This is after I\u2019ve passed/already submitted it, etc, so my meetings with him are now just to fix the wording of my text before I start sharing it with people. He recommended getting Grammarly to look over the tone indicator so I was just looking into getting it and it\u2019s $30 a month?! Jesus Christ.\n\nEdit: if anyone knows of a place that will look over tone indicator that isn\u2019t that expensive please let me know lol",

      "text": "I haven't found anything better than Grammarly yet. So yes, the premiums are higher because they know what they sell. Give it a few more years. There are many Grammarly competitors on the horizon.  Just do a search for Grammarly alternatives and try em out. I have and didn't find anything close. \n\nAnother alternative is just keep using free version and work on tone yourself. It is not that hard. With a bit of practice, you will start getting a feel of it.",
