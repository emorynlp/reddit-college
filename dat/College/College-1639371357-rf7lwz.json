  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently in a process of being kicked out (although with a time period) by my parents as they are fed up with the way I am with my academics. I have all A's in my classes except my sciences which are mostly B's and a couple C's (along with dropping out of three science classes and one failed science class) I'm currently in Community College where I have been struggling a lot as I have been forcing myself to like a major which I have no interest in and only did so to make my parents happy. I was a Nursing Major then into a Biology Major to go into med school, and honestly, I wasn't happy with it. I decided to change my major next semester where I actually care and devote myself to which is Business. \n\nThe part is I understand why they are fed up with me as I do not have a job nor pay any bills and I understand how I am in the extremely lucky position as many others have to work, pay bills, and go to school. But I do not like my major in science and I'm really sorry for those who read this who have it more difficult than me. I also don't have the best mental health as I have really negative thoughts due to many factors which I do not really want to talk about. But to continue, I want to get a job but they don't let me as they want me to focus on my school but I want a job to move out, along with I don't know how to drive nor do I have a credit card to my name nor any money which causes me to stick to them when I want to have my own freedom. They suggested I either find a job and find a roommate which I don't mind because I just want to get my degree, but they keep trying to convince me to do the other option which is to go to the air force which I don't want to mainly because I have to wait to get my degree after 4 years although it would give me the space and time for me to grow. What are some suggestions or advice you guys have about this? Also how difficult is it to move out and continue college life in general?",

      "text": "I have experience here. 1. Quit school, for now. 2. Apply for ajob at UPS or one of the other big companies that offer $ for college. Try to get full time. If you cant, get another job. You will need to work60+ hours a week to get some $ saved up. You will need all the cash you can get for when you go back to school. Spending any on school right now is an expense you dont need. Secure a place to stay. Best option would be living with friends and splitting rent. I once lived in a rented house with 8 other guys. Messy but affordable, and fun-for a while. Save usmuch as you can for school, but the goal here is to get your employer to pay for school. Find out the details ans ask orhers who have done it. When you have your living situation figured out start plannging your reentry to college. Try to major in a field that your employer my need cause you woukd be an internal hire and have ahige advantage at getting hired.\n\nAlso, i have met scores of folks that were in the military and almost all of them are glad they did it. Sometimes i wish i had done it. But i get it its not for you.",
