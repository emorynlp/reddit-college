  "text": "Hello everyone. Before I start I\u2019d like to put a TL;DR before I speak so that if I\u2019m in the wrong subreddit I can be directed to the right place.\n\nTL;DR: My two friends from high school are both undecided and in completely different situations, and I feel like if they aren\u2019t guided now they will be wasting lots of time and money on college.\n\nSo I, 18M, go to University X. I have a friend, 18M, that also goes to University X, and a friend, 18M, that goes to University Y (very close). I want to preface this story by saying that I am very comfortable right now in college, about to have a 4.0 semester in STEM and premed. I am completely fine, which is why I have no idea what I would do in my friends\u2019 situations.\n\nMy friend that goes to University X originally intended to be an architecture major. He seemed to really like the idea of it, and we have other friends in the architecture major so he wouldn\u2019t really be alone. For some reason, two weeks into school, he went to his advisor in hopes of changing a class and ended up going completely undecided. His schedule sucked for the entire semester, and we barely saw each other unless we made plans on the weekend. He also plans on going undecided next semester as well. When I asked him why he did this, he said it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t really like anything. I asked him if he would be interested in every major under the sun that I knew of, but he just said no. He seems completely uninterested in attending or going to college, but at the same time he wants a degree. \n\nMy friend that goes to University Y, on the other hand, began his tenure there as a music major. However, a week before finals, he dropped out and did not even take any finals at all. He only told his parents and didn\u2019t consult any of his friends before making the decision. When he finally dropped out, I heard from a completely separate friend who attends University X, and I have still not spoken to him about the matter. He said the reasoning was that music was more of a hobby than a career, but I still disagree with the decision because he didn\u2019t take any finals or get credit, which is a waste of money. Apparently, he is planning on transferring to University X next semester and also going undecided. I have not yet asked him about what he likes to do.\n\nSo, given the situation I have, what does anyone think the best course of action would be? While one friend has no interest in anything, the other one is still yet to be interrogated. I was personally thinking of hosting an intervention and hopefully at least help them go in the right direction. Again, I want to help them because I can tell if nothing gets decided, they will end up wasting a ton of money.",

      "text": "I\u2019m going to be honest with you, but this really isn\u2019t an issue for you to solve. They chose to either drop out of school or go undecided. They chose to not consult you or anyone else about it. They don\u2019t know what is the right fit for them yet. They\u2019re still figuring it out and that\u2019s really what you\u2019re freshman year is about, figuring out what you really want to do or what future career interests you. You can\u2019t really bully them into picking majors because at the end of the day it\u2019s still their decision. It\u2019s ok to be concerned about their futures and if they ask for you opinion of something pertaining to this situation, it\u2019s ok to express your opinion and thoughts. But it\u2019s not ok to force them into something they don\u2019t want to decide yet. Holding an intervention on how being undecided is a waste of money and time is a sure-fire way to lose those two friends because you\u2019d basically be telling them that their plans right now are stupid because they\u2019re not like yours. \nSo my suggestion is to do nothing and only help when they ask you to. Still support them on this journey and be an open and understanding friend.",
