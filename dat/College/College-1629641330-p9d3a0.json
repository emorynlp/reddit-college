  "text": "I go to the dining hall alone a decent amount, when my roommates schedule and mine don\u2019t line up, and I think about asking others who are there alone to sit with them but end up deciding not to. Would you think it is weird, especially girls, (I\u2019m a guy) if a random person asked to sit with you? And how would you feel about it?\n\nEdit: I realize that it would make people uncomfortable even if my intentions are good, so I decided to not and just sit alone lol",

I mentioned the fact that I have a boyfriend as kind of an \"I'm not interested, but I don't wanna be rude\" kind of thing. But then the dude said,\" I don't see him here...but does he care if you have guy friends?\"  I then explained that we are long distance and somehow he took that as a go-ahead to keep flirting with me because \"he wouldn't have to know.\" I made up some lie in order for me to leave and then he was like \"can I walk you back to your dorm?\" I declined. I leave the dining hall and notice he's following me. Did not go back to my dorm until he decided not to follow me anymore.",

She was really upset about it for the rest of the day and avoided that guy around campus. I do not think YOU or that guy had bad intentions, but realize some men have VERY bad intentions so women have to be on edge about it. It\u2019s an entirely different reality.\n\nHowever, my sister went to a very small Catholic university and was shocked to see so many people eating alone when she visited me. She said it was rare to see anyone alone and if they were alone, it was customary to invite them to sit with you. So I guess it really depends on your school\u2019s vibe.",

      "text": "So, first off, definitely don\u2019t go with the intention of trying to hit on someone. That may work like one in 100 times, but it is generally not going to be received well. If you are interested, there\u2019s not really much you can do to help with that, but you need to start off by just striking up a conversation and not immediately jumping to \u201cwe should go out sometime.\u201c The only exception to this might be if you consistently see this person in a dining hall and they are giving you \u201cthe eyes\u201c, though even then I would approach with caution and respect. (Also, generally speaking, I would avoid using the term \u201cfemales\u201c when referring to women collectively. While I am not a woman, and I certainly don\u2019t want to try to speak for women, my experience has been that they generally dislike being referred to as females in a casual context. It can set off a lot of red flags, which you may not intentionally be doing, but could be off-putting to some). \n\nThat being said, I think this is definitely a problem that a lot of college students and adults in general face. It would certainly be great to have some kind of system to let people know that you are down to just chat with people. The reality is that a lot of times people sitting by themselves do you have a reason for doing so, but there are also definitely a lot of people who wish that they weren\u2019t by themselves. If you go to any college sub Reddit, you\u2019re more than likely to encounter some amount of posts that are something like \u201cI\u2019m lonely\u201d or \u201chow to make friends\u201d.  Ideally, there would be someway to discreetly signal to people that you are not opposed to meeting new people while seated and That people can approach and know they are meeting someone interested in talking. This should ideally be a discreet signal so as to avoid becoming synonymous with \u201cbeing a loser\u201c (which by the way, if you are having a hard time making friends, you definitely aren\u2019t a loser, but just trying to be realistic here and think about how these kinds of signals can develop into further stigmatization which is the opposite of what we want). I was thinking maybe turning a chair outwards or something of the sort, assuming that there is enough room and that you were not going to block the way. At the very worst, something like this could result in a few unassuming people sitting down at a table and people coming up and asking to sit, but would also be discreet enough to avoid becoming an obvious signal that you are looking to meet people.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a tricky issue, so just approach with caution and respect. Generally, the worst thing people can do is say no. It\u2019s hard and a lot of the time it\u2019s probably not going to be super great conversation, but sometimes it also could lead to the beginning of very good friendships.",

You want to meet girls then go say hi, be open honest and friendly, if they say no to that they were going to say no to anything anyway, so now you know, move on. But many people will be open to talk to you and you will meet some nice people.",

I'd feel terrified that other people could think I'm a loner by going up to them. It happened to me when I did a year in a French high school and one drop-dead gorgeous girl in heels came up to me like that, worried about me being all alone. I responded quite nervously and aggressively that I was fine. I was trying to signal that I was not \"weak\" or \"afraid\" when in fact, I was. The difference is that French people are just more confident and approachable I guess. \n\nHowever, nowadays, I would respond much more warmly to that after experiencing 18 months of purgatory (i.e. Covid). But others may be different. My advice is to not do it too abruptly and be patient. The more gradual you are with your approach, the better received it will be.",
