  "text": "Hello, not sure if this is the correct place to share this but I just realized I was 0.007 points away from magna cum laude. One of my professors harshly graded an assignment and I was bumped down from an A to a B. Has anyone been in this situation? I highly doubt I could talk to my school to convince them to raise my GPA by just those points since it wouldn't be fair to other students, or if it's even possible at all.\nOn another hand, I feel like I shouldn't complain since I still passed and finally graduated. What do you guys think? \nI hope everyone has a good one!",

Unfortunately I think these grades are final as of now but no biggie. Onto new goals! \ud83c\udf7b",

Graduating with honors is a big deal to the person that busted their butt through school to do so, and to miss a higher achievement by that small a margin is a bit of a gut punch to all of the effort put in. It isn't about anyone else giving a crap or future employers, but about wanting to achieve something personally, working hard at it, and missing it by *that* much. OP, you are perfectly justified in feeling bummed. Depending on how far back the harsh grading was, I may bring up the difference it made to the professor, whether it results in anything or not. Regardless, I hope you can still feel proud. It is an accomplishment and a big one, congratulations!",
