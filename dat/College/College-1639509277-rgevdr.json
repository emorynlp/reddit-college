  "text": "Hello, not sure if this is the correct place to share this but I just realized I was 0.007 points away from magna cum laude. One of my professors harshly graded an assignment and I was bumped down from an A to a B. Has anyone been in this situation? I highly doubt I could talk to my school to convince them to raise my GPA by just those points since it wouldn't be fair to other students, or if it's even possible at all.\nOn another hand, I feel like I shouldn't complain since I still passed and finally graduated. What do you guys think? \nI hope everyone has a good one!",
