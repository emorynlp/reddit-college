      "text": "Hey, depends what you like tbh. Both finance and accounting are great degrees to have. I have a friend in the accounting major who is going to a huge firm and making 75k right out of college. I have another friend who\u2019s in finance and accounting and she\u2019s going to a big bank (not sure what she\u2019s making) and she\u2019s working on Wall Street. My school has a really good placement rate for graduates",
