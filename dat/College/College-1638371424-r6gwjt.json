      "text": "That does seem expensive. Depends what the master's is in it might not be too awful. At least Johns Hopkins (it's Johns, not John) is a really good university -- definitely top 15. That doesn't change the fact it is expensive though, and there are probably less highly ranked universities which could offer similar education for cheaper. Is it a good idea? It depends on you.",
