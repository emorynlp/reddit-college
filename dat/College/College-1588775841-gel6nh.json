My dorm, my classes, being away from home, I ended up failing my first semester and spiraled mentally from there. I had a 1.2 gpa and a major I hated. I made one final attempt to switch majors only to be told by my counselor that it would be impossible. \n\nSo I switched to CC. Best decision I ever made, academically and mentally.",

Maybe I was just stupid or naive. I dropped out after 3 years, partly because my grades began falling due to stress and partly because I felt I had learned nothing in college and would be screwed if I did graduate. \n\nIt wasn't until a few years after I had dropped out of college that I realized the purpose of college was to learn a skill set, time management, how to bs, how to follow complex instructions,  be able to check a box on an application, and show future employers that I was teachable. Up to that point, I honestly thought the purpose of college was to train me on how to do a certain job, meaning that when I graduated an employer would hire me and I would immediately know how to do the job. I didn't know that even with a college degree, an employer would still have to train me and I would have to learn the new job.  \n\nAll that sounds really stupid now, but as an 18-21 year old, that is what I wished I had known before college.",

Being tagged in a post does not equal anything of real substance, commenting on a post, etc. That is all arbitrary and not indicative of anything real. The struggles of making friends and finding what you need out of it all is what literally everyone in college is going to go through. To my freshman sad/alone ass self in a bare awkward dorm room looking through photos of people online, I would\u2019ve said \u201cthis is it. This is what they actually all have.\u201d More or less",

A lot shoot for good universities, of course, it's not bad but you need to have the \"feel\" if the university is good for you. Universities big or small have their own bad systems and administrations, but a good school is where you can still feel some respect for the students.\n\nI used to study in a big university and hated it.\nTransfered to a smaller college in a province and loved it.\nNow I'm here in another \"Big\" college and hate it. \n\nThe work load wasn't different. Teachers weren't kinder. The people weren't simple to get along with either. The difference would be the resources you COULD get like student exchange or a good university brand for your resume.\n\nGo to your classes. Submit your stuff on time even if it's not your best work. The best way to manage your time is to have a hobby or interest close or relating to your program. It's fun and educational. Put effort in extra curricular too and learn other skills than just your major! \n\nI learned to speak to my professors as well with problems and questions. It doesn't really excuse my work but it's best that they have knowledge where I'm coming from like being depressed or having trouble understanding.",

You pay for the resources anyway, so you might as well use them.\n\n If you dont like the major you chose, change. I started out as an engineering major and my school had me take 18 units as a first time freshman (this is generally as many units as you're allowed to take for most institutions). I was wildly underprepared for the way my classes were taught (lecture vs project based learning), and that I needed something that was going to take in my creativity, not lush it on the back burner. I'm not going to spend thousands of dollars for something I'm going to end up hating to do. If you're not feeling in love with what you're learning, dont study it. \n\nProbably I wish I had gone to a CC out of HS. I know for many people CC is like a last resort option, because there's nothing glamorous about it-- but you're going to college to learn. It isn't as much fun as a big uni, but it cotst a helluva lot less. At the end of the day, it's about a work life balance. Your physical, mental, emotional  health carry as much value as your grades and class work. I have gone overboard on all of these and it has negatively affected me. \n\nLastly, and this is something it has unfortunately taken me 5 years to figure out, now is the time to try something new. Working out, spicy food, candles, studying at the library, exploring your sexuality, making friends with people you otherwise wouldn't, theater performance-- there are so many things to try-- dont limit yourself because you think you know what you like now.",

Sit in various areas, sit in sunlight, work at the time of day that works best for you, and a bunch of other tips to study properly. And don't sit around people who are just going to distract you!\n\nSit in front of the lecture hall or classroom. Always. Don't be sitting in the back, it really does make a huge difference. I don't care if it makes you nervous, just do it.\n\nIf you can't tolerate morning classes, then *do not take morning classes* (unless you have to). Likewise, if you can't tolerate 3-4 hour lectures, *then do not take them.* There's a trade off though so you have to pick and choose your vices here. \n\nAlso, never fall behind in a class. In fact, be ahead of the game. Once you catch yourself doing that, do your best to catch up because the semester is going to be real rough if you don't stay on top of it. \n\nI also realized I can't multitask to save my life, so don't be juggling 50 responsibilities at once. If you can, try your best to devote much of your time for homework.\n\nStudy groups are basically essential for your science courses. \n\nLastly, please make use of university counseling.

Do this as soon as you get the syllabus! That's key! You'll never be surprised if you do this. \n\nQuick tips: \n\n1.you can copy the previous assignment event in your calendar and just edit the name and date to fit. So if Assignment 1 is due 11:59pm on May 1st, you can copy it, change the name to Assignment 2 and just change the date to the due date. It's a little annoying having to mess with the due time constantly.\n\n2. If an assignment is due every Sunday at 111:59pm because it's like a journal or something you can go to custom in the date area and make the event repeat as much as you want. So if there is 15 weeks make it repeat 15 times. This way you don't have to remake the thing 15 times. \n\nIt's easier because if due dates change you can just go in and change the date. Add reminders for 1,3 and 5 days before the assignment so you can't forget it. \n\nIf a class doesn't have a schedule posted with when stuff is due... Add a reminder to Google Calendar to remind you daily to check BlackBoard, etc.",

Plus you will save money on parking fees. \n\n* Alternatively, live close enough to school to walk/bike ride to prevent the freshman 15.\n\n* Even if you can pay in cash for school, apply for loans because that will qualify you for some grants or bursaries. \n\n* Get enough sleep each night. 8ish 9ish hours. \n\n* Join a study group. You will be able to combine socializing with dedicated study time.\n\n* Build credit, by putting school books and other school related costs on your credit card. Then pay off your credit card with your loan money within 14 days to avoid interest. If your limit is $1000, you can pre-pay on to your credit card to expand your limit (example you want to buy an $1800 computer, so before you buy it, you move $800-1800 to your credit card to not exceed your 1000 limit.) Call your credit card servicer to let them know ahead of time if you will be putting a large expense on your credit card. Credit cards also give you extended warranties on items you buy with it, like electronics. \n\n* Don't be afraid to take a smaller course load. Especially for your first semester. Extra especially if you will be working during school. There is usually a number of classes you can take and stay full time. (Usually 4.) \n\n* Keep track of every program, device, systems you use/learn in school. These could be useful for putting on a future resume. \n\n* Try to find part time or temp jobs relevant to your degree. Internships are good as well. Co-op programs are best if you can get one.\n\n* If you feel you did well at something, don't be afraid to ask if they will be willing to write a reference letter for you. Some may say no, but start collecting reference letters.\n\n* Never lie. Not to profs, not to people you are dating, not to friends. Honesty will get you far. Be trustworthy. Being responsible is necessary. Do what you say you will. Learn to say no to people upfront. Getting caught in a lie will do extreme harm, and you will be caught eventually.

If you fail there isn't going to be anyone to hold your hand. No shoulders to cry on. It will just be you and your persistent failure and all the \"should ofs\". Feel upset about it? Sucks to suck. Move on and try harder at something else.",

              "text": "My entire degree basically has been entirely group projects, which if you are a good contributor, it helps because people want to work with you. I'm very very lucky to go to a school where I am part of a cohort and my professors are genuinely great people with industry connections and experience. \n\nFor peers, Just ask them questions, even if you know the answer, it's a good way to start a conversation and help each other do homework. I've never had friends in classes, but it really changes the game. I transferred to my college knowing 0 people in the area. I'm not advocating cheating, but on busy work assignments my friend and I would split them in half and then share our other half of the answers together. I'm not saying you should do that, but as a transfer student taking 18+ credits a semester and working, it did help me.  Ask your classmates about their lives, like ask where they work, where they're from, etc. My classmates are all from the area where I go to school and all enjoy hunting and fishing so even though I'm not from here and don't know anything about hunting or fishing, I asked them about it. \nWith professors, even being a few minutes to class and asking about their weekend is helpful for building rapport. If you have an assignment done early, go to their office hours and ask for feedback, my school is very involved with industry so participating in outside competitions and coming to advisory board meetings is helpful for having them get to know you. \nIt may sound like a lot of work, because it is. But, because I was very connected with school, was a leader in extra curriculars, and worked hard in my job,  I earned over $11k in scholarships from professional organizations, had multiple job offers, and locked down my post grad job in 7 months before graduation. I view this \"social\" work as essential to my career success because I came to college for these kind of opportunities. Did I love giving up my free time to do extra competitions, help other students and take on a leadership role? Of course not, but it helped me get the most out of college experience and prepared me well for my career. \nBuilding connections is very hard, but it's rewarding.",

Be outgoing, not a hermit.\n* Manage your class load with your work hours, I've seen many people fail classes because they have to work a lot and can't manage time\n* Time management is **key**, use a planner or Google Calendar, it changed my life\n* Pirate textbooks and/or share them with your classmates and split the costs, there are a lot of textbooks I've found just googling\n* On campus jobs (especially those that look good like a student assistant, tutor, or working for your major department) are great jobs and are usually willing to work around your schedule. But having any type of extra spending money is nice\n* Don't let your parents continue to control you. You're not a 16 year old high school kid anymore. I know many people whose parents are controlling and maybe they didn't go to college back in the day, so they don't know how intensive an engineering degree is and they force their kids to come home instead of studying and watch siblings, work, etc. Don't be afraid to be upfront and honest to your parents and manage expectations of your workload.\n* Go to office hours if you're struggling, professors usually want to help\n* Remember that everyone's experience is a little bit different, getting advice from others is great to learn how it applies to you!\n\nIf anyone has any questions feel free to DM!",

Conduct individual research for credit hours instead of going to classes. Complain about the egos with PhDs to department chairs and actually be taken seriously. I can't tell you how many times my 3.8 GPA has basically given me free run of the place. \n\nDon't do internships at least not unpaid internships. Never do anything for free kids. Those who did internships got hired on at the same rate as those who never did one at all. I'm citing Adam conover on that statistic.\n\nThere's no shame in taking time off or enjoying your twenties to figure out who you are what you want Don't let people pressure you into going to college too soon. Go to your own pace and you're going to age anyways so might as well do it with a degree when you're ready.\n\nPassion is important but man my emails went from new art gallery opening as a humanities major to here's a list of jobs hiring right now as a triple major in communications political science and philosophy. There are some fields better than others for careers afterwards. Engineering is the big one but it's very competitive. There are still plenty of really good paying non-STEM jobs. \n\nRate my professor is your best friend. \n\nMake the most of every opportunity that University gives you. The outside world does not have clubs or free seminars or jam sessions to earn this certification or that certification. Come out with as many certifications and accolades as you can. \n\nGrants and scholarships as much as you can I don't care if you don't think you'll win fill out everything.",

      "text": "1. It doesn't make sense to spend time around people who aren't taking college seriously. You should cut those people out fast or they will impact you negatively. Half of your friends should be better/smarter than you in some major way: that's the environment you need to improve yourself and keep growing as a person. Befriend people with skills you admire or good goals. *You do NOT want to be the smartest person in the room.*\n2. Not everyone is going to college with the same goals in mind.\n3. (This isn't for me personally, but it's one I wish we would address) Academics is only half of college, if that. You absolutely need to put an emphasis on networking, experience, and self-development to succeed. Some of us are lucky to have parents that told us this. My parents and grandparents went to college so it was well hammered into my head. First-gen students often don't get the same quality of advice from their parents who didn't attend college, though. This \"information disparity\" contributes to the success rate gap of first-gen vs non first-gen students. Colleges need to do more work to provide first-gen students with the networking and self-development knowledge that they weren't able to get from their parents.\n\nEDIT: Also most people don't learn personal finance or money management before college *or* during it. That's how we are able to have college graduates making $100k now going broke during COVID because they have no savings. We absolutely need to teach people how to handle money either before or during college. This crisis highlights the need for more financial literacy: many people currently struggling are middle or upper-middle class people that could have been adequately prepared to last months without work if they had emergency funds or savings.",

              "text": "These are ideas:\n\n1. Get a LinkedIn profile created. It's fine if you don't have a lot of stuff, you will add to it as you go. Having a LinkedIn just makes you more visable overall and gives you a digital portfolio.\n2. Join a professional organization, social or professional fraternity: it really doesn't matter which one you go with out of all these. If you are just looking for career development, a professional organization (i.e. ACM, DECA, etc.) or professional fraternity is the better option.\n3. Having a leadership position sometime during college looks good and will also help you develop good skills (organization, keeping people accountable, managing relationships with the university, setting goals, etc.). I have one in my fraternity, but IMO a leadership position in *any* group where you can oversee people and goals is very beneficial.\n4. When you start looking at internships and jobs -- get your resume reviewed by the school or someone in the field. It's well worth it and can really help you.\n5. Always start your internship hunting early and think about it -- a lot of fields will be extending offers for these programs 6-8+ months in advance. You can get an advantage on a lot of stuff just by starting early. Do this with actual first post-college jobs too.\n6. *(this is something I didn't prioritize, but is still very worthwhile for most)* Reach out to your professors if you want research experience. A lot of them will likely have work they want help on. Research work is good for grad school and it also adds to a resume for jobs.\n7. Do a few extra things. For me, this was participating in a few design competitions  and participating in a few conferences. It's often a hit or miss, but you can sometimes find great connections at these things. Obviously, attend your career fair too.",

I only say this because I was depressed for a whole semester and transferred because of it, and when it started to creep up again, I went to the counselor who said there was nothing wrong with me but I had trouble adjusting. I went to a therapist after that who told me it was anxiety. \n\nAlso you might have to endure a bit of a line.

School will always be there, take some time to get yourself in the right mind for such a high stress experience. You can also cut your credit hours if your situation makes it possible. \n\nOn that note, It annoys me and my colleagues SO MUCH when students use their mental health issues as an excuse to abuse the system or to get a free pass in classes.  We know when you are doing it because other students with the same issues are working hard to navigate it correctly (notifying us about it **at the beginning of the semester,** seeing someone to work through their issues, creating a plan with their professors and sticking to it, i.e. being responsible) and you are just being a lazy ass and blaming your anxiety. We want you to succeed and will work with you if you do it properly and not right before finals when you haven't attended class and only turned in one paper the whole semester. We do talk about those students as a faculty and no one wants them in their classes.",

They have to go through other firms who run this information and get it to these firms. So it costs a lot more than just calling up a university and asking for a $20 copy of an official transcript. Most searches start with 300 candidates, is narrowed to a couple dozen, then the top three. They aren\u2019t going to pull transcripts for all of those candidates. That is a huge waste of time and money. And time is money. It\u2019s not like college admissions teams that automatically eliminate the people with GPAs under a certain number.

I've found a pretty awesome support network and am very thankful I've known them. I've definitely been pushed to become a better person since then, and feel there's more we can comfortably talk about than with anyone I've ever met in person. I might eventually try to make friends irl (I have a few but most are childhood friends I've known 10+ years and only occasionally talk to), but I'm afraid the quality of most irl relationships will not compare to what I've found online... Heck, I'd almost say it's more likely for an online friend to become an irl friend than for me to make a friend in person first.",

Severe depression is really a killer and hard to understand from anyone that hasn\u2019t dealt with it. \n\n\nI WANTED to go to class, but couldn\u2019t get myself to go, and once I\u2019ve missed a class I get so anxious about catching up that it snowballs. Before you know it you\u2019ve missed a month of class and you\u2019re failing out. I was always the \u201csmart kid\u201d in highschool, and I didn\u2019t know how to reach out for help when I actually needed it. It got so bad at one point I was drinking a 6 pack a day by 2pm so I wouldn\u2019t have to think about how stressed and anxious I was.\n\n\nHeading home and facing the fact I wasn\u2019t cut out for such a competitive school was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I still struggle sometimes, but I\u2019m taking classes at a local state school and trying to graduate. 5 1/2 years of school and I\u2019m still tryna reach that finish line.\n\n\nTL;DR: Depression sucks ass. Ask for help when you need it.",

I\u2019m a senior as well, in spring semester, and by the time the social distancing started, it had been over a year since I\u2019d gone to class (except for on the dates of midterms or finals). \n\nFor me, it\u2019s a combination of a few factors. First and foremost, I\u2019m a guy with ADHD and am always used to teaching myself the material, regardless of attending class, as I rarely remember much from the lectures. So, I realized that if I just stay home and read the textbook (which I have to do anyways) to complete the homework, I learn the same as I always do. This saves me hours per week and lets me spend that time doing things that help me maintain my mental health. \n\nAnother thing is, I get stressed af if I don\u2019t have that balance in my life, and there\u2019s little in college that you can opt out of \u2014 skipping homework or tests or anything else is a non-option, so if you want to skip something, lectures is the only thing that really makes sense. So for me there\u2019s a value tradeoff: get a bit more of what I paid for at the cost of my free time and mental health, or recover a few hours per day to take care of myself while maintaining the exact same grades and doing the same work. For me, that\u2019s a pretty easy value proposition.",

Then, if it turns out I'm missing some knowledge needed to succeed that I could have learned from the lecture, I'll just learn that material on the job as needed.

The first course was basically a free A (as in 90% of the class gets an A) with random quizzes so if I had a quiz one class I'd skip the next one. The second course is mainly reading off of slides already put online and during class I just read the slides and understood the whole lecture in a third of the time, so I stopped coming. In the third course the first class per week was introducing a new topic or chapter in Math, and the second class per week was doing reviewing sample homework questions of the many due the following week. But since I just did all the homework before the second class of the week, I just skipped the second day, and eventually, stopped coming, since lectures were recorded and I could teach the material to myself just as easily regardless.\n\n\nI can't say the same for many other classes but if it's genuinely easier or more efficient to not go to class, I'd opt for that alternative.",

My amazing high school teachers went to great lengths convincing me to go to the school where I had scholarship money instead. One of them even staged an intervention in her class and used the opportunity to explain to everyone how awful it is to have that kind of debt hanging over your head. She was in her 30s and had been making student loan payments for a decade at that point.\n\nI didn't get it then, but I just graduated from that school where I got the scholarship money, and I'm really starting to feel what a bullet I dodged by not taking out all those loans. It kinda makes me a little queasy when I think how close I was to being trapped under all that debt for the next few decades. No one should have to take out that much in loans for an undergrad degree.",

                          "text": "Usually your campus career center can help you get a broad idea of the on campus jobs available. Or, if you receive financial aid, their office could help too. Those are definitely great starting points, but they will usually go over the most obvious jobs, like working on campus dining (don\u2019t do that unless you really enjoy it, it\u2019s like the only shitty on campus job). That\u2019s not to say you still shouldn\u2019t reach out to them, because all you really need is to find one good job and you\u2019re set, but the very best jobs are often hidden gems that you gotta find on your own. Because if a job is super publicly advertised and really cushy, it\u2019ll be gone like that.\n\nMy best recommendation? Find a department on campus that you\u2019d love to work within (if you want to do office work, pretty much any of them) and go just flat out ask them about any job availabilities. If don\u2019t feel comfortable cold asking them, then get involved with their department for a few months first, get known and then ask (or they may even mention it to you). Even if they don\u2019t have one available, if you build connections and represent yourself well they may know of availabilities in other departments! \n\nI got every university job I had by starting with just 1 contact, my club advisor (of which club I got a job with as a senior member), who got me a summer on campus job in another department. Then once in that department I joined one of their organizations which eventually lead to me getting a job in another department. So yeah, just get connected somewhere, anywhere, nice and early and represent yourself well. It may take a semester or even a year for people to graduate out of some jobs, but if you get well connected that first year, you\u2019ll be a shoe in for those jobs and once you get them you\u2019re set.\n\nHope this helps!",

There are a few rare jobs, depending on your location (I.e. if you\u2019re not in a small college town like my university and others) that may be easy work and pay really well; however, it definitely will not be flexible with your schedule. Also, another perk of some on campus jobs is they can be tax free! As in they can be paid in the form of scholarship rather than taxable income.\n\nThere is no part time job that\u2019s going to perfectly fit someone who \u201cneeds money,\u201d all students need the money, but McDonald\u2019s, Walmart, and so on aren\u2019t going to help the people who need money any more than these jobs would.\n\nAll this said, I absolutely appreciate your comment and think it is important for students to consider all factors when choosing their job, their major, or anything.\n\nI do still stand by my belief though that these jobs are the best way to earn a small but fair amount of income when all factors are considered (how easy the job is, that they are super flexible, that you can literally do homework while working, etc.)",

I got a textbook from 2008 for 50 euros at the second-hand bookstore, but it's missing quite a bit of infos we cover in class because they literally hadn't been discovered yet. For 80 euros I could've gotten the latest edition that's up-to-date and will remain relevant for longer. Apparently it's a very good textbook that many people keep for years, even after they've graduated, to reference if needed. If I'd known that, I would've spent the extra 30 euros on a fresh copy. \n\nOn the flipside of that, I'm using my grandpa's Sobotta-Bercher books to study anatomy and despite being from 1968, they're still very useful.",

That's really where I made bank at. \n\nAlso, there are more scholarships available based on certain circumstances. You are first generation it sounds like, lot of scholarships and opportunities based around that. Look into McNair, it is a fantastic program if your school has it. \n\nIf you are minority (racial or otherwise), socioeconomically disadvantaged, first generation, those yield big opportunities. \n\nThen also get as involved as you can while still being smart about coursework. \n\nStudent Government can yield scholarships, Your Major or Department likely has its own set of scholarships.\n\nSo really work on knowing your institution if you are dead set on one school (like I was). It is a little harder if you are applying to many schools, but you will likely receive a decent offer from one of those and then focus on really diving in because you can probably find more. \n\nJust be yourself too. I won a Civil Rights Scholarship just for calling out our College President on several issues.\n\nEdit: Make friends with smart scholars and faculty too. They know where its at. I got a graduate certificate, fully funded through the US Government (I actually got paid to do it) from a Top 15 University this year in something I never would have known about it were it not for my friend.",

Make sure you go to these events and try to get the contact info of the people there. If your school has a career center try to schedule an appointment and get to know the people working there. They oftentimes hear about good opportunities first and can send opportunities your way. Don't be afraid to message people on linkedIn and ask about doing an informational interview. Most people are open to having a quick phone call about what they do and this can lead to referrals or help you decide your career path. Try to join professional or academic clubs that are related to your major. Look for programs that offer unique learning experiences.\n\nI found that the biggest obstacle is oftentimes finding all the cool things your college has to offer. You have to be really proactive in seeking them out. Don't be afraid to ask professors and make sure you check your schools events website (we use handshake) to try and find opportunities.",

As a prof who routinely teachers honors courses at a private liberal arts college, that's a Big Deal. Fully 100% of the students in most of my classes were in the top 5-10% of their high school cohorts, most had high ACT/SAT scores, but every fall about 20% of them struggle mightily because they really never learned to study and have no self-discipline-- they weren't challenged in high school. AP, dual credit, etc. are not real college courses, and if you end up in a selective school your \"smartest kid in the grade\" valedictorian from a typical high school will simply be *average* among their new peers.\n\nThe better students, overall, tend to be those who actually had to work to earn good grades in high school.
