  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and I\u2019m trying to get used to sharing a room with someone in such close proximity. So this is just a venting session really. First of all my roommate has a terrible sleep schedule that ends up keeping me up. She\u2019ll take a melatonin gummy around 5pm and sleep until like 12pm and then just be up snacking and watching tv when it\u2019s time for me to go to sleep at a normal time. And then on the weekends it\u2019s completely different she\u2019ll sleep all night and then wake up at like 7/8am when I\u2019m trying to SLEEP IN LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. How can I live like this? Lol and then don\u2019t get me started on her long nails and her tapping the screen like she\u2019s trying to break her phone.",

Sleeps a few hours, studies for a few hours, sleeps for a fee hours games for a few hours... WTF!?\n\nDoesn't wash his dishes until he needs them again, once borrowed my only pot that I use constantly, made soup and ate from it FOR TWO DAYS!? While I had to eat ramen and bread with butter because I didn't have a pot...\n\nHe constantly takes bites of of cheese blocks ar sausages and puts them back in the fridge. LITERALY EVERYTHING HAS A BITE IN IT!\n\nConstantly throws his stuff on my bed and leaves it there for the whole day, including dirty laundry...\n\nSo fucking socially-unconscious...",

But thiese thimgs do happen quite often.\n\nIt's just that when you start living with so meone that comes from a different place, they'll have different ways of doing things. To add to this, my current roommate lived with his previous roommate for two years so they might have gotten accustomed to a certain level of familiarity.\n\nA lot of thongs add up to this, but that's not an excuse, you still have to be mindful.",

      "text": "I understand the weekday problems and that\u2019s pretty weird but I don\u2019t see the problem with the weekend 7/8am wake up time\u2026. I go out till late and wake up at 8am the latest on weekends it\u2019s very rare I sleep till 9am or later\u2026. I understand the bizarre ass 12pm wake up and activities through the night being bothersome but the weekend stuff I\u2019m not sure how you can change, you can\u2019t force someone to sleep in. Confront her about the weekday stuff and just tell her you are a light sleeper so she can be more considerate though the whole week. For the weekend just let her know you really need to sleep in to catch up with missed sleep and if she is up early to either like I said be more considerate about noise or to just chill elsewhere in  the dorm, though the weekend thing is more tricky to navigate imo. Possibly contact your RA if things continue.",

Mine is so erratic because of the hours I work and im ditching my roommate next year to live in an apartment because its not fair to either of us that im trying to sleep while shes awake and making noise, and that im getting ready for work while shes sleeping. you could ask her to make less noise at night",
