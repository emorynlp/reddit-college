  "text": "Ok I'm about 99% sure I will not pass this class. Because it's an accelerated it is going so fast, I knew it would be that way. Had a midterm yesterday and I, along with many other students, bombed. All I have left is the final in 4 weeks and will have to get a 92% on the final to pass the class. Still finish the class? I just don't know what to do and from the beginning wasn't sure I was totally cut out for this.",
