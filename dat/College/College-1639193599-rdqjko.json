  "text": "I\u2019m currently in my 3rd year of high school and have a plan to major in comp sci. I\u2019m curious to know if the degree is actually as great as society makes it out to be.\n\nFor example, jobs with the degree. The internet says that computer science majors can get a huge variety of jobs that make a huge amount of money right out of school; is this true? I\u2019ve never personally knew a person who went through the path. I\u2019m extremely curious.",

      "text": "The jobs are out there.  \nWe hire Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Cybersecurity and Information Systems grads for around $70k.  \nNow that's not a stunning Southern California $160k or Washington, DC $140k salary, but here in central Virginia, that's a very comfortable income.  \n\n\nWe will interview multiple times and require a 3.0+ overall GPA.  \n\nCompleting the degree program and graduating is NOT enough to access these kinds of positions.  \n\nYou've got to **really** understand how all this stuff works, and why it works, and why it's important.  \nAnd you will really help yourself by having a GitHub account with some solid code samples.  \n\n/r/cscareerquestions  isn't a terrible community, but they have an unhealthy obsession with FAANG employment, so be aware of their skewed sense of normalcy.",
