  "text": "hi i live in university apartment and ever since the beginning of the school year, my neighbor has been calling her boyfriend constantly and it\u2019s making it hard for me to sleep. she\u2019s calling him it feels like literally every single moment of the day so i don\u2019t even spend time in my room except to sleep, and even then, she\u2019s calling her boyfriend until 2 or 3 AM. she\u2019s not LOUD but loud enough for me to hear what she\u2019s saying through earplugs + what her boyfriend says over the phone. ive rearranged furniture so my bed is against the furthest wall and i play white noise and i can still hear everythin\n\nive heard horror stories of neighbors who play music all night or party all night so idk if this is bad enough to go report her to housing or smthg but it happens every single night and i don\u2019t know what to do. is it normal to be able to hear your neighbors so clearly or am i just overreacting",
