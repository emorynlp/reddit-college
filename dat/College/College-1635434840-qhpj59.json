  "text": "Hello! I'm planning a workshop for a club where I want to focus on developing good planning, organization techniques, goal setting, and ways to balance life and studying. This is for a university and almost every member has an engineering-related major. The workshop is an hour long and I want to have 3-4 stations/activities that focus on what I mentioned above. If anyone has any ideas please let me know!",
