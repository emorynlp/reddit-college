  "text": "This is mostly for people who did well in high school without effort and now have to time and project management skills. \n\nTLDR; I thrive on schedule but have to legitimately force myself to stick to them. I used these tips to stay on the Dean's List, procrastinate mindfully, stop wasting time on studying ineffectively, and ease the stress of 18 college hours with my 3 homeschooled kids and a job.\n\n-MAKE A WORKSPACE: Make a little area that you keep your school stuff at. Sit there an hour a day to work, make important phone calls, ect. Your \"adulting\" spot. Dont doodle there. Dont eat dinner there. Dont play video games there. Even if it's a backpack, chair, and a tv tray. Mine is a desk in a closet. Decorate meaningfully. A school vision board and an erasable calendar maybe. \n\n-If you can, take notes on one word document so that you can search your notes instantly for a keyword. \n\n-MAKE TIME (just a little) to actually work. Everyday. Like a job. Even when you have no work to do, sit down at your desk for a bit every day and find something important to do that is unpleasant/has been put off and do it in that \"work time\". Make that appointment you havent made, call the matenience to fix the dishwasher you have been not using for a week bc you havent called, do whatever and limit the adulting to that hour and do it everyday. You'd be surprised how much an hours of actual work can get done if its consistent. But consistency is hard for me so I have to enforce it. My kids have an hour or so of nap/quiet time in their rooms while I work, and I rarely if ever need more time than that. Most of the time I spend outside of that is on important tests that cant be interrupted. \n\n-RITUALS: No not those. But you cant just sit down and expect to switch gears. Do something everytime you sit down to work that gets you \"in the zone.\" Maybe it's a cup of water and a journal, or checking your calendar or whatever, or even a cigarette and 20 minutes of a game that you only play right before you buckle down, set a timer. Setting out 15 minutes  or so to sit at my desk and bullshit actually makes me work better. \n\n-ONLY HIGHLIGHT key words in notes and textbooks. If the course has many dates and names, consider highlighting those in a seperate color.\n\n- COMBINE POWERPOINTS all the teachers powerpoints she sends out into one giant  PowerPoint that you can search for keywords efficiently.\n\n-COPY AND PASTE all test questions that allow it into ONE master document of test questions for each class: if you can correct the wrong answers after, even better. This takes no time if you do it during the tests, or print screen after you've taken it. Not all classes allow this, though.\n\n-INDEX everything that you cant search easily. If you do it as you go, it's easy but it's hard to get started. \n\n-  *Leave it for the due date* , if you have to, but not the night it's due. Work in the morning. Trust me. Wake up at the same time everyday. Do something pleasant for a limited time and then work until you're done for the day. Then you can enjoy you're whole day without the clock ticking down to 11:55PM when that quiz is due that you've known about for 2 weeks and havent done. It's going to happen, it always will, but it you do it that morning, you will always feel better. \n\n- Bring your snack or drink with you and dont get up, if you can manage that.\n\n- totally optional: Bullet journals. Especially for those that love to be creative, hate taking notes, and cant seem to get organized. Everyone loves to be organized and consistent, deep down.",

      "text": "Okay I've recieved some strong and harsh criticism that has been helpful for me. I'm not really going to defend my schedule because maybe it's a dumpster fire and you guys know something I dont. I'm willing to accept that. But I also have some advice that might be harsh... you guys are wasting your lives.\n\n No offense everyone saying that my major is a joke, but it's one of the most well paid and stable degrees you can get right now. I go to a well recognized state school. If my degree is a joke than most degrees are jokes. \n\nMore likely, you may not be as efficient of students as you think and you're letting your early adulthood destroy you. College is not a prison. I LOVE school. I wanted to be a career student even. I enjoy every single hour I put into school. It's not a burden or a prison. No offense but maybe some of you need to reorganize your lives to work for you. I had three kids already, I'm not judging. But now I have three kids, Almost a dual degree, writing a fantasy novel while I watch my kiddos, I finish a book for fun in just my spare toilet time at least once a month. I watch netflix while I clean and I work out daily to wind down. I have ADHD so even if I had the time to sit for hours a day after work, that would be soul crushing and more importantly OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY... for me and my skill set.\n\nYou guys need to enjoy yourselves more! School isnt my whole life. Just one beautiful part of it. To stay healthy and happy and challenged, I can only spend 1 hour a day and make the grades obviously other people do, then why should I? That's what efficent people do, they dont waste their time. \n\nMy heart goes out to you guys. \n\nBut just because I'm not falling apart every exam, doesnt mean I'm not learning anything. I have a finance job now and I apply things I learned in school constantly. I did absolutely top tier in high school, loved the shit out of it,  and basically did no work at home. School is easy for me and maybe that's the missing piece. If you need 40+ hours a week for your 4 classes because you cant pass them without selling your entire life, leave college and get a job you love, you may be the one who wakes up a year after graduation and realized that your technology degree is obliterated by an algorithm and that you wasted your life on school. But if you fully utilized that time and enjoyed school how it was meant to be enjoyed, you didnt waste your time. College wasnt meant to kill you.",

I'm well prepared for my exams. \n\nI'm not saying that it's for sure a good program but it's the best one I can afford and can get to. It's a huge, well regarded state school and I make good grades. Maybe I AM wasting my time, but if I am than so is everyone else that goes to a state school. At least I'm wasting less time doing it, by that logic. \n\nDont follow my advice. I regret posting this. All the comments are like this when in reality, I work hard and well under pressure. Maybe I wasnt dealt the hand to be an MBA and that I'll get a slap in the face before I graduate. But right now it's working and I wanted to give advice on how I make it work for people who have no choice but apparently that's literally just me lol.\n\n I obviously give bad advice because college kids without insane pressures like working fulltime and homeschooling 3 kids alone dont even need advice like this and women who do dont need MBAs and CPAs. You guys have all made me realize maybe I expected too much out of myself and life. It's working now but I'm sure from the outside it looks dumpster fire. I didnt realize that until I posted this now I'm embarassed because I thought I had something. \n\n I'm in both Business Admin/Accounting programs. Not light workload. I want a CPA and MBA and I'm on track to get them both. No it's not engineering or rocket science but it's tedious and careful and, more importantly, I can get a good job with it and it's a fit for me. Maybe Im just smart and could be valedictorian if I worked on school 40 hours a week like you guys but more likely, I'm not and besides that's pretty much impossible at this point. I cant sleep any less. My kids are 5 and under so I'm not supervising them excessively. It's just the way the cookie crumbles.",

Truly. And yeah, maybe I'm wasting my time. But if you're spending well over 40 hours a week on school, which is meant to teach you how to efficiently do a job in ideally about 40 hours a week, maybe you should reevaluate where you want to go and if that's the path that will be natural and happy for you because work is alot harder than school.",

Even if it\u2019s just a small tool or behavior they might be able to enforce. (Enforcing my own behaviors though.

Exercise, get mind space, eat well.\n- use a planner if your scatterbrained. You can find several free ones online.\n- prioritize.\n- know yourself. We all have off days. My studies have fallen to the wayside while I've adjusted to a new job on a new schedule.\n- keep at it. With everything going on and ask if the changes, one day of your plan or schedule not working doesn't mean the end of it. Try again tomorrow and don't give up. 2020 has been a hell of a journey for all of us.",

One physics problem set can easily take me over 5 hours to do and my coding projects can take take 10+ hours a week and I\u2019m definitely a quick worker (usually finish exams in around half the allotted time), and that\u2019s just 2/7 courses",

Thats on the low side and assuming that I am not aiming for As in the class, 2 hrs average would be aiming for a high C low B.\n\nIm really glad you found a way that works for you an your major and espically going to school when you have kids. I could never imagine how stressful that must be for you. Thank you for making this post because even if it wouldnt help me, it will help someone else.\n\nI really just wanted to say that this advice will not work for everyone and no one should be feeling bad that they are working longer than an hour a day and not getting As.",

          "text": "Word, I'm a computer science major and i had to switched from four classes to three because the time to study/complete projects is insane. I had a solid month of 16-18 hour days of programmimg/studying/meetings with project partners. It was insane.\n\n I wouldn't say that semester is the norm though considering some of my classes that semester had nearly half the class fail. \"Weed out\" courses as they called them. But hey I had a 95+ in three of those so it paid off if you don't count the years I took off my life due to stress haha. Can't really aim for C's because you will get kicked out of the program.\n\nThat scared me though so I switched to three classes and now only put in around 30 hours a week outside of class give or take 10 hours. So it's way more manageable now.. Well before covid.\n\nSince covid everything is online and way easier, still have big projects but the travel time and teachers being more linent makes me feel like I'm doing nothing some weeks.\n\nThat being said I don't like to take my Adderall prescription often but when I do... I'm studying haha.",

According to you're more generous estimate that would leave you an hour a week for all your assignments. You also say you read the chapter on top of that. Highlighting names and dates isn't necessary for accounting unless you're still in your gen ed history classes. I didn't wright this to come at you just saying from my experience I don't see how it's possible.

I\u2019m still looking for ways to efficiently study since the material is so ridiculously hard sometimes but what I\u2019ve found works for me is consistent note taking and recording myself reading the PowerPoints (a tip from my mom lol). I have for instance a medical bacteriology class and I just listen to the PowerPoint lecture and take notes. Then I record myself reading those same powerpoints with my notes added in. I use those notes to study and on the morning of the day of the test (this semester it was at 11am), I wake up early (6-7am) and I go through the PowerPoints again and take notes on what I know will be on the exams (my professor likes mechanisms, you have to see how your professor tests). \nAll of the recordings I listen to when I walk my dog, drive around, etc. Something about hearing my own voice helps me to remember better. I also watch YouTube videos to break down or visualize what the material is about. I\u2019m a microbiology major so a lot of the stuff I learn is kind of abstract to me since I can\u2019t see it, so it helps to see a video about it. \n\nI also want to add that I got a dog and it\u2019s helped my mental health TREMENDOUSLY.

I am all online and my roommate now could care less about microbiology so I don\u2019t do that anymore lol. \n\n\nThe dog though will help a lot I think. For me I am alone. I have a roommate but we don\u2019t really do much and I feel disconnected so I was suppppper depressed for a couple semesters. I got my dog and I never feel alone it\u2019s pretty crazy how much it\u2019s actually helped. Not to mention I go outside now cause I have a high energy breed whereas before I never exercised lol.",
