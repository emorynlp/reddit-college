  "text": "My program got cancelled and I was transferred to a different program in Europe. I wanted to go to Japan originally but it didn\u2019t work out.  I never thought of going to Europe in my entire life so im just confused if I should go or not. I\u2019m also  going to graduate soon this would be my only chance to study abroad with financial aid. Of course I could study abroad after grad but I would need to pay out of pocket so im not sure if I should just go through the program or not.",

You should go anyways because it\u2019s such a diverse experience and you\u2019ll still have fun even if it\u2019s not the culture you expected. You will learn so much about how people differ from yourself! Approach it with a good attitude and an open mind and you will surprise yourself!",
