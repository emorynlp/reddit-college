  "text": "I'm applying for internships for journalism for the Spring and the Summer of 2022, but I really don't know where I stand with other applicants. I'm a sophomore, who did her first year of college remote so didn't really get to be as involved with activities as I could have. I've been on the school paper since my freshman year, and almost everything I've done since high school has been in the field of politics/writing/journalism. I'm stuck in this vicious cycle of wanting to find internships and boost my skills and resume, but they only want seniors/recent graduates who demonstrate good knowledge. I'm getting anxious that I am wasting my time at college and was wondering if anyone has any advice or more stuff for me to do? Happy to dm.",
