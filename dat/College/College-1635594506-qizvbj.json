  "title:": "Paid someone to do online test but never went through with it from guilt.",
  "text": "So im in my final year of uni, and i was struggling with a course so i was actually looking for tutors online who could actually tutor me on the course subject instead of doing the actual exam for me. So i contact this guy who seemed pretty reliable with good reviews about tutoring me. He immediately asks if i just want him to do the test for me if it's online. Stupid of me and because im struggling i say yes. And long story short i pay him a pretty large sum of money to secure the date for which the exam is held (The exam isnt held until awhile later).  The test hasn't begun and it's around 4 weeks away, and out of just pure guilt and not wanting to let my parents down and myself down i told the guy that i would no longer be continuing with this and i will be doing the exam myself and that i would like a refund (gave me partial refund which i dont mind).\n\nSo my question is. If in the future this guy gets probed for doing exams for students and all the contacts get traced including me. Would i still be at risk of getting my degree revoked even though i didn't pull through with this in the end.\n\nI know i am dumb as shit for even considering this and i've learned my lesson.",

      "text": "Oo you gotta be careful with this because usually tutors still go through with the work, but will still contact the university to let them know that x student hired someone to take the exam for them (I\u2019ve seen it happen in one of my classes). Honestly I think you\u2019ll be fine since you didn\u2019t use that service in the end.",

It would be to your credit that you solicited tutoring only. You were offered and then backed out of the cheating. I would consider it a lesson learned and spend the next 4 weeks with a real tutor.
