  "text": "So when filling the residency form I put my father as the claimant, I put two forms of registration evidence like drivers license  and other but there is one problem.\nMy parents do not know exactly when they became a florida resident.\nThere is a spot on the form where you need to fill when you established it. I just put the date of we purchased our first house. Is that alright or do I need to find the exact date. If so, how can I do that?",
