  "title:": "What topic should I pick for an academic club project?",
  "text": "I have joined 2 academic clubs last year, entrepreneurship (created a business plan canva) and finance (analysis of Balance Sheet and Income Statement of a multinational company - unfinished).\n\n\n\nOur class is really small and most of the times people just quit these academic clubs and I end up being the one who stays until the end. This year, I paired up with a girl and we published an ebook about crowdfunding. \n\n\n\n\nMy professor asked if I wanted to stay in this club (finance and economics) for the next semester, said it's up to me if I want to choose another one.\n\n\n\nAs I'm the only one, he gave me a few options: either wait more people to join me next year, or I can also finish the balance sheet and income statement analysis alone (haven't finished because the person I was doing with ghosted everyone), or pick a new topic and work on it alone. As long as we can publish and article, ebook, video or have something finished that can be shown to all the people in college, it would be a good one.\n\n\n\nI like the idea of choosing a topic, any recommendations?
