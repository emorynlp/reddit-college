I have definitely done this before, that is I haven\u2019t turned in assignments at the end of the semester that wouldn\u2019t affect my final grade in order to prioritize other things. In my opinion that\u2019s just working smarter and not harder. Read the syllabus, read the assignment, read everything to make sure that you\u2019re not required to do this to pass the class, but otherwise I wouldn\u2019t bother. Also double check your math to make sure it won\u2019t bring your grade down if you get a zero.",
