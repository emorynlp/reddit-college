On final week I wear my ninja turtle pjs pants to all my tests.\n\nAm I the only one that does stuff like this? Or do you also do stuff before tests that you think helps?",

      "text": "I have a ton of habits. I usually base them off researches and studies from neurosciences. Neuroscience is my major. \n\n\nHow do you study? Based previous studies, it\u2019s been shown that brain is much better at informational absorption and informational recall when the person divides their studying time in many chunks, rather than non-stop studying without chunks. I\u2019m terrible at explaining, but taking breaks is better than not taking breaks. \n\nNow supplements. Disclaimer, I\u2019m not a doctor so do your own research. I supplement [L-Theanine](https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/). It helps with relaxation and calmness without causing drowsiness. It also been shown help with memory and learning in people who are anxious, while there haven't been any significant improvement shown in people who were not anxious. Personally, I\u2019m not anxious. But I supplement due the relaxation properties of L-Theanine as well as help with sleeping. Normally, I would simply drink Matcha Tea on daily basis since 1 cup= 60mg L-Theanine but during the tests I supplement. \n\n\nWhy do I chew gun when I study? There\u2019s been study showing that chewing increases memory by simulating the hippocampus, the area in the brain responsible for memory and many more things. \n\nI don\u2019t take sugar the day of test, but why? Because there been study showing that sugar prompts poor memory. \n\n\nI\u2019m too lazy to source these studies, but I\u2019m pretty sure someone amazing enough can and even correct my mistakes.",

Those little folk psychology tidbits were sort of my security blanket, and I swear, regardless of their actual degree of truth/scientific support, they worked purely because I thought they did.\n\nAmong various pop-psych hacks, my number one superstitious ritual I believed in was my own hybrid of the \u201cpomodoro method\u201d and my nighttime routine/next day setup\u2014I\u2019d go through the steps of my nighttime routine and laying everything out for the next morning during my 10-20 minute \u201cbreaks\u201d I took between 40-50-minute windows of review. Once my routine was as finished as it could be and I felt fairly comfortable with the content (or was just way too tired to continue reviewing), I\u2019d go to straight to bed (scratch what I said earlier, guaranteeing I got enough sleep is my true first defense/superstition). Even if the slow-cramming itself didn\u2019t do a whole lot for my memorization of the content, it kept me from procrastinating my way to a later bedtime and minimized my stress about the upcoming day (due to me setting up for things as much as possible during the process), all while giving me time for bite-sized doses of actual involved review of the material.",

Hope this helps! :)",
