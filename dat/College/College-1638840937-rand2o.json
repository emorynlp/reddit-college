  "text": "Hello. I need replies ASAP. I tried overdosing yesterday. my schools police stayed with me until ambulance arrived. was in psych ward for 24 hours. my rcd says they have to tell my parents, but I am a legal adult and I do NOT want them to know. they have reacted badly in the past. is there some law I can say to stop them *legally*. please please I need this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this not go against HIPPA?? What about my privacy as an adult? Why can't I let them know on my own terms? ",

HIPAA and most other medical privacy laws give sharing exceptions in attempted harm to others or self-harm situations.\n\n3. If your parents are abusive you need to tell the university. Your university may voluntarily agree to not inform your parents... your most realistic option would be to explain the situation and offer a trusted relative's contact information instead.\n\n4. Get help please.",

Long term help. Therapy. Medication. You deserve help.\n\nI don't know the laws but honestly why does it matter? If they are abusive they could say mean things or maybe do more but you are an adult now. Please talk to your university and tell them you don't want your parents to know. But overall, you need help. Please accept it.",

So they understand your trying your best to seek help. Not sure what your internal issues are but they aren\u2019t worth overdosing. Life Is short start doing things you love and worry about yourself not anything else.",
