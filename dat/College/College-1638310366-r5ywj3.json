  "text": "Thought this was really interesting and wanted to share.\n\nAs if we couldn't have one virus going around school we have two. It happened about 2 hours ago, they've shut down all campus systems although canvas, school email, and the school wifi are still up. \n\nHas anybody else had this happened to their school? And if so how long did it last? I kinda have homework to turn in and classes to go to lol.",
