  "title:": "Should i take a semester off due to my situation?",
  "text": "So for some background, just completed my first semester of freshman year, funded by my homophobic mom who used tuition as a way to have something to hold over me. She always threatens that if I don't become \"straight\" or stop being gay that she will take away x thing. She refused to let me do FAFSA and claimed me as a dependent so I couldn't file FAFSA as an independent. My school refused to let me file independently so until she signs it I cant get aid. She also threatened to report me as fraud if I try and put her income down as I \"don't have permission\":\n\nI paid off my car IN HS because she would hold that over me (My only way to get to school bc my bus route was not going to my area and I was a minor and couldn't change schools to closer), but now she found a new way to force me to be something I'm not. Last night she said \"I will not pay your tuition If i ever see you post such disgraceful things.\", granted i posted a picture with my boyfriend. She basically wants to change me by threatening to take things away she gave to me willingly.\n\nLike she paid my tuition without telling me, IDK HOW but they let her pay it without my student account login. Literally i had no control.\n\nHer and her boyfriend are also HIGHLY emotionally and verbally abusive to me and they gang up on me often and make me feel worthless..\n\nI am considering taking a semester off to save money and try to distance myself from her, but also i read its bad to take breaks from school. I dont know what to do and really don't want to have to drop out. I LOVE cs so far and really wanna get a degree so i can work in the field i love, but its hard atm with family stuff. No one will believe me because she will attempt to discredit everything i say.\n\nAny advice would be AMAZING. i don't wanna drop out, but I cant keep being gaslighted for tuition to be something I'm not and get abused by her and her boyfriend emotionally and verbally.",

      "text": "Honestly I think that what you need to focus on right is getting a job so you can become independent and get your own place for the sake of your health.  Once you get established you can go back to school part time and will then be able to apply for FAFSA or use your schools payment plan if they have one (in my area almost all schools do, your tuition for the semester is broken out into monthly payments during the semester). Your health is more important than going to school at the moment.  Yes, you might end up taking off more time than you initially planned but you're never \"too old\" to go back, I'm saying this as someone who is 45 and almost done with their second year at a community college.",
