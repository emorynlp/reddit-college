  "text": "I am in community college and before transferring to the University I have to pick either Physics, chemistry, or biology to take for the next two semesters. \n\nI am a non-traditional student and have been out of high school since 2005.\n\nI took all 3 in high school and I remember enjoying Physics but hating chemistry.\n\nI am not sure why I hated it but I think it was the teacher. I also used to hate math, but here I am loving it.\n\nI am a computer science major and figured physics would be more useful due to using the logic side of things? not sure what my line of thought is. \n\nThe thing is that for chemistry I can take it without permission. For physics, I need to ask permission from the department because I would have to take calculus 1 at the same time, which is a prereq for physics.\n\nanyway, I guess my question is for CS or Engineering majors;\n\n**What did you choose? or what would you choose? What's more useful?**\n\nEnglish is my second language so I apologize for the mistakes.",
