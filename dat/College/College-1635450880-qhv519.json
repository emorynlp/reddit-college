  "title:": "Would it be bad to take online classes?",
  "text": "So I go to one of the top universities in Georgia, I was wondering if it looks bad to future employers if I take classes online? I\u2019m still getting the same curriculum so I\u2019d assume it can\u2019t be that bad and it\u2019s not one of those unaccredited online schools. I first had to take online due to covid, then when it went back to on campus I had to choose to take online classes once again due to me going back overseas. I do plan on doing at least my senior year on campus but yeah that\u2019s pretty much all the details. Will it make a difference? Thanks",

      "text": "If its at an accredited institution there's nothing wrong with taking an online class. Of course, depending on the subject, it might be better to be in person (for things like a physical science) but it should be fine. Employers dont really look at what type of classes, if they look at them at all.",
