  "text": "I feel like it is a quintessential college experience to do/wear/have something super weird that makes everyone else look twice at you, AKA the Stuff You Only See In College\u2122. You HAVE a perfectly reasonable explanation, but obviously you can't give that reasonable explanation to every single person who looks strangely at you, so you just have to pretend like everything is totally normal and ignore all the weird stares and second glances that you get as you walk across campus. \n\nFor example, I just carried a giant plastic pitchfork from my dorm to the student union three quarters of the way across campus and back. I was bringing it to the craft center to paint gold and use as a trident for my Ursula Halloween costume. But apparently the craft center isn't allowed to have spray paint, so I had to carry it all the way back to my dorm. The poor girl who was getting off the elevator when I got on jumped a foot in the air.",
