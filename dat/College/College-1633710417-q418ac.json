  "text": "I was just offered a virtual internship at a small Health startup while I'm studying at college during my fall of freshmen year. The internship is supposedly 5 hours a week, so it doesn't seem like that large of a commitment. That being said, I'm already involved in a couple of clubs so I'm not sure if I want to mess with my routine.\n\nI'm struggling to make this decision because I don't want to be stressed out while I'm still acclimating to college (it's only been 6 weeks). Also, freshmen aren't normally offered internships, so I'm not sure if I'll get another opportunity like this later down the line.\n\nAny thoughts?",
