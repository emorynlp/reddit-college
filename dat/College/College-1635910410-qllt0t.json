  "text": "So my prof unexpectedly moved up our midterm by two weeks last week (from the 15th to tomorrow) and as a result there's a whole chapter that I just haven't prepared enough for, basically the exam is on 4 chapters and I've drilled 3 to satisfaction but because of the moved up exam I haven't had near enough time to drill the last chapter and have basically read it for the first time tonight, I just spent 2 hours reading it and I'm internally freaking out because my knowledge isn't up to my standards, should I spend the rest of the night getting in as much as I can in or is it not going to help me at this point?",

      "text": "This is late but I say cramming is better because you will read or study up on information that could be very helpful on a random question. I find when I cram in information, I have a different perspective or understanding when I first leaned the material. If you don\u2019t study then you will have to dig up information that is deep in your brain",
