I am pretty sure you need to amend it with the 1040-X form and not just send in another normal 1040.\n\nHe should be able to claim both stimulus payments as a tax credit on his 2020 tax return if he amends the 2019 one like this. The father will also lose whatever benefits he got and be forced to repay those taxes. Depending on what tax bracket the father is in, your fiance might just want to ask him if he would rather send him a check for the stimulus money over losing those benefits.",

This isn't a \"small enough percentage\" (not that there \"is\" a \"small enough percentage\" that would make this acceptable). It's not a hypothetical, either. I don't have to explain my life story to you, or that of any of my friends, but this is not hypothetical, and we aren't just outliers.\n\nI get that parents who pay a majority of money deserve returns, but really, no. That should come down to an agreement post-receiving the money itself from they and the kid, leaving it in the kids' hands so that those who are in such situations will at least have the opportunity (even if they don't have the backbone to go through with) to put the money to good use (ex. cheap renting with someone they know so they can start and pick up whatever job they possibly can and get out of that situation), not the government choosing based upon the parents' filed dependency.\n\nAutonomy > politeness. Sure, some kids might be selfish bastards, but that's just something that'll have to be risked because, especially in today's economy (this talking about kids without money, parents without money, families without money, adults without money, even without COVID's influence and now with) people need now more than ever to be able to make these choices their selves.\n\nShitty situations are the furthest things from outliers you can find nowadays. Sure, if you look at a whitebread all-rich-people uber-expensive college campus, you probably will see majority students in good financial situations and with parents who either love them or never interact with them. Congratulations, though, that's not the majority's circumstances, let alone right now.\n\nPolicy should reflect on need, not on capitalist idealization and dreams of enough people being in fine circumstances and \"the other is such a little percentile that it isn't worth addressing.\" Policy needs to actually fit circumstances and allow for appropriate choices to be made by those who it \"addresses,\" (which, this is clearly not made to actually benefit students, except the few that have no money and don't rely on their guardians in any way shape or form and have to live on loans, which, it still isn't much money to give lasting benefit to in comparison to the cost of renting near campuses--they deserve so much more).\n\nRegardless of whatever our differences in ideas may be, the even more unfortunate reality that this almost definitely won't pass in the first place is worse.\n\nPlease, consider people instead of numbers. It's not difficult to create policy which does rely on responsibility. Yes, some people will ideologically abuse it, but they likely weren't the ones who needed it in the first place, if they waste it. And no, there isn't a method outside of mass-surveillance to know who would versus wouldn't actually benefit, and even that would rely on predicting people, not to mention that it could cause more problems for minority / vulnerable groups in the long term with its implication than it would be worth.\n\nI'm going to leave a link actually to a study, so you can check up on it (yes, over double the amt of money, and no, not directly related, but it's really a good read that might bring you to think in more perspectives than just percentiles, but in the manner of general society improvement). As someone minoring in stats, not everything starts and ends with the first set of stats you gather (that being, your idea of students who would actually benefit from this money being \"small-scale\"). This idea of \"small-scale\" being ignored is how we get a nation doing its people as poorly as the US is currently in the first place.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/10/09/americas/direct-giving-homeless-people-vancouver-trnd/index.html\n\nEDIT: added paragraph explaining why it isn't worth trying to then police who would be vs wouldn't be responsible with the $",

In total, if passed in the senate, the person or persons (claiming you as a dependent) would receive a total payment of $2,500. As it reads now, the payment for adult dependants goes to the claimant, not the adult dependant. In terms of getting the money, that would come down to your relationship with the person claiming you.",
