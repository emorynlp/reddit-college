  "text": "I'm a freshman this year, and I really don't like it so far. Classes are the best part right now and so far nothing has really challenged me. The honors classes I'm in have big workloads but the content isn't hard to understand.\n\nI'm at a fairly big college (top 3 in state by number of students) and bring around so many strangers is really fucking with me. For the last two years of high school I would constantly joke around in every class and was a generally decently charismatic person, if an asshole at times. \n\nBut being around people that I don't know is just debilitating. I hate going to food halls and usually just subsist off of snacks/sandwiches in my dorm because of it. I was interested in a few clubs at the beginning of the semester but the fear of people not liking me has prevented me from going to any meetings. \n\nI have classes Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and have a dorm. But I've been going home every weekend to get away from college. When I'm on campus I only ever leave my dorm for classes. I went to an event for my dorm floor, since food was provided and I ran out of snacks in my dorm so I hadn't eaten for 2 days, and it was incredibly nerve wracking, just making this mindset worse.\n\nOverall just not having a good time, depression has gotten significantly worse since starting.\n\nWhat should I do? I want to have friends but I'm so scared that doing anything will make everyone hate me and I'll be an outcast from whatever club/class is in question.\n\nSorry if this isn't allowed, I read the rules and it didn't seem to violate them",

      "text": "I felt like this too. People eventually approached me and I picked up friendships that way. Going home can be comforting but maybe try not do it every week and see if that helps a little. And at my college we can get food from the hall & leave or eat outside so maybe try that out if you\u2019re overwhelmed. And I totally get being around strangers is absolutely terrifying but you have to open yourself up and be kind and that\u2019s how you\u2019ll get more comfortable. Good luck!",

      "text": "Just gotta talk to people and make them not strangers. You see the same people in the dorm all the time, chat them up.  It\u2019s ok to be eating alone in the food halls too, sometimes friends schedules don\u2019t align and you gotta eat. Nobodies judging you for being there alone I can assure you. If your as charismatic as you say you are then use that\u2026you won\u2019t be outcast unless you\u2019re being blatantly rude or super duper weird.",

Get out and eat. \n\nAnd kinda like the earlier post, it really is time to start plunging yourself into the college community.",

      "text": "Grow the fuck up dude. And I\u2019m not trying to say this in any mean way (even though it might come off like it\u2014 I\u2019m more of a tough love type of person). If I met my 18-19 year old self, that\u2019s exactly what I would tell myself. \n\nYou\u2019re still terribly young, and you have sooo many opportunities to meet new people and discover yourself. Don\u2019t start doubting now. I graduated in spring 2020, and throughout my time in college I\u2019ve been through 3 major friend groups and struggled with finding friends and community (especially freshman year). Join clubs, reach out to people that have common interests, etc. I know it\u2019s hard, but things won\u2019t get any easier in the future, and be intentional with the time you have. The big difference between high school and college is that there is ALWAYS a group of people willing to accept who you are. And it\u2019s your job to find them. Become the person you want to be. Work on yourself, and even if you\u2019re not perfect, take the time to find people that will accept you for who you are. \n\nYou got this!!! :)",
