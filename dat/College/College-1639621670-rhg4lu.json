  "text": "Literally right before COVID shut the world down, I decided I wanted to go back to school for a 2nd bachelors. I went through the financial aide office to apply for aide, and the \u201cworker\u201d that was helping me told me to do it incorrectly, resulting in me getting $0 in aide, I emailed the advisor that I was working with, that due to financial aide issues, I could not attend- this was before classes started- I did the withdraw from the classes I had enrolled in. Then COVID happened, my job closed down (which was my access to internet, I live in a rural area where WiFi just recently became available). I was communicating with them via my work email. I just looked back at my student account bc I am wanting to go back for grad school, and I have a balance I\u2019m assuming for the classes that I withdrew from. What can I do? Is there any program or COVID related option that could help me? It\u2019s over $3000 and I\u2019m a teacher- I cannot pay that and still afford grad school!",
