  "text": "Hi everyone! I am switching universities, and I am in search of a 100% online English undergrad program. More specifically, I would like something from an accredited university, and ideally a place that had an online program available pre-covid. Located on the west coast would also be good because that\u2019s the time zone I\u2019m in. \n\nPlease give me your suggestions! \n\nAlso, I have a career path in mind that uses this program is relevant to. Please no comments on the vein of \u201cWhat are you going to do with an English degree?\u201d \n\nThanks in advance! I\u2019m really stuck.",
