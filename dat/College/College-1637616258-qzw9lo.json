      "text": "Don't have a script, but do have some stories ready in the back of your mind to present if you get asked like \"what was a challenging experience you had\" or something. Or if you get asked the godawful \"what is one of your biggest weaknesses\" questions. Definitely make sure to ask questions too it makes you look better. Some suggestions I got were like \"what does an average day look like in this position\" or \"what projects will I be working on in this position\" Hope that helps a bit lol",
