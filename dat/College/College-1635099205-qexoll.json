  "text": "So I have been doing all my work this week, and have turned in everything on time, however I do have few things to do, not too much however. I wanted to rest today, but I feel kinda sweaty (don't know how to explain the feeling) when I decide to rest one day. Whenever I decide to rest or do nothing college related, I feel uneasy, like my brain is annoying me with \"you could be doing this reading\" or \"you could be doing this in advance\". Currently I'm not in a rush to do anything, and already did all my group projects, so I don't get why I sometimes I feel guilty for deciding to shift my mind away from college for just one day",

During my first year of college, I did what you\u2019re describing. I would have a reflection paper to touch up, maybe a little bit of stats to do on Pearson, and I\u2019d need to touch up a slide for a presentation.\n\nThink of it this way: even if you finish it, turn it in, and see that orgasmic \u201csubmitted\u201d subtext on the school website, you\u2019re just going to change what the anxiety is about. It will go from \u201cman I have work to do\u201d to \u201cman I hope I get at least an 88 or so.\u201d",

However I must say this semester I've organised myself so much better to the point I'm learning to manage and pay attention to this things better. It's good to know its normal though",

      "text": "What about instead of seeing it as an all-or-nothing, do just 1-2 hr of work today and then take the rest of the day off. Then you are still making progress, but you still have many hours in the day to rest. If you aren\u2019t comfortable taking an entire day off. That\u2019s how I am too and I feel better when I make progress everyday instead of in spurts. But I still relax and do fun things on weekends. I find I can balance everything much better when I do a little bit everyday vs working full days and then taking full days off.",
