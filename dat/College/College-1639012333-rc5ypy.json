  "text": "Hey everyone. Like the title says, I feel like I\u2019m not being paid a fair hourly wage at my work-study job. Alongside rising prices and rent increases it seems that they have no plans of raising the work-study students pay rate. \n\nI understand the perks of work-study are the flexible hours and the fact that you can work and study at the same time. However,$7.25 and the fact that we can\u2019t work more than 25 hours per week just seems ridiculous at this point. I only have seven days of the semester left and I haven\u2019t even collected half of the amount that I was awarded for this semester. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering have any of you guys had the same experience? What do you guys get paid at your work-study jobs? Do you know if the university benefits from paying us so little? What happens to the federal governments money if I don\u2019t receive it?\n\nPlease don\u2019t just tell me to fuck off and go get a new job. I love the job itself just not the pay. As long as my rent doesn\u2019t increase again, I will be employed at my work-study job.",

      "text": "Two things you can do: 1) ask for a raise. You don\u2019t know if you never ask, and if you\u2019re an asset to them you\u2019ll get more money, and if you don\u2019t get the raise it clearly shows how much they (do not) value you. 2) find another job that pays more with similar hours, then bring the offer sheet to your superior and say \u201cmatch this or I\u2019m leaving\u201d. It\u2019s effectively the hardball way of option 1",

          "text": "Your advice would definitely work if It was a traditional employer. My direct supervisor and her supervisors have no control over what the student pay rate. It\u2019s the very high higher ups that determine the student worker pay rate. I would literally look like a fool if I walked into the HR office of the University and demanded a pay raise because I am an \u201casset\u201c. They would literally just shrug their shoulders and move onto the next hundreds of students that want a work-study job. \n\nI guess my point is, the pay is just not sustainable but I have no leverage to ask for a raise because I\u2019m just a stupid silly work-study student employee.",

      "text": "The trouble with the work study BS is that you\u2019re limited in how much you make a semester. So if you were awarded $1k a semester, but the job needs you for so many hours a week, they\u2019ll try to make you work the exact hourly wage it\u2019ll take to use up that $1k by the end of the semester. Or at least that\u2019s what my schools did. I had one department that used my hours quick and put me on payroll, so I could earn more than work study allowed, which helped. After a couple years of that, I just gave up and I asked department\u2019s top hire me as a student worker (some depts have budgets to hire) or I found jobs elsewhere, that way I wasn\u2019t limited by work study caps. \n\nMy wages were only slightly better as an employee but at least I could earn more money faster if I worked more hours, and I wasn\u2019t capped by the bullshit work study award. \n\nBut you\u2019re right, you should get paid more. Students are ALWAYS shafted when it comes to wages. It starts in undergrad and then gets really ugly in grad school if you\u2019re a research or teaching assistant.",
