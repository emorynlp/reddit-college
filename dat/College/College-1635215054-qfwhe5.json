This is typically while you are enrolled in school at least part-time.\n\n**Unsubsidized** \\- Accrued interest collects while your loan payments are deferred. Upon entering repayment, the sum of outstanding interest is capitalized (added onto the principal of the loan) which is then used to determine future interest payment.",
