It can depend on the grade distribution.\n\nHow hard one works is not automatically a reason to round up. Performance speaks for itself.\n\nIf a professor were mediocre, and asked you to give them great teaching evaluations, would you do it?",

      "text": "Many professors will round of slightly bump grades but generally don't want students asking. They know students who are close would like a grade bump, so you aren't communicating new information by asking and you do risk developing a bad reputation. Usually if rounding is going to happen either everybody within a certain margin gets rounded or nobody does, it wouldn't be fair to round people who asked while giving more demure students lower grades.\n\nA grading scale were a B+ is 87-89 thought probably wouldn't result in a 88.81 rounding to a 90. That's pretty close to dead in the middle of the range and, if we're rounding to two digits, would round to a 89 and not a 90.",

This trick isn't very well known though, so don't tell too many people. \n\nFor real though. I wouldn't consider asking in this case. You got a B, and that's not bad. Be proud of it and learn how you could improve next time.",
