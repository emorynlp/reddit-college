  "text": " Hi, I've been applying biochemistry programs for the past couple of months for the spring term but now I'm feeling like biomedical engineering is a better program for me. do you guys know about any universities that offer it? also do you think its a good major for a premed student?  I must also mentioned that I'm an international student with average to good grades so am I also a fit for the subject?",

      "text": "University of Utah has a great BME program, and I believe that University of Texas - Austin also has a great program. Engineering in general is a great pre-med option, it makes you stand out from all the other bio/chem/biochem/molecular bio/etc majors that apply for med school.\n\nIf I were you, I would look into these schools with good programs and research projects you're interested in, but then get a chemical engineering degree. You can still take BME electives and work on BME research teams, but ChemE is more widely applicable, so if you decide somewhere along the way that you don't want to do med school, the ChemE let's you work in lots of industries, whereas the BME would be more limiting.",
