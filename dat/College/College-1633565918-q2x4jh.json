  "text": "Hey guys so I'm a sophomore in college and I'm in my third semester of college, and I have a 3.3 GPA right now, mostly only because of the two math classes I took last year. I got C's in both of them because yea I suck and hate math. however, in every other classes, I got an A. I'm also majoring in political science so I'm maybe guessing that when I Apply to internships they might be able to overlook that since I don't need math for my major. The semester is so much easier now that I've finished all my math classes and my classes are so easy to handle I already know that I'm gonna get an A in all my classes. My question is, should I retake one of,  if not both, of the math classes? and do I still have time to raise my overall college gpa?",

      "text": "For the vast majority of schools, the original grade will remain part of the calculation that goes into your GPA. You can retake the courses, but the Cs will usually still stand as part of your average (check your college policy). Take heart, I got a 1.7 my first semester of college and now I have a PhD.",
