  "text": "So right now I\u2019m taking an organic chemistry class to get a second associates (an associates in science, my associates I have done right now is some bs called \u201cliberal arts science transfer\u201d, liberal arts associates are useless, I know) since I have the time to do so before transferring, and I\u2019m transferring into science.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, I have a 3.90 GPA right now and it looks like I\u2019m going to get a C in Orgo (been a tough couple of months life wise) and that will bring my overall GPA down A LOT; I calculated it and it\u2019d go down to ~3.70.\n\nI\u2019m considering withdrawing from the class since I already have the one associates, but I was wondering what other people would think. Does it look bad to withdraw from a course in my last semester? Would the associates of science be worth the drop of GPA? With a C the class probably wouldn\u2019t even transfer for reference.\n\nThanks for any advice.",

I\u2019ve done a couple stints in research in the field I want to go into so my extracurriculars are good, but a 3.70 is a genuine detriment to my application.",
