  "text": "Hello everyone. I'm looking into returning to school at some point in the near future after being unenrolled since the 2019-2020 school year. However, I recently discovered that at the end of that year I was academically dismissed from the university. Long story short, during the fall semester I made the mistake of taking an F instead of a W for a class which put me on academic probation the following semester. This combined with the beginning of COVID stressed me out to the point that I ended up taking only 10 credit hours, and I did not pass my classes with high enough grades to achieve a 2.0 GPA. Subsequently I was academically dismissed, though I did not find that out until recently.\n\nI was very unhappy at my last university and would be looking at attending a different school. Is being academically dismissed too large of an obstacle in achieving that goal? Will any transfer application get rejected outright? Is there some sort of process for this? I understand I will have more hoops to jump through. Any advice is welcome.",
