If it isnt, you can always ask math questions to strangers on the internet. The best thing about infintesmal calc and precalc is that they are such well understood subjects. So well, infact, that if youre struggling with the subject, its likely not your fault. I dont mean to say a person can simply not try and understand it. I mean to say that your teacher is probably not reaching to you as well as another might.\n\nGetting instruction from multiple sources can be difficult, especially when one instructor makes a mistake, but is almost always a neccesity for math. Consider a second instructor or simply start firing questions in a sub like r/askmath. Alternatively, you can always DM me with math related questions and I can try going step by step through them.",
