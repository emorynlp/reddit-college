      "text": "The N.U.IN program basically sends you abroad for your first semester. Northeastern uses it as a way to boost their average stats by sending the people with the lowest stats they admit abroad and only taking the average stats of those on campus. You would still be studying at the Boston campus in the spring semester though! Congratulations on the acceptance!! I haven\u2019t checked my decision yet I\u2019m too anxious haha.",

Since it isn\u2019t binding, does that mean there\u2019ll be another decision made on the 15th for if I get into the boston campus for the fall semester or is this just the final decision?\n\n\nAnd you\u2019ll only get more anxious knowing knowing your decision is there but not looking at it. Something something schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, good luck when you check!",
