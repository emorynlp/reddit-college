                      "text": "I see what you're saying, but here's my reasons for claiming APs are a scam:\n\n1) I graduated in 2020. That year, when we took them online, students in Asia had to take them the same time we did in America. I took them at 2pm, they took them at 3am. A student simply can't perform well at that time of night, and many of them failed as a result of it. (Not sure if the time conversion is correct but you get the gist of it).\n\n2) There's a limit on the scores they can give out. Say you write an essay that should score a 5, but you're one of the last graded and they've already handed out too many 5s, you get a 4. \n\n3) A 3 is a passing grade, but many colleges do not accept 3s. If I prove that I am educated enough on the topic to hypothetically pass the course, why am I still taking it?\n\n4) College Board literally threatens students. I'm not saying they shouldn't punish those who go against academic integrity, but the whole \"if you violate our rules we will track you down and punish you via legal action AND we will email every single college you have ever interacted with and make sure they know what a bad student you are\" thing serves almost entirely to scare students. My anxiety for APs my senior year made me sick. \n\n5) Academics have become more of a competition rather than for the sake of learning. Again, I sort of see the appeal of this, but why am I paying $93 to prove that I don't need to take a college course because I'm already educated enough in that subject? This really is a factor of how education in America is severely overpriced, though. I acknowlege that. $93 v. $2k IS a steal, but it's still too much, especially for the students who can't afford it and suffer as a result.\n\n6) AP has become a popularity thing in some schools. This one sounds weird, but our generation has really flipped the whole \"being a nerd is lame\" thing on its head. Being smart is cool now, and that means taking APs even if you aren't going to college or don't really have any reason to take it in the first place. \n\nFrom a broad perspective, I agree with you. Financially, it's logical to go for a program in which you're only paying a fraction of what the course would really cost you at college. But when you look at other factors, it's way more complex than just that.  AP fails so many students because the ratio of students who actually get to reap the benefits is disproportionate by a very large disparity to the ones who do not. But if you're someone who benefited from it, that's awesome! Some of my friends have, too, but the overwhelming majority just unfortunately don't.",

[...] students in Asia had to take them the same time we did in America\n\nI totally agree this sucks, but I don't see why this would make APs \"a scam.\" Just because it was a logistical mess doesn't mean it doesn't serve its original purpose.\n\n> 2. There's a limit on the scores they can give out.\n\nDo you have a source for this? As far as I'm concerned, curves are pre-determined. I highly, highly, highly doubt this is what happens, especially given different tests have different distributions.\n\n> 3. A 3 is a passing grade, but many colleges do not accept 3s.\n\nThis doesn't really answer your criticism, but I do NOT think a 3 should be a passing grade lol. If you get a 3 or below on an AP exam, I genuinely believe you lack a fundamental understanding of the subject area. If I get to make the decision, I would honestly just raise the bar for getting a 3 to solve this problem.\n\n> 4. College Board literally threatens students.\n\nIf that's what they do (I'm assuming you have evidence for it), then yeah, that's obviously horrible. But again, I don't see how this contributes to APs being a scam.\n\n> 5. $93 v. $2k IS a steal, but it's still too much\n\nSure, the test is still very pricey, not to mention that's the price for each individual test. That still makes APs much LESS of a scam than colleges though, wouldn't you agree?\n\n> 6. AP has become a popularity thing in some schools.\n\nThis problem isn't caused by APs; it's caused by the overall academic culture surrounding high schools. Even if APs cease to exist, there were always be something people are going to compete over for popularity. APs are just a mean, not a cause.\n\n> Some of my friends have, too, but the overwhelming majority just unfortunately don't.\n\nI'm curious what your basis is on this. Are you saying a lot of people pay to take the test but don't end up passing, and thus they waste money? Do you have actual data on how many people this happens to?",

What matters most is studying effectively and with intent, spinning your wheels will get you nowhere. That's why the kids I hear who say \"I reread the textbook like 5 times and studied 12 hours a day and still ended up with a B\", I can instantly tell that they are incredibly capable people who are one breakthrough away from academic success. They have all the right stuff, except they're not studying effectively enough, rarely are there any other deficits. I think we do a disservice to the students we try to help when we put the blame on them and make them believe that their *efforts* were deficient, instead of pushing them to revise their study methods.",

I was kind of a fuck up in high school, but I don't think it's a good predictor of success. Grit and adaptability are more important. For me the biggest thing was learning how to learn, which pushed me from probably a B+ student to an A student. I'd file that under \"adaptability\". It's so weird, because I'm the same dude, but now I'm winning awards. I didn't suddenly become more smart, I just learned how to play the game.",
