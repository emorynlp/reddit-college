  "text": "A sophomore in college, I find myself losing more streaks than I am gaining them. I have like 4 left because most days I just forget to open the app with all my work. I was never big on social media anyway but hopped on the snap trend freshman year of high school. I thought about ending the rest but I\u2019ve always had a streak with someone so I think it would feel weird. Yes I know I can just snap people who I ended streaks with but I\u2019d kind of rather just not\u2026 \n\nAnyone else go through this phase where you realize the app is mostly pointless yet you\u2019ve got such a habit of keeping streaks it would feel weird to have none?",

      "text": "I wanted to disconnect for a little so I haven\u2019t used Snapchat for almost three months now. I didn\u2019t realize HOW MUCH I would end up disconnecting and it made me realize that I use Snapchat a lot for communication, which I hate. But so do most of my friends. So right now I\u2019m almost on month 3 of no Snapchat and I realize I really don\u2019t know too much about what\u2019s happening in peoples/friends lives. Which is nice on one end, but I\u2019ve also had feelings of complete disconnect. I guess it just depends how much you use Snapchat for actual communication.",

          "text": "Thanks a lot for your input!\nMy friends seem to be posting on Snapchat and other social media about the same amount as usual, but for me I\u2019ve started to taper off a lot this year. I asked this question because I felt like I was alone in this situation. I guess it\u2019s normal for all people to stop at some using socials at some point unless they expect to be snapping friends pics of their babies in their 30s",

      "text": "I used to have tons of streaks. Then in junior year of high school I realized how shallow it was and let them all die. Now I still use it to communicate to my closest friends and occasionally swipe up on an old friend\u2019s story. I honestly know very few people in college who care about Snapchat streaks and I would find it a little immature if they did.",
