It's an \"off\" year (no presidential or congressional/senate elections) and only VA and NJ have governor elections, but it's not really a close race in NJ so that leaves VA. \n\nAssuming my guess is correct (and it might not be, lol, but seems reasonable enough), you can request an absentee ballot through the state's online \"[citizen portal](https://www.elections.virginia.gov/citizen-portal/).\"",
