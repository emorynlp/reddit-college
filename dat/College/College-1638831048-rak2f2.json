  "title:": "worried about HS GPA when applying for college",
  "text": "I've been graduated from HS for some time but I recently received my transcript to apply for some schools in NYC and I realized my school goes off of a 6.0 GPA scale. \n\nMy personal GPA was around a 4.089 is what it says. Is this pretty decent? \n\nI know there are obviously more factors that go into this like class rank. Mine was 162 out of 255 and I'm scared this is bad for colleges. Just curious of other peoples experiences with applying with a similar/low GPA. \n\nAny advice? Not sure what to take of this.",

              "text": "I know nothing about the 6.0 scale and haven't heard of any schools using it, but I think you have somewhere around a C+ on the letter grade scale, which mostly qualifies you for what people would consider to be \"mid-tier\" schools.  Grades aren't everything though, just make sure the rest of your application is good.  This whole game is basically the art of selling yourself, and they're 100% investing in you when you think about it, same as you are investing in them.",
