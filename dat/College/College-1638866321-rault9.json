  "text": "I am really upset because I can't take 8 at once, it's against the rules. I am old, 32 to be exact and I am poor ( I say old because I feel like I should be getting my Masters not my Associates at this juncture ). I have nothing but debt to my name and by the time I graduate it's going to become significantly worse. I only have 24 credit hours left and the maximum I can take is 5 classes, or 15 credit hours. Just wondering if anyone thinks it's worth it to frontload 5 this semester so I can lighten the load for the final one. I can handle a lot and I have a part time job but just trying to see what people think. Should I just do 4 and 4 or 5 and 3?",

      "text": "Have you tried talking to the dean? Most colleges have a \u201creal\u201d limit of like 25-30 credits you can take. There\u2019s a general limit for most students at like 18-22 depending on college, but usually you can get to the aforementioned \u201creal\u201d limit by submitting a petition to the dean of students or someone else.\n\nIt\u2019s for student protection, since most students would lose their minds taking 24 credits in a semester.",
