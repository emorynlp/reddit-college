So I asked him if there was a specific section he wanted us to focus on and he said to just read all of it.  I  realized that the PowerPoint summarized everything in the book so I just went over it and what helps is that the book has a section where they summarized what they talked about, so I took the quiz. I got a 10/10 without wasting my time reading a whole ass book.",

It wasn't as simple as \"open up to page 352 and answer question #7,\" it required actually going through the chapters and picking up on an overarching theme, analyzing pieces of artwork throughout multiple chapters and grouping them together on things they shared in common (and not just their medium and content), or comparing and contrasting artwork based on our knowledge of the history surrounding them.\n\nSo basically, I spent a few hours just skimming through the textbook at the middle and end of the semester BSing my way through it, which was more stressful and time consuming than reading the textbook and skimming the powerpoints would've been.\n\nThere's also a purpose to it, since if you're actually intending to learn something, the best way to remember it is having it reinforced multiple times. Once in your own reading, once more through your notes, and then a third time through the teacher's lecture.",
