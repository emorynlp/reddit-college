  "text": "So i have a journalism class that has a big project due in a couple weeks. we have to make a vide, do a podcast, take pictures, write an article, and make two graphs, Plus coordinate all the interviews for this assignment. Today my classmates were discussing how just seems impossible to complete in such a short amount of time and we were talking about maybe emailing the professor about lowering the requirements for this assignment. the thing is, how would we write such an email? Of course one of us will send it and tag the rest of the class. but how can we go about writing this email. any advice is appreciated.",

We had individual assignments about each components, like one assignment was about how to make a video, there other was how to make a podcast, etc. all to lead up to the final. and since a good chunk of students didn't know how to work with editing and things like that, myself included, we couldn't work on the final until we learned all the lessons. And even then, the assignment has not been explained to us till like two weeks ago, which basically left us a month to do this [final.so](https://final.so) I",

                          "text": "I would strongly advise you against sending this email.  It seems from what you've set forth that you were aware of this assignment since the beginning of the term (except the podcast) and that the entire term has been designed to \"scaffold\" you to complete this project, which I imagine accounts for a large portion of your grade.  \n\nIt is very difficult to arrange interviews at the last minute, and I sympathize with you on that.  But it does not sound like your current predicament came out of the blue; when did you begin contacting potential interviewees?  \n\nMost professors aren't capricious in designing assessments and, given what you've said about all of the planning yours has put into teaching you the skills you need to succeed, they were not.  We design assignments with \"learning objectives\" in mind; students have to demonstrate certain competencies in order to receive credit for the course.  I don't know what type of course this is, but it sounds like competence in various media is central to the aims of the course. \n\nSo I would not expect this professor to simply do away with one or more of these components because several students (by the sound of it) failed to start work on it until the very end.",
