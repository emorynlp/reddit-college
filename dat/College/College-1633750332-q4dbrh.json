  "text": "Long story short, in one class I\u2019m going to end the class with either a high C or low B. So far I have managed to have straight A\u2019s and have my GPA at 3.88. I know my GPA will drop. Would it still be possible to graduate with Latin honors? I\u2019m set to graduate next semester.",
