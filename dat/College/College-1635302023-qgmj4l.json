  "text": "There's this website called FreezeCrowd that tries to get people to sign up through emails or DMs. \n\nIn May I received a lot of DMs from an account with my school's name and \\_unofficialyearbook. I was like okay I guess I'll sign up since it's a \"class effort\" according to them. A few main points of what I have learned:\n\n1. **They sell your email address and all your data.** In their Terms of Service, you agree that your information including your email can and will be sold.\n   1. Terms of Service say: \" You hereby agree and consent to the use and transfer of any aggregate data submitted by you to third parties, without need for consent. \" and   \"WE DO NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT ... (E) THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE OR THAT WE COLLECT SHALL NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTIES\"\n   2. Since then, I have received incessant emails from people trying to scam college students like HYPEBEAST.Inc and the \"Department of Education\", both offering to pay me (???)\n2. **The website is horrible and blank**\n   1. No one at your school will use it. No one. \n3. **They use misleading tactics to get people to sign up**\n   1. They told me it's a student-run yearbook. It's not.\n\nThere's also a bunch of sketchy business stuff like not paying the developers, but you can look that up if you're interested. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Don't trust any \"unofficial yearbook\" accounts and don't sign up for FreezeCrowd because they will sell your email address to scammers.",
