  "text": "So I'm trying to decide which business associates degree is best for me. My long term goal is to someday run and operate my own HVAC company as I'm also going to school for the trade.\nI was shown \"Business management and Sales Management Specialization\" and \"business management\".\nThe only differences I see are the sales management degree comes with \"integrated software applications\" and \"business computer application\" classes where the  business management degree has a \"small business/entrepreneurship\" class.\nAny idea what might be better? \nI'm honestly trying to choose the class that will teach me the most and give me what I need to operate my own business successfully. I dont care much about what the degree leads to or how it looks on paper. I'm just trying to get the most education from my classes.",

I asked a simple question about a college degree and your answer was \"watch youtube\". \nForgive me for assuming you were a shitty entrepreneur. Turns out you were commenting on entrepreneurship without any idea as to what it takes to actually run a successfully business. \nSo, I'll gladly take my GI Bill, get a college degree for free, obtain the KNOWLEDGE I need to be successful. I posted asking a question for a reason, not to have my time wasted by a fucking moron.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t get a degree if you want to own a business. Assuming you don\u2019t need it to secure financing, it would be a waste. \n\nSee if you can take specific classes in basic finance and accounting and that\u2019s about all you need. An associates is kinda a bust for information you can apply in majority. Assuming you don\u2019t know much about management you could look into taking a couple of those classes too. Then as you find stuff you think is interesting or you don\u2019t know, take more of those. Or just look up each subject online. A lot of the information given in the lower and even to an extent higher level classes can be found online for free.\n\nCollege really won\u2019t give you what you need for a business as much as it might teach you the language and give you resources to ask, such as professors. \n\nI would suggest going to an HVAC company and try to work in different positions. Then take a couple of college classes and then start your business. Real world experience applies better than a college class any day.",
