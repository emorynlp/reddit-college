  "text": "This was a hard school year for me and I am feeling down because having 3 Cs in college does not seem great. All 3 of the classes had absolutely no assignments except for 4 or 5 tests throughout the semester, so clearly I am not the best test taker in the world. I am a sophomore and I just was wondering if anyone else has been through this and has still gone on to succeed and get a job after.",
