  "text": "I want to keep pursuing music in my life. I\u2019ve been doing music, playing musical instruments and been in the musical program since kindergarten and I\u2019m in my senior year of high school now. I never wanted music to leave my life and I always imagined it being in my life. \n\nI express myself though music; music is my savior and it means everything to me. It\u2019s very therapeutic to me and I enjoy it. \nI still want music in my life, I love marching band and I\u2019ve been considering of joining dci but I have to go to college and I want to persue something music related. I have my eye on music performance but I can\u2019t see what I\u2019d be doing with the degree of it. I\u2019m very dedicated to my craft but I fear I\u2019m not good enough. \n\nSo I also decided as a backup plan for music education\u2026being a teacher but I have bad social anxiety but i really wanna be surrounded by music and teach people about it. \nI can\u2019t imagine any other interest I have besides music. I tired psychology, I hated it. I tried computers and thought about computer science but I cannot do math. Im very bad at it. So that\u2019s a weakness of mine. But I\u2019m very good at creating things and instruments which leads me back to music. I was looking at music technology but I tried to see myself working on tech and not playing a instrument, but I don\u2019t want that. I want to play a instrument so what field of music could I go into? \nCould I just go into the field of \u201cmusic\u201d and get a degree in that? Learn all the things of music?",

      "text": "Have you considered becoming a music therapist? \n\nAlso, consider working on the social anxiety and overcoming it. I have horrible social anxiety but worked as a music teacher and it wasn't so bad. It's terrifying when you first start but after a while you get used to it. In general, exposure therapy is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders-- avoidance tends to worsen them, whereas facing your fears tends to improve them. They key is taking baby steps instead of trying to face all your fears at once. \n\nIn music you probably want to specialize. Music education is the most stable, marketable major for musicians, since the demand for music teachers is higher than the demand for people with other specializations in music. You can start by teaching private one-on-one lessons-- in fact, you can probably try it out now, even as a high school student. \n\nI also know someone who got into instrumental repair, so maybe you could look into that?",
