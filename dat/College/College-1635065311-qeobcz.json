  "text": "It's rough! I fell super isolated. Family and bf can't relate to the stress I'm under. I take remote classes because I fell the college campus itself is targeted toward 18-20 year olds. Ideally Would love to join clubs and stuff at my cc but I would feel weird because these people in my classes already feel so much younger than me. So it's very lonely and I'm burnt out already in my third semester at home. But I am going to have continue.",

My mom went to college for ~~2 years (community college) & my boyfriend went to college for ~~2 year (community college) & is now going to tech school for his electrician job he got. \n\nWhile my family has gone to SOME college, no one really understands my stress either. They think I can just drop what I\u2019m doing and go away and hangout every weekend. I went to Knoebels this weekend & when I got here I found out that the cabin has no WiFi, so I was fucked I\u2019m not being able to do ANY HOMEWORK this weekend. I\u2019m stressed & no one in my family seems to understand.",

I find that university is worse since there are mostly traditional students. Even more so because I do everything in person. Most people my age take online classes but I hate online because I have a lot of learning disabilities.",

My family is unable to give any meaningful support so I'm doing both work and school full time. I have to keep my GPA as high as possible for my scholarship. It's hard, it's so much different than when we were younger and had less responsibilities.\n\nEdit: There's too much of an age gap between me and most of the younger students, honestly half the time it's like talking to an alien. My sister complained about people being younger than her and she's 23 like bro fr. Im almost a decade older than some of these kids",
