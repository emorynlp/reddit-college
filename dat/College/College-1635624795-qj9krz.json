  "title:": "Should I study astrophysics in Canada or France?",
  "text": "I'm in last year of high-school and have chosen to study astrophysics after graduation ( and hopefully get a PhD one day). It's getting bad where I live but I have the option to get a student visa to either Canada or France, in hope of staying long enough to get the nationality. I chose Canada and France specifically because I have an uncle in each country, which will make my time there a lot easier; I speak French and English fluently, although I have passed the DELF B2 exam and not the SAT, so I guess it's either France or French Canadian universities.\n\n  Let's not forget, after getting a PhD in astrophysics, will I have a hard time finding work in either France or Canada?",

              "text": "There's some exemptions for the TOEFL, for example if you studied in an English-speaking school for the last 4 years of school, I think? There's other ones, but I think it depends on the uni, so totally check the English requirements for the school you're interested in applying to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout the time, when are you planning on taking TOEFL? I took mine in January, applied for my Visa in April and still was able to get an answer before September, so don't sweat it.",

      "text": "When making the choice, make sure you consider things like culture and climate. Both Canada and France are great countries, but they're different, and chances are that you'll like one of the two places better.\n\nAbout the climate thing-- from what I gather you currently live in a warm country, and as someone who lives significantly south of Canada (New York City, which is warmer than most--or maybe all-- of Canada) I know many immigrants from these sorts of warmer climates who love living here otherwise but are miserable several months out of the year because they *hate* the cold. I don't know if you know what \"Canada cold\" feels like, but if it turns out that you don't like it, then you probably don't want to be stuck in that country.\n\n[Here are some Questions and Answers about handling the cold from the University of Toronto](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/Winter-facts.pdf). \n\nFrance, on the other hand, is well known to have a much \"nicer\" climate than Canada. \n\nObviously, you may want to talk to people from Canada and France to get a feel for cultural aspects, and you may want to talk to people who have immigrated to those places to get a feel for what their experiences were like.\n\n>  after getting a PhD in astrophysics, will I have a hard time finding work in either France or Canada?\n\nIf it's anything like the US (and I can't guarantee it is, but there's a reasonable chance there are at least some similarities), it's is unlikely you'll get a job as an astrophysicist, but quite likely that you'll be able to use some of the skills you learned in the PhD program to get a job doing something else, since very few people will have the advanced math skills you will have gained, and a number of careers require the advanced math skills you will have gained. So I'd be surprised if you have a hard time \"finding work,\" but I also wouldn't bank on getting your \"dream job.\"\n\nJob markets of course do vary depending on location, so obviously feedback from people from Canada or France would be better than mine. Like, in the US we have a huge tech industry as well as significantly sized industry that contracts with our government, both of which would potentially be interested in someone with advanced math skills. Without these huge industries, I'm not entirely certain the market would be as good, but generally speaking math skills are the sort of skills that have the potential to be marketable wherever you go. The being said, be mindful of something like [this](https://ftp.iza.org/dp11197.pdf). The link is a warning that engineers find jobs easier in France than PhD's (this is often the case in the US, too, but I think it's worse in France), so consider the risk of becoming \"overeducated.\" If getting a stable job is your primary goal, then there's a good chance that you're better off getting an engineering degree than a PhD. That doesn't mean you won't find a job with a PhD, but many people assume that getting a PhD will make finding a job easier, when that's not necessarily the case. I don't know how this situation is in Canada, but given that the \"engineers are often hired over PhD's\" thing happens in both France and the US, I'll go out on a limb and say it probably happens in Canada too.\n\nSorry I can only speak from an American perspective, but I hope what I could offer helped.",

          "text": "Hey, thanks for the detailed reply!\n\n  I didn't know the winter was that hard in Canada; I can barely make it through our 10\u00b0C winters. I'll ask my relatives about it.\n\n  As for the work options, I kind of guessed that I'll still be able to find work outside the field, as you said advanced math skills in addition to programming skills (I'm learning to code in Python) are something the tech industry is looking for. \n\n  I'm not sure of the full extent of opportunities that are granted by an astrophysics PhD, but I was thinking of becoming a reasercher, and there's also the option of teaching at universities. It seems like a common thing for astrophysics PhDs to become reaserchers at their universities and even teach there.",
