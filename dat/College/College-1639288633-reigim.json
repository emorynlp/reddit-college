  "text": "Hey!\n\nI'm thinking of starting a community forum/group/discord server for Gen-Zers interested in business/entrepreneurship. I know a few people who love to hear how other high school/college students are earning money (including myself), and I think having a forum dedicated to Gen-Z businesses/side hustles would be useful for a lot of people.\n\nIs anyone interested in joining?",
