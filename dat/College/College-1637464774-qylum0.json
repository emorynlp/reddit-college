  "text": "I feel like I can never make the right choice. Everything from the school I chose to go to to my major to the location I chose to attend school in\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m constantly being told I\u2019m going to fail. \n\nI go to a liberal arts college and I can\u2019t fucking escape people constantly joking about how I\u2019m just gonna work in fucking retail. Hell, one of the top fucking posts on the sub rn is a meme about going to college and still living paycheck to paycheck and one of the top comments was \u201cliberal arts majors be like\u201d. It makes me feel like shit. \n\nI\u2019m majoring in cognitive science bc it\u2019s the closest thing to a STEM degree (a portion of cognitive science is computer science) that won\u2019t make me wanna kill myself and will allow me to get a career that might pay well and that I might not completely hate. But still, it\u2019s not good enough. I\u2019m still told that my degree is a load of useless bullshit. \n\nI feel like if I don\u2019t follow a very specific and narrow path I\u2019m just constantly being reminded that I\u2019m going to fucking fail. I\u2019m trying my hardest to balance what everyone tells me is the \u201cright\u201d choice with what won\u2019t make me wanna leap of a goddamn bridge, but I feel like I\u2019m always hearing that I should just risk misery and possibly offing myself at 25 from hating my entire college experience and career for the sake of being \u201cfinancially successful\u201d. \n\nWhat the fuck does world want from me? I can\u2019t keep doing this bullshit. Everywhere I turn I\u2019m just being reminded that I\u2019m gonna be a fucking failure and I\u2019m fucking tired of it.",

      "text": "You\u2019ve got to relax man. Nobody ever bettered their lives by being angry at the world and making decisions when they\u2019re emotionally heated. The world is a rough place. People are going to joke about everything and the best thing you can do is take it in stride. Nobody is actively wishing you to fail, it\u2019s just a statistical fact that most arts and humanities majors have very poor career outcomes.\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, cognitive science does have some decent opportunities. But you\u2019re sure as shit not going to succeed and take advantage of them with this chip on your shoulder. Just relax. I\u2019m a business major. We get memed at all the time for being mommy daddy money, for being too dumb to do engineering, for being the default major everyone picks who doesn\u2019t know wtf they wanna do, the party major, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s all in good fun. We get made fun of for that. We make fun of liberal arts majors for the Starbucks jobs. Engineers make fun of everyone, until they cry because we laugh about their 30 hours of weekly homework and crap writing skills. C\u2019mon man, everyone roasts everyone. It\u2019s not personal. Have fun and focus on yourself and making a better future.",

          "text": "I agree. OP, please take everything with a grain of salt know that roasting every major is for giggles and satire. Cognitive sciences and humanities have great value when applied to a career. You can advance in clinical Psych, and even writing. Many STEM professionals have gone into humanities do so because of their own interests and creativity. Reality is no one path is the only path to a goal.",

I'm just saying that even on this metric that everyone believes is so important, liberal arts majors do just fine according to anyone who does the research.",
