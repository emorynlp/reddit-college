  "text": "Im currently a CS major attending community college and I plan on transferring to a UC / CSU the upcoming fall. My academic counselor recommended me to take 2 more GE classes to receive my associate degree. However, I would like to receive a BS degree from a 4 year university instead.\n\nMy question is that is it possible for me to have an AS in CS while also receiving my BS in CS when I graduate from a 4 year university? That would mean I would have both an AS and BS in Computer science when I graduate college. \n\nI\u2019m still wondering what the benefits are from receiving my AS.",
