  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need your help regarding building performance. I\u2019m studying an IT course and during the first year, I had exemplary performance with the top marks in my class. Apart from marks, I truly enjoyed my studies and felt ambitious to do something. \n\nHowever, when the pandemic struck, I somewhat lost my motivation to do anything at all. Online classes didn\u2019t make sense nor helped me do anything. Over the time, I started taking my studies for granted and my SGPA dropped by two whole pointers. I regained some of it in the next semester but I\u2019m still unable to reach where I started. \n\nDue to continuous low performance, I\u2019m also exhibiting symptoms of exam anxiety, which I didn\u2019t have, such as puking thrice before an exam and going entirely blank. It\u2019s getting out of control as I cannot eat anything without feeling squirmish even a week before exams. \n\nI\u2019d truly appreciate any help or tips to overcome this. Thank you.",
