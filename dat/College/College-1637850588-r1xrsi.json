  "text": "So my gf is going to a hair school college locally in my town. This school is owned by a local family and it is a private school. The school has people come in to get their hair done for a reduced fee and have the students cut their hair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to covid, there aren't very many people coming to get their haircuts, and with the 20 odd students in the class sharing these, all of the students have filed a complaint saying they aren't learning enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the owners had come in, told everyone that he is making a ton of money and owns all these businesses and if they don't like how they are learning they can always go to get more manikins to practice on. This course is 10,000 dollars and many students do not have the money to buy additional manikins.\n\nIn response while one of the students was trying tob ring up these problems, he told her to shut up and that important people are talking. What can my gf and the rest of these students do to complain about this school?",

      "text": "It's a private, for-profit business.  \n\nThere isn't much you can do if the owners of the for-profit business believe they are delivering a product of acceptable quality.  \n\nAll you can do is take your money elsewhere and buy someone else's product or service.  \n\nYou could complain to whatever state or academic or trade-skill entity certifies their school as legitimate, but you won't see any immediate result from that effort. It will take months to years for real action to result from that.  \n\nI'd focus on asking what the current, written policies are for withdrawl from the course for a refund / partial-refund.  \n\nActually, I'd ask for the student handbook and read the policies for yourself BEFORE you ask about them to minimize their advance warning of the question.  \n\nWhatever the policy is, your gf accepted the policy when they enrolled, so if the policy says \"fuck you, no refunds ever\" then you have no real leverage to ask for your money back.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nCaution:  \n\nBefore you go all the way off the deep-end you might try to find similar schools nearby and ask if those students have any better access to customers to practice on.  \n\nCOVID is dampening things like hair salon activities all over the nation and the world. So it might not be unique to your school.  \n\nSure, your school could try to subsidize the cost of practice manikins or try to stimulate business by literally paying customers money to come get their hair cut by students.  \nBut they are not obligated to do such things.  \n\n\nI get it: the owners of the school are not nice people. That's unfortunately not unlawful though.  \n\nYou could find the requirements from the state educational or trade-school entity and see what they are obligated to teach & provide and see if they are meeting those obligations. But again, you're not likely to see immediate action from such an allegation or complaint.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nBest of luck, hope you find a path forward.",

      "text": "He sounds condescending and harsh. Unfortunately, there may not be much anyone can do because it\u2019s a private organization. If the class as a whole doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re learning what they were supposed to due to provable external factors (ie, COVID and the need for mannequins that they can\u2019t afford but had no idea they needed), you may be able to speak to a lawyer, but I am not certain of the laws here, and it may not go anywhere.",
