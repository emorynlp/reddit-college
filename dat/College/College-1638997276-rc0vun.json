  "text": "I\u2019m a class of 23 and I have recently gotten emails from a few really good colleges, but I\u2019m not sure what I should do with them. I\u2019m interested in one of the colleges but I haven\u2019t looked at the other. Should I think these colleges want me or should I keep them as an afterthought?",

      "text": "A majority of those are spam and marketing emails from various private and career specific colleges that have no admission rates and charge high tuition. Simply put, they want your money. Why accept offers from colleges that you don't know, or don't even offer the major you want?\n\nBy the time you reach senior year, you'll have the opportunity apply for the universities you want to go into, as well as the major you want to pursue. And different colleges offer different majors and classes. A major in one college might not be offered in another. So it's best to start researching about the major you want to pursue, and then see which colleges offer that major. Legitimate and prestigious public 4-years with low admission rates don't come to you. You come to them.",
