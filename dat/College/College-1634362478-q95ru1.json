      "text": "Honestly, you shouldn't fret about it. Just because yiu don't make friends within the first few times, doesn't mean you're in the wrong.\n\nYou're not in college to make friends. You're there to study, get a degree, and be better at life. Focus, and the rest will happen at its own time as you visit the places you like, meet people who share your passion, and so on so forth. Just focus on studying and the rest will happen naturally.",
