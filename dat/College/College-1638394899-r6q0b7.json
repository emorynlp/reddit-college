      "text": "Obligatory \"nobody knows\" but here is what I think of the situation:\n\nI really doubt we'll ever go into a large-scale, long-term lockdown (like early 2020) again, unless shit gets *really* bad. Simply because society and our economy can't handle it.\n\nThe 2020 lockdowns have already damaged the economy for the next few years, caused shortages, and ruined small businesses.  Some children have barely learned in the past year and a half. And if people have to adapt to perpetually locking down - \"we don't know if we can go to the pool or see grandma this summer Johny, we have to look at the case numbers\" - it's going to have an impact on mental health.\n\nMoreover, it's clear that we can't use lockdowns to eradicate covid, all they do is slow and delay it. Unless maybe we do a super-intense lockdown and institute martial law. So there's not really much purpose.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't be surprised if we have more short-term, localized lockdowns. When hospitals start getting overwhelmed in a particular region, the economic and social destruction from a short-term lockdown is worth possibly saving lives because the hospitals are too crowded.\n\nBut these lockdowns would be *short*, e.g. 2-4 weeks, until hospitalizations start to fall (and if they're not falling in 2-4 weeks we have bigger troubles). They would be local so you're unlikely to be affected by them. And hopefully people would plan for them, so e.g. if a college goes online it would be back in-person when the lockdown ends.",

Overreaction sucks but when it comes to a deadly virus, it's better than underreaction.\n\nEventually it might both evade vaccines and be deadly- all because we decided to be chill about it.",

It also really depends on where you go to school, depends on what the state decides and what the school itself decides. For UMass Amherst (where I am now) we must have our booster and get tested 10-14 days prior to the start of the spring semester. Idk remember exactly what southern schools did last year but I think they probably would stay in person no matter what at this point.\n\nPersonally I am considering transferring south if another lockdown happens, last year was really mentally draining especially because it was my freshman year (which was online) and the best half of my senior year did not happen because of COVID. I really hated the online stuff and really don't want to return to it, I learn better in person. Although I'm considering transferring anyways because I am not having a great time at my current school so.",
