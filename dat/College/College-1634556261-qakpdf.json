  "text": "I\u2019m a first year student at ASU and I really am not enjoying my experience and fear that it won\u2019t get any better as the time goes on. My classes are easy and my grades are A\u2019s/B\u2019s. \nI\u2019m not worried about the classes or workload, I\u2019m more worried about if college is for me.  \n\nIf I drop out I would have a full time job working for my dad\u2019s company and would be in the position to take it over should I decide to in a few years. One downside that I see with this is that I could decide to drop out and work there, but if I decided that I didn\u2019t want to take over the company I would have a hard time finding a job with no degree. I worked there during HS and really enjoyed the sales part of it (I\u2019m majoring in marketing rn and don\u2019t even know why). I also enjoyed repairing the machines that came back. What I hated was having to work on computers for everything such as Excel and Goldmine. But that\u2019s the way the world is going and there\u2019s no escaping it no matter what field I choose. I\u2019m blessed to have had a lot more experience in the business field than most of the people in my classes and feel that I\u2019m wasting my potential in being here, especially ASU (I could have gone to TCU/The Ohio State but I flipped a coin and ended up here). \n\nClearly, college was never something I was excited about. I\u2019m hoping that it gets better sooner rather than later because as of now all I want to do is work a real job with real money, buy my own apartment, and just be independent without professors and staff forcing me to learn useless subjects and pissing away my parents hard earned money at an institution that I\u2019m not thrilled about. I\u2019ve got a few good friends here but none like I did back home. And I find it difficult to make new friends here because I don\u2019t really enjoy spending time with the party/sex 24/7 crowd that ASU is known for. Although I do like kickbacks and a good party every now and then. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about community college but I feel that my issue is not that I don\u2019t know what school I want to go to or what field. Rathe, there\u2019s nothing that excites me when I think of college. And I feel that going to a community for two years and transferring would make it a little bit more challenging to create friendships when most people have already had established friend groups from the years prior. And if I\u2019m going to college, I\u2019d like the college experience and I feel that community/being a commuter isn\u2019t the same as going to a uni.  \n\nI guess I\u2019m writing this in search of some form of guidance or an opinion that\u2019ll help me in this decision. Truthfully, I\u2019m only going to college because I fear that without a degree I\u2019ll be in a difficult position to land the type of job I want. But since I basically have a guaranteed job in the field that I want, I feel that my sole reason is eliminated. \n\nIf you were me, what would you do? Personally, I\u2019d like to see myself finish college with a degree for the sole purpose of having more job opportunities but I just hate the way my life is going right now. In a way, I almost feel like it\u2019s doing me more harm than good being here (mentally). Perhaps my issue lay not in the college but in myself then. Especially because I\u2019m not 100% sure of what I want to do in the future. But what do I know, I\u2019m just a kid that feels lost in his life right now. \nAny sort of input is greatly appreciated, thank you all so much.",

      "text": "I say you try and stick it out. If you aren\u2019t happy at the college you are at now, and it is an out of state school, have you considered transferring to a school closer to home?\n\nYou could always go to a college within your state or attend an accredited online college, and have the ability to either work part-time, or work-full time and become a part-time student. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the latter, you don\u2019t have to get a degree within the traditional four years. \n\nUltimately, if you want to get your degree, you need to choose an option that\u2019s not only realistic, but most sustainable for your well-being. Yes you should go to college to get an education, but those years you are there shouldn\u2019t be miserable if you can help it.",

      "text": "I\u2019m someone who has never liked school. I didn\u2019t exactly want to go to college. I also have ADHD which makes school extra hard for me. I\u2019m finally about to graduate, but I can\u2019t count how many times I thought about dropping out. Honestly, my college years have been the most miserable years of my life.\n\nAs much as I have hated college though, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t drop out. I\u2019m so proud of myself for pushing through and doing this. Maybe my degree helps with a job. Maybe not. That\u2019s not the only thing college is good for. You learn so much. You gain valuable skills. College will teach you things without you even realizing it.\n\nIf you put in the time and effort, you will walk out of college with a lot more than a diploma. Ultimately, it\u2019s your decision whether you want to do college or not. You have to do what you think is best for you. If you ask me though, it\u2019s worth it.",
