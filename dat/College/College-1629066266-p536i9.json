  "text": "  So, you\u2019ve just arrived at school, live in the dorms, and are having trouble meeting people. Here are some tips!  \n  \n1) Leave your door open. Signals people are welcome to pop in and say \"hi.\"  \n1b) Say \"hi\" to people with their door open. It might be super scary, but come up with an ice breaker like, \u201cOh, hey, my name is X. Cool poster! I was just wondering if you knew what time food service starts in the morning?\u201d Or\u2026 \u201cThe wifi is kind of wonky in my room, how has it been for you?\u201d  \n2) Introduce yourself to the neighbors as soon as possible. It will be way more awkward introducing yourself half way through the semester.  \n3) Similar to 1b, compliment people! Especially people you know live near by, but haven\u2019t talked to yet. \u201cCool pin!\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019d you get those shoes?\u201d \u201cI like your hair.\u201d Keep it simple, don\u2019t be creepy.  \n4) If you\u2019re at food service and don\u2019t have anyone to sit with, find another lonely soul and ask if you can sit down! They\u2019re probably in the same boat as you! Ask where they\u2019re from, their major, etc., etc. Ask questions!  \n  \nWho has more to add?  \n  \n*Bonus points if you get the Radiohead reference.",

          "text": "I feel that. I attended community college and socializing is not as simple when people don't live together.\n\nPerhaps set up a sort of \"home base\" on-campus where people can usually find you? Ex: if you like a particular table to study at in a lounge or outside. That can give you a familiar place to claim as your own, and then you can focus on introducing yourself to or complimenting people who also frequent that spot. This should be a place for medium-focusing, or hanging out. If you're desperately trying to cram for something maybe the library or your apartment is a better choice.\n\nAt community college I would often sit outside near a fountain to study or read. The fountain drowned out excess noise, and I was comfortable and near student traffic. If people from class walked by we could exchange hello's or talk shit about homework. People would sometimes stop and ask for directions. It was a comfortable place for me, and I could invite others into it.\n\nAnother thing is to be ALERT when walking between classes. (Maybe stay off your phone while walking?) Glance at the people walking by or sitting down that you pass. If you recognize them AT ALL from class or orientation, stop/approach them and say \"Hi! You look familiar, aren't we in the same class/orientation?\" People might not respond if they are lost in thought, but usually will say hi. Then you can keep it really short, saying \"Well it's nice seeing you! I gotta get to class. See you around!\" If you both want a longer conversation, then great! But these short positive interactions are really helpful for establishing that you as a friendly, welcoming person to talk to.\n\nLastly, if there are any extracurriculars you are interested in, that can be a great way to meet new people. It was crucial for me as a commuter student. Best of luck!",

Friendship is give and take, so if you want to find real friends, you\u2019ve got to give a little to see who\u2019ll give in return.

This post is an important first step to meeting people, but you're right it isn't a guide to finding your kindred spirits.\n\nPersonally, I need friends who can be there for me when they are able, and vice versa. I have never really been able to maintain non-romantic relationships where we deeply rely on each other for more than 6 months (think best friend). So I'm not necessarily looking for a friend to \"stick with me until the end,\" I am looking for friends who can support me now (if they're able), and who I can support now (if I'm able). If our relationship endures, that is awesome! But I know that with my mental health issues I am often not great at keeping in touch. (Ex: I'll go though a depressed/anxious period or my ADHD makes responding to things difficult).\n\nIdk. Maybe it's because it's been 4 years since I graduated highschool, and this is how I have noticed my relationships evolve. People move, change values, grow their family, and change life priorities. I work on building friendships locally, where I am at, that can exist into the future without too much upkeep. Being able to talk to someone I haven't seen in a year and for it to feel like not a day has passed is a beautiful thing for me. College is always going to be weird for friendships. Most of the friends I will make at college will probably move away. So while college is local, those friends will be my priority. When I move elsewhere, my new local friends will probably be my priority.\n\nAnd as others stated, pleasantries, chats, and hello's are really important for mental health and just feeling accepted in a space as a human being. Besties are super important for feeling that your unique self is awesome and accepted, but friendly acquaintances should not be undervalued.",

      "text": "As a social butterfly who lived at home for some of my adult life and who is about to move to university: definitely say hi if a room door is open! I always keep my bedroom door open if I want to say hi to my siblings. Personally, I plan to keep a comfy chair free from stuff in my room so that people can wander in, sit, and chat if they'd like.\n\nSocializing in a new place can be downright terrifying, whether it is \"I'm new here\" nervousness or ongoing social anxiety. One thing I am doing is mentally preparing myself for this exhaustion/anxiety, by telling myself\n--\"yeah, uni is going to be kind of scary to adjust to. I will have to learn all these new daily patterns, new life and social habits, and I am going to have unfamiliar safe spaces. But! I will be in a beautiful place, exploring a new life, and get to meet a bunch of funky people! And when I get overwhelmed, I can take a nap, walk to the bathroom/water fountain, or sit in the garden/library!\"--\nBasically familiarize yourself with expected stressors, and think of ways to calm down or reduce the stress - remember: good things can also be stressful, and it is okay to recover from exciting things the same way you would recover from unpleasant things. Acknowledging the stress of meeting people (as it presents for you) can help you not get blindsided by those emotions and inner thoughts as much.\n\nPersonally, I am mentally practicing getting OUT of conversations so that when I need to recharge, I can. I LOVE talking with people, but often chat to the point where I am burnt out. So, I am preparing myself to say things like \"I am really glad I got to talk to you! I need to run, but I'll see you around!\" or \"I hate to interrupt our conversation but I am pretty exhausted and have to get going. Good luck on XYZ!\" (1: Compliment conversation/person, 2: say you have to leave, 3: give a cheery farewell)\n\nWell that meandered a lot... Basically, while socializing can be \"simple\" it can also be stressful. Learning how to anticipate and coexist with the stressors you encounter is super helpful!",

If you have time I definitely recommend stopping by your school's counseling department if they have one! Therapy is helpful for 80% of people - regardless of diagnosis. Plus, they might have candy at the front desk...",
