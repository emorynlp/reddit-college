  "text": "My biochem lab professor absolutely hates me. It\u2019s a small lab of 10 people and everyone in that lab told me that he doesn\u2019t like me. On the first day of class he screwed up a problem on the board and I raised my hand and asked him why he did it that way then when he explained it I told him respectfully that the way he did the question is incorrect. He did not realize what was wrong so I had to walk him through it step by step on the board, which I get made him embarrassed and look like an idiot in front of the class but it\u2019s not my fault he did the problem wrong. Since that day he has hated me. He consistently grades me harsher than all my peers and takes off points for things that others didn\u2019t lose points for. \n\nLast week he screwed up an answer key for a quiz and when I told him that the key is wrong and proved to him that my answer is correct he refused to give me the points back, instead he said \u201cI\u2019ll just throw that question out. \u201d \n\nOn another instance he took off points because he claimed I had not included my pKa value in my notebook, when I showed it to him that it was on the next page he refused to give me the points back claiming that I should\u2019ve circled it. \n\n\nAnother thing that happened today. He took off points for my notebook because he claimed I didn\u2019t include my data. When I showed him it in my notebook he claimed that I wrote in after he handed back the notebooks. Then I showed him the same data on another page that he had also commented he was like ok and gave me back 1 of the two points. Then I asked why only 1 of the 2 then he said ok fine and gave me back both points. \n\nHe huffed and it was one of the rudest encounters ever tbh. \n\n\n\nWhat do I do? ",

I'm sure you know this, but it's good to be reminded, one day you'll be the boss and won't have to worry about it.

In 2nd semester I helped my friend out of a trouble because he was going to fail the course because the teacher didn't put his assistance on a list a day we had to present a project.\n\nWhen the teacher took assistance, she recognized my name and immediately asked me to have a couple words, of course I said yes, she is the teacher.\n\nShe made it to me very clear that what I did in the previous semester was wrong and that I was walking on a thin line between continuing my studies or being expelled, at first I didn't know what she was talking about but then I remembered, she let it pass but made that class impossible for me.\n\nEveryday she would name me to pass to the front to solve exercises, or when she asked something and no one answered I had to, even an examn I had like a 95% she put me a 56%. At the end I passed the course but it was hard, is a pain in the ass having a teacher like that in your back but at the end I made it, so maybe there is hope for you.\n\nI couldn't go to her superiors because she is member and leader of a teacher \"syndicate\" so the next superior was the sub-director who is a really good friend of her, so I had no option to stick with it and hope for the best",

His behavior is inexcusable if what you have written is a pretty unbiased account. I've known similar asshole professors, so I believe you. The chair of the department can talk with him, and he is NOT ALLOWED TO RETALIATE. That's a way for the university to get sued (by you) and possibly for the professor to get fired. To get the best outcome possible with the chair of the department, bring one or two students from your class that have the same answers with different point values taken off.

He may not lose his job and get off with a warning, but I've seen tenured profs at my university get major penalties from doing shit like that (teaching only intro classes, not being allowed to advise students, only teaching night classes). If this is an ongoing problem, this may not be strike 1 either. \n\nEither way, your grade isn't representative of what you're getting correctly, and he isn't treating you professionally. In fact, I would actually lead the conversation with the chair with that information. If they don't act, go to the dean of the college that department is housed in. Students are not without power in these situations. The biggest issue is they wait until the end of the semester to complain, and that's far from effective.",
