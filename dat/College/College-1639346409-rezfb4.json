  "text": "The concept of gen-eds is weird to me. Particularly if you pay very big money for the \"privilege\" of studying in a university. From what I understand, anyone, even an engineering major is forced to attend classes that are totally unrelated to their major. How much time to they take up? Do all universities require the same amount? Are they taken seriously? Doesn't anyone have a problem with paying exorbitant tuition fees and being forced to take classes they don't need? ",

      "text": "Most universities have requirements for an English/writing class, a math class, a science class, a history class, and a foreign language class. The exact details will vary from school to school but that\u2019s the overall idea. I think the general education requirements at my school totaled about 36 credit hours, or about 12 classes spread out over 4 years. Again, it will be different depending on where you go. \n\n(For reference, most bachelors degrees require about 120 credit hours.) \n\nSome of these courses can over lap with your major. For example as a chemistry major I took a lot of math and science anyway. Calc 1 counted as a math gen ed and my chem 1 and bio 1 counted as my science gen eds. \n\nThere are several reasons for them. I personally think money is a big one - they can require them and you have to pay if you want the degree. \n\nBut I think another reason is to ensure that everyone starts off on somewhat equal footing as they get into the upper level classes. High school education varies wildly and some people don\u2019t have the same opportunities, same level of education, or even quality teachers prior to college. They may need some of the gen ed courses to be able to do well in later courses. \n\nI think another idea behind them is that anyone who goes to college will have a basic understanding of math, science, reading, and writing at a higher level than just what\u2019s taught in high school. \n\nNow what is done in theory and how it plays out in reality are two very different things. Colleges have become more and more about making money and less about preparing students to enter a more specialized job field. \n\nThat\u2019s my 2 cents on it anyway.\n\nETA: Some people take them seriously, some don\u2019t even try. Some are stupid easy because the profs know you don\u2019t care so they make it easy to pass. Some profs seem to purposely make their courses super difficult or tedious for some reason. People can and do get very upset about paying for classes they don\u2019t want to take. Other people just try to take the most interesting ones they can.",

              "text": "To an extent, yes. Especially at the more selective schools.  \n\nBut let\u2019s say you have one student at a mediocre high school and one at a top high school. They take similar classes and get similar grades. The top school has better teachers and better opportunities. When applying to the local state university, both students get in. The student from the average school might find the gen eds challenging because high school was never that hard for them. But the student from the top school might be bored from the gen eds because they find it similar to some high school courses. \n\nI hope that makes sense, there\u2019s obviously a lot more to it but that\u2019s the first example that came to mind lol \n\nAlso the higher the admissions rate is at a school, the more likely you are to find a range of students with very different high school backgrounds. \n\nAnd more schools are doing away with ACT and SAT entrance exam requirements. I graduated before that came into effect so I don\u2019t really know how that\u2019s changing anything but it could be \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe more selective the school, the more prepared you\u2019d expect the students to be. A lot of private schools are considered liberal arts schools. To get a liberal arts (aka \u201cwell rounded\u201d) education, you\u2019re expected to take a wide range of courses. I guess that\u2019s another reason for gen eds? \n\nI hope that sorta helps to explain it? There are a lot of potential reasons for gen eds and a lot of students disagree with them. I\u2019m sure someone smarter than me has ideas on how to change the system, but for now it is what it is",

And all colleges use non-academic factors to admit students like race/ethnicity, work history, volunteerism, awards.\n\nGaokao (I see you made comparison in another comment) is significantly harder than american SAT/ACT. There is no comparison. Chinese students are usually surprised by how easy SAT/ACT are (except for English reading/writing part). There is no science, history, foreign language on SAT. There is a little bit of science on ACT, but still no history or foreign language. Just reading/writing and math. Math does not even cover up to trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent, radians).",

Everyone has to take the exam for Maths (basic or advanced - your choice) and Russian in order to graduate. Other than these two you can take the exam for any other available subject of your choice: physics, chemistry etc. The exam result is graded out of 100.\n\nEvery university has a list of programs (majors) you could apply to. Each major has its list (usually 3) of exams that you have to have taken in order to apply. Russian is a must but the other two depend on the major. The exact subjects are decided by the university. Chemical engineering for example usually requires Russian, Maths and Chemistry. Program engineering - Russian, Maths and IT. Law (we have undergraduate law programs) requires Russian, Social Science and History...you get the point.\n\nEvery program at each university has an X number of places.  All applicants have their exam scores across the relevant subjects summed  and everyone is arranged in order according to this sum. The top X applicants from this list get admitted into the program.\n\nThis system has totally eradicated corruption during admission process since it is both transparent and completely out of hand of the universities, since they have no control over the unified state exam.\n\nIt is actually a very effective social lift, since you can be very poor and still do well on the exams. The rich have a slight advantage of being able to hire tutors, but previously, they could just bribe their way into the university which is now all but impossible.",

A lot of people don't like that they have to take GE classes and would rather just do their major - I used to be one of those people. The reality is that the GE and support classes are honestly more important than your major classes when it comes to actually getting a job and working. This is one of the reasons - I'm going to get downvoted for this, but whatever - that international graduates struggle so much in the US job market. Specifically, in computational fields, the market is essentially flooded with CS graduates from Indian universities, and while they may be good at coding, they lack the basic communication skills and ability to think outside of the box that GE classes teach you. There is such a focus on just being the best at solving specific problems that nobody ever learns what they are actually doing on a level that can be applied to another situation, or how to articulate their thoughts and work effectively on a team. Companies hire you for your ideas - if you have tons of great ideas but can't articulate them, then they are just thoughts. And if you know a ton about one thing but can't extend that to learn about something else, well, your education is essentially devalued.",

      "text": "So the way they work is that they usually aren't specific classes that are required, but competencies. So there's a \"quantitative reasoning\" requirement, so engineers have to take calculus anyways and it's fulfilled along the way while and English major would still have to take College Algebra or Intro Statistics even though it's unrelated.\n\nSimilarly, everybody usually has to take a class for \"Arts\" or \"Civics\" which for the humanities are probably already covered, but as an engineer I had to take an Intro to Music History, History before 1500, World Religions, etc. that was \"unrelated\" to my major.\n\nSo how long it takes really just depends. The better question that maybe you can answer is that in the US, a bachelor's degree takes 120 credits. Some majors only have 40 or 60 credits of required courses, so they have plenty of room in their schedule for the general and still only have to hit the 120 credit minimum. As an engineer, there were more like 80 or 90 defined credits (counting all the pre-reqs like 3 calc classes, 2 physics classes, etc), so the general education credits on top actually made it where even the most efficient degree path for my major (Chemical Engineer) is probably closer to 130 credits. So it'd be 3 or 4 extra classes across 4 years.\n\nDo you have credit minimums for a bachelor's where you're from?\n\nAnd to answer the question, yes lots of people are bitter. However, a lot of schools in the have a flat tuition rate above 12 credits, so if you can manage doing 15+ credits per semester, you're actually not paying much more for those classes. It's if you slow down to 12 credits or go part time that you might pay extra for these gen eds.",

I had no idea we even had a concept of  a \"credit\" until I started studying my university program's paperwork when I accidentally stumbled upon this term. It is not something an average student ever interacts with.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but from what I have heard, in the US, in order to graduate with a major you need to complete a list of classes, but which semester you have is class is at least partially up to you and you are free to take extra classes if you feel like it. This is NOT how it works here in Russia. Once you are admitted to a program, you have a set path which every student in your program has to take. You cannot repeat a class. If you fail a class you will have to repeat the whole year (granted, you wouldn't have to repeat the classes you didn't fail that year). Everyone takes all the classes in the same order with same people (your group). You might be able to choose a class or two along the way but that is something very new which has only starting to appear.\n\nSo I guess we don't really have a concept of a \"credit minimum\".\n\nP.S. I am a chemical engineer too BTW)))",

My sister did Physical Therapy School, and slit was 3 years if year round school, with all the same students, and if you fail you either quit the program or wait a year for it to come around again.\n\nAs for undergrad, you're correct that they are somewhat linear but there is freedom. My engineering degree had about 5 semesters worth of \"take this class, then take that class, then that class\", but you could spread them out and do it slower if you needed to, and several were offered multiple times a year. As well, we had 12 credits of upper level technical electives that had to be in the engineering college, but we got to choose, so I took a programming class, a Petroleum Engineering class, and a Biomedical Engineering class.\n\nAs for a credit minimum, I would assume there is probably some standardized minimum number of credits or classes in Russia. If you look at other majors, they probably all take about the same amount of time as each other, and that's due to the credit minimum. I assume this is because there are a lot of jobs now that say they want a college graduate, but it could be any degree in a certain field, or even any degree at all. So there needs to be some level of consistency about how much time/effort/education goes into a bachelor's degree.",

I know that the minimum is 4 years. You cannot get a degree faster than that AFAIK. But different majors may take up wildly different of class time. I think universities are tempted to cheat the system and be very liberal about what counts as \"class time\".

It really only takes about 2 years to finish up all your GE's and pre-requiste classes for your major.\n\nI don't really have an issue because unlike most students, college isn't a career college for me. It's a place to get further educated and by happenstance it provides opportunity for career readiness. The reason GE's exist is for the university to have a method of measurement for their graduates. If you graduate in your major you will also be expected to be competent and writing, reading, basic math, and some civics and understand of society.
