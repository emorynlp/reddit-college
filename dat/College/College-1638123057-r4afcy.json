A day before Thanksgiving break, my Pre calc Professor done and went assigned 38 Topics on Aleks. Then after thanksgiving weekend, assigned 30 additional videos for us to review for finals. We're a quarter system so my bio class is fast paced. So they basically crammed 21 chapters within 10 weeks. And now I have to figure out how I'll review for both classes while balancing a part-time job and cover my tuition. \n\nBut look on the bright side, our professors are basically chillin, assigning and clicking shit on canvas while they sit back and watch movies from home. They be getting that 100k a year for not teaching jack, and just let the TAs do all their work for them. Screw this education system.",
