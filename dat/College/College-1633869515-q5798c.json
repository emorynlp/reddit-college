      "text": "When I first started college, I lived in a residence hall. During orientation this guy and I were cracking jokes about the activity we were doing and we just hung onto each other for when classes began since we were in the same major. \n\nTo this day were still buds but we have our own groups in college that we call on to go hangout. The best way to do it is honestly just have the confidence to go up to someone and either crack a joke or ask them to get a meal with you and get to know them. Or even go and get a coffee (or if your not a coffee drinker ask them to get a drink with you). \n\nAnother good way to make friends is also getting to know the people in your classes. That's always a good way to start since your likely in the same major. Every good friendship starts off small and eventually it blossoms into something beautiful. You got this :)",

      "text": "Where I am from the ones who live in a campus or a residency of students are a minority, people usually rent apartments on the city.\n\nWe make friends on classroom and going out at night to pubs and other places, also on caf\u00e9s in the afternoon. Also, as lots of students rent apartments, it's usual that your neighbours are also students and you can meet them and hang-out. I started university last month, and our neighbours slipped under our door a paper with their instagrams asking us to meet them whenever we wanted.\n\nP.D.: I am from Spain.",
