  "title:": "Any advice for Online January Classes?",
  "text": "Hi there, I was originally planning to spend January taking a short study-abroad trip through my school, however, the class was just recently cancelled due to covid concerns, which is not too much of a surprise. Unfortunately, that puts those of us who were in the canceled class in a tough position as the rest of the University has already registered leaving very few classes left with space. I am earning 2 degrees and so I have to be sure to use every single credit I can to my advantage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the last General Education Requirement I need is a religion course and I was wondering if anybody here had any ideas or advice on where I might find an online university that offers either January Term courses or courses that are work-at -your-own-pace, that I could complete in a month just like a J-Term class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was recommended BYU, but unfortunately, all of their Religion courses are only 2 credits and don't translate to 4 credits when transferred to my university, which would mean I would have to take 2 BYU courses, and I would rather not do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Thanks in advance!",
