  "text": "Near the end of the semester, I find that I get really unmotivated to study, even though there's a lot to do. I think it can be really overwhelming and easy to procrastinate. \n\nWhat I found really helpful to get/stay motivated is to think about my future and my career goals. For example, I will ask myself why is it important to study and do well on this exam? How will it help me in the future? I think about how passing the test will help me take one small step toward my bigger goals and that helps me keep studying. \n\nI also find it helpful to think about all the fun things I will do once the semester and all the exams are over. Even though it is partly procrastinating, I make a bunch of fun plans with friends for after exams and knowing that there is a reward at the end of the semester helps me stay motivated to study. \n\nWhat helps you get and stay motivated to study?\n\nI also made a short video about study motivation tips for anyone who is interested: [https://youtu.be/qOX0-INp6TE](https://youtu.be/qOX0-INp6TE)",
