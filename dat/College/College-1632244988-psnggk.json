      "text": "Depends on the college. I know that for several Christian universities they had technology policies that banned certain types of video games and had filters on their internet. It's also possible you're using the wrong internet or having registered your device. At my college they had gaming set up to run through a wired connection to keep the wireless unburdened. You had to register your device with the university and they'd let it into the wired connection.",
