I don\u2019t have any friends from high school so that\u2019s not an option for consolation. My roommate and I don\u2019t really click. There\u2019s no hostility or bad feelings; we just don\u2019t click. I\u2019ve tried talking to people online for years now and it\u2019s never enough since at the end of the day I\u2019m not actually doing anything in my life. Can anyone else relate?",

Then second lockdown hit and it became even more impossible , and now I can\u2019t see my friends from high school. Just remember that it\u2019s hard for all of us , and that you can make friends wz people throughout your whole college years. I know it\u2019s easy to say, difficult to really believe but it\u2019s true. Hope you\u2019re okay in here if you want to share experiences",

I told myself I\u2019d try harder the next year to make close friends but now I\u2019m living at home with my parents this semester and haven\u2019t talked to a single person from my college since march (aside from zoom meetings) and also don\u2019t talk to anyone from high school anymore. I made jokes about it in the beginning bc I\u2019ve always been an introvert and struggled in social situations so quarantine was perfect to recharge without having FOMO but now everyone is back at college having fun and I\u2019ve never felt so isolated.",

I had to leave the U.S because my parents wanted me to be home during the pandemic. It is HELL since then.\n\nAdditionally, I had Covid and my mum too so we were in isolation for three weeks!! Normally, I was able to escape to the city in order to be around people but I am not interacting with anyone, but with covid and staying in isolation with depression I had ZERO contact with others. My boyfriend also broke up with me during the pandemic and since then I am even more depressed.\n\nI think for many people it is a problem, so really, just know, you are not on your own with these thoughts. We will manage somehow. Things might take a while to get back to normal, I guess it will stay like this until July next year.\n\nAlso, from experience, it is better to be on your own than to catch this virus. I am 25, young, healthy and caught it and it was NO fun at all. Protect yourself. I try to stay positive, I think it could be worse, but it also could be better... I mean worse, because so many people lost their jobs or died due to covid, as long as you have a safe home you should be fine. Any home project you want to accomplish? But yeah, I can understand what you are going through.",
