The high paying portions of math lie in applied mathematics and statistics.\n\nIf you\u2019re pure math, I highly suggest trying for analytics type roles. If not, I would go for a masters in stats, applied math, engineering, data science, or analytics. That\u2019s what a pure math BS is really for.",

Graduating very soon and looking for data science positions.\n\nA math major has the potential to be extremely valuable but you 100% need to know how to code to make it valuable. And know that if you're looking into jobs like \"Data Scientist\" or \"Statistician\" they will probably be very hard to get without a graduate degree.

Also \n\nThe thing is with physical sciences and math, they\u2019re tough degrees but job wise you need to do higher level studies to get the good jobs.\n\nAlso network like crazy!

Ask people in the industries you\u2019re looking to get into about keywords. I\u2019m in a DS/analytics masters now and had a project course over the summer with a professor. This same professor also worked in the DS industry, and I sat with him with my resume and he replaced words in my resume with the DS keywords that ping resume filters. \n\nEdit: that\u2019s the fact of the modern job market people, you need to understand the power of networking, this isn\u2019t the 00s anymore.
