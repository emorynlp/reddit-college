  "title:": "Need Some Advice as a Dual-Enrollment Student",
  "text": "Hey y'all! As the title states, I am a HS student (Junior) who is currently doing a dual-credit thing through my HS, which pays for 18-ish courses. If I take a few extra classes here and there, I can graduate HS with an associate's. \n\nThis is where my issue is coming into play. I'm not sure how to go about this whole associate's thing, given the bachelor's and school I'm wanting to go for. \n\nFor some context, we recently did a degree planning thing where we planned out our time in HS to maximize on the credits and whatnot for a given associate's, which will go into the bachelor's that we will plan next week. I looked into this super specific AAS that was kinda close to what I wanted, but wasn't exact. I want to major in Electrical Engineering, and the AAS was Engineering Tech: Electronics--Bench Technician. The general education requirements were whatever, I'd be able to knock them out before my senior year. However, the program-specific requirements were ones that weren't too likely to transfer, let alone to another state (which is what I'm shooting for). Not only that, but as per my teacher (who has their BA), those specific classes ended up not doing too much, so it wasn't worth going through the struggle of planning it out and doing all of that. She mentioned going for a general AA, AS, that sorta thing. So I looked and the AS is the only one that seems like a decent option for what I plan on going into. The college I am enrolled at does not have a general AAS degree (Idk if other schools even offer this), so yeah.\n\nI'm a little worried about going for the AS, as some of it might not contribute towards the bachelor's I want, with it being an applied science one. Due to this worry, I thought about the idea of just doing the general education requirements of any AAS and then just getting some of the requirements of the BAS out of the way, but I'm still not sure if this is the right way to go about it. \n\nAnother thing that in sort of making it hard to decide is that the course codes for the courses are different between the school I am at and the school I want to go into (Obviously, different states and all), so I'm trying to flip through two schools' websites and course catalogs, trying to convert them into each other and it is just a whole thing. Is there an easier way to do this, or not really?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thank you all so much in advance.",

      "text": "An AAS isn\u2019t going to help much in terms of credits, absolutely true. Lots of the classes won\u2019t transfer. If you want to do it, do it as a backup. You\u2019ll have the AAS for jobs in case uni doesn\u2019t work out. It may also help for internships, because you\u2019ve already proven you can do the work at a decent level. A freshman/sophomore doesn\u2019t know shit and hence, they don\u2019t normally get internships. But having an applicable AAS already boosts your profile and helps you seem more credentialed, so it\u2019s really not the worst idea.\n\nAs for comparing course codes and shit, it\u2019s just gonna be a pain in the ass. You should reach out to your target schools and ask them if certain classes would transfer.",

          "text": "I've already looked into the transfer of a lot of things, and most general-education requirements transfer over (I.E. MATH, ENG, etc...) pretty easily. If there's any issues with the transfer of credits, I'd say that I'm pretty well prepared to fight it, since I'm making it a habit to save all of my class syllabi so that I can refute claims that a class doesn't meet the given requirements and whatnot. \n\nI've not decided yet, but the AS does sound enticing. Just something to put in my portfolio, and it does give me more room to breathe. I've been really dead set on this school for years and higher education in general, so I don't think anything would go wrong, but I guess those are some famous last words. \n\nOnce I figure out the course code thing, I'll look through and see if I can actually cover a decent bit of the credits needed through the AS. \n\nI'll just have to look more into it, I guess. Luckily, I have 3 more semesters and a summer to do courses and figure this out, so I think I'll manage.",
