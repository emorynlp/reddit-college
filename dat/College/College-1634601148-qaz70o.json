  "text": "So I started my junior year at Uni about a month ago, and around the second week I felt a sudden and severe decrease in motivation to attend lectures and be studious. At first I thought it was due to my sleep schedule being slightly wack, however I quickly started waking up earlier and still not attending. It's gotten so bad to the point where I feel as though I've missed maybe 2/3 of all the material 2 of my core classes have covered thus far as well as a fair amount from my others. The confusing part is that I keep telling myself that I will attend and even make plans to get back on track and even feel pretty motivated about it multiple times each week. But the next morning I wake up and practically do nothing. This mindset is something that I feel needs to be broken ASAP or else I will 100% fail. Freshman and Sophomore year I didn't have these problems. I did procrastinate occasionally, but nothing out of the ordinary. However now I can't even make myself start on the path to catching up. I understand that my Uni has resources such as office hours and tutoring, as well as clubs and programs where I can meet more people in my major so that I might be more immersed in my learning, yet it feels as though there's this mental barrier preventing me from just taking the first step towards doing any of these things. I don't know how to overcome this as I am right now and want to know if others have had problems similar to this and what advice they may have.",
