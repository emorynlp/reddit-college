  "text": "Hello, so under new circumstances I find myself in a special situation. I have decided to change my major from biochemistry/pre-med to Anthropology with a business minor. With my previous major, I had to take the notorious Organic Chemistry 1 and its Lab. However, now that I am no longer interested in pre-medicine I find that not only do I not like this course, but I furthermore don't need it anymore and it is not adding to my progression in the new degree path. Furthermore, I have no intentions of taking Organic Chemistry 2/lab as it is not required, so I feel there's no point in taking half a course. I want to drop this and swap it for a sprint course that goes toward my major, but it will give me two W's. I already have one W on my transcript currently (I overloaded my schedule with a course that I'm not advised to take freshman year, but nobody made me aware of that at the time). So will it look awful if I have 3 W's? I am not looking to go into medical school anymore, but perhaps nursing or maybe a master's in business administration or perhaps continue in anthropology if I really enjoy it. I know W's are not great, but I feel I could make much better use of my time by taking a course that actually benefits me.",
