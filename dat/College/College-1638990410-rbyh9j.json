  "title:": "I'm exceedingly nervous about my math final",
  "text": "So, great. Here we are, at the end of my first semester. My other finals are easy, but math... math burns a hole in my heart because I went through an extremely rough period throughout the semester. I'm panicking, my anxiety is flared, and I'm sitting here outside the shower just trying to get myself under control.\n\nDoes anybody have any recommendations for videos or sites I can visit to essentially get a rapid review of calc 1 concepts? They're not hard for me to grasp I just don't know them in the first place. If I can just get myself grounded, I suspect I can push myself out of anxiety and not panic myself to death.",
