  "text": "So right now I\u2019m just walking around campus trying to take a break because I\u2019ve been working all day today. I\u2019m kinda paying for this for taking Friday and Saturday off to hang out with friends and it\u2019s kinda biting me in the ass. I just finished an essay that\u2019s due Tuesday that I think sucks right now and I got math test Wednesday that I\u2019m going to be studying for later. College is starting to wear me down and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll survive. It\u2019s made me a workaholic as all I think of now is school and my job. I Just feel mentally tired all the time.",
