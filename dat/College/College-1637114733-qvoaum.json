      "text": "I study in Canada, so I don\u2019t know if that will apply to you, but the difference between a BA and a BSc in Economics is that in the BSc you\u2019d have to take classes like physics, chem and bio as requirements for your major, while in a BA you wouldn\u2019t need that. But someone with a BA or BSc in Econ can work in the same things, it doesn\u2019t really matter.",
