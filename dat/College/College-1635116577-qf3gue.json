  "text": "If you try really hard to make friends you\u2019re probably not going to make very many since you\u2019re probably not acting like your regular self. \n\nJust act normally and try just hanging out in people\u2019s vicinity. If you live in a dorm with a communal living space then just go hang out there. You can put yourself out there but don\u2019t try so hard. If you try hard and fail you\u2019ll make yourself feel bad, which isn\u2019t good for your mental health. \n\nIn grade school I literally made my friends just by sitting near a group of people in the cafeteria and in class, then those people\u2019s friends became my friends. I didn\u2019t really talk to them either.",
