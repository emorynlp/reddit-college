  "text": "I am a Computer Science major and my roommate is a Biological Science major and we are both junior in the same college. My roommate told me that in one of her core class her professor give everyone 100% in the final presentation and and give extremely easy final exam like everyone finish and leave the classroom 15 minutes after the final begin( normally it is supposed to be a 2 hours final). Her other professor ( which is also a core class)make the exam open book/note/internet which make the overall average exam score is around 85%, all of the exam are multiple choice and a 10% short answer which you can copy from your note, besides that the professor make the weighted average extremely generous that 85 is a A and 80 is A-. One of her lab class didn\u2019t even have points deducted, as long as you go to class you will get a automatic A. All of her homework is like multiple choice problem+ lab report which can be done in 2 hours.\nWhile in my core class(algorithm), the exam average is 49 and project average is 70, and there will be no curve since the professor make 90 as a A, 85 A-, etc, every semester 20%withdraw/fail this class. One of my math class(combinatorics) average exam score is a high 60s and no curve, during the midterm we have to solve 8 free response question in 50 minutes and in final is 15 questions with sub-questions in 2 hours.\nAm I jealous of my roommate? Yes. I spend all my time doing my project and prepare for exam but can still maintain a 3.3 GPA, while my roommate play games/watch Netflix all day and get a 3.8 GPA. The more my roommate tell me about her high score on her exam and how generous her professor is, the more anxiety I get. Now I even start to think about maybe it is a fault to choose CS as my major because I thought that if I am in other major like bio my gpa will be much higher. (Since in college GPA is everything, am I correct?).\nCan someone give me some suggestion?",
