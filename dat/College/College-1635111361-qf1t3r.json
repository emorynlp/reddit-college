  "text": " Greetings, all!\n\nI'm currently taking English 118 at my university, and as part of our final research project, we have to create a survey on a topic of our choosing and distribute it to the relevant population. My paper is focused on what factors influence a student's perspective on alcohol consumption, and whether or not their upbringing plays any great part in that view. \n\nI would be very much obliged if y'all would be willing to fill out my survey: [https://utk.questionpro.com/t/AUDLEZpUH4](https://utk.questionpro.com/t/AUDLEZpUH4).  Looking for all respondents - regardless of positive/negative views on  alcohol. This should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.\n\nIf anyone else has a survey they need respondents to, leave a link in the comments, and I'll complete it!",
