  "text": "I was thinking of pursuing a teaching degree (like kinder) but hate the fact it would take 4 years. I've been a SPED asisstant for 2 and a half school years and im wondering if that counts towards credits in any way? Is there a way to speed run uni to become a teacher? lol I also live in AZ so i know there's always a shortage here for teachers. Thanks!",
