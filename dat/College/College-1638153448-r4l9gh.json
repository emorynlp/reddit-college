  "text": "it just seems so far away. \n\ni\u2019m doing so bad in my coursework. \n\ni\u2019m classified as a 2nd year student, but there\u2019s still a lot of credits i haven\u2019t taken, due to dropping. \n\nto me, time has gone by so slow, and i feel like i\u2019m rotting away doing nothing with my life. \n\ni probably won\u2019t graduate in 4 years, because i can can only manage 2-3 classes at a time.",
