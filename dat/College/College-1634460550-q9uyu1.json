  "title:": "College Majors With The Best Looking People",
  "text": "Has anyone else noticed the disparity in attractiveness between the people in different college majors? Like how people in business majors, especially the guys, are generally far better looking than people majoring in computer science and engineering? Obviously, there are attractive and unattractive people in all college majors, but some college majors have far more attractive people on average than others. What do you guys think which college majors have the most attractive and unattractive people?\n\nIn my personal opinion, based on observation,\n\nMost Attractive: Business related majors (for guys, don't really encounter any girls in business majors)\n\nLeast Attractive: Engineering, computer science, science majors in general unless they're studying to be a nurse\n\nOf course, this is just my opinion, it may depend on the college as well. These are just averages, I've encountered handsome engineering majors, pretty coders, etc.",

There are fat people but they are generally older and seem to be transfer students. I'm thinking that the university is picky about incoming freshman and generally don't pick fat people. \n\nThe fat people population is WAY lower than the population in the state. It's crazy.",
