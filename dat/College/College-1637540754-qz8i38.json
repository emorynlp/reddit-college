  "title:": "Im thinking about leaving an elite Military Academy to pursue my own goals",
  "text": " At the age of 20, I left home to attend the Military High School, after which it is obligatory to continue my studies at the Military Academy. Of course, all costs are taken care of by the state, but if I leave school, I will have to work in the army twice with the rank of private or pay or 20000  euros for now. I am currently in the first year of the Military Academy, whose education lasts 4 years. \n\n I like this job and life less and less, which is very similar to life at West Point. I just don't know what to do anymore, this life is killing me, I have a feeling that it is killing my creativity and moving me away from my loved ones. I\u2019ve sacrificed so many things since I was 15 that I can\u2019t describe it.\n\n There are two options about which, the first is to leave the academy immediately and start finding ways to repay it, or I struggle to finish it and increase my debt to  32,000 euros after which I would leave it again. I have a huge pressure from the environment and my parents, because they believe that the army offers a secure job and that all other innovative jobs are a kind of fraud.",
