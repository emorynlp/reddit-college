      "text": "As someone who was a double major and had to wake up from 3-6 am for football practice I'd say it's a manageable schedule. You just have to know your limits and manage your time very seriously. My schedule was looking like this:\n\nWake up at 3am\n\nGo to morning conditioning from 4-7\n\nCatch some breakfast and go to work 8-11\n\nThen I alternated classes and work like crazy all day until 4pm which was when I had practice\n\n6-9pm was study and homework time and at 10pm I slept.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah I'd say it will be worth it but could cause some doubts mentally but I believe in you!",
