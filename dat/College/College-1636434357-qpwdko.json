  "text": "i\u2019m actually terrified right now. just the prospect of having to move out and be miles and miles away from my family is the worst thing i can imagine right about now. im gonna be going to college in the fall and i know this freak out session is kind of early but i can\u2019t help it. i\u2019m blessed enough to have had amazing parents and a somewhat great childhood and i don\u2019t want to leave that part behind. i know that they are just one phone call or facetime away but they\u2019re not gonna be right upstairs or in the next room and it\u2019s getting me choked up. i know i\u2019ll have to adjust when i move out but i can\u2019t even fathom that happening because i don\u2019t want to move away from my parents or sister or my dog :(\n\ni literally have no idea how to cope with this feeling",

      "text": "I was feeling the same way when I went to college. everyone said the feeling would pass for me, but it didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t ready to live away from my family yet, and I learned that I didn\u2019t have to in order to go to college. After 2-3 months I was really unhappy, so I decided I will finish the school year and move back home and commute to a small 4 year college close to home. And you know what? It was awesome. I had an amazing 3 years there in college with great friends and tons of fun, and one of the best parts was being able to go home every night to see my mom and have dinner with her and play with my cat, sleep in my own quiet room, and have my own kitchen to make myself a snack. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this to scare you or make you more nervous, I just want you to see that going away to college is not the only way you can go to college. And it certainly isn\u2019t the only fun way to do it.",

      "text": "Oh my gosh I was/am in the same predicament. I moved out at 18 last month for school and on stead of staying in the dorms I stayed in an apartment. I coped with sadness and loneliness by always keeping myself busy doing things that I like or exploring the city on my own. I got into working out (not intense, just light workouts) for the serotonin and endorphin boost. I also still call my family everyday. Sometimes it's a long call and sometimes its short, any in case it seems to help. Recently, I've been thinking about keeping a journal to get out all my icky feelings from moving out and that way I wouldn't be projecting bad feelings on any one.",

      "text": "It sounds like you have a good relationship with your parents, so talk to them about it. They want what is best for you, but they will miss having you around as well. It might help to have a plan for how far away you would be comfortable going to school, and how often you will reasonably be coming home, or having them visit you. Will you have a car on campus, or other people from home who will be going to the same school that you could share rides with? 1-2 hours away is pretty manageable for frequent visits home, while still feeling independant. A 4 hour drive each way takes a lot of time out of your weekend and might only make sense for holidays, breaks, and 3 day weekends. If you have to fly home, that can become a significant expense. Depending on the schools you are considering, and your major, the distance may be worth it. Senior year is really stressful. Your making a lot of big decisions, but some of it is also out of your control. Take care of yourself. If it starts interfering with you doing school work, sleeping, eating, ask for help. Talking to a councilor, or pastor can help you develop the skill to manage stress now and in the future.",
