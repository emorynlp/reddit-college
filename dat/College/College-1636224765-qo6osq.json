  "text": "I recently was made aware of my college's option to register a preferred name alongside a legal name.\n\nBit of backstory, I was recently bestowed a religious name and have started going by that name at school, work, and around some friends. Please note: I simply added the new name to my current name, so my preferred name is NewName, FirstName, MiddleName, Lastname. \n\nI made it clear from the start that I did not expect my family to use my new name, as they were not all to gung-ho about my religious conversion. Anywho, it would be nice for them to acknowledge it somehow though, as it is a huge part of my identity. \n\nI originally did not think I would use my religious name as a first name, but I have come to enjoy it as such. \n\nHence, I decided to file my preferred name into the system. Now my email and student/work profiles show my preferred name. Legal documents still show my legal name of course. I do think I will eventually add the preferred name to my legal name. \n\nMy dilemma is this, my family was not too gung-ho about my conversion, they do not use my new name, and I am graduating soon. I want to acknowledge my new name when celebrating. But, to what extent should I do that? Should I or should I not use my preferred name when decorating for the celebration? I do not know how my family will react, (but can guess that they will react negatively, either by being sad or upset).",

This is a day for you to be proud of your accomplishments and a day for others to celebrate you for your achievement.  Use whatever name in your graduation announcement or at your graduation ceremony that you prefer.  Others' opinions about your new name are nothing you need to concern yourself with at your own graduation ceremony.\n\n>I do not know how my family will react, (but can guess that they will react negatively, either by being sad or upset).\n\nIt's true that decisions have consequences.  If you decide to use your new name, then your family relationships might be rocky or unbalanced for a bit.  That's a situation you'll simply have to navigate if and when it arises.  But, ultimately, their sadness or irritation is their problem, not yours.  If they can't get over your new name, then you'll simply have to make an adult decision to not let it concern you (or, more likely, to let it concern you less and less as time goes on).  You are not responsible for other people's emotions.\n\nGood luck, and congrats on your impending graduation.",

      "text": "Do what you want. In the long run, it's a piece of paper that exists for you anyhow.\n\nI get wanting the name you identify with on the docs. Someone at my school assumed my preferred name was a shortened version of it, and used it. Then all my OFFICIAL records had that on it. I have a student ID with \"not my name\" on it. I spent two months trying to get it fixed and someone said, \"I don't see what the big deal is. No one sees this stuff.\" The last time I called the registrar the receptionist didn't hit the \"hold\" button as well as she thought and called out, \"It's chick that doesn't like her name.\"",
