  "text": "Covid hit during my second semester at university, and the first semester i didn\u2019t know hardly anyone. After that came online classes and obviously I didn\u2019t meet anyone there either. Now I\u2019m in my third year and I\u2019m still struggling to make friends. I never get invited out so i just stay in, which only contributes more to my isolation problems and social anxiety. These are supposed to be the best years of my life but I feel like I\u2019m missing out.",

      "text": "I was in the same position as you. As a freshman I didn't have many friends, and I didn't do much either. I basically just sat in my Dorm room all day watching Netflix or doing homework.\n\nBut an important thing that I learned was that you have to get out of a High School mentality and start thinking like an Adult. When you're in College, you're no longer forced to be around the same people all day and befriend those people like you are in High School. You're an Adult, you can go anywhere in the world.\n\nDon't feel like you have to meet people on campus. Go to bars, go to nightclubs, go to music festivals. Find events for yourself to go to, don't rely on invites from other people. And once you're out in the world, I guarantee you will meet people.\n\nOnce you're out of College and in the real world, this is how you're going to have to meet people. I moved across the country and literally knew no one in the City I'm in. How did I meet people? I went out to the hottest nightclubs in the city, I went to Bars and hung out, I went to Music Festivals and met people from all over the world that I still talk with.\n\nYou\u2019ve just gotta put yourself out there. You got this!",
