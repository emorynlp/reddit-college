  "text": "\nI\u2019m 23 about to be 24. This is my 5th year of college I\u2019m studying to be a computer engineer and I\u2019ve just felt completely burnt/ depressed. I feel like several things are making me feel like this. I\u2019ve had a rough two years. my sister tried to blackmail my parents for money by saying my dad raped her and me which is a lie my dad is mean son of bitch but he\u2019s never done anything like that or hurt me and that just felt like my sister died that day and we cut contact with her I don\u2019t miss her I just feel like my parents are broken since then. Secondly Lockdown happened and I just hated the online classes and I wanted to just wait a year and my mother insisted I keep going and I didn\u2019t learn anything I passed most my classes during it except the last 2 semesters and I\u2019ve failed those. Then last spring my ex fianc\u00e9/ gf 5 years only person I\u2019ve been serious with turns out she was lying to me about her being in nursing and her age and just a lot of things and that just pushed me over the edge. She broke up with me the day before finals and she lied to me about having heart surgery and getting pregnant and needed a abortion twice. This all just fucked my head I feel like and I desperately want to finish college i just feel like I need to take a break and work and get my mind right I can\u2019t sit and think about what I need to do. And worst of all the thing that most is fucking me up inside is my own lying my parents think I\u2019m graduating in a few days but I\u2019m really failing and about 3 semesters at least away I just haven\u2019t had the heart to tell my parents and I don\u2019t want to be disowned like my sister and I don\u2019t know how to tell them there son is just a failure. I\u2019m gonna meet my mom in a day and I need to tell her the truth I can\u2019t live the lie no more and they won\u2019t trust me ever again probably I just want know what you think I should say and what I should do going forward I want to finish college I just know if I just go back in the spring I will just fail again and how do I tell them that and that I just want to get a job and work for a while and get my mind right.",
