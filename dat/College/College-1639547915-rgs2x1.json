      "text": "if you're able , i'd recommend living in the dorms if you want to meet more people at school. I'd recommend trying to find a roommate who will be a transfer student as well.\n\nIt really depends on the college for dorm life experience. I liked living in the dorms because I got to meet a lot of people and go to parties. I go to a large public university, so it was nice to find my group of friends at a school of 30,000 people.\n\nAssuming you've always lived at home, the dorms are a good transition into apartment living. I don't know the housing situation on your campus, but it's often easier to arrange dorm living than apartment living if you're new to the campus/city because there are more factors that go into apartments (utilities, internet, roommates, etc). Apartments sometimes have roommate matching, but these are usually HIT or MISS.\n\nYou could request to live in a \"single\" dorm if you want more private space without the hassle of making apartment arrangements.\n\nI liked living in an apartment more than living in the dorms because I had more of my own space while still having access to a social life. I lived with friends I met in the dorms my freshman year, so this would not have happened without living in the dorms.\n\n**TL;DR: live in the dorms if you like social environments; live in an apartment or request a \"single\" dorm room if you're okay not meeting as many people.**",
