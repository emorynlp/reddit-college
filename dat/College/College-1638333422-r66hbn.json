  "text": "I\u2019m looking into what technology I am best investing in for next school year (as my Acer Chromebook isn\u2019t good for anything anymore and won\u2019t even turn on unless plugged in). \n\nOriginally, I was just looking at committing to a MacBook, as this seems to be a popular choice for students. However, I\u2019ve just started looking into getting an iPad and the accompanying keyboard and pen. I\u2019m drawn to the latter because the pen is an easy and efficient way to fill out worksheets assigned digitally, without having to waste time and paper on printing. I\u2019ve been using Google tech for several years and have very limited knowledge on the features of Apple products, so there\u2019s likely components to both that I\u2019m missing. \n\nI\u2019m very interested in hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts and preferences on this!",
