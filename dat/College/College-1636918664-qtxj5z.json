  "text": "Sorry if this doesn't belong here but I am about to start my third year next year and I am struggling to find a career path. I have tried different skills such as computer programming skills but I am very bad with computers so it's not for me and I struggled very hard in my intro to programming class. Honestly, I am not a very smart individual as I struggle very hard in logical thinking and I struggle to understand things faster than my peers. I also probably have a really low IQ so that's not a good situation. I literally don't know what path to pick next because my GPA is below a 3.0 and I don't know what to do anymore because I can't go to medical school, law school, or high finance jobs like investment banking. It's like nothing is going well for me. I have $36k in student loans and I have to pay them back. I don't know what else to major in. Any advice?",
