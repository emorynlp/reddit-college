  "text": "Hi, I am a bachelor's student, struggling.\n\nI will come right at the problem. I don't have good teachers. Most of them just plainly read from books without explaining and there's one who asks students to make presentations and herself does nothing. I can't concentrate when other students are presenting because more often than not, it's just copy-pasted material and a lot of it in just one presentation. \n\nI find it way easier just to read from books and I do that too but it just gets way too much at the end. Not the material, but the time spent in classes. It's like 6-7 hours (there are breaks in between though) so even if I try to read everything from books AND understand it, I can do it only for subjects (consistently) because I don't have enough time left. I have also suffered from anxiety for 3 years now (and I am trying to fix it, it has gotten a lot better but some episodes just take 2-3 days to settle which wastes a lot of time).\n\nI talked to other students, many of them don't just study that much and some are able to complete everything + learn more skills + hold positions. I don't know how. Honestly, I might be able to do that too if I didn't have anxiety.\n\nThe solution for me right now seems to cut the time spent in classes. But then the attendance gets low and I don't get to know any assignment or work given. I don't have friends because, again, of online classes.\n\nWhat do I do... anyone has any advice?",

      "text": "First, I recommend counseling to deal with any anxiety you\u2019re going through. Secondly, it seems as though you\u2019re trying to teach yourself in the same method that your professors are. Diversify your studying. Use flash cards, watch videos, quiz yourself. Just reading course material does not aid in long-term learning and comprehension. One thing that helped me is to pretend I\u2019m teaching someone. It helps you figure out what you\u2019re missing and also reinforces what you\u2019ve learned so far.",

      "text": "Hold the brakes. \n\nThere's a lot going on in this post. A lot of it is terribly common to see, especially in this sub reddit. Your suffering isn't just yours, a lot of people share the same feelings. \n\nI know this will seem impossible and outright ridiculous but I think a shift in your mental state could be beneficial. This is hard to discuss but incredibly important. I'm pulling this from my own personal experience, so take it with a grain of salt as nothing is one size fits all. \n\nI think it's dangerous to start telling yourself that your professors are horrible. Some may be. The point is, that is a point where you can direct your problems. It's so easy to blame a professor for a bad grade. The thing is, *you are in charge of your own education.* All of your professors can't be shitty. I notice in my classes that certain peers blame the professor more than others. If you take the responsibility on yourself to make your grades well, then a bad professor won't be able to come between you and a good grade. \n\nThis practice works well for me. My own outlook on the college system is better and overall makes it easier to succeed within it. Having the mindset that \"college is a scam\" and \"all my professors fucking suck\" is not going to help you succeed, even if you ARE right. Maybe it's a good thing to tell yourself little lies to keep your morale up to keep you on the right track. I have a very difficult class this semester. All the ratemyprofessors ratings are terribly low for the professor. The professor is fine, the course work is hard. I got a 79.5% on the first exam and wasn't happy with that. I changed my study habits and got an 84 on the second exam. That's better! I took it upon myself to improve and it worked.\n\nDefinitely take a hard look at your study habits for each class and evaluate if that's the best way to study. For the class I mentioned, I went from using the professor's skeleton notes to making flashcards and not using her notes whatsoever. It definitely improved how easy it is to study and how effective it is. I wouldn't study for Calculus 4 with flashcards. \n\nYour anxiety isn't keeping you from doing everything everyone else is. Don't forget that a lot of those people probably also suffer from anxiety. Realize that not everyone you know knows you suffer from anxiety as well, so how can you know if they do without them explicitly telling you? You can do those things with anxiety, I promise. Your anxiety doesn't define you or your accomplishments. \n\nDon't stop going to classes, that's a great way to miss important things. Skipping class is the fast track to dropping out. It's not a great idea. You absolutely need to be in class even if you don't think you're absorbing a single ounce of knowledge. \n\nI think it's important that right now you evaluate your courses and study habits. Work on improving the things you are in control of and letting go of the things you aren't in control of. The quality of your professors is outside of your control, it is something that you cannot change. You can change your study habits for those classes to succeed in them. Take it as a challenge to adapt and find a better way. This is what college is teaching you to do. Being in the work place will be no different. I think a shift in mindset to take on responsibility for your education will lead to feeling more accomplished and successful. Instead of feeling like \"I'm not successful because my professors aren't great\" you'll tell yourself that \"I'm successful because I adapted my study habits and made smart decisions\". \n\nIt's easy to get sucked into the mindset that everything is working against you. It's not healthy. We are all going through the same amount of shit. The ones who succeed are the ones who are taking responsibility for things and conquering them. You're capable of those things too.",
