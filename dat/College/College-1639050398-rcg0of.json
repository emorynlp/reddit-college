  "text": "They are not important classes\u2026 but I have just had such a hectic second half of a year, losing a family member, going through a breakup, finical problems. I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. It\u2019s done, so I\u2019m not gonna dwell in the sadness of it all. I\u2019m just upset at myself that I let it get this bad, I\u2019ve never failed a class, and I\u2019ve never gotten anything below a B+. I just felt so numb and couldn\u2019t bring myself to give a shit. I just need to take this month break and figure out what I want, and what I need to do. Even if that means taking a break from college. But I will not let this happen again. I would appreciated you guys left advice, or words of encouragement for me. I really am trying my hardest.",

      "text": "Life is full of these moments. I don\u2019t by any means mean this in a sarcastic or condescending way. At some point you will fail at work, fail your friends, fail your spouse and kids. As humans, you can not do 100% all of the time. As you get older, you will have competing priorities, some of which will break your heart when you can\u2019t give more. It\u2019s ok. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to accept as you leave college. \n\nMy daughter came home yesterday and complained about getting a \u201cC\u201d on a major paper. After an extensive discussion with the teacher, she felt like a failure. It was a very humbling experience for her since she generally excels at writing. My response was, \u201cIt\u2019s ok. What did you learn?\u201d and \u201cYou can\u2019t change yesterday, but you can plan how you\u2019ll make tomorrow and next time better\u201d.  You only fail if you don\u2019t learn anything from the experience, even if that means you accepting your limitations with everything that is on your plate. \n\nSo long story short, forgive yourself. Figure out if you would do something different and give yourself some grace. If you\u2019re still torn up with all that is going on in your life, you can take a break, however I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to get back in the swing of things. Maybe lighten your semester load.",
