  "text": "I\u2019ve been in and out of school since I started 3 years ago. I got diagnosed with bipolar my freshman year then I got diagnosed with adhd sophomore year and had to get both of those figured out. Then last year I had to get brain surgery in the middle my second term. All those withdrawals and missed terms resulted in me getting disqualified and I can\u2019t get over it. I feel like I need a fresh start and reinvent myself as a student. I\u2019ve had flashes of success, but they\u2019ve been botched with illness (pink eye and strep throat caused me to miss a week of class my first term freshman year and automatically failed me), an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, and my brain surgery. \n\nI was a decent student in high school, 1500 SAT 3.7 GPA, but I had no idea what I wanted to do and doubted my ability to get in anywhere other than in-state schools. I decided I want to pursue a career in medicine a few years ago, but things haven\u2019t gone well due to reasons outside my control. I feel like I have no chance of accomplishing that at my current school. My time at the university I currently attend has been filled with problem after problem. I want to start over at a community college in Seattle and transfer to the University of Washington after 2 years. \n\nI\u2019m about to finish my first term back since brain surgery with a failing gpa. I started off the term with a concussion and stuck with my classes when I really should of taken the term off. Couple that with a back injury and the entering a depressive mood it was a disaster. I was trained as a mechanic this summer and had made tremendous strides in my mental health and was eager to start school and it all fell apart the day before I started classes. \n\nThe only part about this plan I worry about is I\u2019m 22 and I feel like I need to provide for myself.",
