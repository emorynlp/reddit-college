  "text": "I only have time for homework, classes, and sleep. I can't seem to keep up with anything that ever mattered to me. Homework is so demanding that I can't even get a hobby. Hobbies cost money, and I don't have time for a job.. how does one organize their life in college? Tips would be appreciated!",

      "text": "Most people don't, welcome to adulthood! I've already got like 6 interests on my list that I want to pursue but can't bc school comes first.\n\nFor you, the best way to organize your life is to do it in a way that flows with you. Now hold up, I know that sounds vague but hear me out. Different people have different methods of time management, these methods will change over time, but naturally it should adhere to your preferences and priorities.\n\nFor me, personally, I use notion ([notion.so](https://notion.so)). They have a lot of great templates for organizing all your schoolwork (legit, just Google \"Notion templates for college students\") and you can find some online. Another thing you can use is Trello. Trello gives you a to-do list that you make and you drag-and-drop each item into one of three categories: \n\n\\- Not started\n\n\\- In Progress\n\n\\- Finished\n\nYour work is done once everything reaches the \"Finished\" section and then you can make room for your hobbies and other interests. I currently employ this method, but I deadass have a job, research, 15 credit hours, and I'm a PM for school club this semester, so I don't have time for shit that's not school fml.\n\nLast note: Remember how I said your organization skills need to be done in a way that flows with you? What I mean by that is to look around and experiment with other time management styles and use the one that doesn't feel like a chore. Believe me, once you start getting a good schedule rolling, it's hard to stop doing it.",

      "text": "Honestly, you get better at it. For the most part, the things you listed are optional with the stuff you actually are doing being the priority. My first attempt at college, I prioritized the wrong things and it was a disaster. After some years in the military, I came back. Now, I'm a 4.0 student, single mom of 3 with extra curricular activities and school work of their own (the two that aren't a toddler, anyway), coach my daughter's volleyball team, and do 100% of the parenting and adulting. I took 18 credit hours over the summer and am currently taking 19. What I'm getting at is you learn to do it when you HAVE to do it. No way would I opt to do anything else but study and sleep if it wasn't absolutely necessary. I do it because I have no choice but to do so.",
