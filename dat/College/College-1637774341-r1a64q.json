      "text": "It can be done and theres some programs that do a joint MD/JD degrees but it's a lot of time and money.  However, ask why you want to do this. When you do a med school interview, and I'm sure the same for law school, they will ask this question. Both schools are also rough with many hours of studying and lots of board testing. Also don't forget when you graduate, at least for med school, there is residency and sometimes fellowship, at least in the USA. I don't want to persuade you to not do it but just be warned it's a lot both in and outside of school.",

How do you think you'd feel trying to balance out your time with all of these competing needs?\n\nEdit to add: I read some of your other posts about dealing with anxiety and your mom not really pitching in to help with school. \n\nAgain, this isn't to say your dream is impossible, but these are hurdles to be aware of. The more things you choose to do, the less time you have to dedicate to doing each thing well. Just be careful spreading yourself too thin and making your anxiety worse. \u2764",
