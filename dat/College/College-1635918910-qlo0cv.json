  "text": "Hi.. I have a chemistry exam coming up, and for the life of me, whatever I do, I cannot set my mind on studying. I study for about a couple minutes then get blind sighted by other things. This usually always happens the few days before exams. I am VERY into my studying, I have an intensive studying-ethic, but it seems like my mind cannot connect to studying the few days before an exam. \n\nHas anyone experienced this?",

      "text": "I absolutely have. I'm a sophomore in social work, so we have more essays than exams. But I often find myself struggling to push through and write an essay, even though I love the subject matter. \n\nWhat works best for me is to set up a timer for 15 minutes, write for those 15 minutes then take a two minute break. Rinse and repeat. I've played around with the timing, but this is what I've landed on for when I'm really struggling to get my butt moving. Good luck!",
