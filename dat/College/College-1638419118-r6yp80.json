You can be average at high school level math and still pass the CPA and get the degree. Not worth ignoring the major if you\u2019re scared of the math  because that\u2019s not really what it is",

If entry level is hard for you, either solve problems day and night, until it becomes a routine exercise, or consider seriously, that you would be happier, and more successful in another field. Forcing yourself through any major by sheer force of will is possible, but working in a field just because you had an image about how good it would be, even though the reality is very different, is not good. Believe me, I did it. I imagined how awesome would it be to study chemical engineering, because I was really good at chemistry, and maths. I worked in appropriate jobs for my degree, with good teams, and good salary, and I was miserable. I say from experience, if your major, and later your job doesn't fit you like the glass shoe fits Cinderella, get the hell out of there, you have only one life to do what is right for you.",

OP, this message wasnt really for you, moreso for all the comments hating on stem majors. there are plenty of ways to get math tutoring in college. dont let one class get you down, keep pushing though it!",
