  "text": "So my professor has a required attendance policy, and if you miss a certain number of classes you fail. For personal reasons I hit that number despite having a 96 in the class. However, one of the absences was recorded for the first session which occurred before I was even enrolled. I emailed my professor\u2019s TA asking to be excused from that since I find it unreasonable to expect me to have attended a class I wasn\u2019t even enrolled in, however the TA responded that it counted as an absence even though I wasn\u2019t enrolled. Because of this I\u2019m going from an A to an F unless I get this resolved. Am I in the wrong here or is there anything I can do?",

      "text": "It sounds like attendance is important to this professor, which they made clear to you immediately on their syllabus.  I'm not sure what \"a certain number is,\" but it's obviously not just the one you \"missed\" because you weren't enrolled. (Side note, but students often use late enrollment as an excuse to extend their summer break. Unless there was something interfering with your enrolling on time, I disagree that this should be automatically excused; many students hoping to get in my full classes will attend the first several classes before the drop/add deadline just in case).\n\nI don't know what \"personal reasons\" means, either, but you knew that you had already missed one class meeting, you knew the number of classes you could miss without penalty, and you knowingly exceeded it anyway.\n\nSo no, I do not think they are being unreasonable.",

          "text": "I didn\u2019t enroll late, I enrolled before the deadline, they just had a session before I enrolled. This is the first time I\u2019ve encountered anything like this, and everyone I\u2019ve spoken to agrees, Professors and students. My personal reasons are irrelevant since I\u2019m not arguing the other absences, just this one in particular. I am curious on why you think it\u2019s ok to mark an absence for a class I wasn\u2019t enrolled in, and therefore could not reasonably have been expected to attend.",

      "text": "Many professors do count absences before you were enrolled, since you missed the material or discussion that day. I\u2019d recommend next talk with the professor directly, then if that doesn\u2019t get you anywhere, the department chair or academic Dean (if you\u2019re at a community college, usually the Dean is the professor\u2019s boss, not the department chair). Depending on the personal reasons for the other absences, talking with the Dean of Students could also be useful.",
