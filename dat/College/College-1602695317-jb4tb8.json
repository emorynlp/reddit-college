  "text": "Idk why, but I just feel like that all of this stuff I\u2019m \u201clearning\u201d in my classes are just going through one ear and out the other, and it\u2019s really scaring me because I feel like I should fundamentally understand what is going on in my classes, especially the ones major-related. Like sure, I\u2019ll be able to memorize and regurgitate enough relevant information to do relatively well on exams/finals, but once I\u2019m done with the class, you can forget anything that was taught to me. \n\nI just feel really dumb taking all of these notes, labeling all of these diagrams, when I know for the most part I\u2019m just gonna forget it come a few months, maybe even a few weeks. Is it just me?",

It is not the end, it is a starting point to actually be able to ask questions about the details the model does not cover, so that a full understanding of what is known -- and not known -- can be developed.\n\nRoll with it.",

Once you actually memorize stuff, you can move on towards more complex ways of applying the knowledge and skills. The ultimate goal is creating new knowledge from your knowledge, by synthesizing it. For stuff related directly to your major, you do want to put in a lot of time and effort, because you\u2019re eventually going to need to be an expert when you are applying for jobs and then working in the industry that you studied in school.

The skill of acquiring knowledge is like the skill of gathering medicinal mushrooms: you'll be a master mushroom gatherer long after the first batch of shrooms are gone. Smoked. I think that's the answer to the question you raise - when the phones in our pockets give us access to the whole internet, does it matter if anyone remembers anything they learn? No, all that matters is that they learn how to gather information effectively when they need it.",

You pick up a lot more than you realize, and just because you can't name every specific piece of information off the top of your head right now doesn't mean that it won't come back to you when you need it during an internship, or after you graduate in a full time job. \n\nOne trick that helped me when the impostor syndrome really kicked into gear was to ask whether you would be able to hold your own in discussions with your peers without having gone to school. That helps establish a baseline for what you've learned, and more importantly, what you've understood well enough to apply in a real-world discussion.",

You learn to develop social skill to make friends and connections - whom may help you in your career. I think learning Math is just developing our logical thinking skills and remembering skill is important too. I remember reading somewhere the first step to learn something is to remember and copy it. So you're not wasting time or anything, you're actually learning a lot. But I totally get what you're feeling, I felt like that sometimes",

Unfortunately because how we are taught currently, I sometimes have to just BS my way through a class because I would fail otherwise (since there is no time to take it slow and fully understand a certain subject).  The bottom line is our educational system is in desperate need of reform, and I struggle to comprehend why no one has been more vocal about this.",

However, I think a lot of this is due to the design, not always the people. \n\nI think people \u201cforgetting\u201d material from sociology, psychology, major-related, etc coursework can be very problematic. If I\u2019m a criminal justice major and I\u2019m about to become a cop who goes through a stress-based academy that does not reteach those sociological principles as well, it\u2019s going to be problematic if I don\u2019t retain the things I learned in sociology. A aspiring doctor should not forget everything they learned in anatomy. These are extreme examples, but I\u2019ve seen these presented in smaller-scale issues in my experiences: computer science graduates who didn\u2019t know what they were doing in the workplace, incompetent EMS workers, nurses who gave incorrect information or demonstrated poor knowledge of field understanding, etc. That can get an employee replaced quickly. \n\nI don\u2019t have an answer for your question. It\u2019s a good one. I would say focus the most on remembering coursework that is relevant to your major and/or that will likely help you in the future\u2014 generally these are going to be people related skills no matter what major you are.",

      "text": "I kind of disagree with most of the answers here. If you\u2019re not learning, then seriously try to learn instead of just memorizing. Spend time with the material. Do more research, approach it from different angles. Learning takes actual effort. If you want to LEARN as opposed to MEMORIZE, really dive into things and attempt to master it. Watch youtube videos, spend your free time reading a book on the subject. College was supposed to be about developing your intellect, not getting a job. In the job market there are NO guarantees- treat college as its own experience that requires its own mindset. If you genuinely want to come out in four years as someone who has a genuine understanding of your subject, it\u2019s going to take more than making A\u2019s on quizzes. Which is a good thing by the way! There\u2019s nothing wrong with putting effort into something y\u2019know?",

However, if you\u2019ve *really* learned the material you could, in theory, derive most of the equations from first principle. For example, I almost always just use my memorized form of the navier stokes equation in my transport class. However, if I really needed to I could do a shell balance, derive it in Cartesian coordinates, and then convert and simplify it into whatever coordinate system I need. So while I memorize the compact version because it\u2019s nifty not to have to do a hour long algebra and logic exercise on exams, I can also derive it all from force balances and critical thinking. \n\nHowever, in most psychology, history, journalism or sociology courses I have to base my arguments off of memorized facts with *minimal* logical thinking. It\u2019s less difficult, but still incredibly important. I am glad I got a taste of the liberal arts in my dual degree, but I am even more glad I got the critical thinking skills that many people in the aforementioned fields lack at the undergraduate level. The way many LA degrees are taught right now is too lax in my opinion, they should involve more academic and logical rigor.",

      "text": "Yeah that's normal. You're not actually going to remember everything. But you are learning and you are understanding, and because you've remembered it before and understood it before, then you'll be able to pick it up more easily in the future. For example, I have to use calc 1/2 knowledge in a lot of classes. I haven't taken calculus since high school, 2 years ago, but it didn't take my long to remember most of the rules and methods. It didn't have to be \"retaught\" to me because I picked it up again easily. And a ton of this stuff you won't need to apply in real life, but if you ever need to, you can easily relearn it. That's the point. \n\n\nIt's important that you understand and not memorize, and this is especially important for majors that require little memorization and more problem solving and understanding (engineering, math/physics, some sciences, computer science). If you try to memorize your way through the class and the major you'll end up performing extremely poorly in the future.\n\n\nI personally feel very uncomfortable with just memorizing content; if I panic on an exam I only have my memory and my hours of studying to fall back on, and if I forget somehow then it's over. I need to have an understanding of things to feel prepared. That's probably a good habit to get into: forcing yourself to understand concepts.\n\n\nFor example, take a mathematical formula. Try to understand why exactly it makes sense, or why you're performing a specific computation, rather than spitting out the formula. For Chemistry, try to understanding why molecules interact, how the electrons and polarity will favor certain reactions over others. When you are about to learn something new, try to predict what will happen based on what you already know.",

I could see how the entire world could be explained by a set of equations, and it set off my ability to actually learn about things.",

But you can't tell me you used even 50% of what you learned in your college classes in that phone interview.\n\nTaking biology for instance, since that's my wheelhouse, they were obligated to teach me about genetics, chemistry, statistics, ect. They rounded it out with a ton of electives; for me ethics, Spanish, and that random film making class. There's pre-reqs, there's required general knowledge like writing..\n\nMy point is that for your undergrad they have to cover doctors, nurses, clinical staff, laboratory workers, ect all under the header \"biology.\" But we all have a specific role that makes the world go round. So all the stuff I learned about genetics or in O chem II was fascinating, but pointless to my current position. Therefore mostly forgotten because I've had to take it upon myself to learn a ton more about the things I'm responsible for day to day, so I don't, you know, accidentally kill someone. \ud83d\ude43\n\nIf we're gonna get philosophical, college is about learning all those less tangible things; how to meet a deadline, being self reliant, getting good at networking.
