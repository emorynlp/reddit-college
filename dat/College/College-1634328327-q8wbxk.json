  "text": "I got a low sat score 970 (560 Reading and Writing, 410 math) and I applied to a college that has an avarage of 1150-1350 SAT score. \nI have a 3.95/4.00 GPA and they told me that my extracurriculars are outstanding. I'm the only applicant from my country and from my minority in years, and they said that I have a very interesting set of skills. How many chances do I have of beign admitted? Today I saw my score and got very demotivated. I don't really know how many chances I have realistically talking.",

      "text": "It depends on the school and their values regarding testing scores. Schools are valuing standardized test scores less and less - especially for minority individuals or those who are English language learners. Standardized tests such as the SAT just simply don\u2019t measure/tell universities exactly what they want them to. Your GPA, extracurriculars, and unique set of skills make you a great candidate for most universities. If you are ever interviewing with a school, sell those good attributes. I scored worse on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), percentile wise, than you did on the SAT and was accepted to every graduate program I applied because of my previous experience in the psychology field, decent grades (3.6 GPA), and strong interpersonal skills (which they cared most about). That was for seven schools who have that have less than a 15% acceptance rate. You\u2019ve got this!",
