  "title:": "Guy wants to join lab group, but partner doesn\u2019t really want him to?",
  "text": "So I guess this guy did the first lab group by himself and got a zero bc you need to choose a partner or whatever. He came up to me one class and wanted to get my phone number and stuff, but we already did the lab and I told my partner about it and he didn\u2019t really care so I just said whatever.\n\nHe texted me and I hate to be that guy that ghosts, but like I feel too bad telling him that he can\u2019t join our group. Should I just not respond or tell him we can\u2019t bc we already did it, plus it makes it more complicated adding another person.\n\nMy lab partner did all the work so I feel like I can\u2019t even say anything.",

              "text": "Yeah I understand feeling bad for him, since anyone would want help if they were in his place. But at the end of the day, you don't owe him anything and the fact that you considered taking him in out of courtesy is enough, don't feel too guilty about it. Stuff like this happens and I'm sure he'll find another group or the professor will get him sorted out.",
