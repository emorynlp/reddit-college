  "text": "Good Day Reddit!  \nI have a fat crush on this guy in my physics class. Since the first day I walked into class, I've always kinda been eyeing him, and recently, we were put into the same group for a lab project. The lab project gave us an excuse to see/talk to each other and not only is he physically attractive, his personalty is like a 10/10. I also really value being able to joke around and our humor is pretty similar, so I'm always giggling around him.\n\nHOWEVER, as many college students know, it is nearing the end of the semester, which the number of opportunities I have to make a move are quickly dwindling. I go to a really big state school, so unless I make the effort to initiate something, I will probably not see him ever again! The idea of asking someone out romantically is absolutely terrifying and I don't know if I can work up the balls to do it before the end of the semester. It's kinda bad timing too, since everyone goes home for about a month for winter break, so even if I do ask him out, it's not like we will be in close proximity over break. \n\nInstead of directly asking him out, I think it would be a better idea to ask him to join a club with me next semester, that way, we will have an excuse to keep seeing each other. Do you guys have advice about what to do?",
