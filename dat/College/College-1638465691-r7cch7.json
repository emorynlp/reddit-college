      "text": "It's usually a good idea to finish for your future career prospects, earning potential, etc. But there are always exceptions for unique circumstances. If you can stick it out, try to do so. \n\nIf you are having mental health issues, talk to your doctor and follow their advice. If you are having other pressures, find an appropriate expert to discuss options (e.g., financial).\n\nGood luck and wishing you a peaceful day.",

As for that advice it\u2019s basically just pandering since humans are a walking talking contradiction at least once in their lifetimes",

      "text": "It really comes down to whether or not you will be able to finish the degree and get a job. If you won\u2019t be able to pass the classes necessary to get the degree, then you should drop out now to avoid wasting more money, and you can chalk it up to college not being for you. Get out now before you are in even more debt. \n\nOn the flip side, if you will be able to pass the classes necessary to finish the degree, but you just need to retake them, you just need to change your major, or you just need to lighten your load and take an extra semester or two, then it may make sense to stay in college and finish it out. \n\nYou just have to examine whether or not you think you are capable of ever passing the necessary classes. \n\nThere is probably a point where it takes so much time that it\u2019s no longer worth it, even if you could finish. You\u2019d just have to look at your earnings potential after getting the degree coupled with the debt you\u2019ll be in, and compare that with the earnings potential of getting a job without the degree but also without the debt.",
