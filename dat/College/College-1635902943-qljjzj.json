  "text": "I\u2019m already 3 semesters into business administration and I just can\u2019t stand it. I find it boring, uninteresting and it\u2019s quite literally draining my soul. Just this week I had to turn in a final project and I decided to not do it, lose the credits and get a zero on it because I just couldn\u2019t find it in me to even start it. This was a first for me, but at least it helped me finally realize how unhappy I am with this major.\n\nMy big problem though, is that I have a very generous scholarship that would be greatly affected if I changed my major. And even if that was not an issue, I\u2019d have no idea which one I\u2019d change to.\n\nI\u2019m feeling very lost right now and don\u2019t know what to do.",

Hopefully I can get my parents onboard with this though. I\u2019ll also try talking with a counselor to check what my options are. Thanks a lot.",

Not worth it even with a scholarship. \n\nDefinitely change your major or at least press pause on school for now. Do some soul searching and come back to it.",

I always tell incoming freshman to take at least one computer science/coding class. It\u2019s not the most exciting, and I didn\u2019t particularly love it. But coding is a 6 figure skill so the job I landed more than makes up for it. Try tech!",
