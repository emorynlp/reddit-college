  "text": "I had an A in a class, and the final brought it down to a 92.55. An A is a 93+. I talked to my instructor, and today I found out that my grade got rounded up to an A. One of my classmates asked me if I got rounded up, and she told me that her 92.8 wasn't rounded up. I messed up didn't I? I shouldn't have said anything. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
