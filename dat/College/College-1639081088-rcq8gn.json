  "text": " So I had a pretty complicated college application process. Amidst Covid, I transferred high schools and was offered to graduate early - however, they didn't tell me by doing so I wouldn't be ranked and wouldn't be able to see my GPA until the very end of the year... obviously this made applying to colleges so much worse since I had also never taken my SAT or ACT (Also, I didn't find out months after applying to my main college picks that the school had an error on my transcript and put a 67 instead of an 87 for one of my math grades).\n\nAnyway, after being stressed the whole year and not knowing where I wanted to go or wanted to study, I ended up applying to UTD around May and decided to go here since it was the cheapest. Because of that, though, I missed all the deadlines for scholarships and received no merit aid despite having a 4.2 gpa in high school. I still received a lot of need-based aid but it's not nearly enough to cover everything.\n\nOnto my issue now... I've already had to take out 5k in loans for my freshman year and hate the idea of being 20k in debt by the time I graduate. Is there any way I can apply for merit scholarships as a current student here? Should I unenroll as a full time student and do part time while taking community college classes if that's cheaper (is that even applicable now?)?? I really like the program I'm in, but should I look at other schools and transfer? (would other schools even grant transfer students good aid?)\n\nI'm genuinely just looking for any advice at all. I've been constantly stressed for the past two years lol and am about to cry after I found out there really arent any good scholarships besides UTD's AES which is only for incoming freshman :') Any advice is helpful thank u",

      "text": "Your school may be different, but in my experience, school's reevaluate merit scholarships after every Fall semester. So if you got a high enough GPA this semester you may qualify for an academic scholarship. If not, work hard next semester, maybe take a summer class or two to boost, and try again the next year.",
