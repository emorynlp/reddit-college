  "text": "Am 20/F. It's been like 4 years since I've been in school because I dropped out and got my GED due to life circumstances, and they were going to hold me back anyway at the time because my last semester I made straight F's. I won't lie, high school killed my love for school and academics. \n\nHowever, I'm so excited to finally being going back. It took me awhile to finally figure out something I would be interested in, which I've finally settled on becoming a medical lab tech. It's right up my ally and just looking at the courses that are required, I'm in love already. Even math! Like I can't fucking wait to get back to being a student. Though I'm a bit nervous about being back around other students, but I hope I'm able to make a few friends at the very least. \n\nBut I need to get supplies and prepared again, which I don't know at all what supplies I should be looking for. Like, binders? Should I bring like a backpack? Like do people still wear them? #2 pencils, markers, highlighters? Mechanical pencils? Calculator? Like that's all I can really think of when it comes to school supplies. Notebooks? Am I missing anything?",

      "text": "Just finished my first semester of college. I\u2019d say the supplies you need really depend on your personality. Most assignments now are online so a laptop is a huge must have. I found notebooks to be a personal choice. Some people do better writing things down rather than typing but, it\u2019s always nice to have one in case a professor has a vendetta against technology. Math classes also prove to need a notebook as it can be hard to take math notes online. Multiple subject notebooks with folder dividers are my main go to as it\u2019s not as bulky as having both multiple individual notebook and folders. \n\nIf you chose to only bring a laptop and a notebook or two a laptop bag will suffice but, backpacks are definitely still widely used. Unless your taking an art class items like crayons, colored pencils and such aren\u2019t used. Of course, they can still be used to help take notes if color coordination is your thing. Taking a few pens and pencils to class is great as professors may occasionally hand out something to quickly fill in. \n\nOverall, don\u2019t go overboard. I definitely did. It may be best to just wait last minute until after the first class, you get your syllabus and get a vibe from your professors. And remember technology will likely be a huge part of learning if you can supplement physical items (notebooks, binders, assignments) with technology without sacrificing grades do it. I\u2019ve lost so many note due to my illegible handwriting and losing physical papers.",

      "text": "I'm glad you finally found something you're interested in!\n\n> Like, binders?\n\nDepends on the subject if it'd be overkill. For example, this semester I used two binders for A&P and one for nutrition, but didn't need one for English. Definitely get good folders (at least one) for each subject, though. Some students even have Trapper Keepers! As an older returning student, seeing those again threw me for a loop.\n\n> Should I bring like a backpack? Like do people still wear them?\n\nAbsolutely. I'd say 85-90% of students in my classes had backpacks. I personally prefer bags, though. I used one of [these](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D364LNT/r) for my A&P class and one of [these](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09B56S9C4/) for my other classes. Last semester, I used this [backpack](https://smile.amazon.com/Backpack-Business-Charging-Resistant-Computer/dp/B06XZTZ7GB/). Zero complaints about any of them.\n\n> 2 pencils, markers, highlighters? Mechanical pencils? Calculator?\n\nDepends on the course. For my classes, I bought notebooks (one per class), pencils (Target brand), mechanical pencils (Zebra M301), big erasers, highlighters (I like the [Sharpie ClearView](https://smile.amazon.com/Sharpie-1912769-Highlighters-Assorted-4-Count/dp/B00M58JUFQ/) but YMMV), pens (Pentel Energel aluminum, Sharpie S-Gel, and some cheap Bic Cristal for writing in my book because gel takes too long to dry!), [page markers](https://smile.amazon.com/Post-Markers-Assorted-Bright-670-10AB/dp/B007QFATEO/), post-it notes, a small notepad, pencil sharpeners, and index cards. I also bought a cheap $5 calculator for nutrition (formulas) but your classes may require something more advanced (my medical math course in spring will, for example, but I'm waiting to see what the syllabus says before buying anything).\n\nDepending on your courses and your school, your syllabi may suggest additional materials -- and it can't hurt to ask your professor/instructor (if it's appropriate; in larger classes it may not be) if they have any suggestions re: materials you may want to pick up.",

      "text": "Yeah backpacks are still a thing where I\u2019m at. Some binders to organize all of your papers and assignment handouts would be a good idea. As for writing utensils, I\u2019d just use whatever you like the most, although it would probably be a good idea to bring some pencils for tests in case you want to change any answers. As for calculators, I would wait to see what your professor says before you buy one since they can get kind of pricey. Some other things that might be useful would be flash cards for studying, and a planner to schedule assignments and exams. Good luck, I wish you the best!",
