  "text": "This is definanlty on me. But, I feel like I am constantly experiencing an overload of information. For background, I take 5 classes per semester. When I get really interested in a topic, I want to know everything and anything about it. But even when I am not in school, I feel this. Especially on Tiktok. There is so much informative content. I want to learn about it all so that I can be more aware. Even when I am watching TV/movies I think \"How accurate is this?\" and look up a bunch of stats on it and compare it to real life. I know that it is impossible to know everything. But it's like I need to analyze everything. Is this a common experience?",
