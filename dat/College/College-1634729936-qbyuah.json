  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm a potential exchange student from Sydney Australia and I was wondering which exchange University would be best for me. I'm planning to take pretty chill 100 or 200 level units because I only have electives left in my degree and I really wanted my studies to be not too intense, so I could party and experience American college life as much as I could. I'm considering the University of Wisconsin at Madison, University of Illinois at urbana-champaign, University of Florida but I'm open to other unis too, my uni is partnered with alot of american universities. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",
