  "text": "Despite me sending them to her on or before the due date (via Google docs, as requested), my professor says that I am missing about half of the weekly assignments. She is willing to overlook my \"late submissions\" if I get them to her before the end of the semester. However, I have emailed them to her 3 times already, to no response, and just received another email that I am STILL missing assignments that I submitted, to which I emailed her the assignments again. I have double and triple checked that I have been sending it to the right email. I do have all the email communications saved, so I can prove that I've sent them to her on time, if it comes down to that.\n\nMy concern is that my final is on Friday, and I don't have any more classes with her until the final. She does not have an office (she's an adjunct), and schedules office hours by appointment only. However, if she's not responding to my emails, I can't schedule office hours! I've asked a classmate for her phone number (as she references using text communication in the syllabus, but doesn't actually provide her number), and will try to text her if I am able to get the number. I also have different professor for the asynchronous lab component of this course who is extremely prompt with communication.\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed: should I wait it out to see if she responds to my latest email; should I try to contact my lab professor for advice; or should I escalate to the department head? I really value my grades, especially as this class is a foundational class for my major, but don't want to be blowing things out of proportion.",
