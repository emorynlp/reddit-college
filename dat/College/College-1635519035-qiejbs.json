  "text": "For one of my courses this semester, I (along with MANY of my peers) managed to get past resources from a certain person(let's call them A). These resources included exams and other assignments that they had given when they took this course.\n\nOne of our (pretty major) assignments is exactly the same as the professor gave to this previous class (same question, same source material to analyze). Initially, I was only going to read A's assignment once as a general guideline, but eventually I ended up refering to it much more than I would have liked. Basically this assignment was supposed to be 2/3 summarising and comparing the assigned source materials, and 1/3 developing your own idea based on the source material. \n\n\nI got my assignment run through turnitin before I submitted it and the plagiarism percentage was 4 percent, and I know for a fact that I most of it is my own work, but there are some bits in the first 2/3 of my assignment (the summary and comparison bits) that feel a bit like A's. At at least one place, the example I've used is the same as A's. It was a pretty prominent and important bit of the source material, and I probably would still have talked about it had I never read A's assignment, but in this case I got the idea to use it from A's assignment. I expanded on it more than A had, but that doesn't change the fact that I got the idea from A's assignment.\n\nSo at this point, I'm going paranoid thinking my assignment would read too much like A's. This professor is literally amazing but also very strict when it comes to plagiarism, so I can't stop thinking of what would happen if he thought I had plagiarized and decided to report me to the university",

In the case, it gets graded and you don't receive any contact, congrats you lucked out, don't be stupid, and don't do it again.\n\nThe only thing reaching out after the fact would do is nuke your grade, potentially still get in trouble with the uni and also the person who gave you the assignment.",
