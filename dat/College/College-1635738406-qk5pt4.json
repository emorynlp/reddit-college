  "text": "I\u2019m currently an undeclared  freshman in college but with the spring semester coming up it\u2019s about time that I have to pick a major. I know a lot of people don\u2019t have to decide their major until the end of their sophomore year year but in high school I did dual enrollment and had a lot of my credits transferred to my college. There are a lot of things that I like but I just don\u2019t see myself making a career out of. Also I feel like a lot of people might say something like hmmm I like math so I\u2019ll be a finance major or a math major but with me the things I like are on completely different spectrums and are not related at all. I\u2019m feeling kind of stuck and I don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice?",
