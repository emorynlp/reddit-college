  "text": "helloo \ud83d\ude2d i\u2019m really paranoid about what\u2019s going to happen but basically today we had a quiz on the respondus lockdown browser, with the webcam and audio function turned on. also i did it with a friend sitting near me, but we had zero intention to collude, just sitting near each other. \n\nit was an MCQ quiz. the first question stumped me but i just gave my best guess and moved on. this quiz had the function such that after i moved onto the next question, i cannot go back and change my answer. \n\nnearing the end of the paper, for some reason i was itching to know what the answer was for the first question, knowing full well i cannot change my answer anyway, and i completely forgot that my audio was being recorded (i had my mask on), so i very stupidly quietly asked my friend what the answer for the first question was and he answered me, which might have all been picked up by the audio.\n\ni don\u2019t know if my video will be flagged and if they\u2019ll question me, but the question i was verbally asking wasn\u2019t even the one that\u2019s on my screen at that moment in time. it was such a stupid mistake because i was just an impatient little shit who wanted to know it i got it right but i really had no intention to cheat, and now i probably won\u2019t be able to sleep for a few days \ud83d\ude2d i don\u2019t even know if my case is favourable for me but i genuinely didn\u2019t intend to cheat.",

      "text": "I think you'll be okay, because if your teacher questions you, you can bring up the exact same points you've mentioned here. Given that there was no way for you to cheat since the question you asked about was different to the one on your screen, any professor would likely be reasonable about it and let you off with a message to not speak during exams next time. Don't stress too much, this won't matter in the long run! And who knows, maybe they won't even notice since these systems aren't always perfect \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
