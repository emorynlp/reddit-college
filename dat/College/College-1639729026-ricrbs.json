  "text": "So I have my final in a couple days for my C++ class and I haven\u2019t done half of the work for this semester. It totals up to 7 labs and 6 homework assignments and a final project. I\u2019m currently working on them right now and I\u2019m stressing the fuck out because I don\u2019t understand as much as I thought I did. \n\nThing is part of this is because I decided to take 6 classes this semester and the rest I finished with good grades, but i just fell behind in this class. I\u2019m looking to transfer so I\u2019m super reliant on my gpa and I\u2019m super scared.\n\nDoes anyone know if I can fail and retake the class and will my original grade get replaced on my transcript? Also maybe I can argue a covid withdrawal or something similar? \n\nAny help is appreciated I just don\u2019t want to mess with my gpa. Honestly if I could retake the class with more time on my hands I know I could get an A it was just that I took 20 credits this semester and I realized it was too much.",
