  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m currently enrolled in a mandatory university writing course and I\u2019m finding it extremely difficult to excel in it. I have A/A+s in all my other STEM class but I just got a B/B- on a paper worth 30% of my grade. Can anybody link some helpful resources/websites that have helped them in uni writing?",
