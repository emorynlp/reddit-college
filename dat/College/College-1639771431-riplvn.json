  "text": "I just hate when professors don't grade the assignments throughout the semester and then we're left freaking out until grades are released.\nThis professor of mine never posted our grades on our grade book. He would grade the exams and send our grade through email, but never posted them on the grade book so we can see their weight and how we were doing.\nI got either a C- or a C (I don't really know as he didn't specify) on the first midterm. Got a B or a B+ on the second midterm (I don't know which one for sure either). And finally, got either a C- or C on the final (again, have no idea). He also hasn't graded any of the the homework.\nAnd that's how I stand now. I have no idea if the grades I got on the exams will be enough and I'm freaking out cuz I have no idea of how my performance was throughout the semester. Ugh",
