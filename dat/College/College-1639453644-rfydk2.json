  "title:": "What calculator is fine for Intro to Probability and Statistics?",
  "text": "Hello, I'm taking Intro to Probability and Stats in the spring semester and the description says, \"a scientific calculator with two-variable statistics capabilities is required for this class.\" I did some Googling and I couldn't really figure out exactly what level(?) of calculator would be fine for the class. I'd prefer not to have to buy the $100+ ones but if that's what's needed, I'd like to know in advance. Does anyone have experience with this class and know what calculators will work? Thanks!",

      "text": "Ask the Professor, or the TA.  \nSeriously, ask before you spend the money.  \n\nA \"Scientific Calculator\" is not a \"Graphing Calculator\".  \n\nIn fact, it's a much more simple device, in the $30 ballpark instead of the $130 ballpark.  \n\nBut check the rest of your degree. Will you need a Graphing Calculator for your next class?  \n\nAre you allowed to use a Graphing Calculator at all? Not all classes/schools allow them.  \n\nhttps://education.ti.com/en/product-resources/scientific-course-comparison  \n\nThe Ti-30XS is $16 @ Amazon and will probably do everything you need.",

          "text": "The class descriptions have used scientific and graphing interchangeably which has just confused me more, haha. I guess I'll have to ask the professor personally. I'm a sociology major so I won't be doing anything higher than this class. I used the Ti-30XS all the way through high school so it would be great if I don't need to upgrade!",

      "text": "Ti Nspire you can get one used for cheap\n It's a little different from the regular TI84 but you'll get used to it and find out its easier to use than the TI84. You get a bright screen, its WAY faster than the TI84\n\n\n\nI also here the HP Prime is decent its like the TI nspire but touchscreen and a bit cheaper but its not standard in schools so idk how you feel about that",
