  "title:": "How to apply the 90/10 or pareto principle for predicting engineering exam questions?",
  "text": " I have taken some big engineering exams like solid mechanics, engineering materials etc & found that only 10% of the content that is taught comes in the final exam. How should I predict that 10% of the content that has higher probabilities to come in the finals & how should I understand the mindset of the professor & find out important topics/questions that he might give in the exam? Is there a way? Please share your experiences.\n\nThanks in advance.",
