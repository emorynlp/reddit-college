  "text": "Okay. So this one\u2019s about working. \n\nBasically I\u2019m having trouble doing my math. \n\nThe trouble isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t have determination, or drive, or that I don\u2019t see it as an important task to do. \n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t want to do it. \n\nWhat\u2019s strange is the ways my body communicates this before-unknown fact. I\u2019d get up, get ready to do my homework and then I would feel repelled. It\u2019s like the air was taken out of me that was floating me dutifully to the study room. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I started talking with myself that I realized I don\u2019t like math and I don\u2019t want to do it. Which is strange because I thought I liked math and the work wasn\u2019t truly painful. But I have feelings deep down inside that tell me that math is a no-go. \n\nAnyone else have troubles like this? Have you felt \u201cready to go\u201d but your true feelings held you back?",

      "text": "If your major requires a lot of math, and all you are going to do in the field is math, I hope you either resolve your feelings or chage major. I feel the same way, when I open my math book, I read for like 10 min. and then close it. I have the same feeling of refusing to learn it. Maybe had that feeling, I\u2019m starting to change. The good thing for me is that my major doesn\u2019t really requires math, so the only math I\u2019m taking is for a general requirement. I have many reasons for not liking and not really carrying about math. But I do recognize that I should study and give it my best. I regard my feelings of not wanting to do my math homework as bad. It\u2019s like a bad habit that I want to eliminate. I would like to not care about math but do it swiftly. You\u2019re not alone, but, in my case, I hope to chage those feelings. I hope you don\u2019t fail your math class :)",

          "text": "Thank you! I\u2019m understanding that it\u2019s mindset. Tonight I went on a long walk and it was made known to me that I don\u2019t wanna do math because I didn\u2019t think I could do things as a result of living with a critical mother who\u2019s differently abled and not living up to her expectations. The feeling generalized from not being good at the things she wanted me to do to not being good at anything. Also had the thought that right now, everything\u2019s swell for me and I need to fully appreciate that until I want to move on and do something difficult. So I feel a bit better. I\u2019m not going to stress for the next few days, and Saturday I have a tutoring appointment so hopefully having someone else there will get me moving. \n\nI only have to take 1 math class. It\u2019s 1/2 classes I have to take total for this semester. Bad thing is I have an F so I have to double up on assignments every week. Hope it gets easier for you.",

              "text": "I might suffer from something similar lol. Not just in math, but when I\u2019m taking an exam, once I finish it, I think, \u201cwhat if I\u2019m wrong\u201d, so I go back and double check. I know I\u2019ve got the right answers, because I answered based on te textbook or the lectures, but I still hesitate to turn it in (yes, sometimes I have no clue what the answer is, but that\u2019s different because I truly don\u2019t remember/know). And in math, before I do anything, I think, \u201cthis is difficult/dumb\u201d, but then when I sit down and do it, I realize it wasn\u2019t difficult and that I actually knew how to do it. So yeah, probably suffering from some psychological issues as well here. But I\u2019m happy to know that you have resolved your feelings. I think you helped me resolve mine, thank you. I don\u2019t know how the school you attend works, but you could withdraw the class and try again on another semester, right ? That way you won\u2019t have to blast your butt off just to get a C. You could withdraw, take the class on a later semester, have a fresh start, and more opportunities for a better grade. I said that I don\u2019t know how the school you attend operates, but on mine, I can do that. Once I take the class for the second time, the school honors the grade I obtained the second time around. I don\u2019t know if the W from my withdraw remains on my transcript after completing the class for the second time. But the second grade is the one counted towards my GPA, and the grade that I officially have in that class. So, If you have that option, I recommend you to think about it. One can\u2019t take the class again if a C grade or higher was obtained (at least in the school I go to). That\u2019s is why I\u2019m telling you this, if you don\u2019t want to ruin your GPA, you could do this. That being said, please don\u2019t start withdrawing classes left and right. Be smart about how to use this tool (if you have it) to your advantage. I have only done this for two classes that I took last semester. I wasn\u2019t performing well due to a variety of reasons, I was failing the classes, so I withdrew. I\u2019m taking one class I withdrew from this semester and I will take the other class next semester. \n\nAlso, if you are on some kind of program and/or scholarship, withdrawing might affect your eligibility. So if you do want to withdraw, check beforehand. Some programs require a certain amount of units per semester. \n\n:)",
