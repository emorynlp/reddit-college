  "text": "The problem that I'm having is that I simply don't have a good reason for essentially throwing my hands up and walking away from college. I was an immature 18 y/o who decided to major in computer science because I thought it would be profitable. About a month after classes started I was overwhelmed, frustrated, and totally demotivated to do school. I was depressed, did drugs often and spent most of my free time skating. I literally decided that I would simply stop logging in to do classes. Now I'm here over a year later with my head on straight trying to figure out how to professionally explain( with documentation) that I simply didn't give a fuck but now I do. Please help, what should I do?",
