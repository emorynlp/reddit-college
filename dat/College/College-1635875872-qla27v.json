  "text": "First time posting on this sub, hello everyone!\nFor some context I\u2019m a 4th year student, I was able to do one and a half years of in person school before I had to do a year and a half online. Those 1.5 years in person were the best time of my life. I loved school and going to classes, I was always interested in the subjects taught and took thorough notes.\n\nSince coming back to campus I\u2019ve been extremely overwhelmed with school work. I watch as my peers enjoy being back on campus and thrive in the in-person school environment while I am drowning in homework and my studies. I don\u2019t know what I am doing wrong, I miss enjoying school. Looking to see if anyone else feels this way, no one within my major seems to (small major but huge university). It feels extremely isolating, I have no one to talk to about it.\n\nLooking to see how other college students feel about returning to in person classes. I was initially excited, but now I am struggling immensely.",
