  "text": "So I have a prof who requires us to submit written work each time we take a quiz. That\u2019s completely fine. I respect that. What I don\u2019t get is how he expects an explanation for simple answers. \nExample: how am I supposed to explain my answers on a question asking for domain and range??? It\u2019s literally just the domain and range. I don\u2019t get what more explanation is needed?",

I lost half of the points there despite getting the right answer",

      "text": "It depends a lot on the complexity of the function in question.  The domain of 1/x is one thing, but no student at the college algebra level is going to honestly find (for example) the domain of 1/(x^2 + x + 1) without some work.  I need some reason to think they didn\u2019t just pull it out of their ass.\n\nOn a related note, the requirement for an explanation helps your grade if anything.  If you at least attempted to solve x^2 + x + 1 = 0 you might get partial credit even if you screw up the final answer.  If you did absolutely no work and put down a wrong final answer that\u2019s almost certainly zero credit.",

          "text": "I did show calculation on the complex ones. Got the right answer. On a less complex case it was literally looking at a graph and I\u2019m not aware what kind of work could\u2019ve been shown. On another case it was finding the vertex of a parabola and the range. showed calculations on that one too. I got all three right and lost half credit",
