  "text": "I am currently in my first year in a University and I hate it so much. Yeah it is nice to have freedom from your parents but I honestly kind of miss being at home. I may sound spoiled but I miss having privacy, not worrying my roommate is asleep, my own bathroom, and my car!! So, I am considering of transferring back to my home town and going to a community college. If I do so, I'd have access to my car and be able to work as well. But I don't know if I would later regret this in the future. Help or advice?!?!",
