  "title:": "Broke my ankle and can\u2019t get to class and my professor is being an asshole about it ????",
  "text": "This is blowing my mind I broke my ankle on the 6th of this month ( super shitty) and I\u2019m in a full cast to my knee totally unable to drive. I live in a town with no family and my boyfriend works 9-5 in another town and is unable to drive me to class. I emailed my professor explaining the circumstances and apologizing for it being an inconvenience and I get an email back asking why I still can\u2019t come to class? I don\u2019t understand what he thinks I\u2019m suppose to be doing ??? In the age of covid you\u2019d think he\u2019d just let me zoom but since I\u2019m not technically sick he won\u2019t. Any advice ? It\u2019s a discussion based class and that\u2019s his argument as if I can\u2019t speak through zoom?? Anyone dealt with a professor like this before? should I contact campus disability? Someone please help",

          "text": "It is not the professor's job to figure out students' transportation. Students who are permanently unable to use their legs attend in-person classes every day at every campus. They do it using tools such as wheelchairs, crutches, busses, university-provided disability shuttles, cabs, and rideshare apps. The people who are saying to contact the disability office are correct - the whole reason they exist is to connect students like OP to resources for students who have limitations such as not being able to walk, so that professors can do their actual jobs. Professors are not high school teachers and their job description does not include solving all problems students encounter, because students are adults who are expected to figure out their own lives. Helping students figure out how to arrive at school buildings is one of the many things that is not the professor's job. That's why universities spend so much money on student services like the disability center, because that kind of problem is *their* job.\n\nAlso, providing remote instruction was a response to a totally unforseen global disaster. You can't expect it to continue indefinitely with just the professors filling the gap by working 80 hour weeks with no extra pay. For online classes to continue permanently, the university will need to provide actual resources (such as employing people to do filming, editing, and captioning or paying professors extra/offering course releases to allow them to develop online courses within their normal job duties). Plus, some classes (apparently including this one) just don't translate well to hybrid or virtual formats.",

              "text": "It's definitely not his job to figure out her transportation but while op is dealing with student services, it would not hurt to show a little empathy for her circumstances. This was an unfortunate incident that happened to her and it's going to take time for her to adjust and navigate it. Also, universites do already pay for instructional designers who can do editing/transcription etc. It doesn't have to be the best video lecture ever since it's short term and im sure op understands that. Honestly even professors who offer hybrid also just record their session and upload it and that's it",

They can provide formal documentation and help advocate for you (assuming you have a good DoS office).\n\n*edit: the dean of students is someone different from the academic deans. Do not contact the academic dean of the particular college/unit until you first contact the department chair if you decide to go that route. In any case, without formal documentation, no one in academic affairs will be able to do anything.",
