  "text": "So I'm getting a programming degree at a community college, I'm in my early 30's and I have had a hard time going back. I have taken 2 semesters already. But here is the deal, those were the easy ones. I already knew SQL from my job. \n\nThis semester I took JavaScript and android development, and bommbed both courses. They were both really difficult for me, I got overwhelmed and far behind and now its the end. \n\nI feel really humiliated now. I kept assuming that since I was 31, that I had my stuff together and I would eventually pull things off.\n\nI'm still making satisfactory academic progress. I'm still in the game. I'm just feeling really discouraged that I let this happen.",

      "text": "It's hard going back as a non-traditional student. I'm working on my PhD at 31, but it definitely feels like I'm riding a rusty bicycle that's on fire off of a cliff. \n\nAt 31 we have work and real world experience. But undergraduate courses are geared toward young 18 and 19 year olds who usually don't have to work or have any excess baggage wearing them down. Meanwhile, older students often have to unlearn many ideas and old habits before they can learn the new stuff. It is harder. But as a non-trad you do bring experience, a good work ethic, and a wider perspective to the mix. \n\nEssentially, recognize that you face unique challenges but are also worthy of being in the program. Keep up the good work, it does get easier.",

Weed and alcohol lol. One of my friends, who has a PhD, told me they never wrote papers sober. \nEdit: I definitely don't advocate for the use of alcohol or drugs to help you write. I'm not entirely sure how they managed to write in that state. \n\nNow we all have aches, pains, and poor eyesight.",

      "text": "It is demoralizing but really not that uncommon for people to bomb their first semester because you don\u2019t know how much you are taking on, you are learning how to do a million other things (besides SQL).  15 weeks is a super short time to recognize and ameliorate a problem\n\nThe good news is - it seems like you actually know what the problems are.  Just don\u2019t do that again .  Seriously.  Get help from your advisor and take fewer classes to start off with.  Try to avail yourself of the tutoring center.\n\nSpeak to your professors and say, look, I don\u2019t want a better grade, I just didn\u2019t do this right. I want to learn how to do this right.  Help.  You might not have a 100% hit rate, but earnest requests for actual help melt the heart of even the grinchiest of professors.  And if only one helps, that is still more help than no help.\n\nDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking \u201cI will never finish if I take one class a semester\u201d\n\nFor one thing, once you have some time management and some College 101 under your belt, you will likely be able to handle more classes.  But if not, you are not going to get done faster by being overwhelmed and miserable.\n\n\nPersonally, I really prefer taking someone who had a bad grade or a bad semester and then turned it around.  I look for these people .  (Not dissing the all good grade people either) . This means you have many really important characteristics that will make you successful. A good LOR can highlight this.  I do this for my students all the time.  Dave has a B, and started from an F.  This shows\u2026.  Now this is not a red flag but a +.\n\nTake a breather, get some distance and don\u2019t think about what went wrong, think about what you can do to make it better next time.\n\nOther than  drunk driving you car into a bus full of kids and puppies, there is really very little that you can do in 1 semester of school that is truly irreparable if you don\u2019t repeat the pattern.\n\nReally, you did the hardest thing already.",
