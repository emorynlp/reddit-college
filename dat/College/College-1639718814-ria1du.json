      "text": "Idk why you're asking this on r/college instead of r/NYU... But I'll bite.\n\n1) It totally depends on what your preferences are. Generally the freshman dorms are Weinstein, Rubin, and Lipton, which are close to Washington square park. There are also third north and uhall, which are further away from WSP. IMO Weinstein has the best dining hall\n\n2) The food is generally above average compared to that of other universities, but it still pales in comparison to what you'll find on the streets of NYC. I mean u have to buy a meal plan if ur dorming so it's kinda unfortunate but what can u do\n\n3) Depends on what u prefer. Do u wanna live with 3 other ppl or just one? How social are u?\n\n4) Depends on which classes u take. Generally courses of similar subjects/areas will be held close to each other.",
