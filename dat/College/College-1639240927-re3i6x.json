  "title:": "teacher graded differently than the scale on the syllabus without notice causing me to fail the class",
  "text": "ive been taking a really hard class with an even tougher teacher, and according to the grading scale on the syllabus i shouldve finished with around a 76. to my surprise when she posted grades (a week late by the way,) i had received a D in the class. this dropped my gpa tremendously since the class was worth 3 credits and is required for my major. when i called her and asked about it she said she graded according to the syllabus, and on there nothing is weighted, tests are worth 150 points, lab is worth 50 points and assignments are worth 400. i accumulated at least 455/600 points and this is without any of the extra credit that i did being in the calculations. i calculated my grade multiple times and even the grade on blackboard was a B (i expected this to drop though). when i called her again, she basically said \u201cwell you did badly on the tests are theyre worth 50% of your grade and blackboard does not properly reflect your grade since work is missing\u201d without saying it. this shocked me because the whole year she stressed to not worry if you do bad on tests and to make it up with extra credit and doing all assignments since they are worth less than everything else. i cant even see all of my assignment grades since she never put them in during the year and still hasnt put all in now. i have a meeting with her on wednesday, but what can i do? i really dont want to retake this class and it is jeopardizing my scholarship. i have all As other than this.",

If this is still an issue make sure you still have that silhouette to keep it on hand and and perhaps talk to the department chair that's usually the next person up from your professor about the situation whatever currently blackboard reflects take a picture of it. Sounds like a stressful situation sorry you're dealing with this but but has your professor input it all the grades that they are going to use to determine the grade for the class are there still homework assignments or papers that are yet to be grated and posted?.",
