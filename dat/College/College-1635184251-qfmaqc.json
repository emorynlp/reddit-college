  "text": "I am on my fourth year of college and I declared my major just two semester ago. I chose finance as my concentration as I heard there is a higher chance of getting a good job when I graduate. This is true -- however, none of my finance classes are appealing to me. I am having the most difficult time understanding materials and I have no interest at all in learning them. I originally chose this concentration because my personal finance class was so interesting. I want to teach younger kids (high schoolers) how to manage money and such because none of my classes in high school helped me to do so. \n\nNow I am looking into other options in the business world. International business sounds very interesting but it looks like I have to take management, finance, and marketing classes to get through the degree.  I have only officially taken 2-3 finance classes from the past two semesters because my advisor told me to try and get through my gen eds and business students requirements before my concentration classes. \n\nWhat do I do?",

      "text": "I don't recommend majoring in international business. It's not a real business function in the same way finance, accounting, marketing, sales, HR, operations, and supply chain management are business functions. It would be unusual for a company to have an \"international business\" department, for example, whereas nearly every medium or large company will have a dedicated accounting/ finance department responsible for all company financials. \n\nMultinational companies who have business operations in other countries don't typically hire international business grads to manage those operations, but instead hire people in-region who have the relevant expertise. If a US-based company wants to start selling products in Germany, for example, they'll likely hire Germans to staff the new sales team and manage the country's operations and marketing, rather than hire Americans and pay for them to relocate internationally. \n\nAll of the more quantitative business majors are fairly in-demand by employers. If you don't like finance, what about accounting, MIS, operations, or supply chain management?",
