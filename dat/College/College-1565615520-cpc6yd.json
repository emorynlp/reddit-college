  "text": "To anyone who is reading and considering going to a for-profit school, please stay clear.  It may help you down the line as you apply for good paying jobs.  For profit colleges to some employers is a disqualifying factor.  However, the number one reason to stay away is the overwhelming debt that can be accumulated for a degree that is looked at as having little value.  You don't want to be owing hundreds of thousands for a degree that may not even get you an entry level job.  Yeah, you're best going to a community college which has way more respect.",

Everything that I've read or seen so far concerning WGU seems to make clear that it is a legit school.  For starters, the school is almost cheaper than a community college as students can take as many courses as they want for a flat charge.  In other words the school is not out to make shareholders rich.  To my understanding students can also earn IT credentials while completing courses which has substantial value in the IT job field.  Finally, as you mentioned, the school is non-profit.  Now on the flip side, some people may still be leery of the school simply because it is completely online and has no brick and mortar campus.  However, it is certainly leaps and bounds above your typical for-profit school.",

      "text": "If you're wondering how to spot a for-profit school, the thing you should be looking for is **accreditation.** You want a *regionally accredited* school, **not** nationally accredited. I know, nationally sounds better, right? It's not. Regional is the legit one.\n\nAccreditation is basically a list of standards and guidelines that a group of schools have agreed to hold themselves and each other to, in terms of what is required for the school to confer a degree of a given level. It's essentially an agreement that a degree from University A and a degree from University B both require more or less the same type and amount of work to receive, so it's possible to compare them in a meaningful way. It's also what allows you to transfer credits from one school to another, or enroll in a program at School B after completing a degree at School A and have your School A coursework count toward prerequisites at School B. A non-accredited school hasn't agreed to the same guidelines, so holding a degree from one of those schools doesn't \"mean\" the same thing as a degree from a regionally-accredited school. If you can't find anything about \"accreditation\" specifically on a school's website, that in itself is a red flag, but if they say \"credits may not transfer,\" that's an even redder flag. If you start your degree at ITT Tech/DeVry/University of Phoenix/Everest/one of these other for-profit scam schools advertised on daytime TV, you can't transfer to a real school partway through. Well, you can, but none of the credits you earned at Scam U will transfer and you basically wasted that time and money because you'll have to redo all that coursework at Legitimate College.",

I believe equivalent accreditations exist for other fields, but I don't know the specifics of them.",

          "text": "Definitely look at accreditation, but I'd say don't write it off entirely if the accreditation *of a program* isn't regional. The university's accreditation as a whole should be regional, absolutely, but a specific department might be accredited by an agency that deals specifically with that kind of degree (think accreditation specifically for nursing, or IT, or business) and that agency might be regional, national, or international.\n\nAACSB, for example is an international agency, but they only accredit business schools, and they're the agency that accredited Harvard, Stanford, and Yale business schools are all AACSB (just to give a single example that regional isn't necessarily what checks the box).\n\nAlso, minor correction on accreditation meaning a degree from school A is basically equivalent to a degree from school B-- it doesn't mean they're basically the same, it means they meet the accrediting agency's *minimum* requirements. Using the example above, Yale and UW business schools (and several other business degrees in state schools) are both accredited by the same agency, but most wouldn't consider Yale on the same level as UW. One's ivy league, the other is state. They have a minimum standard, but a school very well may exceed that standard.\n\nI'd say better advice would be to look at your desired school and program, then check out the specific agency for that school *and* that program. \n\nI do definitely agree on your red flags though, if there's *nothing* on the site about accreditation and they say your credits won't transfer, those are both huge red flags.",

Even selective US schools are now going \"test optional\" in many cases.  Of course these are not \"top programs\" of any kind, but public schools like Weber State offer a solid education at a reasonable price and they accept 100% of applicants.
