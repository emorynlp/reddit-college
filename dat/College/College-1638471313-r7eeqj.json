There's nothing that indicates an unreasonable risk for a conflict of interest.\n\nI personally would rather see more stuff like this than university culture becoming painfully staid. A lot of professors won't even meet you off campus to chat about a project over coffee and I find that much worse than this. People making a huge deal about small stuff like this is why professors are so afraid to act like a normal social human around their students. Screw the judgemental people. Most of this stuff is not an actual issue and there is no expectation on you to participate.",

Going to a bar *could* involve that, but it also could be for snacks or food, or a beer or two.\n\nI think they are going to be pretty disappointed if they think that it is going to be a party or something with the prof. He likely thinks it is going to be something very different than what they have planned. May be worth sending him an email about and say you aren't comfortable with it.",

              "text": ">just don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s right\n\nIt's not right to you, but in a subjective way based on your own cultural exposure growing up. Chances are you would be fine with it if you grew up in a place where alcohol was more social and your parents started letting you drink it at the dinner table as you got older. Ask a Nordic person if this is \"right\", as you put it, and they would probably be just be confused about the question.\n\nWhat you are describing is not uncommon in a lot of more liberal cities and in other countries. Both at universities and jobs. In some countries the work culture, at least in jobs, goes a step further and it would be weird if you didn't participate.\n\nMaybe you should attend and just opt-out of the drinking if it bothers you that much. I personally don't drink 99% of the time, so I'm coming from a similar place when I tell you no one will care that much in the US if you politely decline and it is not rude to do so. But it's a social experience and it seems like you are more concerned with everything aligning to your standards/expectations rather than experiencing adult life. Plus you are hyper-focusing on alcohol. Don't you want to talk to him outside of class and get to know his personal opinions/experiences in the field?",

I\u2019ve had professors invite me to dinner, and I had a few that I think would\u2019ve taken the class out for drinks if not for covid. The professor-student relationship does should not be uncomfortable or terribly inappropriate, but it can be more fun and less formal than a high school teacher-student relationship.",
