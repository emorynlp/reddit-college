  "text": "So my classmates arranged a meet up with my professor, who we\u2019ve never met since it\u2019s an ASYNCHRONOUS CLASS (100% online no zoom), at a bar\u2026 to drink.. \ni don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s because i\u2019ve always been conditioned to think students/professors can\u2019t have a relationship like that \ni understand if it\u2019s something like coffee to talk about an internship or if they\u2019re your mentor something like that \nBUT GO OUT AND TAKE SHOTS W HIM?? WITH A BUNCH OF COLLEGE GIRLS?? HES LITERALLY LIKE IN HIS 40\u2019s, MARRIED, WITH KIDS\ni don\u2019t know so far im the only one who thinks it\u2019s weird everyone else is \u201cso excited to take a shot w him\u201d",

      "text": "Uncommon or weird doesn't warrant criticism by itself. There's nothing that indicates an unreasonable risk for a conflict of interest.\n\nI personally would rather see more stuff like this than university culture becoming painfully staid. A lot of professors won't even meet you off campus to chat about a project over coffee and I find that much worse than this. People making a huge deal about small stuff like this is why professors are so afraid to act like a normal social human around their students. Screw the judgemental people. Most of this stuff is not an actual issue and there is no expectation on you to participate.",

Let them buy you a round, but don\u2019t buy one for them. Don\u2019t hit on them, and stop anyone else among the class from doing so.",
