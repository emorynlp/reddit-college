  "text": "My best time for clubs is late afternoon/early evening, at like 4pm-5pm. But so many clubs on campus have meetings at 7, 8, 9, or even 10. Maybe it\u2019s because I commute. Cause I wouldn\u2019t want to be on campus anywhere near 10.",

      "text": "Those time slots are aimed at on campus students, so might make sense for somewhere with a significant residential population. \nThe meetings are then at the outside a 10 minute walk from your room. So going to a meeting from 7-9, and then stopping by the dining hall for snacks and dessert is perfectly reasonable Tuesday night.",
