  "text": "Hey all. Forgive me if this post isn't allowed here, but I'm looking for some advice. \n\nAfter putting it off for years, I'm going back to school to complete my Bachelor's degree (I have just under 2 years left).\n\nMy question is this: I've recently found myself in a position to go back to school at no-cost to me due to my employer footing the bill 100%. I'm already ~$23,000 in debt for student loans from when I first attended school. The employer, however, only foots the bill for a specific location that does not offer a large variety of majors (and none that I'm truly interested in taking). With that being said, they also foot the bill for Graduate studies once I obtain my Bachelor's (again, same institution that has even less graduate options)\n\nWould you take the offer and just find a major, even if there really is no point to it just to finish the degree without going further into debt? Or would you find a location with a degree that you're more interested in, but would set you back in terms of more debt?\n\nFor reference, I started my journey as a Criminal Justice major (and loved it), but I don't see a point in finishing that degree with the job opportunities that are out there specific to it.",

      "text": "I'd do it. But it depends what you mean by \"not truly interested.\" I'd say feeling \"mildly interested\" or even \"neutral\" would be good enough, since it's free, but if you actively dislike the idea of going back and doing the work for the majors offered, then you might not want to.\n\nStill, free is free and you probably won't work for your current employer for the rest of your life. When you need to search for a new job, you'll want to have a degree under your belt.\n\nI say go for it.",

And don\u2019t forget that most people end up in positions unrelated to their major anyways.",
