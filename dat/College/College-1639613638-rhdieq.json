  "title:": "I failed this semester and I got kicked out of my internship",
  "text": "I\u2019m a human services major at a community college. This semester I had English, an internship and a class in conjunction with the internship. Today my internship supervisor called me to tell me that I was essentially fired, because of that I automatically failed my internship class. I already failed English which was my other class. I work part time and I\u2019ve been struggling with my depression and ADHD symptoms all semester. I can\u2019t stop crying. I feel like a failure and don\u2019t know what to do.",
