  "text": "Last month I started University, at the beginning I was super excited and since high school I wanted to go to university because I didn't like what I studied in high school. But now after a few weeks I feel tired, I like the lessons but I feel a lot of pressure and I am also afraid that I'm not making enough friends as I wish I did. I started studying and I'm figuring out my study method, and every time I miss something during the lesson I feel guilty because I know what my parents are expecting now that I'm finally attending university. I also applied to a top university in the US next year and I almost completed my application and I was regarded as very competitive, but now I'm afraid that I might fail or feel tired as I am doing here. It's a weird situation, a mix of guilt, fear, loneliness and fatigue.",
