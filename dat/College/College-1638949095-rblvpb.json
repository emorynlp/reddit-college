  "text": "Hey everyone, I honestly do not know what happened. The professor posted that the exam day was on Monday dec. 6, but I misread the text, thinking it was until Friday, December 10. It was a stupid part that I made.\n\nI'm taking one in-person course and three online classes, including this course (history, gen-ed) and so I completely jumbled the time schedules. I am in such a shock right now and it has overall been super overwhelming. I have a 90 in the course rn, but if I get a zero, it's down to a 63.\n\nIt's night time now and I JUST found out when I was planning to take the exam tonight. I emailed the professor but I fear that she will not let me make it up. I messaged her that I understood her decision, but asked her anyways since I wanted to take my chance by asking. I'm trying to not get emotional but ahhh. I seriously do not know how hot handle this because of my stupidity.\n\nHas this ever happened to any of you? Did your professors allow to give you a chance to make it up?\n\nI feel so devastated right now.",

I want to kill myself. I feel so stupid and terrified. My teacher takes numerous measures against cheating, and while I sincerely am not (& like, why would I even? I literally needed a 40 on the exam to get a C in the class & be able to take my future classes, you don't fucking cheat for a 40%) he doesn't know that so fucking damn it.\n\nBare in mind this is a major class that I'm taming for the 2nd time.",

Luckily my prof was really nice and I got to make it up later.\n\n\nFinally, I just went through this not too long ago\u2014straight-up forgot there was a test. My prof said \"Sorry, too bad.\" At least there are four tests, so that one won't count.",

It\u2019s a little harder to do that with an in-person final with one set of questions",
