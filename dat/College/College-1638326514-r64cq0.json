      "text": "You have to factor in how many grades make up your 3.7, how many classes youve taken. If you took 1 class and got a 3.7 and got a D in a second class then yes it would be 1.6. But if youve taken 10 classes with a GPA of 3.7 it wont drop as much because theres more weight behind the 3.7. You have to input each class and the grade you got for each class to get an accurate number of what your GPA will be with a D.",
