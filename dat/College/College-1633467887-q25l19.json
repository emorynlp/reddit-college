  "text": "Hey all. I'm currently in my junior year with a 3.278. I had a 4.0 in my first year and I never thought I'd be dealing with this anxiety, but now I'm worried I won't make it into a research position in time to write a thesis.\n\nI'm taking 18 credits now and I'm doing well in all my classes, so my gpa will improve. I just think it's too late. A few labs have already rejected me.\n\nI feel a lot of regret. I had some adverse experiences my freshman year (unreported sexual assault, parents divorced, I was displaced my the pandemic). I mentally crashed my second year, and that's when the gpa decline happened. I did well in some classes but chemistry just didn't happen for me online. I ended up taking an emergency withdrawal and stepping down to a part time course load because I was having severe breakdowns and I needed time and money to start therapy. This past summer I lost my scholarships, and that's been another challenge since I'm already really struggling financially (didn't qualify for federal grants because my parents claimed me last year on their taxes). I feel like my \"college dreams\" are a fucking joke now.\n\nI reached out a few weeks ago to one of my professors who studies climate change and forest ecology, since that's my area of interest. He said he'll be happy to meet with me and discuss how I can get involved in his lab, but I'm scared he'll see my transcript and turn me down. I've been working as a technician in an immunology lab for two years and I just really want to be able to get into this research position. I'm passionate, I know a lot about this subject, I'm good at it. It just hasn't been enough. \n\nI don't even know if I can explain my low gpa in interviews or if I have to just sit through another lecture about study habits and tutoring and \"focus on grades before you're trying to get into research\". I'm doing so much better now that I have legitimate mental health resources, it just doesn't show up on the transcript yet.\n\nAm I being hopeless about this? Do I need to make more realistic plans? And is there anything I can do when they bring up that shitty \"Do you have a copy of your transcript\" other than just sit quietly?",
