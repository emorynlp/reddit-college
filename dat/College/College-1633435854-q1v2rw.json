  "text": "Okay so the demand for mental health services for young people is dramatically increasing, and most of them don\u2019t receive the help they need.\n\nI want to build something that\u2019s gonna be here to support young people at any time. There are tons of cool mental health apps, but there's always room for improvement. We\u2019re trying to build something focused on teenagers/young adults - what would a helpful mental health app look like for you?",

      "text": "I think: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Big focus on letting people open up and describe whats on their mind. Forum, Chat or something among those lines. Make people feel as if they are heard and make sure they receive feedback on what is said (It doesnt have to be a psychologist who answers, but just someone who cares) \n2. A place to follow up on strategies and rutines. Did you wake up on time, did you take time to get your homework done for today, did you spend time planning the day and so on. This is a big part of getting a long-term solution and not just a quick fix that most apps have today, plus it makes people come back to your app. \n3. Make it cheap and afforable. Headspace and therapy apps today are expensive as f\\*\\*k and most students cant afford paying 15 USD per month for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are just some quick thoughts but feel free to send a PM or an email at [david@sndstrom.com](mailto:david@sndstrom.com) i\u00b4ll be more than willing to help out.",
