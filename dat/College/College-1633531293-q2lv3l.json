  "text": "I was told before that you shouldn\u2019t put interests in your resume, but I\u2019ve been reading some advice that says otherwise. For big companies such as boeing, NASA, etc, people say keyword interests are key to get past the initial scanning when getting hired. Are these the only times where it\u2019s okay to include an \u201cinterests\u201d section on your resume to put some keywords from the job description?",

      "text": "You can put interests to fill your resume up and show your potential in that field. Once you have enough job experience that\u2019s usually the first thing to go. For example I had some interests (analog/RF engineering) that was like one line, but now that I have actual experience in that field it\u2019s 1) not necessary and 2) wasting space legitimate work can fill in. Also stating your interests narrows your market/malleability, so if you care about Electrical Engineering but don\u2019t exactly know what to do, don\u2019t specify analog design until you know that\u2019s what you want to do",

              "text": "Yes, but also you\u2019ll probably be applying to hundreds of positions, so it\u2019s much easier to just send one good resume versus multiple less good ones. And it\u2019s also kind of disingenuous to change your interests based on where you apply, as they\u2019ll assume your interests are your top interests if it\u2019s on your resume. Also your multiple resumes may have you running thin on important things to have. Better to concentrate your achievements on one document, it\u2019s highly unlikely at this point in your career you\u2019ll have so much varying experience to fill multiple resumes if that makes sense. Less filler > tailoring your resume to the position",

Shouldn\u2019t interests be a line or two max, so changing these wouldn\u2019t really affect the resume that much since 99% of the resume would be the same? Are you saying I should be putting the interests in a different format than I think?\n\nThank you for all the help so far!",

Changing only interests between resumes is pretty unnecessary, if you\u2019re interested in the position that\u2019s why you applied (I hope). If you have 4 important projects across 4 disciplines, better to have one sheet of all 4 than 4 sheets of 1/4 value and 3/4 filler if that makes sense",
