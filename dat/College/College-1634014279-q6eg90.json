  "text": "I'm majoring in Engineering and I'm working on a part time job that spits out $900/month, but even then I still don't have enough to pay for tuition. I had to borrow half of it from my parents (which is around $3k every semester). So far I'm not in college debt but I feel shitty for taking money from mom and dad. I'm a senior and I still live with parents, so that might be even more shame since they cover some of my necessities. Should I take a few years off to make more money?",

Don\u2019t let that negativity they\u2019re putting on situation take you away from a good opportunity in life . It\u2019s YOUR life and YOUR future . Take advantage",
