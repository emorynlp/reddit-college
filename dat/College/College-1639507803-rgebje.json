  "text": " Hi. I am a student who lives in Canada. I am currently taking the final test for this 3rd semester and am almost done. My question is: *Is GPA matter when looking for a job?* Right now, my GPA is around 3.3 or maybe 3.2 (if I did badly on the test). My program is Library and Information Technician. I am nervous because I heard that a job related to business needs to have a little higher GPA (when putting a resume). I also heard that most of them wouldn't care, but I want some opinions here. Thx.",

      "text": "Honestly, as far as I know, no one in Canada actually gives a shit about GPA - that seems more like an American thing, but I can't speak for them. I have a 3.8 GPA and the general response is usually \"so?\" So I would say don't really worry about it. BUT I also don't know much about Library and Information Technology as far as the job field, so I would probably take my response with a grain of salt.",
