  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman at community college looking to go into MIS or finance after I transfer to university and I finished my first semester with a 3.5. My goal was a 3.8 and I\u2019m a little down about that but how good is a 3.5. I know my GPA is gonna change and I want it to get higher",
