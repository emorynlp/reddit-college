  "text": "Have two options to take CS/math courses from two different community colleges online.\n\nOne is Foothill college in California and they offer courses in a 12 week quarterly format.\n\nThe other school is Oakton in Illinois which offers 16 week semesters (like what I am used to).\n\nDoes the 12 week imply they\u2019re more intense? Thinking of taking two courses per semester while working a full time office job.\n\nAny insight is appreciated!",

      "text": "From my experience, 8 week classes are very intense, but 12 and 16 week classes aren\u2019t bad at all. Obviously the 12 will be faster, but it won\u2019t feel different overall unless the class is a hard one like calculus",

      "text": "Typically, the shorter the class is, the more intense it is. I did the semester system at junior college at 16 weeks then transferred to a quarter system for university at 10 weeks. I definitely felt the pressure with that change. They still have to cover the same material, so it is just spread out differently.",
