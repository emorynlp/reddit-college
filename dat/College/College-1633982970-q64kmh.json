  "text": "hello reddit,\n\nRecently, I began my freshman year at college. I was placed in triple with two roommates who briefly met over the summer.  we have since bonded together.  however, one of the roommates has been following the other around like a puppy, eating the same foods as him, etc.  So you see our dilemma.  We are worried that if someone said something to him, he would take it the wrong way and freak out.   \nWe live with him, and want to preserve the friendship, but also want to distance ourselves from him, at least to the point where he does not follow us regardless of his own intentions.  For example, he often joins us to smoke weed outside even though it is obvious he does not enjoy it.  any advice is appreciated, even if you are not an expert.  thanks in advance!",

      "text": "Well I think you should tell him he can come out to hang out while you smoke but that he doesn\u2019t have to smoke if he doesn\u2019t want to. I get the feeling that he lacks confidence in being himself thus shying away from opportunities where he should draw his boundaries. But you should show him that you would like him still even if he was a bit different than you and develops his own interests.\n\nAnd further encourage him if you hear him talk about something he\u2019s interested in. And just be honest that sometimes you both need to do your own thing, even away from the other roommate. A lot of college when you attend at a young age is about discovering who you are and where your boundaries are, and learning that people will still like you regardless.",
