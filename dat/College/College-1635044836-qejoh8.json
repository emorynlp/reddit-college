  "text": "I\u2019m not the best nor the worst at math. It would be a 3 1/2 week, 4 hours per day, and 4 days a week. This is a important course for my major so I hope to have a pretty good understanding of calculus. I wouldn\u2019t be taking any other courses at the time. Does this course sound like academic suicide or doable?",

Personally it takes me a bit of time to grasp mathematical concepts so the idea of it sounds terrifying to me, but with the right study habits and commitment you could make it work.",

      "text": "I did that for calc 1,2, and 3. It\u2019s definitely possible BUT prepare to have no life outside of class/hw/ and studying. I mean it. It\u2019s incredibly rigorous and you will be stressed out all the time, but surprisingly it was also really helpful in learning the information. Focusing solely on one subject for an extended period of time worked out pretty well for me in terms of remembering the material afterwards. So if you\u2019re okay with that and are fine with committing your whole day to Calculus then go for it!",

      "text": "I think it would be okay. From what you learn in Calc 1 class, there are really only a half dozen concepts that you really need to remember. The first 2 units of calc 1 is all just foundational concepts to explain how derivatives work and when derivatives actually apply. If you're going into a STEM field that uses a lot of calculus, my guess is that most of the time you'll worry less about if or how the calculus works, but just that you can take a derivative or understand how functions related through derivatives and integrals.",

I'm doing a standard one semester Calc 1 class rn. Be prepared to spend a LOT of time on HW and studying and to have no life outside of that for the 3 and a half weeks. If it's that valuable to you, then that sacrifice should be okay, especially since it's under a month. \n\nGood luck my friend!",
