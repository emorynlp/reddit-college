  "text": "Hi, I am currently on the first year of my teaching degree in Sweden and I was warned that it includes a lot of group work throughout the whole degree.\n\nAnd the first month and a half, it was alright! We were in groups and worked together during seminars and at the end of the seminar, we got to explain what we learned and had a bigger project towards the end of the courses.\n\nBut I am currently on my third course and the professor gives us two group projects a week that we are supposed to present as a 15 minute power point at the next seminar.\n\nHe also talks the entire 3 hour seminars so we don't get any time to work with the group while the subject is still fresh on our minds.\n\nWe have two presentations a week, Tuesday and Thursday. So when he gives us a project on Tuesday, we are supposed to present it on Thursday and then we're given the weekend and Monday to finish the other presentation to Tuesday.\n\nI'm finding it very very hard to keep up with it all since I am working and taking care of my sick grandpa, which gives me very little time to meet up with my group several times a week.\n\nI find that my group gets a little bit annoyed by the fact that I cant meet up a lot either, but they all live in the same city as the college and I live 70 minutes away with train and bus so it takes a big chunk out of my day to even go in on days that dont have seminars.\n\nIs this a normal college experience or is it some anomaly in the amount of work we're supposed to put in?\n\nAlso has anyone else had issues like mine and ideas to maybe make it all work? \n\nThank you.",
