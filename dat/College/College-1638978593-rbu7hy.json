  "text": "This may sound like a dumb question but I'm honestly unsure. I'm thinking of majoring in computer science. I have absolutely no general ed classes left, I completed them all. All I have is major-related classes. Would taking 5 per semester be way too much to handle? It's the only way to completed it all in 2 and a half years. If I only took, say, 3 a semester, it would take me over 4 more years, because there's 26 classes to take total I think, though I'll probably talk to someone from the school to make sure I calculated that right. I also have to take a year off for personal reasons, so that means by the time I'm all done, I'd be 26 with that time line.. that seems a little too late to me. \n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "With a career like computer science, I wouldn't worry too much about your ability to pay off debt in the future, so length doesn't matter in that sense. But if you graduate faster, not only is that less student loan debt but also an extra year or two of full time salary, which is probably at least 60k/yr if not more. So ask yourself, is a little bit of relaxation/sanity worth 100k opportunity cost to you? And exactly how would a crazy course load affect you, especially knowing that CS classes are often project based and require the discipline to stay up with the deadlines?\n\nThe on paper answer is to graduate faster, and 5 classes (15-ish credits) isn't so bad. I had plenty of semesters where I had 12 credits of engineering plus one general, and half the time the generals had silly group projects or crazy amounts of busywork and took just as long.",
