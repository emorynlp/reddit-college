  "text": "Alright, so to start I just turned 25. A relative passed away and knew I wanted to go to back to school, and I was left a small amount of cash. I\u2019m planning on re-attending my local community college, but I\u2019m straight up terrified of my college history. I have a TON of withdrawals from about 2 years ago. Basically I thought I could do school living by myself during covid and it did not work whatsoever. After being laid off and then evicted, I  withdrew from a full course load on back to back semesters, and was then placed on academic suspension. I love learning, and I want to help people. I\u2019m trying to earn a social work degree but I\u2019m worried the admins at this school either won\u2019t let me back, or if I earn a degree here I\u2019m scared I wouldn\u2019t be able to transfer to another school. Any thoughts? Am I overthinking?",
