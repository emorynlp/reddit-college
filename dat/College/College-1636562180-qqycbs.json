      "text": "I love the class, but to be fair i\u2019m studying econ as a minor.  It\u2019s one of those classes where you\u2019re definitely gonna wanna study a lot and review.  Most of the questions you\u2019ll get on exams and such are gonna ask you to compute things like longterm economic growth, etc, so make sure to pay close attention to how your professor tells you to solve problems.  The conceptial stuff is also super important, but most of that stuff just kinda makes sense, so if you think through things logically you should be fine.  Like obviously if interest rates go up companies are going to do less investment type of logic.\n\nIdk if you\u2019ve taken microeconomics, but personally i found macro soooo much easier",

      "text": "Macroeconomics isn't bad if you just study a bit and learn the terms, the majority of it is just common sense and a little critical thinking to solve most problems like \"If the demand for X complementary item increases, what happens to item Y?\" or or how much an item bought in the past cost in current currency. Microeconomics was much more challenging.",

      "text": "It was harder than micro, honestly because I\u2019d mix up inflation and interest rates in my head sometimes, no joke haha. But it\u2019s also very similar to micro. Drawing supply and demand graphs, and then doing some other stuff. So you\u2019ll be fine long as you make sure you understand the concepts. Once you do, it\u2019s incredibly simple",

A lot of terms and little things. Ugh \n\nI guess I just have ZERO interest in the subject. Can\u2019t wait for this semester to be over lol\n\nMicroeconomics is more interesting, in my opinion.",
