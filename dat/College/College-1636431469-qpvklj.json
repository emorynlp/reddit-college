  "text": "I currently have a 2.57 as a second semester sophomore / first semester junior (skipped a semester but may be able to catch up). I\u2019m in 18 credit hours currently (6 classes at 3 credits a piece). Currently have a solid B average this semester but grades seem to be steadily increasing. Aiming for all A\u2019s by Christmas. What\u2019s the highest GPA I can get this semester and/or by graduation?",

      "text": "I\u2019m feeling real lazy, so I\u2019m going to make some broad assumptions and call it a night\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re at 54 credit hours completed, roughly enough to be second semester Sophomore but also a Junior. And just to make my life easier, each class was 3 credit and you got a 2.57 in all of them(do the calculation if you want a good estimate). \n\nAssuming you need a total of 120 hours to graduate, you have 120 - 54 = 66 hours left. Assuming you get a 4.0 for all 66 hours, then you can get a 3.36 GPA.\n\nMath I did: \n\n(54 * 2.57 + 66 * 4.0)/120\n\nProper math:\n\nSummation of: (credit hours * grade)/120",

      "text": "Okay so my GPA was about 2.4 when I had 6 classes left (24 credits), I managed to graduate with a 3.2 GPA and that was with most my classes being passed at a C average and some classes I got a high B. You should be able to graduate with a GPA above 3 especially if you keep the B average with a couple As.",
