  "text": "Not sure if I can continue this semester any longer. Mind is exploding. I\u2019m past the 60% point of the semester but how bad would I\u2019d be if I academically withdrew with the national guard supplemental grant that pays my tuition? From my research I\u2019ve seen if I\u2019m past the 60% I have earned my grants but I\u2019m really not too sure. I wanna transfer to another school closer to home. I hate it here.",
