  "text": "Hello, My name is Carlos Antonio D\u00edaz Guerrero, I\u2019m a 5th semester student from the Anthropology career from the School of Political and Social Sciences in the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM in Spanish) and I\u2019m carrying out a poll for the final project of the class named \u201cSocioanthroplogic methods and techniques II\u201d, If you are a university or college student in the USA (doesn\u2019t matter if you are foreigner as long as you study in the USA) it would help me a lot if you can gift me 5 minutes of your time to answer the poll and/or share the poll with other University/college students.\n\nThis poll would only be used for the final project of my class, it does not ask for personal information and the results would not be published in any way, the results would be purely academic.\n\nWithout further to say the link to the Poll is the following: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScy27y8hNw59pnlnyR7qZxbCc6-CXZnw6alno89wHxfGvU\\_YA/viewform?usp=pp\\_url](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScy27y8hNw59pnlnyR7qZxbCc6-CXZnw6alno89wHxfGvU_YA/viewform?usp=pp_url)\n\nIf you have any question about the poll let me know in the comments and I\u2019ll be glad to answer.",
