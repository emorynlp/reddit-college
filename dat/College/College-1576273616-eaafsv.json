History is written by the victor, and companies like apple work hard to get their products put in school textbooks so they are associated with high quality and being better than the competition. Problems don't nessacarily mean \"this sucks\" but sometimes can mean \"this can be done better\", but that requires a deep understanding of processes and products. \n\nBut, back to your earlier point the touch screen was evolutionary. The phones that came before could use a stylus to do exactly what you could use your fingers for later on. That, plus the simpler and more intuitive UI make the iPhone innovative. After gen 1 they basically just got faster, better cameras, and got better battery life. \n\nIn my opinion, this is a really good opportunity to look at iteration vs revolution. Innovation is more iterative vs revolutionary, at least for most things  3d printing is one example of revolution. It brought additive manufacturing to the forefront and made prototyping a lot of things far easier and has allowed for innovation in how things are made. But, when we look at phones, again, motion activated features (like the Android camera or flashlight) are iterative since they had an on board gyroscope already for the screen rotation. It was an iteration of the user interface to  take advantage of existing technology to solve a problem (how can I take a photo quickly or see in the dark?). \n\nI've tried Innovating in a few areas, and honestly you fuck it up more times than not. Especially for process related idea. I've learned that to make a serious positive change you need to understand a problem. Otherwise it's just solution looking for a problem. As I've gotten older I have become more wary of new ideas, as often the juice isn't worth the squeeze. The old way may have huge flaws, but is a marginal improvement worth retraining users and the associated costs?",
