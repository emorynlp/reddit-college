  "text": "I've had this feeling since the beginning of this semester. I'm 19 and in my junior year of college. I'm in my college's business school, after having transferred internally at the end of my last semester. I was previously studying French, and that was exciting to me. But French doesn't pay the bills, and I'm a first-generation American with no wealth to rely upon as a cushion.\n\nMy grades are basically perfect, I can't complain there. But my classes just bore the *everliving hell* out of me; it is becoming increasingly harder to get myself to do the work. I still do it, but I don't do it happily. It's a lot of work, but that's not my issue. I enjoy doing work if I find it stimulating, but this class work is easy and mind-numbingly boring. It feels insulting to me.\n\nI also just think that I don't think that I want to *do* business for the rest of my life. The concept fills me with dread: five days a week, for the rest of my life, making enough money to retire at 60, but still doing something I'd absolutely loathe. I'm a naturally creative person, I speak four languages, I want to spend the rest of my life going around the world and learning languages (I speak 4 languages, and am trying to learn a fifth) or at least do something creative, like writing, videomaking, etc... but that doesn't pay the bills. Ideally, I'd be able to travel the world and just learn languages, but that also does not pay the bills.\n\nMy school is also in the middle of bumfuck nowhere; I am somebody who loves city life, because there's so much to do. Everything in the area around my school, however, closes at 2 AM, and everybody goes to the same two or three bars (because there's nowhere else to go), and it's gotten so boring going there too.\n\nI think I might just want to transfer colleges, it's something I've been considering for a long time but never did because I didn't want to make my friends sad, so I chickened out of it at the last moment last semester, when it would've been timely. I do though, have the grades to go to a top university. I could get challenged there and meet some interesting people from other countries, or even from around the US. My college doesn't have that... it's all just people from my state. Transferring though, as a junior, seems so scary to do, because I'd have to take a year off of school, elsewise I'd just be wasting my money taking the very classes I hate. At the same time though, the desire to transfer feels like me just chasing pedigree... I am just genuinely so conflicted.\n\nPlease help me out here, I really don't know what to do. It's just gotten so boring for me.",
