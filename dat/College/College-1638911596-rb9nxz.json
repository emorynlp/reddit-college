  "text": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m new to this subreddit but I was hoping somebody here would have an answer to my question. So I am taking 2 classes, one writing class and a public speaking class, and for the final for both classes we are allowed to pick our topic. I chose the same topic for both, and turned in the final for Writing already. The Writing final is an essay and the public speaking is a presentation, so I was hoping I could just take the best parts of my essay and turn it into a presentation. I\u2019m not sure if that would be considered self-plagiarism though and I don\u2019t want to get kicked out for academic dishonesty. Anybody know if this would count as plagiarism?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice everyone! I emailed both professors and got approval from both, so long as I don\u2019t just copy paste it.",

      "text": "I would highly highly recommend lots of paraphrasing, and of course make sure you cite all your original sources. It\u2019s not a problem to use the same topics, but make sure you are applying the concepts you learned from research to BOTH and not just transferring from essay to presentation. Just making sure you\u2019re not copying blocks of text is the main thing, but to be extra safe I\u2019d recommend even slightly changing your approach to the topic if that makes sense. Good luck!",
