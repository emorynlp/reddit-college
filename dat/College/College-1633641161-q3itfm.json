She's also not getting along with her roommate(and friends).What are her options?",

If by money invested you mean scholarships directly from the school then it's just a loss you will have to take. Direct deposits are also non-refundable so no use in sticking around then.",

I know plans don\u2019t always happen as we want them to, but at least there\u2019s a foundation that we lay out for ourselves. \n\nBest of luck to her!",
