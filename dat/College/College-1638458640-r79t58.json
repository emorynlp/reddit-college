  "text": "So I have a 63 in a&p. I need 7 points for a 70. He does give extra credit for notecards & doing our connects. Which our connects are only worth 1 exam (IDK WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT IS!) I really want to know what I would need on my final (which is 15% of our grade) to make atleast a 68 in the class. Because if we\u2019re close he said he will round it up a point or two. I did have a discussion with him and asked what do I need to pass and his response was \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s better to fail than to barely pass\u201d I\u2019m freaking out.",

      "text": "You know, he has a point. Your knowledge of anatomy and physiology (you can make fun of me if that's not what a&p stands for) does not end with this course. That you're trying to skate by on generous rounding--a whole 2 points!--means you have not demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the material for future courses, and it sounds like your professor agrees. He's trying to spare you further stress.\n\nYou may have to take an L in this course, and that's okay, but I hope you're able to study hard, get a good grade, and pass regardless. If not, at least you'll be more prepared to retake the course.",

But what brought my grade down to a 63 in the first place was the lab portion not the lecture and lecture is definitely way harder than lab. I\u2019m doing better than I did the first time because I was averaging like 40s and 50s the first time. This second time around I was averaging 75s & 80s. I just hate having to do it all over again.",

I think most people take it for nursing and don't they use this for the gpa. I know people in my class dropping it with a B. I assume you connect grade(mcgraw textbook) is already factored in.",
