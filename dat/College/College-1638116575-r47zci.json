  "text": "I\u2019m a nursing student in an 18 month program so I\u2019m curious as to what type of loan I should get. To give context, I live at home with my parents and currently work at a state facility this semester due to our clinicals being eliminated due to Covid. These two upcoming semesters will each be 20 units so I won\u2019t have time for my normal 40hr work weeks. I\u2019m not sure how to go about this, but I do know that I\u2019m not going to be working since I don\u2019t want myself to be stressed about money or classes. I also live in California the cost of living is higher than normal.\nThanks for the possible help.",

      "text": "How much money do you need per semester and for how many semesters?\n\nUsually starting by taking out federal subsidized loans is the best bet. If you need more you can use federal unsubsidized. It is pretty unlikely you would get anywhere near maxing both out as long as you are at a state school.\n\nYour parents can also take out a loan from their retirement account without penalty as long as it is for educational expenses. You would pay them back directly and the incentive is no interest. This is a good option but less commonplace because not everyone has that amount of money in a 401k and is willing to loan it to their dependent.",

I need a certain amount (roughly 20k) since I help out my parents with bills and to pay for my traveling expenses to the clinical locations that my school needs me to attend. I\u2019m going to look into a subsidized loan and go from there. I\u2019m guaranteed a job at a few mental facilities since there\u2019s a shortage of psychiatric nurses so I\u2019m not worried about paying it back",

The remainder can be unsubsidized.\n\nSubsidized means it won't start accruing interest until after graduation. Unsubsidized starts accruing when you take it. Both subsidized and unsubsidized have a relatively low interest rate (I think it's around 4%). You will probably pay a little under $3k in interest over the life of those loans if you pay them back in 5 years. Much less if you hit it in the first year or two after graduating.",
