  "text": "Hello, everyone! So yeah finals week is in 4 days (I'm a sophomore). I haven't paid attention to my lectures in about 1 month a half. I just thought that I can walk through college with bad study habits (Please study well, don't be like me), well that didn't go well LOL. \n\nI'm on the brink of being kicked out of my program (Engineering) and I don't know what to feel, I just feel like a disgrace cause this one professor keep on calling me out and making fun of my excuse letters in the class. She even tells the class to call me 2 hours before an exam to make sure I'm not asleep or anything. Man, I'm tired of this environment. Life here sucks. I can't even do anything cause people will say that's her style.\n\nI've undergone some therapy sessions with my our counselor recently. It helped me realized that I'm not for this field, or maybe I just gave up too early? I don't know\n\nI'm planning on shifting my major to another field that is not really related to science anymore. I feel like my personality does not belong here. I like to network, I like to socialize and connect with people. Good thing I made good friends while I'm still here. However, I just don't see myself going down this career path.  \n\n\nIs shifting the right decision? Thanks guys",

      "text": "Hey if it\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s not for you. Consider a different major like CS for example. CS is more application based than theoretical. Even if you do bad cs classes you have a good chance of finding work. I noticed that you are Filipino and reside in the Philippines. Perhaps you can do CS and find employment in another country.",
