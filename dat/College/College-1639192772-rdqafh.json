  "text": "This is a weird question to ask, but does anyone else have the problem that they\u2019re not smart at all, but instead they\u2019re just really strong mentally and high motivated to push through hard times? Like, I\u2019m in computer science which I think is difficult, but I have always struggled with reading, writing, history, math, science, whatever\u2026 but the only reason I pass my classes is because I pull all-nighters even for the easiest assignments and just forget everything I learned a week later (I almost failed intro to psychology which had an average 98%). I\u2019m not even kidding, my watch has tracked my sleep since freshman year, and I have averaged 4-5 hours sleep all 4 four years. And I\u2019m not even getting great grades which sucks because I always think it\u2019s not worth it; like 3.0 at a #17 public school. Like, I\u2019ve ran a half iron man with absolutely no training the month prior to the race because I just do things even if it hurts me. Then again, I was in the hospital afterwards, but I mean, I finished.  \n\nPlease, are there others like me out there? I\u2019m scared I\u2019m special and will fail in life.",

I feel like shit the next morning until I nap! \n\nI am comp sci major! I am less smart than all peers! I am in bottom tier of two math courses required! but, I did not withdraw! I am continuing to go! and, I forget everything next week, as you do! \n\nit is not good to go on this way though! find study habits! I don't know what I will do, but it will likely involve flashcards and looking at solutions to many problems like the ones on my homework!",

I know a person that is extremely smart, but SO unmotivated. As a result of that, he is struggling with most of his classes. \n\n\nStay tough! You are not alone!",

      "text": "Yea I think I fit this. I am also in a computer related major but not super smart by any means. I have one Professor this semester really giving me a headache. He purposely makes his programming assignments complex and convoluted (almost at an attempt to weed out students) While being frustrated with one of his challenging assignments, I told myself (and my gf) that I\u2019d pass the class no matter what and that failing was NOT an option (plus I need this class as a prereq for others next semester). Long story short, I managed to figure out how he wants things done and now I\u2019m on track to finishing with an A. Having a strong mindset definitely helps during tough classes even if you aren\u2019t the smartest like I am.",

      "text": "I consider myself mentally tough... I'm much smarter than I give myself credit for though. \n\nI never got \"great\" grades in high school. Overall my average was in the 70s and I had to study 2x as hard as most of my peers to get those grades. Life was just harder for me.  \n\nI remember in my 1st year or university I was sitting at 75% average. By the time I graduated in my 4th year I was sitting at above 90% average. Each year I slowly increased my overall average. I NEVER pulled an all nighter the entire 4 years and averaged 6-7 hours of sleep per night. I graduated with honors and awards, and landed a job straight out of university. I worked my ass off the entire time. I was humble and took any and ALL help available from teachers and peers and it paid off. \n\nTo me \"mentally tough\" means determined, persistent and reliable in the face of obstacles. But I know this definition might be different for everyone, but that's what it means to me.",
