Freshman year is honestly about finding your balance. Try and find a good study group and set designated times for homework and studying. If you need a break, take one, but sticking to a schedule where you actually get a chunk of work done will help keep you on track, even if that time ends up being late at night or early in the morning. I personally found 5 hour energies to be my best friend during especially hard and long late nights.",

I got some of my worst test grades my first year and am standing with a solid GPA and really great class work as an almost senior now! Don\u2019t knock yourself down for not performing the way you expected when you didn\u2019t have anything to compare it to in the first place! I would take this as an opportunity to learn what study styles help YOU. You go up from here!",
