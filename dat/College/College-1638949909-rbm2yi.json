  "text": "So I\u2019ve been apart of some pretty shitty group projects in college, but this one takes the cake.\n\nSuper easy class. No tests, no homework, it\u2019s all discussion-based with one individual presentation (20% of your grade), and 2 team presentations (40% of your grade each). \n\nNot to sound like *that* guy, but I\u2019m used to being a leader in my groups. I like to take charge, but I respect that everyone different styles of working and learning as well as personal lives. I try encourage everyone to participate fairly and evenly and usually give people the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWith this project, there were 4 total members (including myself). We\u2019ll call the other A, B, and C. B and C were not pulling their fair share from the get-go. They were evidently serial procrastinators who didn\u2019t do any bit more than they were asked to do (and sometimes not even that). They showed no initiative and it felt like I was begging them to put together this first project that was worth 40% of our grade. I have my own life too obviously, but when it came time to putting the finishing touches on everything and having to practice the presentation before we had to present, it didn\u2019t seem like they gave a shit about my time. They finally finished their first attempts at around 10 the night before we had to present, which left us practicing until midnight.  \n\nThis bothered me on so many levels. I completed my work weeks earlier and had to wait around for them all to finish so we could practice. They were completely disrespectful to my personal time and what\u2019s worse is they didn\u2019t see a problem with it. All of this to get an 80 on this presentation. I was livid.\n\nI reached out to our professor for help and he suggested practicing more (yeah, I tried), setting meeting times monthly to keep each other accountable, and set deadlines for the work for the next project so we wouldn\u2019t be doing everything at the last minute.\n\nWith his great advice, I decided to set up a document outlining tasks that needed to be done as well as dates they needed to be done by (the first task being due 3 weeks from that date). I sent it out to the team and let everyone choose which tasks they wanted.\n\nAfter a few days of me reminding everyone to choose their tasks, everything was finally laid out. Each task took about 20 minutes to complete, and we only had to choose 3 each. Piece of cake, right? WRONG!\n\nI checked in with the team the days leading up to our \u201cdue dates\u201d for our tasks. Checkpoint 1 went well; everyone finished their first parts. But at checkpoint 2, members B and C weren\u2019t responding. Crickets for weeks.\n\nBy Checkpoint 3, only member A & I had finished all of our parts. I decided to message her and ask to talk, where we both revealed we did not believe members B & C were pulling their fair share. At this point, we banded together to try to finish the project as best we could.\n\nAfter weeks of silence and another email to my professor, he suggested I communicate a hard deadline. If they didn\u2019t do their work by that date, he said that A & I should do our best to finish the project and note their absence on our peer reviews.\n\nWeeks later, we met on a Monday where I communicated a deadline of Friday for all of our work. This was several weeks past the original deadlines so they had even more time to complete their work. We had the day off that Wednesday and Thursday, so this left plenty of time to finish their tasks.\n\nAfter several unanswered texts in our group message, I decided I had had enough. I wasn\u2019t their parent, I was their peer. I texted A and we decided to finish the remaining work.\n\nThe day before the presentation, surely enough B & C are rushing trying to help finish their parts. It was too late. We presented and it was evident A & I were the only ones who made significant contributions.\n\nOn our peer reviews, we outlined all of the above and gave them low marks.\n\nOur grades were released today. I\u2019m assuming member B realized they got a low grade and messaged me about it, that they assumed I gave them bad marks and asking why I would do that. They continued telling me they did their fair share and any remarks I gave were false. They said they\u2019d go to the professor to discuss it and it sounded oddly like they were trying to intimidate me.\n\nWhat should I do? I\u2019m so tired of this class; my grade is final and I\u2019m perfectly happy with it. I did the group project basically with A alone. I know the truth and can back it all up, but I don\u2019t feel the need to explain this to B. What\u2019s the right call here? I feel like they\u2019ll keep harassing me or the professor until their grade is changed. I don\u2019t want anymore part in this conflict. I just wanted to hold them accountable for their own actions. Help! \n\nTL;DR: My group member who did nothing all semester is pestering me asking why they got such a bad grade and is threatening to go to the professor to contest it. Even though I know I did nothing wrong, the confrontation is making me nervous. I want no part in this. What should I do",

      "text": "It\u2019s honestly not your problem anymore. As you said, the grades are final now. B student can talk to the professor but you communicated the issue repeatedly throughout the time period. B just has to face the consequences of their actions which is sometimes that they need to be a better team player.\n\nReally, just hope you never have classes with them again. Don\u2019t respond to their messages, see how they like it. Let the teacher and uni deal with the student. If they actually harass you, file a report but otherwise, out of sight out of mind. Congrats on the good grade!",
