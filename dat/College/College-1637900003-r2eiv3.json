  "text": "Ok so I received a pell grant for my community college. My question is will I be able to get books and a laptop with whatever left I don\u2019t use for the semester?? I can\u2019t afford books and I need a laptop for my classes. Also I\u2019m a single mom so I kind need daycare too and my college offers daycare for full time students. Can I use my pell grant to help pay for that as well or no?? I don\u2019t really know the logistics of all this so any help would be great",

I can't speak on the daycare aspect, but someone at the college (financial aid department for sure, possibly the daycare department though they just make send you to financial aid to cover themselves) would know the answer to that for sure.",
