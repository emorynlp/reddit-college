  "text": "hey everyone! i\u2019m currently a high school senior or in my last year in secondary school if that makes any sense. i\u2019m planning on going to the university of Brighton in the UK. it\u2019s pretty expensive compared to my college of choice in my state but i really want to get out of the US. \nmy state college is only around $10,000 dollars including tuition, dorm room, meal plan, and books per year. the university of brighton is around \u00a313,500 pounds just for tuition. the cheapest housing i could find was \u00a3500 per month. i just don\u2019t know how i\u2019m going to afford it without going into major debt.\nif anyone is an international student and can give me any tips weather it\u2019s scholarships, housing advice, jobs that help with tuition or even jobs that pay well over there, that would be so helpful! thanks so much!",

Look at what school fits you best academically.\n\nAnd you can be on your parents' health insurance until you're 26 (not saying US healthcare is better, but is it really worth all that student debt?).\n\nYou could always study abroad too.",
