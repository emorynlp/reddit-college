  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman and recently caught covid. I\u2019m not sure if professors typically grant extensions for assignments when it comes to this kind of thing, and I\u2019m falling behind in bio because I\u2019ve been too sick to do enough work every day. Am I fucked? Is there anything I can do to get my grade up if profs don\u2019t grant extensions?",

      "text": "Considering it\u2019s covid, you should be able to email your professor written proof of a positive result and discuss extensions. Even with other illness, a form of documentation is usually helpful as well. \n\nDo they have a late/extension policy in their syllabus? Make sure to check first and then email them! I\u2019m not sure if I got extremely lucky with all my professors, but most have been fairly accommodating for work or illness issues as long as you\u2019re upfront and honest and show you\u2019re making a valiant attempt at keeping up with the course materials.\n\nGood luck!",

Like definitely reference that you\u2019ve read the syllabus and are aware that dates are final, but that you\u2019ve been very much unable to function. I do hope they\u2019re willing to adjust things for you, I can\u2019t imagine being a stickler for due dates when a student has the illness that caused a friggin global pandemic \ud83d\ude44",

Was it given to you 2 weeks ago and you tested positive yesterday and it\u2019s due tomorrow, then no they\u2019re not giving you an extension because you had two weeks. If it was assigned the day you tested positive and due in 4 days, yeah with documentation they should be flexible",
