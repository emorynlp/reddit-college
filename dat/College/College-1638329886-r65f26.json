  "text": "Hello, so we have an online class that has open note open book tests. We can use the book, our notes, and the slides and recourses the Professor provides. The Professor has also posted multiple quizzes and exams with their answers from previous semesters in the files folder on canvas. Some students couldn\u2019t find these files so I downloaded them from the canvas page and put them in the group chat for our class so people could access to it. But now I got an email that I was reported for cheating because of this. Is downloading files provided by the Professor and giving them to your classmates if they can\u2019t find it cheating??",

      "text": "presumably the professor does not have access to the files you uploaded, so the prof doesnt know you didn't edit them to include answers or whatever. or perhaps the professor doesn't even know what the files are, and all the professor has are screenshots of \"file123123123.pdf\" of the chat log. So the professor probably doesn't yet know if you really posted stuff from class or if you are cheating. that is why you are getting roped in.\n\ngenerally how academic dishonesty accusations work is first they identify and accuse everyone involved (because they dont know yet who is the cheater and who is not, they just have a really strong hunch). THEN they talk with everyone, get everyone's stories, dig deeper into the evidence, and anyone who was not cheating is cleared.\n\nSo after professor talks with you, you show chat log, press the file link to download, then professor sees it's all the same.\n\nof course, you are legally (as matter of law, not just school code of conduct) not authorized to disseminate the professor's (the university's) intellectual property. it probably falls under a reason for discipline in the student code of conduct (\"distributed course materials, not limited to but including exam, projects, blah blah blah\"). so you can still be in trouble for that, even if you didn't cheat.",
