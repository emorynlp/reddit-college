  "text": "Hello, \nAnyone else going to college a bit later in life (im 23) having issues with getting your age of study kind a poked at? I'm an af vet and now a sophmore cs major and all classes I'm getting picked on by these kids. I'm a pretty stable guy, but it's getting on my nerves a bit and making me feel a bit self conscious, idk lol. Anyone else dealing with this?  ( this is a bigger university btw ) \n\nId like to know im not the only vet or student still here after life steers you away for a bit.",

I am sorry that some people are giving you a hard time. If they are making negative comments to you about your age, vet status, etc. within the bounds of a formal university environment (i.e., in class, in an organization, on a group chat, and so on), then they may be violating university policy in doing so.",
