  "title:": "Is a Dual Degree in Engineering and Business worth an extra year?",
  "text": "I'm currently in my first year of a 5 year long Dual Degree Program in which I'll receive a BEng in Computer Science & BBA in either of Management, Finance, Economics or Marketing(haven't decided yet). My primary interest is in Computer Science but I am quite interested in Business as well and starting a tech company is one of my long term goals. Graduation with a single degree requires 120 credits and with a Dual Degree requires around 170 credits. I've received 25 transfer credits from my high school curriculum and so I have a possibility of completing the Dual Degree in 4 years if I take courses every winter and summer. If I did the single degree however I could graduate in 4 years taking less credits per semester than the norm or complete it in 3 years if I wanted to. Is the 1-2 extra years worth a Dual Degree? I am interested in Business and am enjoying my current business courses but I'm not sure if it's worth it or if I'd be better off dropping out of this program and doing a single Degree.\nAn added Pro of the Dual Degree Program is some specific courses only for students in the program, more networking opportunities, mentorship etc as well as the option of going to an extra semester abroad at another university (being able to do 2 semesters abroad rather than just 1) \n\nI'm quite unsure on whether I should stick to this program or not and would really appreciate some more insight.",
