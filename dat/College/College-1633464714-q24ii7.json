  "text": "I\u2019m so conflicted, my parents want to send me off to the UK for 4 years but I know from all of the discussions we did, there might be a financial strain if I do. (And they still insist I go)\n\nLess strain would be me doing the twinning program (2 years local and 2 years abroad)\n\nBoth are two different schools, the one in UK is Top 20, local is top 100. \n\nCost for the one in UK is about 4 times of the one in local. (For the same course)\n\nI\u2019m so confused, I\u2019ve always wanted to move/study abroad but logically it did not make sense if I were to just leave and put the finances at risk when I come back 4 years later.\n\nAhh, help! Any opinions on this? :/",
