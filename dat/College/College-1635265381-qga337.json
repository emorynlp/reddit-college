  "text": "I\u2019m not sure how to word this, so I\u2019ll just explain: my mother had a heart attack two weeks ago that left her in the hospital for 3 days. Since I\u2019m the only one living with her that can drive, that means that I had to drive her to and from the hospital. I knew I was going to miss 2 sessions of one of my classes, so I contacted that particular teacher a day in advance. She told me it was totally fine, nothing to worry about, etc. A few days ago, she has me wait till after class (all online) to tell me that I\u2019m going to be having 2 points taken off my overall grade for having missed these days. I told her that my mom had a heart attack (again), and she just said that there\u2019s no excuses. What can I do to get these points added back to my grade/get justice for this? How is this fair?",

Absences and points for those absences are usually at the sole discretion of the professor, but it all depends on institutional and departmental policies as to whether excused absences can override said discretion. As others have said, the dean of students may be able to help with documentation and advocacy, but they cannot do anything about grades or override a professor\u2019s decision. That occurs within the department.",

Since you have documentation of you communication with the professor, I don't expect there to be any difficulties.\n\nI would advise to be careful with your phrasing and tone. Professors are a prickly bunch and don't like being accused of doing something wrong. Words like 'unjust' will get people on the defensive. A better way of phrasing it is something along the lines of, \"The professor agreed to this, but now is not. I think they might have forgotten our conversation or made a mistake.\" Always give faculty some kind of 'it was all a mistake/misunderstanding' out. I know it can feel unjust, but it is how the game is played.\n\nIf for some reason things don't work out for you don't escalate the situation. Put a pin in it, finish the semester strong, and then see if your final grade was affected. Then raise the issue again.",
