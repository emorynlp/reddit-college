  "text": "Hello, I currently am studying PPE (Philosophy, Politics, economics) and I'm enjoying it very much, especially the fact that I study in an open University that allows me great flexibility (I can choose any number of courses from 1 to 5 in a semester, and the studying part is realy when I choose to do it).\n I am a person that loves studying, and I dream of also studying and getting management, psychology, law degrees and so on.. taking my own pace as much as my current and future career allows.\nStudying an entire degree in my country can be very cheap. would you continue to study various fields just for you own knowledge if you did not have to worry about financing it?",

I like learning and there are more classes that I want to take than I have room for in just one degree. I'm in bio but also really interested in history and geography, and my school also has some astronomy, sign language, and indigenous studies & language courses that I'd like to take. I don't know that I would necessarily do more degrees but maybe some certificates/diplomas? I learn much better in a class environment than on my own, and it would be nice to have done extra stuff on my resume.",

That said, if you spend some of your time during school developing side hustles or trying out various entrepreneurial ventures, that's the dream life IMHO.\n\nEDIT: even in a non-STEM or business field you can spend time creating a startup, even a non-profit. You could start a political polling company, or maybe a political newsletter, for example. Don't underestimate the amount you'll learn through work experience!",
