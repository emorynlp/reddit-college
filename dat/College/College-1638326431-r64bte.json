  "text": "(Disclaimer: I am not asking for *help* with my research paper, I have just read this sentence to myself so many times while questioning its clarity and I just want to make sure it sounds right.)\n\nI am writing a research paper about conformity and nonconformity in a novel I just read, and in my intro paragraph I included this sentence:\n\n\"It is no secret that at some point during their life, a child will implement boundary-testing behaviors in order to analyze the extent of which they can push said boundaries\". \n\nPlease help, I have procrastinated this all day and my brain is mush and I can't think",

Otherwise, there's nothing wrong with this sentence. It's a normal length and construction for scholarly prose.",
