  "text": "Hi. I\u2019m an undergrad student. So I\u2019ve been interested in a lab at my university for a while now. I contacted the PI during the summer and we had to postpone till the semester started. Since then I\u2019ve sat in on a couple lab meetings and I think I get along with everyone. The thing is that I said I was interested in the lab and said I\u2019d attend another lab meeting, which are usually on a specific day. They didn\u2019t send me the details for the meeting but just sent out a group email for the meeting without saying the time on a day that the meetings don\u2019t usually take place. Of course I saw the email too late and freaked out. I\u2019ve contacted the PI asking about meetings and updates again, but it\u2019s been a week since I\u2019ve emailed the PI and she still hasn\u2019t gotten back to me. She did send out a Happy Thanksgiving message in Slack though so I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s just not interested in having me anymore. I was so excited to join this lab and now I\u2019m just anxious and worried she\u2019s no longer interested in having me work in her lab. Should I email her again in case she hasn\u2019t seen the email?",
