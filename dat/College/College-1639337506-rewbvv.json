  "text": "If you know a better subreddit to post this in, let me know. I'll spare details but I didn't plan well and I have a pile of books (including some valuable textbooks) that I'd like to sell very quickly if I can. \n\nHad I more time, I could've gotten good value from Amazon or something, but at this point what I want, ideally is to ship/drop off all of them somwhere and get some cash. Of course I won't get full value getting rid so quickly, but what are my options? I'll check some local bookstores for sure",
