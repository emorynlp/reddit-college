  "title:": "No degree awarded due to professor not entering grades",
  "text": "This is an old situation but I deal with it every day. I finished all my degree requirements in spring 2021, was set to graduate and graduated. Come September I get a call from the university saying I need to apply for graduation again. I am confused and ask why if I\u2019ve already graduated. They say I never finished one of my required courses, I\u2019m shocked. I look online and it shows incomplete. I contact my professor and turns out she forgot to submit the grades for spring 2021 and said it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I go back to the school and they say they are unable to issue me a degree for spring 2021 because the requirements weren\u2019t met in time, despite them being actually met in real life but not on paper due to lack of communication on behalf of my professor. They invited me to apply for fall 2021 graduation. \n\n\nI thought no big deal as there was nothing I could really do about it. Turns out I was wrong. The job I had lined up wouldn\u2019t accept me since I didn\u2019t actually have a degree yet. My university job fired me as I\u2019m no longer a student. I basically had to get a minimum wage job for this semester and do absolutely no school work just to get a piece of paper issued to me. It feels ridiculous knowing I\u2019ve already completed all my requirements since spring 2021 and already attended graduation and celebrated but I\u2019m now stuck in this weird paperwork purgatory where the school must communicate with each other to issue my degree. The problem is my school is notoriously bad at communicating with each other so we will see what happens and if I get it this fall.",

I think the best process here is to try to get documentation from the college/university that the degree is complete and it's a just a matter of paperwork rather than substance -- in terms fo the job, etc. \n\nBut for students with incompletes -- there is no trigger to remind the faculty member to go back and look over any incompletes that they have granted in a semester. Most students don't finish them; professors don't have the time to police them the following semester. So it's a good idea to remind the professor that the incomplete has stayed in place prior to the end of its expiration. But there's typically nothing at the college that says that the responsibility for watching this is on the faculty member. So legal action is probably not a potential path here. \n\nLikely too late for the OP, barring a time machine, but a good practice if you carry incompletes as a student is to ensure that your materials are submitted in a timely manner and that they are updated on your transcript. This sort of issue should have been triggered when you applied for graduation.",
