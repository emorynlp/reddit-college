  "text": "sooo,,, huge 6,000 word term paper due tomorrow at midnight. i need to do well. i\u2019ve been doing research for weeks and i\u2019ve sat down for hours every single night and yet i\u2019ve written absolutely nothing. okay i\u2019ve done like a page but i\u2019m not sure any of it is good enough as it is. i had a mental health crisis last week and asked for an extension but i was denied, so now i need some words of advice and encouragement to help me finish because i\u2019m desperate for a decent grade",

      "text": "i'm in the same position, have a final 15 page research paper due thursday morning and i have nothing done. it's a big part of my grade so the pressure of doing good on this to get a good grade is a lot, but you got this!\n\nwhat i tell myself is it's going to be over soon, just sit down and grab an energy drink or a bottle of wine and just grind. i'm planning on word vomiting and just getting all my sources and info down, then editing like hell later. that seems to be the most efficient method for me when i'm on a time crunch for something like this.\n\ngood luck!",
