  "text": "I am currently active duty in the US Navy. I\u2019ve been in school for quite some time and have been using the Navy\u2019s tuition assistance to pay for some of my masters degree. (I can explain tuition assistance below) \n\nThe navy put out a statement that if you are within one year of separating, they will not cover any of your tuition. I have been pushing through my degree for about a year now and if I cannot figure out how to afford my tuition then I will have to quit school for a whole year.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any Tips and tricks for affording a masters degree? I\u2019ve applied for a lot of scholarships but haven\u2019t been accepted for any.\n\n\nFor those familiar with the military, I am saving my post 911 for my doctorates degree, so I do not want to tap into that. Plus it would be a waste of BAH if I used it while active.\n\nTuition assistance has covered only 4 classes a year and I have paid for the rest out of pocket.",

I don't imagine you make a lot of money, unless you're higher up in rank. \n\nOh, and don't forget to get your voc rehab. That adds a lot more time onto your GI bill.",
