  "title:": "Am I a loser for not having a job over winter break?",
  "text": "I am a full time university student who works a job over the summer, but not during the fall and spring semesters. I'm understandably having trouble finding a place that's hiring over winter break. After all, it's only like a month and who is going to hire someone for that short of a time? But I've been trying to really \"grind\" and better myself lately, and not having a job lined up to work over break is making me feel like I'm underachieving. I haven't stopped looking, but in the event that I don't find a job... am I a loser?",
