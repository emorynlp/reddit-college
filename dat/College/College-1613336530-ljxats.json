  "text": "My favorite experiences came from working in the store attached to a restaurant. I\u2019ll call it Bread Container instead of it\u2019s real name. \n\n* A Karen told her high school age son that because he\u2019s doing so well he\u2019ll get to go to college and not end up like me -_-\n* My manager would try to schedule me during my school hours. \n* A coworker told me that I was not better than her just because I went to college. I never said that nor implied it. College isn\u2019t for everyone. My dad didn\u2019t go to college and he has done very well with his life. \n* \u201dOh you go to a private college? Why are you working then?\u201d\n* I would get my work schedule and arrange time for studying and housework around it. Then the schedule would change halfway through the week. \n* I had my first panic attacks at work because I was stressed with school and getting accused of stealing doesn\u2019t help. \n* Was told that work takes priority over school by my manager\n* Was told by an older male coworker that I shouldn\u2019t major in computer science. Gave me alternatives that were female friendly. He also heavily implied I shouldn\u2019t even be in college.",

      "text": "I love this thread. My favorite was my assistant manager who constantly downplayed me finishing my degree and would try and put me down about going to school/class all the while she would complain about wanting to go back to school. She eventually did and then failed out her first term back. On top of that she would constantly threaten to give me a bad reference and would give me shit about how I wouldn\u2019t find a better job  I actually just got a job doing what I want to do before finishing my degree this term, and I am NEVER looking back. \n\nAnother was when I was working doubles thursday - weekend, my head chef (very talented, worked with some big name chefs) told me I\u2019d need to get my grades up if I ever wanted to be successful. It wasn\u2019t rude, but it did provide some motivation when studying. \n\nOh and the countless nights of getting off at 11 PM washing dishes and doing hours of homework. I\u2019ve worked in 5 or so restaurants through college and the only person I met with a degree was only working part time since he got a job with a Netflix show and was in between filiming season. I\u2019ve never worked with anyone else who was in school, except for a brief month at my last job. In the service industry it felt 100% looked down upon. \n\nAlso not saying college teaches you everything, but hearing uneducated people rant about history or science when the last education they had was in high school during the 90s gets SUPER annoying. I met some brilliant people who didn\u2019t go to college, but the dumbest were the loudest.",

Luckily I\u2019m at a much better place now. Even on my last day there she implied I\u2019d be back looking for work. She even asked me how much I\u2019d be making at my new place and I lied since I\u2019d be making more than her and knew she would react. Just her hearing I would make more than min wage made her make some dumb comment about how it\u2019s not that much (she asked the question and brought about the situation). I\u2019ve been on min wage, pay check to pay check the last 4 years barely making rent and bills. Having a reliable income has been seriously life changing. I don\u2019t make much more than min wage in my city (Portland). But with my expenses, overnight my financial and work stress decreased instantly. After washing dishes and making food on my non school days for 4 years though, my perspective is that anything is better than washing dishes till midnight!!!\nI have to pay back my loans in a couple months, but I\u2019d consider college bringing me out of the food industry a blessing!",

Her demeanor went took a 180 and she just said \u201coh... so you want to be a teacher?\u201d It was so weird, but it still sticks with me. \n\nI was sexually assaulted by a customer after she had apparently been cyber-stalking me. My male manager laughed it off, my female manager said there wasn\u2019t much we could do. I wish it had crossed my mind to make a police report, but I was 19, so whatever.\n\nThe highest I was paid was $8.50/hr. That\u2019s apparently what it\u2019s worth to keep a bunch of exotic animals alive. I\u2019d be studying for finals while also studying the husbandry standards for the new snake species we got in.\n\nI got denied a raise because I couldn\u2019t keep up with the work I was supposed to be doing. But all that extra work got heaped on my plate because no one wanted to address how the manager of my specific department had relapsed back into her drug habits. I found her overdosed in our parking lot one day. She had been missing from her lunch for several hours. We called everyone we could think of, but I had the bright idea to go see if she was in the parking lot. She was. She had passed out after lighting a cigarette while she was getting out the car. Every customer could see her splayed half out the car, but only I could see the cigarette burn in her shirt and the cigarette butt in her mouth. I eventually got her to wake up, and she wasn\u2019t fired until months later. After that, was involved in a fatal DUI accident and eventually got arrested for trafficking meth over state lines. \n\nWhile all off of this was happening, I was working two campus jobs simultaneously and then teaching Spanish at a non-profit as a volunteer. I took 18hrs of classes each semester.  I would stay up for days at a time to write and turn in papers, and then I\u2019d have to go to work for a 10hr shift. \n\nBest part? I did become a teacher, lol. I\u2019m an adjunct professor and I make less now than I did at the pet store. I really showed them!",

I wasn\u2019t working to pay off my schooling (thankfully I have that privilege) but I did want to have cash to not worry about groceries, new clothes, etc.\n\nI remember clearly in my first \u201cinterview\u201d there wasn\u2019t really any interview, I was just hired on the spot. So I\u2019m assuming this happened to everyone else I worked with who were mostly college students as well.\n\nThe owners would constantly complain that they shouldn\u2019t hire any college students IN FRONT OF US because we are hard to schedule and implied to be lazy. But the problem really was that their managers were lazily choosing college students and not properly enforcing rules. Also, the owners were likely too cheap to allow them to hire anyone with actual experience.\n\nI was also scheduled part-time but worked nearly 35-40hrs/week while being a full time straight A student. I worked super hard for that job yet never got a raise, although I asked for it. I was even asked to become an assistant manager while being a student and the owner constantly implied that I should stay at the company forever.\n\nAnd yet, I\u2019m a \u201clazy college student\u201d?? Shit never made sense. I quit right when COVID hit, but it was honestly more of a good excuse at the time than a health hazard. There was a lot more to that job that made me want to quit, but that\u2019s all in relation to the post. I\u2019m happy to have not gone back since.",

I wasn\u2019t working to pay for college, but I was working. \n\nI had just gotten out of the Navy, so I was still readjusting my schedule to get back to regular life. I was working at a Target while going to school for mechanical engineering full time, and I had called out due to having to study a bit more for an upcoming exam. I wasn\u2019t going to lie. I told them what my reason was for my calling out, and my manager pulled me into his office the next day. He started berating me and saying things like \u201cYou don\u2019t call out for that. That\u2019s not a proper accepted excuse. I went to college full time and studied full time without any problems. You need to be here for work. Blah blah blah.\u201d I got rather fed up at the pointless attack, so I looked him dead in the face and said \u201cBrett, you went to college 20 years ago and studied history. I could do what you did in my fing sleep. I had to do what was necessary to ensure I would pass. My collegiate success is more important than a dead end retail job.\u201d I then got right up, walked out of his office, and proceeded working the rest of my shift. I will never forget the look of utter shock on his face. I was **positive** I was going to receive a write up or get fired or *something*. Nope. Never came. He never said anything to me after that. The store manager never questioned me. When I showed up to work, I busted my a**. I learned real quick just how much the store manager respected me as a worker and how desperate they were for hardworking people lol.\n\nEdit: grammar",

      "text": "Listen to me. It's really brave of you to pick computer science as a major while working part time at minimum wage. Computer science is hard for everyone. The fact that you have chosen this major despite having financial and time constraints says that you are going to do very well in life because you do what you think is necessary and you don't turn away from hard choices. That is sufficient for a person to achieve their goals. \n\nBe a stoic, don't give a shit what strangers and coworkers have to say. Don't listen to anything which is going to demoralize you. These people themselves don't know anything about hard work or education or passion.\n\nI am a physics major doing a data science minor. I don't know much about computer science but I can help with something. Let me know if you need any help. I also know of several discord servers which are very helpful regarding computer science and programming. I can send you their links if you want. \n\nThe struggle you are going through currently is going to mold you into a person who can withstand any obstacle in life. Keep working smart and hard. Get some earphones or headphones if it's possible, play your favorite music and ignore unnecessary interaction.",

I\u2019m very proud of myself for getting where I am and for realizing that \u201cno, I am not obligated to work here. I can work somewhere else. I don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this. **I can do better for myself**\u201d And that seems to be something a lot of people struggle with. I know I did. \n\nI don\u2019t want to misrepresent myself. I worked to pay for the $200 textbooks I had to buy, pay my bills, and to save money for my loans. Other students have it far worse than I, having to pay for tuition and room and everything. I\u2019ve been fortunate to score some great financial aid. \n\nAnd because of the saving and financial aid, I\u2019ve been unemployed for senior year so I can focus on my capstone and graduating. \n\nI appreciate your kind words.",

My employers and co-workers knew I was working to put myself through school, and aside from the occasional crazy customer/student, things were fine. \n\nMy UNIVERSITY, on the other hand, could not have been less accommodating. I went to an expensive private school (largely on scholarship)... and the university, despite having programs to \u201chelp\u201d disadvantaged students, did everything in its power to prevent people like myself from succeeding. I was an RA/GA/TA/work study student/administrative assistant/you name it. When the university found out I actually landed two well paying assistantships, they told me I made too much money and had to switch one of my positions for a lesser one. (Mind you, the assistantships were not so large as to allow me to not take out loans). The next year, we couldn\u2019t hold two assistantships at all. The year after, they stopped letting graduate students hold RA (resident assistant) positions... even higher-level ones. My professors could NEVER understand why I couldn\u2019t attend \u201cmandatory\u201d seminars or weird work sessions outside normal class hours. I had a professor flat out tell me I couldn\u2019t work more than 8 hours per week and succeed in her class (spoiler: I did.) \n\nWorst experience: one of my professors mandated that we buy our books (which he wrote) from the campus bookstore, with useless access codes to submit homework online. When he found out I bought the prior edition from a friend, he said it was grounds for removal from the class, and that college is \u201cvery much pay to play.\u201d I withdrew and took it with another professor who GAVE me his own copy of the textbook. I still have it 9 years later, now going for my PhD.",

They ended up regularly scheduling me 32 hrs a week, a couple weeks 40 hrs, and then denied my schedule change request in the fall and denied agreeing to it in the interview. I promptly put in my two weeks notice. \n\nCurrent job I work in healthcare, not minimum wage but close to it. Life things happened and am now back in school studying nursing. Switched from part time to on-call, required to work 8 shifts a month. I meet that requirement and still get attitude from management that I\u2019m not working enough. Coworkers that don\u2019t know me that well act like I\u2019m lazy because I\u2019m barely working not realizing I put in about 50 hours a week in school/study time on top of the 8 shifts a month (about 20 hrs a week).

The experience part is a pretty big deal in getting a job. Fro example, it can be challenging to get an IT/ comp sci job sometimes because you are competing for entry level jobs with so many other people because they\u2019ll take people with boot camp, certs, degree, or experience. All the ample opportunity that people talk about for computer related fields is really for people with experience. You also have to think that sometimes people get through these degrees and hate the field. Nurses leave the nursing field within 5 years because there are so many issues in the way that nurses are treated. I\u2019ve seen nurses quit to go to a grocery store because they hate being a nurse so much. There\u2019s a lot of factors at play.",

I often find that people who end up working jobs like that with degrees, might have had other life circumstances; kids before finishing school; shitty parents who don't support them; etc. People often times love to blame their situation on a specific thing. I'm not saying people don't have shitty luck, many people do. What I'm trying to say is don't let their stories discourage you from keeping at it. Take it from a guy who worked full time as a security guard for 5 years while going to school. It certainly wasn't the worst job in the world compared to fast food/working inside the warehouse, but I had days. I had days where I almost started to believe that was going to be my whole life. I had people/family members imply that university was for rich white kids(I'm a hispanic brown guy), but I am one stubborn SOB. I failed classes; cut ties with shitty friends from high school who would call me anti-social when I would spend my weekends studying; people at the workplace who did not give a single fuck about the fact that I went to school and expected me to work 50hour weeks, etc.  But I kept at it. I graduated with my Computer Science degree and got an amazing well-paying and fulfilling job at an aerospace company. Please, don't let those people project their stories into your narrative. I'm not trying to spew out meaningless motivational marketing lines, I sincerely mean this; follow your fucking dreams.",

Because I deal with other students and with bosses who are used to dealing with students regarding scheduling and in general, everyone is respectful and understands that work is hard and school comes first. I'm sorry you've dealt with all this shit! I definitely think working as a college student is easier when you have a campus or campus adjacent (ie a mini mart or coffee shop RIGHT off campus that usually hires students) job. Students tend to be kinder than townies and townie bosses who are used to working with students are kinder as well afaik.",
