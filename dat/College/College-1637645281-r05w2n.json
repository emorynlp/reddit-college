  "title:": "IDK when I am gonna graduate college exactly (When I'm 25+, I think)",
  "text": "Ever since COVID hit, I realized that I needed to stay longer at college in order to figure out what to do and what route to take from there. Luckily, I am at community college and I'm currently 21 (almost 22) so I am saving some $$$ at least. I just remember last year in 2020 feeling so lost on what to do and it impacted my mental health entirely. I was so stressed and felt overwhelming anxiety with these online classes that I had to drop a few of them and knew that I did not want to do my Business degree anymore, but the other problem was that I did not know I'm not gonna lie, it kinda hurt seeing other people that I knew graduate while I am just going to stay longer at cc.\n\nLuckily, I am not totally stuck exactly compared to last year. I realized that healthcare is always going to be in demand and thus, I am either going to become a Physician Assistant or a Speech Therapist. Both of these careers require going to Grad School and it's something that I really don't mind. I will also be living with my parents in the meantime and I also want to earn a certificate so I can gain medical experience and money. I also don't want to be in a lot of debt and jobless when I officially graduate from college because one's degree/network and experience matters nowadays.\n\nIt's also going to be a bit of a mess since my family and I might be moving (Which I don't mind about moving). It's because I know that not all of my credits are going to transfer at the next community college, but you gotta do what you gotta do. (College advisers also stink btw)\n\nBut I feel like that \"I am falling behind\" a bit because I am going to be graduating \"late\". But I also know that I should not be feeling this since I am still young and that plenty of people go back to school when they are older. Still, I won't be surprised if I am over 25 when I am completely done with college. Heck, I won't be surprised if I am 27 or 28. Is this \"abnormal\"? Any advice is appreciated!",

      "text": "Using my throwaway account to post this, but all I can say is that you're not alone.  I'm going through something very similar; I had known I sucked at online courses ever since high school, so COVID was a total wreck for me academically; pass/failed all my classes one semester, went part time for another, and then, on top of that, realized that there were still credits I hadn't taken into account, meaning I'll be graduating when I'm 23, as I don't plan on pursuing a Master's in my degree (Computer Science).\n\nIt absolutely sucks; almost everyone I know has graduated already and have jobs in the industry. Walking through campus is lonely as hell nowadays, and I've noticed I've been doing a little worse in my classes than I was prior to the pandemic.  I feel like I've fallen behind myself; I know it's not uncommon for people to take 5 years on their degree, but I feel like my predicament was born out of pure incompetence.  Some days I feel like I'm just digging my own grave.\n\nI'm having a bit of trouble with this myself, but what I would try and do is find some sort of support group, maybe, college students who had to take an extra semester or more because of COVID.  Keep in touch with your old friends, let them know how you're doing (I still keep in touch with mine over Discord).  Remind yourself of why you, and only you, are doing this.  Don't regurgitate what some hard-ass online told you about \"sucking it up\" or something, and try to stay motivated enough to pass your classes, at the very least.\n\nGood luck, wishing you the best in getting through this.",
