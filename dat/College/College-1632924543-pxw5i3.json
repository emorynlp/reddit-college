      "text": "I vote because there\u2019s a very small difference in percentage between liberal and conservatives and I\u2019d like to keep my reproductive rights (safe abortions and all that) and keep guns out of the country. There\u2019s also more alienation and racism towards immigrants and POC when conservative parties win. I think it comes down to\n\n- reproductive rights\n- gun control\n- free healthcare\n- environnemental protection \n  - both in terms of creating sustainable living plans (solar panels, wind turbines, electro cars etc.) and more wildlife protection (land reserves, more rights to indigenous peoples to have control over land, animal sanctuaries, habitat protection) \n- free education (free higher education is even better)\n- better extracurricular programs for children\n- affordable childcare\n- affordable housing\n- immigration laws (pro immigration)\n- systems in place for times of need (economic crisis, pandemic, climate change\u2026)\n\nI may have forgotten things I\u2019ll edit if i remember**\n\nWhen there\u2019s political parties who include these topics in their stance, it brings up the motivation to vote in my opinion. \n\nOverall the better off (economic, sociopolitical, in terms of equity and the value system) a country is, the better they can treat other countries, and the more resources they\u2019ll have long term to help the planet (environment and people).",

                  "text": ">Especially if it\u2019s between conservative: who plan to change reproductive rights and lower gun control, and liberals: who plan to do nothing and change nothing.\n\nYou should do more research on abortion and it\u2019s history. It was brought into the feminist movement by a man named Larry Lader, who was a depopulationist. I lean more pro choice, but the origins of abortion before roe v wade concern me. \n\nFirst off, roe v wade will never be overturned. Most moderate conservatives are not against abortion 100%, they are against it after a certain period of time. Abortion and gun control are issues that ultimately keeps the \u201csheep\u201d stuck rooting for one side, they\u2019re the perfect issues for them to throw out at the public so the politicians can focus on the real issues (money, lobbying, insider trading). \n\nPro choice is ultimately better because it gives the government less power over the people, but at the same time people shouldn\u2019t be using abortions constantly. If you\u2019re that worried about kids, simply don\u2019t have sex. It\u2019s not hard. \n\n>Also I\u2019m not sure your stance on taxes but any political party who is willing to raise taxes in order solve some of the issues i stated above, I agree with. I\u2019d like higher taxes, but more transparency with what happens to them\n\nYou like paying more taxes while the rich get off free? The conservatives actually lower taxes but also help the rich, and the liberals are worse they say they will help the middle class but actually tax the middle class more.",

                      "text": "I never said the rich get off free? Idk where u got that from. in terms of taxes: people who earn under an amount (depends on country) shouldn\u2019t have to pay any taxes. This is because they need all the money they make in order to survive (and considering in any sort of dependants they have). Anyone over that number should pay taxes based off of their income. So the higher the income, the more tax you pay. \n\nAnd in terms of abortion, pro choice is the way for governments to have less control. No one is going around \u201coh I\u2019m gonna have unsafe sex just to get abortions haha\u201d (and if there is it\u2019s a VERY VERY small percent). The choice to have safe accessible and affordable abortion is important. And with this choice, if there\u2019s people out there who choose \u201cno, I\u2019d rather have the child\u201d that\u2019s up to them. If someone is having an abortion 7 months into the pregnancy, there\u2019s a HIGH chance that it is because there is a health issue either with the child or with the mother, people who choose to go through with it very rarely want to give the baby up, and it\u2019s more a problem of safety and health. There should definitely be educational resources and doctors should be there in order to say \u201cyou\u2019ve been pregnant for 5 months now, an abortion is not a viable option unless there\u2019s health issues (mental or physical)\u201d but the opinion of abortion should ultimately be left to the woman. There are already things in place to protect both the mother and the child, any more of a restriction on abortion and it IS standing in the way of the choice of the mother",

Rules about who can vote by mail also vary by state.\n\nThere are 10 states where election day is a holiday. Missouri is a state that comes to mind with only election day voting.\n\nMy experience is in Georgia, where the multiple weeks of early voting make it reasonable to find time to go vote, especially on the weekend.",

The problem is that the people pushing for voter IDs reject those approaches because they fail to adequately suppress those they want suppressed.  \n\nHere's an idea:  \n\nWhen an individual registers to vote they become a unique entity, right?  \n\nThere are lots of John Smiths in this voting district, but there is only one John Smith at 123 Elm Street, Wherever, USA  right?  \n\nMail a voter ID to every registered voter when their registration is completed, and mail it again every other year.  \n\nEvery two years John Smith @ 123 Elm Street receives a fresh voter ID with whatever barcode or QR code you want on it.  \n\nWhat you've been trained to say is that you now have no proof that John Doe actually got that voter ID, and not an imposter.  \n\nWe already have laws about identity theft, and voter fraud - federal crimes in fact (if a federal election is involved).  \n\nSo, if an imposter intercepts this year's card and the real John Smith uses his card from last year the QR code is used twice you can now flag a problem in that district for investigation.  \n\nSo, ask yourself and the representatives of your party why the laws calling for voter IDs don't include funding for, or a solution for giving every registered voter an ID card painlessly, automatically, without hassle.  \n\nStart asking the right questions and the realities that it's just a voter suppression mechanism will become easier to see.",

The scenario the shadow campaigners were desperate to stop was not a Trump victory\u201d.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even provide me with evidence proving the last election was rigged.

I can tell you didn\u2019t read the entire article. \n\n>The conversation that followed was a difficult one, led by the activists charged with the protest strategy. \u201cWe wanted to be mindful of when was the right time to call for moving masses of people into the street,\u201d Peoples says. As much as they were eager to mount a show of strength, mobilizing immediately could backfire and put people at risk. Protests that devolved into violent clashes would give Trump a pretext to send in federal agents or troops as he had over the summer. \n\nThey literally push the people into the street when they want. They control people like you like a fucking puppet on a string and they know it, they proudly tell you they have that power over you here. Use better critical thinking skills and take a less liberal stance when reading this article and it sounds like a scheme to rig the election.\n\nI would be just as concerned if this article was about conservatives doing this. They call it uncorrupted because **they are the ones with the power in this article**. Corporate America is on their side. That\u2019s why they see it as justice.",

I\u2019ve also laid out my argument soundly and understandably. You, on the other hand, read a small section of an article that on the surface seems to confirm your preconceived belief that elections are rigged and refuse to read the rest of it. You even admitted to refusing the bit that I quoted because \u201cthey claim they are helping America when they\u2019re not\u201d (I\u2019m still not sure who \u201cthey\u201d is referring to here). \n\nDo you even know what refute means? You are telling me all I\u2019m doing is refuting your points, but that\u2019s kind of the point in having an argument. You didn\u2019t even make it hard to do. Also, in order to successfully refute points, you have to make intelligent points, so your comment is really antithetical to itself.\n\nIt seems like your idea of making an intelligent argument, at least on my side, is just accepting what you say as fact even though it\u2019s blatantly incorrect. I\u2019m sorry to break this to you, but that\u2019s neither intelligent nor an argument.\n\nIf you\u2019re not just a troll, I really hope that someday you can see why what you\u2019re doing is an issue, not just for arguments, but for the sake of our democracy.",

If only a small number of people vote and you will always get 40% of those because they like the party you're in and you will never get 40% because they like the other party then it's really only 20% in play and you only need 11% of them and 11% of not a lot of people isn't that many you need to convince, which is something you can achieve simply by spending a crapton of donor money on ads. Once you're in, you only need to please those donors to keep your job. \n\nWere everyone to vote the percentages may stay the same but the numbers increase immensely and you're no longer looking at something you can just get through with ads. Elected officials will have more people to keep happy in their governing if they want to keep their jobs. So the thing that gets me out to vote is the idea that if enough of us do as well I can help strike fear into the hearts of those bastards.",
