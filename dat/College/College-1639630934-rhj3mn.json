  "text": "I have been barely hanging on to a 91% going into this final. It's one of these classes with like 30 assignments that you can get all A's on, but only 3 exams total that are really what determines your grade. I learned (quite painfully) that this professor is all about the most obscure details, and I obviously need an A to keep an A, so I study the CRAP out of the chapters he states... in writing... our final covers. 12, 14, and 15. I take exam. It's chapters 12, 13, and 14. Feel like I kinda have a right to be pissed here, no?",
