There are opportunities and clubs available to alumni so I can technically join those too.\n\nWould people think it's weird or creepy?  I've gotten pretty mixed responses.",

      "text": "I graduated almost 2 years ago from a small college. My college years were bad so I am still hurt by a lot of stuff that happened to me. I myself have been back to visit my old supervisors twice. I also have been back \"on campus\" for homecoming. But I visit the college town almost every month (for another side job).\n\nI do miss college and am slowly looking into getting my MS. It does not help that my current I am surrounded by 55+ year olds for most of the day. I am also planning on visiting with old friends who live elsewhere. \n\nI am slowly contacting former professors (slowly opening the door) to mentor the students. I told them about primary source research for capstone papers on a subject that I know people struggle on. I also told them about a academic research magazine that is looking for articles to get the students to start out. I am friends with the editor and its local based. But this is a slow thing.\n\nMy ex-friends (so to speak) still visit often as they were close to the now seniors-juniors. They were also frat/sororities so they go back to visit them or to mentor the students.\n\nMy college has a large alumni groups that I keep missing the events outside of homecoming.\n\nWhen I was in college, it depended on the case. Did the kids work for the school as employees (often case) or were they coming from a specific meeting or thing.",

      "text": "Guess it kind of depends. I don't think it's too strange for recent (1-2 years) alumni to hang around campus. Just as long as you have a reason to be there and aren't being creepy or infringing on things intended for students. There's a point when you have to just move on, make new friends elsewhere and such. Join an alumni association, go to public events, or events with an organization you were in. It's less creepy if you're hanging out in a student center with friends once in a blue moon, and moreso if you're there every day.\n\nA friend I graduated with last year got a job on campus and started a certificate program, so it makes sense for her to hang around campus despite having graduated. Same with grad students. The only times I hung out on campus outside public and alumni events have all been just dropping into town for a few hours because I was already nearby. Like if I had a meeting in town, I'd just drop by some old haunts because I know my friends who are still students would be there. It would be creepy though if I were there more often since I don't really have a reason to be there.",

At my school, someone who was of college age, was on leave of absence from our school, and lived in the neighborhood got in trouble for attending church services at our worship building. They got a Persona Non Grata filed against them. And our school is giving those out in other similar cases, to students on leave of absence, etc.",
