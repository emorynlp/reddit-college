  "text": "i\u2019m a junior in college studying accounting and mis. is it bad that i really don\u2019t care much about test grades or studying? i don\u2019t study at all and fail pretty much every test but i still pass all my classes because my grades don\u2019t depend on tests so i just don\u2019t care to study. like it hurts when i see the bad test grade but then i remember that stressing out won\u2019t do anything for me. \n\n\ni know i should study but what i learn in school will only give me the basic fundamentals for what i will do in my career from what my accounting mentor and my dad who is an IT guy says. so i just don\u2019t see the point in studying hard. is it bad to think like this? if so, how can i change my mindset? \n\n\ni\u2019m more stressed about my future career. school really just makes me lose my passion for all things and makes me lazier than i already am. \nbefore this year, on my own time, i would analyze cryptos and i would code, leading me to choose those two majors. but right now, i don\u2019t even find them enjoyable. so i don\u2019t have an idea of the career path i want to go down. i am the type of person who has a plan for everything, so this phase is freaking me out right now. \n\n\nany advice? thanks:)",
