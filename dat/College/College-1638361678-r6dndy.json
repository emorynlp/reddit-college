I\u2019m not saying procrastination is a good habit by any means. It\u2019s just not ours place to judge and to try and tell that person what to do. Maybe for the time being that\u2019s what works for them. We don\u2019t need to know the backstory, we just need to be more considerate and mind our own business.
