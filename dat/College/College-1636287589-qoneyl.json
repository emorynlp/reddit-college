  "text": "I\u2019m taking 3 classes this term each 4 credits which is 12 total making me full time student. Truth is my depression, eating disorder and overall stress during these times came together to mess me up. I\u2019m doing so bad in 2 of my classes but can salvage one. I\u2019m considering withdrawing and retaking these classes next term once I\u2019m in a better place but I\u2019m not sure what will happen. What happened when you guys withdrew classes? How does it affect my FAFSA?",
