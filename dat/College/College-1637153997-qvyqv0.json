Every goddamn elective is full or at the same time as a required course that you have to take that semester. Now you are stressed, now you are sad, and now your day has been ruined.\n\nWelcome to my ted talk about why registration is the bane of my existence.",

At my school we are required to meet with our advisor at some point in the week before registration in order to remove the hold on our account that prevents us from registering at our given time. I met with my advisor last Monday and my slot was Friday at 11:30 am. If I had been able to register at my given time, I would have been able to get into all 5 of the courses I had pre-selected. But there was a system problem that said the hold hadn't been removed even though I had my meeting, and by the time I was able to register at like 1:30 that afternoon, 4 of my 5 classes had been filled. I am on the waitlist for all of those courses and while it looks like I will definitely be able to get into one of them (the professor is increasing the enrollment limit and I'm in 3rd on the waitlist) the others don't seem likely. So now I need to figure out what I'm going to do to have at least 8 more credits + PE if I want to stay on track for a 4-year graduation plan.",
