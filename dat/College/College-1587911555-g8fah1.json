  "text": "Finally got into college and its time to start thinking about the future: I love humanities, specifically history and writing but I'm also ambitious about where I wanna work and how much I wanna earn out of college and realize these two things are sorta incongruent. I know people always advocate to \"follow your heart\" but I simply don't see myself working in history when I leave college and was wondering what kind of compromises/decisions other students (you all) have made in similar situations?\n\nAs of right now, I'm considering a major in the humanities but a minor in either business/economics or  computer science (subjects that I'm interested in but don't quite enjoy as much as history and writing). That way I can sorta pursue by passions while getting the best of both worlds? What have others done and what do you recommend?",

      "text": "I'm majoring in economics and math instead of music because of the money. I don't dislike either of my majors, in fact I'm pretty passionate about economics anyway and math is really just a vehicle for me to be better at economics when I pursue a PhD later, but I made the choice for financial reasons.\n\nI managed to stay musically active by minoring in music, taking lessons, playing in the orchestra, etc. I didn't have to sacrifice studying music, but I'm majoring in something that will make for a financially secure career regardless of whether I do graduate study or not.\n\nIt helps that my AP credits shaved off 35 hours' worth of Gen Eds and 9 hours of math classes. So I've basically got an extra 3 semesters at my disposal in order to graduate \"on time\", making my double major and minor much easier to manage.",

      "text": "You need to mix both of them if you can. Passion+financial aspects of a job MATTER. Ppl here love to stick to the passion side of things which is the root of the problem for new college grads who can't find a job in their field. It's now getting to a point where instead of bachelors, jobs want masters degrees minimum. People need to understand that college is not a place of passion, but more of a financial investment into one's future.\n\nIf you ignore the price tag until the end to pursue music theory, then idk what to say. Too many ignorant college students not caring enough. Research your field of study that interests you and see if you can make a living with it. If not, move on to whatever else interests you. \n\nYou can't be happy with a job of passion if it pays the same as mcdonalds and you have to live on your own, at your own place, with mountains of compounding debt. It just ain't worth the stress.",

      "text": "I think double majoring or getting a minor is a good idea, but I think what\u2019s even better is to think about what jobs you want to do and then from there think about what major will get you that job. That way you don\u2019t jump into some random field just because it\u2019s \u201cemployable\u201d only to discover a) all the jobs it qualifies you for are awful in your view or b) you didn\u2019t have to major in it to get the job you want. The way to do this is to look at job listings and see what qualifications they require or recommend. Except for very specialized stuff, usually multiple kinds of degrees are accepted (for example, many basic data analyst positions accept math, physics, and Econ majors, among others). \n\nIf you have no idea what you want to do, then I guess the next best thing is to think about what kind of skills you want to develop and then take the classes that map onto those skills. \n\nBut also keep in mind that in many cases your previous experience is far more valuable than what words are on your degree. If your school has good career resources and you are otherwise able to, internships are very good for getting your foot in the door and differentiating yourself somewhat. But it\u2019s also kind of a chicken and the egg thing since a lot of internships prefer other majors, so ymmv.\n\nAlso, this dichotomy between \u201cdoing something you like\u201d and \u201cdoing something that makes you money\u201d isn\u2019t entirely true. I\u2019m sure there are things that combine both, or at the very least there are things that make you money that won\u2019t make you completely miserable. So like don\u2019t just pick up a python coding book and tell yourself you have to be a programmer if that\u2019s not something you want to do.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re going to minor, I would strongly pick Econ over business. It\u2019s valued just as much or at least nearly as much as business on your resume, and also it\u2019ll teach you much more useful things. This might just be my opinion, but it\u2019s also far more interesting",

Your scholarships are good for all 4 years so spend at least your first semester exploring classes in all of those fields you like. People might tell you to graduate in three if you can, but also you\u2019re going to be doing this for *the rest of your life*. If you need one more year to make sure you will like what you\u2019re doing, take it. \n\nPersonally, I just got a double major. The two topics I was infatuated with work really well together so I just went with both because I had time to. I wish you the best of luck!!",

      "text": "I\u2019m probably kind of old to still be subscribed to this sub, but I\u2019ve been out of college several years now so I have some advice.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t really think 18 year olds should feel pressured to go to college as young as they are. If you have no idea what you want to do, there\u2019s no shame in waiting. Asking an 18 year old who likely has had no responsibilities or obligations yet to take on the task of picking the direction for their life before they\u2019ve even experienced the world yet is crazy to me. Waiting can be a smarter choice sometimes. Get a job. Get another job. Get several, different jobs. Find out what your work ethic really is like, what work schedules you prefer, what your skills are, how social you like your jobs to be. That stuff can be way more valuable and tell you more than taking some gen ed classes you barely care about. Plus, waiting later can make college more affordable if you have middle class parents who don\u2019t qualify you for financial aid, since you\u2019re considered independent at 24. \n\nThat said, I got a degree in something I loved my whole\nlife (creative writing), and a second degree in something I thought I would like well enough (teaching), but that could pay bills until my passion became my \u201creal job.\u201d I wound up having my love of writing almost completely stamped out. Seriously, I didn\u2019t write anything for years after undergrad, not because I wasn\u2019t talented or well-regraded in my program, but because enjoying something for the craft and approaching it from an academic perspective are completely different. I also discovered I hated the rat race of academia, which is kind of necessary if you want to go into humanities. My backup career didn\u2019t work out either because most careers involving the humanities unfortunately come with demoralizingly low pay, and teaching is one of the more brutal examples. I lasted about two years before I decided to bartend, and now I\u2019m completing a professional certification for something unrelated in a field that pays well and does not require a college degree.\n\nAnyway, this is long but I\u2019ll try to wrap it up. My number one advice is that unless you have full financial aid and you know for sure what you want to do (as in, you\u2019ve already spent summers shadowing a professional in the field or interning, plus maybe have taken some low level coursework and know you\u2019re good at the subject), I wouldn\u2019t go to college right away and I would explore career-track associates degrees or technical training fields that pay decently. If you\u2019re set on four year school at 18, as someone who has been there and done that, don\u2019t major in humanities right now. We\u2019re very possibly going into a major recession, if not depression, and while you think that may not affect you right now, we have no idea how long this could last. I have friends who work in museums and are lawyers and they\u2019re getting laid off left and right. Study something practical and recession proof. If you absolutely must study humanities, get a minor or just take all the electives you can. \n\nAnd if you just think you\u2019ll be completely miserable doing a job outside humanities, look for a stable career that utilizes the liberal arts skills you have, but doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to dedicate your whole degree to it. I\u2019m learning voice writing to become a certified court reporter. I studied English for four years, so I have excellent grammar and writing skills, plus I became good at cranking out multiple research papers at a time, so hopefully that helps me get transcripts proofread quickly. Maybe you decide to major in computer science, but you have a passion for social studies and that helps you find a niche creating applications for education systems.\n\nAnyway. This may be an unpopular opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. I hope anyone who reads this is happy with what they\u2019re doing, because at the end of the day, that\u2019s the only way to get through it.",

And you're much more likely to be successful if you're doing something that you love.\n\nAlso in my experience, once you graduate and get a job, your skills and job experience are more important than what your actual degree is in.

That way, you don't have to pay tuition to get those skills, but you can still put them on your resume and let them help you in your career.",

I see no point in going to college and racking up life changing debt for something that requires skill more than instruction (arts, music, dance, etc), or whose only route may leas back to teaching or research unless that\u2019s your goal. (History, Poly Sci, Humanities) \n\nThat said Im majoring in Japanese, but also had engineering as my main major before switching to Supply Chain Management. I took Japanese for fun on the side, but always put engineering first since that was the money maker. I switched from ENGR to SCM because I was tired of ENGR, the culture, the stress, and didn\u2019t like my internship. Supply Chain Management pays a bit less than engineering graduating, but the money is still good, I enjoy it a lot more, and it\u2019s not your average business major. (Business majors get crapped on a LOT). \n\nMy Japanese Major isn\u2019t costing me much, but I go to a cheaper state school and gets lots of aid. If it was I wouldn\u2019t consider it. I do have to take some summer classes to graduate on time though, but that\u2019s also being paid via aid and super cheap community colleges. My only regret is that I was suppose to be in Japan this summer, but I wont and may never study abroad before I graduate due to Corona. I also don\u2019t feel like my Japanese will ever be good enough translate or do it professionally esp since I can\u2019t study abroad, but I still like knowing the basics and teaching it to others and I can always teach myself after graduating. :) \n\nHopefully this helped.",

Is there a way to combine those? \n\nGenerally things work out in the long run. You have to be aware of whether lifestyle or work are more important to you. Do you want a nice house and family? Do you want to be at the top of your field? \n\nBeing at the beginning of college as a young person is difficult because you have to start making decisions that will affect you for the rest of your life. I wish I had been as aware of that at 18 as I am now. \n\n\"Working in history\" is vague, and if you want to be pedantic, technically impossible. If you enjoy history, consider fields where it's a foundational skill. You could work in a library, in law, in education, in a museum, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Maybe narrow down the history that resonates with you the best. Do you enjoy military history? Then perhaps a path into the military or government or public service would suit you. Do you enjoy music history? Then maybe something like musicology or education would suit you. Do you enjoy political history? Maybe law or public service would suit you. \n\nAlso worth considering is whether you want to work interdisciplinary or be a specialist. Some people are needed in roles that bring fields together, and others are needed to be specialists in their roles. Think about what might suit you. Would you be a movie director or like a costume designer, or maybe a casting agent? You get the idea.",

      "text": "Hey! This is an awesome question and it's great you're thinking about this now. I struggled with the same questions when I was a freshman/sophomore in college. For context, I graduated 2 years ago from a medium sized liberal arts university outside of a major city. I'm now employed full time for a fortune 10 company making over $80k/year as a consumer behavior researcher for technology designers and product developers.\n\nHere's what worked for me: first, I found a broad social science that I loved. For me, it was sociology. The great thing about social sciences is that they give you the foundational skills to do almost anything. I learned problem solving, understanding macro trends in the world, how to write, how to research, etc. Another word of advice: make friends with your professors! This is key as they often have research assistant positions that look awesome on a resume.\n\nNext I added a minor in economics. I wish I'd double majored but I added it too late. I recommend adding a complimentary field to whatever your major is. So for example, sociology can go hand in hand with business, computer science, statistics, economics, marketing, etc. This really rounded me out and gave me additional perspectives I didn't get from sociology alone.\n\nAfter I graduated, I found a position as a market research assistant. Then I worked my way up and got a job as an analyst mostly doing statistics. Then I was able to use that to launch myself into the dream job I have now! I love what I do and it's all thanks to having that clear path forward from my studies in college.\n\nFinal piece of advice: learn some programming! Knowing even a little bit of Python will help you SO much in your job search, no matter the position.\n\nThere are tons of jobs right now that involve data analytics in all sorts of fields. Those jobs won't be going away any time soon, even during a pandemic like this.\n\nLet me know if you have any additional questions -- I'd be happy to try and answer anything!",

I was in an arts management program for a while until I left an extremely unethical internship my school set up for me. I would have saved myself loads of anxiety if I had followed my heart much earlier and chose Art. I have several people I know irl who have asked me for advice about art school. My feelings are this: if it is something you love strongly and identify with there is no other choice. That said, be smart about where you go (this has nothing to do with cost or prestige btw). I switched majors (started out biomedical engineering) and got my self in a tough place grade wise for a bit and I couldn\u2019t transfer colleges. For this reason I chose the switch into Buisness rather than Art. My schools art program had no education for animation, illustration, digital art, graphic design etc. and had a complete lack of marketing education to aid in students success. They had a fantastic theatre and dance program and film(movies) was good too but those weren\u2019t for me and I knew their sculpture, figure drawing, printmaking and film photography programs weren\u2019t going to set me up for success in the modern art market. If I had gone elsewhere  where they were more up to date and interested in setting students up for a more profit centric success I think that would have been super fun and a smart financial choice. It\u2019s important to remember art or any other \u201crisky\u201d choice presents itself in many different ways. Sure there are obvious art jobs like teaching art or selling paintings but there are also people who work on book covers, design packaging, make costumes for plays, work on the movies and tv you binge watch. Art is everywhere and if you play it right with an art degree you will find something interesting that also pays you a livable income. I\u2019m happy with the path I chose. I can always go back to school for a masters in art or art history. I have the foundation and it helped to break up my semesters and I honestly think I owe it my life as I had a horrific college experience (I graduated last December). Whatever you choose to do will work out. Getting a college degree is proof that you are willing and able to learn. That you can think for yourself. That\u2019s what most people are looking for anyways a company can always train you and often will because they want you to be a certain way.",

Your major does not equal your job. It is simply just a course of study to follow in school. Plenty of history majors go into business, for example. As long as you have the required classes you need for your area of interest, you'll be fine. Personally, I'm going into law. But you dont just have to be a lawyer or teacher if you want to do history. My advisor told me of somebody he knew who was a history major and ended up working in the big 4 in accounting. The people in here who are saying that you need to do something practical obviously know nothing about the higher education system and where your major places you. Don't believe me? Look it up. Plenty of experts will tell you the same thing.",

Something I talk to my therapist about (thank again dad!) is what is considered success and from what we discuss success is being happy with yourself.  Yeah, you can have nice things, but is it really worth it if you go to a job you hate every single day.

I know quite a few students who go straight into law school or PhD after majoring in liberal arts, although I also know a lot who went straight into the job market. I think those making the most went into corporate type jobs, usually doing stuff like community outreach or HR. I also have friends who went into lower paying jobs but in their field of study and are happy with that (granted they probably don't have huge amounts of loans).\n\nJust make sure you visit your career center and look into skills that you can get throughout your college career. For example : technical writing, copywriting, foreign language ability, etc. Those are all skills associated with liberal arts majors that can help get a decent job after graduation.",

You can also get a masters in counseling or social work, which does pay a livable (but not fancy) wage. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be completely honest without also mentioning that I started dating my best friend halfway through college and we quickly came to the conclusion that we wanted to be together very long term (it\u2019s a long story and sounds naive but whatever, it\u2019s worked so far) and he\u2019s a computer engineer, so securing a six figure salary became... less of a priority. \n\nMy best advice if you want to get a PhD is this: get involved with a research lab ASAP and do as much of it as you can (I ended up designing a novel experiment for one of mine). Do a thesis your senior year. Do volunteer work in some kind of psych adjacent field (I was a mentor in an juvenile delinquent center). Look to see if there are any psych hospitals nearby that take volunteers. Find a mentor early, and ask all your psych professors about any opportunities they may know of. \n\nDuring the summer, try to do research or volunteer involving psych (I didn\u2019t do this but wish I had). Talk to older psych students about opportunities.\n\nWork hard to maintain a stellar GPA. Be prepared to work in a research lab for 1-2 years after you graduate before a psych phd program (if you\u2019re aiming for clinical). \n\nSchool psychology and Industrial and Organizational Psych are less competitive (you also might be able to get away with just a masters in IO, I\u2019m not sure). \n\nIt is incredibly frustrating, there have been tears, but I love what I do and I\u2019m not sure I would have traded it for anything (except maybe law but that\u2019s because the college I went to had a killer Gov program and I probably could have gotten into a great law school had I gone that route). But seriously, only do it if you love it, because it is incredibly stressful. But if you love it and are willing to really invest your life in it, go for it. \n\nPM me if you have questions.",

Sure I had money but that doesn't mean that my friends had the same kind of money to blow so expensive fun has never been an option for all of us.

The key to getting these types of jobs is doing as many internships as possible. No there aren\u2019t a relative ton of museums jobs out there, but we all live near DC, which has the highest concentration of these jobs. \u201cDigital history/humanities\u201d is also a small but cool field to look into. ETA: I even know people with history/English degrees who have gotten very stable and well-paying govt. jobs. These jobs require and value the writing and analytical skills that studying the humanities can give you. \n\nIf you have a specific idea of what you can use your skills in the humanities in (research, technical writing, etc.) you\u2019re not doomed to be jobless if you\u2019re willing to live in an urban area. \n\nSuch jobs will pay enough to live off of and be comfortable if you have little to no debt. If you\u2019re facing a lot of debt though it might be uncomfortable. \n\nIf Econ/business appeals to you then that\u2019s great. But think of all the people in that field who are either (1) not passionate about it like you could be; or (2) 100% passionate about it, that you\u2019ll be competing for jobs with. You still have to compete and show passion for these jobs and internships. \n\nTLDR; like with anything, if you want to study the humanities you should do so with a clear plan/understanding of job market. Don\u2019t totally dismiss it if you really love writing.",

One of the hardest things for me was to pick the correct major and minor as well as I don\u2019t really know anyone that works in that field. It would be very helpful if you were able to speak to someone briefly in the writing or history fields and ask them what they think is the best background to have stable employment in their field. For example, it might turn out that the ability to do high level research is the most important thing so then you\u2019d want some statistics, reading analysis, or something related to that.\n\nFor me, my major and minor that I went for ended up being very related, but in your case it may be best to have some very different focuses. I chose Finance as my major and Economics as my minor. I like understanding how and why things work so these are very practical ways for me to feed that curiosity. The reason I did this is that finance is more practical in that it gives me more opportunities for various companies. Economics is related, but is more theoretical and those majors are mostly employed in either teaching or the government. I prefer economics itself better as it interests me more, but even though it wasn\u2019t my main focus it does add to my major of finance and allowed me to learn in that discipline anyways.",

A lot of liberal arts majors, some of my friends included, self-select into government and nonprofit work (much more meaningful and fulfilling work than what I do in the private sector!), but unfortunately those positions pay less than the private sector, which skews statistics when looking at average salaries of liberal arts majors. \n\nThat all said, my firm does recruit only at certain schools (the high majority of paralegals in my office went to private schools in the top 50 or so, for example), so I think it\u2019s just important to know what post-graduate opportunities are available from the school you attend. Stalking people on LinkedIn is useful for that, along with talking to career services to see which firms recruit at your school and what kind of applicants they seek. \n\nI think history is a great major. It\u2019s reading and writing heavy, which are essential skills for most positions, and teaches a lot of soft skills. It also mixes aspects of a lot of other majors.

A lot of people start off on something they think sounds great because they will make a lot of money (say CS) and realize that they loved it because it sounded nice, not because it\u2019s any fun at all. If that means \u201cfollowing your heart\u201d, so be it. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to set yourself up for teaching high school classes or some rough equivalent in terms of income though.\n\nFirst? Plenty of people don\u2019t even go work in their area of study. This is changing a little IMO as college becomes more of a \u201cpre-professional\u201d program and less of a purely educational experience but a college degree is partially significant simply as a sign of \u201cI\u2019ve done this\u201d. My dad was an anthro major. He started a business working on boats, something he learned to do while living on one in college. The company grossed almost a million last year. That\u2019s an example of how, honestly, skills are something you can really leverage when it comes to making money. Learn some skills while you\u2019re in school, you\u2019ll have a more flexible schedule than you ever have before. \n\nIf you love history, try combining it with business, international relations, maybe even a science of some sort. Look for certifications or extracurricular programs to join (Model UN?). Just because you do history doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t cap it off by going to say, law school after. Considering a grad program is a great way to add significance to an otherwise very nebulous major. \n\nIn all honesty though, do what makes you happy. I\u2019m serious. I transferred schools to try and do CS this past year, had a terrible experience in a class and now I\u2019ve basically come back to international relations, though now combined with a business major. We have an accelerated masters program, so I plan on trying to get a masters in management before I leave. Just have fun with it!! It goes SO FAST.

Prepare to get wrecked buddy. \n\nIf you just want to pay the bills, all of the math says you should *not* go to an expensive fancy college and take on debt...at all. If you live in the US, take the liberty of going to a community college or in-state institution where you can get a perfectly functioning degree along with the knowledge needed to perform your job effectively. If you just want to work? Do that. Accruing tens of thousands of dollars of debt is inadvisable under almost all circumstances. The number of people going into deferment on their student loans every year is astronomical \u2014 had those people chosen a more affordable option for education, the need to simply \u201cwork\u201d rather than do something they are passionate about and actually invested in wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Not everyone can become an engineer or a doctor in order to cope with their student debt. \n\nSince I feel that your comment made a lot of assumptions about me, let me enlighten you. I work 25 hours a week while going to school full time. I pay my own rent. All of my debt is in my name. My parents don\u2019t even pay for *HALF* of my cost of attendance. So yeah, I get it, there\u2019s pressure. \n\nSure, my family is in the upper 5% of Americans by income. Big whoop. We\u2019re also in the third most expensive city in the country. So what lesson can you draw from that? Live within your means. If we lived somewhere else, we would make marginally less. Cool...but it would also *cost a lot less to live there*. So the operative set of assumptions here are that you *avoid crippling debt*, chose a lifestyle that fits your means and make choices based on the life that you want to live. Debt and the size of the bills you pay are choices, not givens. Sure, maybe I am the exception to the rule, maybe my family is. But we got here, I got here, because I made a series of choices. Those are choices that *everyone* has the liberty of making. None of the money my family had was because of the degrees they got or finances their parents left for them. It came from hard work, ingenuity and being able to envision a life different than what was put in front of you. \n\nBottom line: it can be work *and* your passion. You might not be able to finance that new Audi you can\u2019t afford anyways if you make that choice. Maybe no expensive vacations on the credit card. Personally? I\u2019d rather be happy, enjoy what I do, go on a free hike and drive a 10 year old car anyways. But that\u2019s just me.",

Went to community college for 2 years; transferred, with full scholarship, to a private school and pursued my \"passion.\" I still regret it. \n\nHere's the bottom line: fancy schools have better job opportunities. This is indisputable fact. You will not get high finance, FAANG, etc. from a lower school. At best, maybe your state flagship is a good school for FAANG as they are slightly less snooty. But finance firms, IB, consulting are some of the most snobbish fields imaginable.\n\nIf you want some unicorn job, like human rights or international non-profit, that field is **dominated** by trust fund kids that don't need money. I don't mean lots of them; I mean utterly **dominated** by them.\n\nLocal non-profits and charities have a few proles slip in, who promptly develop alcoholism and depression from the shit pay and long hours, and tragic human stories they deal with everyday.\n\n> My parents don\u2019t even pay for HALF of my cost of attendance.\n\nYou are speaking to the wrong person if you think this is a brag. I didn't get a fucking dime from my parents for college. I paid for my own rent, my own tuition, my own car.\n\n>Sure, my family is in the upper 5% of Americans by income.\n\nWhat a surprise.\n\n>chose a lifestyle that fits your means and make choices based on the life that you want to live. \n\nBy definition: being *forced* to live \"within your means\" is not making a choice \"based on the life you *want* to live.\"",

                              "text": "I didn\u2019t say you were choosing to be stuck in your means forever. I strongly suggested that you lived within them such that you avoided taking on crippling debt \u2014 something which limits your options and starts, in a sense, making decisions for you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that for you, following your passion didn\u2019t work out. That sucks. I also am sorry that you interpreted my post as an appeal for everyone to have the same passions and apparently want to go work at a non profit like every trust fund kid. Everyone\u2019s passion is different. From the sounds of it, yours really didn\u2019t align with the options you had at your disposal. Again, it sucks and I\u2019m sorry. But realize that this is not the case for everyone. Not everyone wants to go into consulting or finance. \n\nThat\u2019s why I advocated (again) making choices that are within your current means and those available to you in the foreseeable future. Many people have several things that they are passionate about. I personally opted not to pursue one of mine at a certain school because the debt load would have been enormous \u2014 $150K or more. That wasn\u2019t worth it to me. Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t find something else (and I have) that I\u2019m passionate about. \n\nAnd for the record, people who chose to work lower paying jobs in positions like teachers, local non-profits etc. don\u2019t all develop depression and become alcoholics. That is 100% not true. Half of my family were (and are) teachers. Yeah, they don\u2019t make much. No, they weren\u2019t given a lick of money by their parents. \n\nIf you re-read my post, you\u2019ll notice that I said my family never had any money. What we have my dad got from starting a business doing manual labor all day. He got no money from his parents, in fact they practically disowned him for it while giving tens of thousands to his brother so he could go to law school and get a \u201creal job\u201d. My family has a distinctly blue collar background. I\u2019m proud of it. And yeah, compared to a lot of people, paying for even half of your college or working 25 hours a week is far beyond what they will ever do. Maybe it\u2019s not what you did, but again, I\u2019m proud of it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry things didn\u2019t work out for you. Don\u2019t try to convince someone else they can\u2019t work out for them.",

I think people really overestimate the importance of a bachelors 5 years after graduating.

It teaches you completely wrong, and contrary to how writing and reading works in the law. Lots of humanities departments teach to pad your essays with bullshit and circumstantial material, laden with opinion and the occasional quote. Law is extremely strict and is more similar to techical writing than any history or english department.\n\nEnglish with a focus on technical writing would probably do well in law school, only humanity I will give credence to.",
