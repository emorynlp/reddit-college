  "text": "Hey guys, next semester ive got Intro to Biology. I REALLY struggled with Chemistry this semester - I got an A, but it was a VERY difficult semester.\n\nSo, I was hoping some folks might know of some really introductory biology audiobooks that I could listen to during work, during the winter break? I would appreciate the help.\n\nNote: Ive googled, but just found general stuff. Im looking for something that makes learning the fundamentals easy.",
