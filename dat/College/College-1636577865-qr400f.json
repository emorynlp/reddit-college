I have really bad social anxiety so meeting new people has been really really hard. i\u2019ve met a few but i want to meet more and was invited to this club meeting tomorrow night that is having dinner at in n out. i want to go so bad but everytime i think about going, it makes me want to throw up and cry. so it\u2019s like i want to go but at the same time i don\u2019t. i know if i don\u2019t go i\u2019ll be sad and feel guilty afterwards. does anybody have any tips or tricks that help in these types of situations? thank you!",

      "text": "My biggest tip, and I don\u2019t mean it to sound blunt, is get over yourself. As in, don\u2019t be afraid of people thinking your stupid. Because what\u2019s wrong with that being the case?\n\nMy best advice is think more humbly. These peoples opinions don\u2019t matter, because you already accept you\u2019re a flawed and sometimes incompetent person. You\u2019ll inevitably look stupid sometimes. It\u2019s not unusual, and it\u2019s not a problem. Just go to enjoy yourself",
