  "text": "Title. I\u2019m lost on what to do. I\u2019ve gotten a low C and a high C on my last two exams (different classes) and it hurts so bad. I\u2019m a first year now and I was one of those straight A kids in high school. I knew things would be harder in college but I wasn\u2019t expecting to do so poorly. I\u2019ve been lying to my parents about my grades because I know they\u2019ll be disappointed. I do well on all of the assignments and then do poorly on the exams. I feel like I spend so much time studying just to screw things up. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore :(",

      "text": "A not-uncommon source of your problem for students today is caused by interactive assignments.  I don't know if that is your problem, but many have become used to having multiple chances to answer homework questions correctly.  \n\nThat can cause a lack of concentration before answering.  That failure to fully think leads to problems at test time.  On an exam, a student has to get it right the first time.  There is no, \"incorrect, please try again\" on a test.  If necessary, adapt that attitude when doing assignments.  It will help on tests.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in graduate school and I still regularly get Cs on exams despite getting As on most other assignments. It really doesn\u2019t matter that much and usually balances out in the end. Exams are just one way your knowledge is tested, some people do poorly on assignments but do really well on exams. Maybe exams just aren\u2019t your strong suit. \n\nThe less you stress out about it the easier it gets. In a decade you won\u2019t even remember it.",
