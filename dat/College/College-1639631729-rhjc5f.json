  "title:": "NYU ED Decision backing out because of not enough financial aid.",
  "text": "I got accepted to NYU for Early Decision, but I did not have enough financial aid for my parents to afford to send me there and my twin who got into NYU Shanghai. Can I back out of the ED binding contract? If I do back out of my ED, will it look back on my part? Will other colleges reject me because I broke the ED Contract? I am scared that this will affect me.",
