  "title:": "How many students actually end up studying for finals?",
  "text": "It\u2019s finals week and I just spent all day watching lectures and going over notes. I usually hang out with a group of guys during the week after class but am taking time to study this week. They keep getting together and I see in our group chat that some of them are bored. I don\u2019t understand this at all considering I have been so stressed with finals I\u2019ve barely been able to sleep. I understand that I probably study more than most people but how many students actually extensively study for finals?\n\nGood luck to all those on your finals! I\u2019m rooting for you!",

Bust your ass off through the semester and at the end figure out the lowest grade you need for an A. You don\u2019t want to be in the situation where you need a high grade to pass or a get a good grade. Obviously with good habits you aren\u2019t going to slack off but the amount of burden off your shoulders is worth it.",
