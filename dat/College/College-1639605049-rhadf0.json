  "title:": "At what GPA is someone good enough to major in subjects that are generally considered really hard like math/engineering/physics?",
  "text": "Assume this is a college that is not an elite one, has small classes, and is not really cutthroat. Also assume there are conscientious students who value what professors think of them and who don\u2019t want to be seen as foolish. Given your views on grade inflation or lack thereof, would you discourage a student who took Calc I in college (and did not take it in high school) and got a B in it (highest possible grade is A not A+). Is that good enough for the student to consider taking Calc II and perhaps majoring in math? If that is not sufficient information for you to answer my question, what overall GPA in a student is good enough to continue majoring in, say, math or CS? A 3.0? A 3.5? A 3.9?\n\nEdit: This isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about my friend\n\nEdit 2: My friend received a nasty comment from a professor at his school and is questioning a lot now. \n\nThank you.",

      "text": "A b and calc isn't terrible, and if they took it their first semester then they were busy learning about rooming with strangers, being disciplined, learning from college professors rather than high School teachers, and so many other distracting things that I think it's a good enough start. I would hope that if your friend continues to take math classes he'll get better in them just because he better knows how to be a college student. Most colleges, even if they don't have an actual strict application process to majors, tell you that you should probably have at least a b and all the prerequisite courses for your major. So for math he should get a beer higher in things like calc 1 and 2, linear algebra, approved class, etc. I think it should be anyone's goal to graduate with a 3.0 or higher just because that's the cutoff for a lot of job, or the cutoff at which you should put your GPA on a resume. A GPA below 3.0 usually doesn't look very good, so majoring in something where he can at least keep a 3.0 it's probably the only GPA related requirement I would have.",

      "text": "Provided one is dedicated to their major and eager to honestly learn, a GPA or a grade do not mean much. People fail classes with shocking frequency in college (it's not common, but also far from rare). There really aren't universally-harder majors, some universities are stronger in one field than another so you can really only compare amongst your own university. However, passion can more than make up for a lack of initial knowledge if one seriously likes their major. A 3.0 GPA or a B might not be winning any major awards for the highest GPA, but it is far from failing. If you like it, go for it.",
