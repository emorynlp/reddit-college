  "text": "Getting my BA in psychology in a few weeks which is supposed to be exciting, but I\u2019m in an absolute panic. I still haven\u2019t gotten any job offers despite applying countless places, and the interviews I have had are barely paying more than I make at Starbucks. I don\u2019t want to have to go live with my parents and still scrape by to pay off student loans and my car payment. I just feel like a failure. Anyone in a similar boat? And I can\u2019t just go straight into grad school at this point either.",

I encourage you to find something you\u2019re passionate about and pursue it with everything you\u2019ve got, regardless of the initial compensation. Love what you do. Love the people you do it with. Never stop learning. Good luck!",

          "text": "Actually, there\u2019s a lot of jobs that only require a bachelors or associates in psychology, some may require additional experience but they\u2019re still there. I intend to get my masters, but I can\u2019t get it directly out of college for a variety of reasons, and this is something I\u2019ve discussed with multiple professors and a counselor and they all agree taking a break before grad school is something they recommend. \n\nMy main worry is just the pause in between graduation and working, and the stress that comes with it. I\u2019ve been looking into a few different graduate programs but want to work first before I commit myself to a lot of debt for a field I don\u2019t actually even know I like.",

All of these are fields with entry level positions that either require or are interested in psychology degrees, and that\u2019s just in my small, rural area. \n\nTearing down students who are trying to further themselves is absolutely not appropriate behavior for professors.",
