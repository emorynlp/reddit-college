  "text": "I am doing my first research project in biology, but I am unable to find papers that relate to the study I want to conduct. If I find one that is relatable it's behind a paywall and I'm unable to access it via my school library. How do y'all find papers for your projects? Currently wanting to look into the overall protein content of feeder bugs for reptiles as well as a break down of the amino acids within each feeder bug.",

Just click the peer reviewed checkbox and type in key terms in the search box of what your paper will pertain to. It\u2019s called ProQuest central, I\u2019m wondering if that is available on your library\u2019s website?",
