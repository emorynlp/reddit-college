  "text": "Hey guys. Super frustrated at the moment because I have a really simple eco evo course and I can't seem to do better on exams. I have consistently been getting 60/75 which is the class average. This is my subject area and I know it well, and I have As in my other ecology classes, which is why I'm so frustrated. \n\nI did another post on how irritating the test questions are, so I won't go into that. Basically I just miss points on these ambiguously worded short answer questions (random looking deductions like 3.75/4 or 1/3 or whatever). It's a canvas exam but they leave no comments on our tests and instead go over what answers they were expecting later on (usually several weeks after because they take this long to grade a 22 question exam).\n\nSince that didn't clarify for me why they took off points, I emailed the two TAs asking them to take another look at my exam (just the 3 questionsi was most upset about). The one who doesn't grade was kind and offered to help, but said he could only give his best guess as to what the other TA was looking for. The grader TA simply told me he doesn't have time to look at my exam responses, and he has too many emails like mine.\n\nEmailed the prof to see if she or the other instructor would look it over and she said the same thing. \"This is a 600 person class... good luck with finals!\"\n\nI genuinely answered these questions according to the lecture slides and I genuinely do not see a valid reason why I lost so many points. Are we not entitled as students to have our assessments graded in more detail? If it was a black and white subject I'd understand, but ecology is complex and there are so many possibilities for numerous correct answers. The profs in this class have done entire 30 minute lectures on why we shouldn't email them begging for points back but their grading system is fucked up and I feel like I deserve to know what's going on.",

      "text": "Entitled...no. Should you be able to get feedback? Yes. Your frustration is totally understandable. There\u2019s just not typically a policy that says grades have to be returned along with any specific feedback. The only real policy is that final grades have to be submitted by a certain time; everything else in that vein tends to be ambiguous. It sounds like this class is so large that they don\u2019t have time to manage specific feedback (though I\u2019d find it difficult to believe that they wouldn\u2019t at least go over it with you if you went to their office hours).\n\nYou always have the option of filing a grade appeal if you have clear and convincing evidence that your grades are not accurate.",
