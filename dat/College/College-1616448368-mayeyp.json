After moving online because of the pandemic all the instructors were kinda just told to make it work...many complaining about lack of training and guidence.  So most likely they just took what they would normally do in the classroom and do it online.  So we get online group work.\n\nI'm older, was in HS in the late 90s and did some college in 00s before leaving. Came back in 19 and was shocked by how common the flipped class stuff was. I had never experienced it prior but knew of it as something being tried out in grades behind me and during my absence it jas apparently caught up.  Not a huge fan of it but I admit it can be helpful if done properly, which it isn't.  Seems more like a crutch to overcome swelling classroom sizes. And it certainly doesn't translate well to online.  At least I never saw it work out well.",

      "text": "This take comes from not being on the other side of this. I used to be an employer - and I am now a teacher. There are usually a top 3 of things employers ask for educators to focus on that would make students better prepared for a career or the work world.\n\n1. Communication skills (oral and written)\n2. Ability to work and interact in group and interpersonal interactions well\n3. Time management.\n\nWhether you like something or can't see the forest for the trees - group interactions require to some degree of all of the above. Moreso very few professors or educators force group work out of fun - multiple research studies point to purposeful use being a positive in education and retention, coupled with sponsors and businesses hammering on eductors to make sure those who move into the work world have been exposed if not are proficient and these are some of the metrics that are used against education as measurements of success or failure. Exposing students to various forms of group and inter personal interaction over time in small and large doses makes you more prepared for the pro's and con's as well as how to hopefully overcome this.\n\nFile this under the same category as most people not understanding that learning a broad set of subject areas isn't necessarily about learning what a parallelogram is but in learning various ways to learn and approach problem solving to give you a broad set of tools that can be transferable into unique and novel situations in the future (aka teach broadly and you might be able to apply those processes to multiple situations, teach narrow and that skillset functions in extremely limited situations if not only one).\n\n\\*Edit\\* on a personal level I hate group and partner work myself - but only because I have to deal with so many people who refuse to step up and do their bare minimum and I actually care about my education more than just a C...I have loved group and partner work in groups where everyone brings their best (and I have been in those groups before - you tend to see more of that when you into higher level coursework and or into more concentrated field studies).",

I had some group works since Covid started and I know it's hard first hand, but learning alone is hard as well and time consuming if you have to cover a whole topic yourself with job help. Once you're out of university noone asks what your plans or schedule says either and you're obliged to get your work done anyway. Key is to be able to depend on each other, for each member to do their work and find ways of effective working. Professors require you to actually know how to get things done and communicate with one another, which one should actually know already when they decided to go to university. \n\nThey don't appoint group works to annoy students but for them to master skills like cooperation, communication  and time management, just the things you'll need once you enter the work force.",

As for whether or not it resembles the \u201creal world\u201d and whether or not professors should strive to emulate it, in most work situations there is a baseline of accountability and assumed competence, as well as our schedules generally matching up. In the two major group projects I\u2019ve had during COVID, both times neither of us could line our schedules up effectively and there were constant technical issues related to sharing files. In the one group project even while my partner was communicative she absolutely sucked at everything she did and clearly did not care about the class and I was left fixing all of her mistakes. Im not saying this sort of thing never happens in the workplace, but a paycheck and continued employment is greater incentive to do the job well than an A.",

Sure, me as a team member need to make sure that the project gets done, but regardless of what the other students get as a grade, me, as maybe the only member that actually want to complete the project, will have to do *all* of the work.  Some professors don't even care to fail those dead weights, which leads to future group let down.\n\nIn your dead patients, collapsed bldg, engine failures scenerios, a bad performer won't(shouldn't, for what's at sake) last long enough for the supervisor to do nothing.  Maybe it's putting in someone else, or cutting your other commitments to focus, or whatever else.  In my experience in school, the professors just tell you to \"work it out with your groupmates\", which is **exactly** what causes the problem in the first place.\n\nJust face it:  there isn't enough at sake for group work to translate in school.  If you are a bad groupmate, no engine will fail, no bldg will collapse, no patient will die, and no one will be fired.",

Or lack thereof?  \nMore often than not, what happens is that I end up having to take on the workload of the others just to finish my the project and have something to submit. \n\nGroup projects in college and group projects at work are vastly different things. I\u2019m an assistant manager\u2014leading, delegating, and working with others is literally part of my job description. But even the laziest of my co-workers will complete the tasks they\u2019re assigned within a given timeframe because they want to KEEP their jobs. College students? Perhaps I\u2019ve just been seriously unlucky, but the ones I\u2019ve been partnered with do the bare minimum to get a passing grade, if that. \n\nMy last group project? One partner went completely AWOL and only made an appearance a week before the assignment was due with nothing to offer but an excuse that \u201cshe was sick.\u201d My other partner completed everything he was supposed to...but never on time. I preferred the partner who never did anything bc at least with her I knew I shouldn\u2019t expect anything. The project was 20% of my grade. While the professor did tell me to let her know which parts of the project I\u2019d completed, I still had to submit a finished project. It was time-consuming and stressful and all for a class that wasn\u2019t even a major req. \n\nTl;dr: college group projects suck when your partners are unreliable and uncommunicative and they are generally not a good reflection of what group projects on the job are like. Sometimes students get really unlucky with who they\u2019re partnered with, and some professors just don\u2019t seem to care that the \u201cgood\u201d students end up having to double their workload on top of an already full course load.",

I have been told by sales people and my superiors that one of my biggest assets is how good I am at communication and working with clients. \n\nThat being said, I have NEVER had a group project in school that was any where NEAR a real life work scenario of working with other people in a professional setting. This semester we were assigned a group project for a 45 minute presentation. Our group had 4 people. So not too bad, just around 10 minutes each. Well, one of the people dropped the 3rd week. So, we split his part between me and one of the other guys whose part was related to the drop guys. Then, (mind you we\u2019ve been working on this project for almost 6 weeks at this point) after having meetings where everyone said they were working on their parts and everyone assured they knew what they were doing and when to send it all to me to put it together into one power point, a second group me member goes no contact. Won\u2019t answer emails, texts, messages on our discord. Just disappears 3 days before the PowerPoint is due. So, since the one guy took most of the drop guys part, I have to take ghost guys part and finish it in 3 days...the week of midterms (did I mention I also work a full time, big girls job?). I did get it done. I also emailed the prof about the situation and had to take a day off work to study for my midterms. The kid had the gall to message me in the discord 20 minutes before class about A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENT!! His excuse? He was busy studying for midterms and wasn\u2019t checking any messages and thought it would be fine if he just added his stuff right before class. The prof was understanding, to a point. We are now a group of 2 giving a 45 minute presentation on Wed. Yeah, group work is the worst!",

Meaning, I\u2019ve worked with far too many students who don\u2019t care about grades and working hard, and far too few students who do, and that the only way to get a grade I\u2019m happy with in a group assignment is if I do a disproportionate amount of work myself.

I\u2019d also give them a piece of my mind, as I\u2019m sick of people wasting my time so I can get a good grade for a class that doesn\u2019t actually teach me anything that will make me money.",

I think group work over zoom is totally reasonable (I disagree with the OP) but I think it's pretty unreasonable for a professor to assign group work to students in completely different timezones. Work is easier to manage time wise because you have those 7 (or 8 or 9 or 10 or more but point still stands) hours blocked out of your day and when you're off work you're off work. It's just a weight off your shoulders after the day is over. Sure managers have to be on call and sometimes workers have times where they're on call in case of an emergency but the bulk of your work is during those hours and you have scheduled meetings on google calendar. If this is not the case please explain",

So why is it so important to place students under more unnecessary stress right now? I\u2019d bet if you asked someone who has to constantly deal with varying time zones, they\u2019d say that they would prefer not to have the headache. Or ask someone who spends all day on Zoom if they\u2019d rather get some of their own work done on their own time, if there\u2019s no concrete reason to constantly be in a meeting. Why impose those issues on those who aren\u2019t forced to deal with them for an actual reason, like job necessity? Just because others have to?",

                          "text": "I'll venture to give you an earnest reply, since I think Our Dear AgentOrange has finally subsided (and would probably have undermined their occasionally justified perspective with assholery anyway) and since you seem to be decently earnest yourself.\n\nLet me emphasize at the outset that \\[1\\] I don't think *all* group work is justified, nor are all forms of groupwork created equal.  Sometimes professors are just being lazy, and that sucks for everyone.  And \\[2\\] I know I'll probably be downvoted for this comment, so you can take me at my word here that I'm saying my piece with the sole hope that it actually gets heard (if only by you).\n\nThere are several factors that bear on your valid observation, that it seems \"every working adult is doing just fine\" at group work. The first and most obvious is that, in fact, they aren't. That's actually what makes collaboration so very horrible in the professional world to begin with. But conversely, working with people who are *good* at collaboration can absolutely be wonderfully rewarding and--perhaps more important from the business's perspective--far more effective than individual quasi-drone labor.  That leads to the second factor, that you're actually dealing with a selectivity bias here: not all of those who participate in group work at the college level will actually get a job that requires collaboration, at least in part because of their failings in the college system. To be precise, your co-workers will have been selected specifically for their ability to create a superior final product, which often and inevitably requires collaboration. Which brings me to the third factor (to which I can attest both professionally and anecdotally), that--believe it or not--serious students actually improve *greatly* over their years in college.  The labor is admittedly unpleasant and pays dividends only gradually, but as a rule, seniors are far better at this than freshmen; and if you, as a senior, feel that the freshman is unbearable to work with, you might reflect that (although it didn't seem like it at the time) you yourself might have been not that different to work with four years ago, and it was in part the benefit of observing upper-classmen that got you where you are today.  Which brings me to the final factor, that group work--like pretty much everything, I guess--becomes easier and more productive with earnest practice.  In other words, people get better at it over time.  And by definition, high-level employees have the benefit of not only four or more years of practice at the undergraduate level, but also their entire past career of experience, which can amount to ten years, twenty years or more.  The sooner you learn how to work well in a collaborative environment, however miserable, the better it will be for you, your co-workers, and your future employer (who often sucks but at least gives you money).\n\nForgive me if that's not what you were asking, but hopefully that helps clarify some things.",

Universities are funded by more than student fees and tuition, things like endowments, donations, advertisements, sponsorships, government bonds and funds, etc. But yes, students do pay their University for education, and Professors do provide education as a service. And yes, there is an entire approach to higher education that involves considering the Professor-Student relationship as one of customer service. \n\nThis is one of the many reasons it\u2019s asinine to compare the role of a student to the role of an employee. It\u2019s an outdated correlation.\n\nFurthermore, even if it was valid comparison, as in if being a student and employee were the same thing, it\u2019s still a shitty comparison. Work projects aren\u2019t the same as school team projects and school team projects don\u2019t make you great at work projects simply because a school project has little framework to provide measured insight into being a successful collaborator. \n\nLEAST OF ALL this example, because there are literally zero managers who would assign a project of value to an employee and assign other resources to the project without first making sure all of the resources could effectively work on the project together, as in would have a way to communicate and meet across time zones. Or if they did, they would be a terrible manager and the company would suffer. In fact, businesses spend a significant amount of money and time figuring out how to ensure their employees can successfully complete projects together, across issues like time zones. Very few, at least the successful ones, just say make it work, with zero tools or advice or support. That is outdated thinking and the business world knows now how much of a waste of money that is. So no, no manager would do this in the real world. Idiot.",

But online class group work that goes outside the classroom doesn\u2019t work, even in-person out of classroom projects doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\nIn the real world you have set amount of time allocated to a job, mostly the same time period as coworkers, and you get work done in it for the most part. For school projects that you do out of class, you now are working on other peoples time, time that doesn\u2019t revolve around the class you have the project in(other classes, part time jobs, random life things). So when trying to collaborate to do a task you are restricted to a very specific time frame, one time frame that could also fluctuate depending on the certain group.\n\nWith all these different variables at play between you and group partners, it then makes the ability to receive a certain grade somewhat dependent on group members schedules outside of the class, which to me seems as an unfair way to assess people\u2019s knowledge on the material, or even willingness to put enough effort in their part",

But for a managerial job, it\u2019s that your job, and you\u2019re expected to surround your life with it. With that being said it is completely reasonable and almost expected that work will follow you on the way home.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, although you hope that school closely emulates the real world, you are first there for the the knowledge you gain and the grades that come along with it. Once you are forced to factor in other people\u2019s schedules that vary person by person, you are essentially getting rid of the even playing field that is what makes school great. Then the knowledge and gpa is now coming second to real world experience, which even though it is important, in this particular scenario the two are more important than the latter, as you can learn to struggle with other people schedules once you get to that point in your career.\n\nNow this is my personal opinion, but I don\u2019t think  struggling to complete a project with three other people whose life isn\u2019t focused around this task is that realistic to the real world anyway (in the real world you may have to meet with many other people, but that\u2019s mostly their main 40 hour a week job as well, so they\u2019re ready to give like 80% at least)",

I think the problem we've seen often with group projects this year is that it's rarely the case.\n\nSome classes don't have in-class time set aside for working together, or have it very rarely, so you have to get together on your own time. That presents problems when you have group members who have jobs or whose class schedules are different, and it gets worse when you have time zone differences (someone in a couple of my classes is 5 hours ahead of us, for example). In those cases, you have to try to cram in a meeting and hope you can delegate tasks well within that, whereas with work you have time designated to meet at least to touch base.\n\nThen there is the added difficulty of whether your partners are cooperative. The reliability of partners on group projects was hit and miss in person, but it has been worse online. I've had three group projects this year, and each time I've had *at least* one person who doesn't even show up to class and ghosts us. When you see someone face to face, you have at least a vague sense of accountability and an idea of where your groupmates are at, but online that's harder. I know last time I had a group project, everyone slapped on their slides the night before the presentation, so I had *no idea* if they'd follow through. At my job, meanwhile, we've had collaborating researchers who fall behind, but they still have *some* incentive to do things since they're paid and they need to maintain relationships within their professional network. \n\nMy job has been mostly remote for 2 years, so I agree that it's a valuable skill to be able to work at a distance, but I don't think this environment is representative of a remote work environment.",
