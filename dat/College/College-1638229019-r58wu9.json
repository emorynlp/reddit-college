  "text": "Hey guys, I know there are ALOT of educated people on reddit so I have two options for college and I need any advice I can get\n\nOption 1:  I am graduating highschool early because of my grades. I will work full time from january until the next fall term and then attend a community college and pay it all off. I will get my associates degree, I will then find a job in the related field. I will work full time while pursing my bachelors degree part time. By the time I get my bachelors degree I will be 24 with enough experience to start getting higher paid positions/ hopefully management roles. I will be in little debt as my full time job will help pay it off.\n\nOption 2: Work for Sams club or Walmart. They will pay for 100% college (Online Only) Thats the downside, I will get my bachelors degree at 22. Have no experience in the field I desire to be in, work an entry level role and hopefully become manager in 5-6 years. \n\nANY advice/criticism is wanted, Thank you!",

              "text": "I believe that in general business majors make enough to come out ahead of small amounts of student loans. I wouldn't go the Walmart route. I would also do some research and really run the numbers to see if finishing a bachelor's faster would be better, or how easy it is to get an HR job with only an associate's.\n\nIt seems like your ambitious and organized enough, that you might even consider going directly to a four-year University if you could get scholarships and be the top of your class, because you'll have much better connections and opportunities there if you're interested in being an employee of a massive company. There's a risk to that reward though, and the safe option would definitely be the community College route and then transfer.",
