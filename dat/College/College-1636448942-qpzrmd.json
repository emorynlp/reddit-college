  "text": "I\u2019m a first year pharmacy student but have for a lot of my life wanted to become a doctor/surgeon. I didnt apply due to the anticipation of failing to get into or not succeding in it but have now realised that I would have been accepted and probobly done well in it. Im afraid to change uni as it will mean a loss year aswell as a year longer study meaning i would start working later along with the requiered residency it takes being a doctor. What should i do. Also the pay for doctors in my country is worse than pharmacist and emolyment and a good speacility is hard to get.",
