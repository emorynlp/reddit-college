  "title:": "In-State Tuition? What do I do?!",
  "text": "I am 26, and was born and raised in Texas. Have never lived anywhere else. My vehicle is registered in Texas. My driver\u2019s license is in Texas. I am a registered voter in Texas. I currently attend a community college, and was planning to transfer to a 4yr university here in Texas next Fall. \n\nMy boyfriend is in the army, and is getting temporarily stationed in South Carolina; we will both be moving there June next year and be there for 1-2 years. I will not qualify for in-state tuition in SC because I will not have lived there for 12 consecutive months prior to my semester. \n\nThis brings me to my question: am I still a Texas resident, and qualify for in-state tuition at the school I planned to go to? My degree program is online, so I can complete it anywhere. \n\nMy parents live here in Texas. I can use their address, but I want to do things the right way. \n\nI plan to work while in SC. If I do use my parents\u2019 address, will I be in hot water when I files income taxes in SC? \n\nPlease help!\n\nEdit: My boyfriend and I are not getting married anytime soon!",

      "text": "I was in the same situation and never had any difficulties getting in-state tuition while in another state. Just make sure you keep the majority of your mailing addresses in Texas. Schools usually do not look heavily into your taxes and things of that nature, as long as you still have a Texas license and vehicle registration. As far as they know, you could be there visiting and picked up a job.",

However you may have issues if you use FAFSA but not really sure about their guidelines or if they check.",
