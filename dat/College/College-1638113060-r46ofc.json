  "text": "my academics are okay, they're not the worst but they're not really the best either. I usually average with 85 to 95 percent.\n\nI'm not really sure whether to major in comp sci or physics. I really enjoy physics and computer science but physics doesn't really make a lot of cash and takes a lot of time and on the other hand, computer science is really fun as well and doesn't take a lot of time to find a good job but working under a company that really isn't all that ethical and does make me feel a bit iffy.\n\nand computer science doesn't really make you feel like you're part of something bigger. \n\nis it really worth it to major in two things because you're unsure?",

      "text": "I studied physics and astronomy as a double major in undergrad, and exams weren\u2019t (and still aren\u2019t) my strength. I would say that if you\u2019re interested in studying something, then just go for it. You\u2019ll find the motivation to stick with the topic or course if you truly enjoy it. Talk with professors if you get stuck, have a study group to work through problems with, do many, many practice problems to make sure you understand concepts. Being unsure of a subject is totally normal, and you can always major in physics and take a few intro comp sci courses to see if you like it or not, and then decide to add on the second major. And CS courses never hurt anyone, and it might even be really beneficial for your physics background depending on what research you want to pursue. I hope this helped, and if you have any other questions about the physics major feel free to pm me!",
