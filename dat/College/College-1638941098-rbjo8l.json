The night after that occurred the power went out and my roommates and I were legit thinking it was some sort of retaliation attack. But it was just a regular power outage. We didn't sleep at all that night though.",

      "text": "Current senior, Hurricane Ida happened this semester. We\u2019ve had hurricanes before but never like this. Lots of people evacuated. I live on campus as an RA and we have backup generators, so I was extremely lucky. Post-storm, I was napping in my dorm and woke up to my residents knocking on my door to ask if I knew why the power was out. We never got power back & had to be bussed elsewhere to go home for a month. Obviously all is well now, but packing in complete darkness to evacuate college for the 2nd time (1st being covid) was a truly surreal experience.",

In my management class of over 400 people, a student stopped the professor in the middle of teaching because somehow she got scammed (or robbed?) through her cryptocurrency account. She asked the professor to ask if anyone in the class had experience with crypto. Her and the student that was helping her were gone for about half the class and when she came back she left to go to the bank because she definitely did lose a lot of money apparently.",

After our history class while we were leaving the door some girl came up to me and my friends and asked if we wanted a donut. We said no and she said \u201cOh you guys don\u2019t smoke?\u201d. To this day I\u2019m confused why she said that and if those donuts were like weed donuts lmao.",
