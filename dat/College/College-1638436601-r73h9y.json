  "text": "Tldr; advice for freshman sorely lacking in confrontation skills??\n\nI was hoping to adjust, but I\u2019ve just been building up resentment for the past few months. She\u2019s been causing me a lot of stress (and tbh, causing my suitemates issues too due to shared bathroom).\n\nI asked her if she could not do vape in the room couple weeks ago, and she said she likes to do it while she works and can\u2019t do it outside bc it\u2019s not allowed on campus. Idk why this meant to her she could do it in the shared dorm without asking, but I did mark on the roommate survey that I did NOT want smoking or vaping in my room. I don\u2019t care if she does it elsewhere. \n\nI don\u2019t want to mention the vape to the RA since it\u2019ll be documented, but idk how to ask her not to do it in our room, where it\u2019s not allowed in the first place, since the first time didn\u2019t go great. I want to be understanding bc she has mental health issues, but so do I, and I\u2019m trying my best to live with others while coping with it.  \n\nVomit on the toilet, messy counter, rotting food, and incredible mess are some other issues I\u2019ve been having. Literally every person who\u2019s visited our room\u2019s first comment is \u201cwow, I thought my room was messy\u201d. My other roommate and I have asked her to clean up, and her answer is always \u201clater\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tired rn\u201d. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m at the end of my rope. She\u2019s just been frustrating to deal with, but I\u2019m still on the fence about moving out bc I\u2019m really close with the people on my floor now, and me and my suitemate get along extremely well. My other roommate is great, she\u2019s amazingly neat and I like to think we get decently along. Also, it\u2019s honestly a pain in the ass to drag all my stuff down the hill a quarter into school. I didn\u2019t want to start beef, but I\u2019m not sure how to differentiate being nice and being a doormat\u2026 \n\nAny advice for a freshman severely lacking in confrontation skills??",
