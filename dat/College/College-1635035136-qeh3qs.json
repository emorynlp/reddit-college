  "text": "Last Fall I was a computer science major and I switched out of it because I was super stressed out by it, then in the spring I was also super stressed taking classes that were not computer science (I think the stress just came from all my classes being online), this semester I am starting to take more STEM classes again and am going to go back to computer science in the Spring, has anyone else done something like this?",
