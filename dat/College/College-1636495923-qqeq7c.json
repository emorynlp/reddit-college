  "title:": "Is it better to get a PhD in something like astrophysics or engineering instead of a PhD in applied math or stats if the end goal is to be a quant?",
  "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I\u2019d love to do a PhD in either (astro)physics, statistics, or applied math. Regardless though, my end goal is to work as a quant (or possibly a data scientist). \n\nInitially, from looking at recent hires at large firms and asking around, it seemed that a PhD in stats would be the \u201csafest\u201d/most popular route, followed by something called operations research (which is essentially just applied math). However, after doing some more research, it seems that a PhD in applied math would be better than stats since it not only encompasses most of the stats you\u2019ll use as a quant/data scientist, but also teaches you to develop new mathematical models from scratch, which is essentially what being a quant is. Moreover, I think its quite possible to get a MS in stats on the road to a PhD in applied math. \n\nHowever, once I started looking at the curricula of the leading applied math programs, it seemed that most of the classes were essentially just the means to an end for solving problems in the physical sciences or engineering. For instance, a graduate sequence in applied PDEs would be geared almost entirely towards solving problems in physics and engineering. I cant help but wonder if then a PhD in physics or engineering would be a better idea, since it would encompass a good amount of these mathematical techniques (albeit without proofs), could easily be tailored to include more advanced statistics, and lets you learn about a super cool science. \n\nIs there something that I\u2019m missing? I would appreciate any input!",

      "text": "Unfortunately, I'm not that familiar with what a quant does (like... at all, so I'm going to go by what [it says here](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/92q5ck/the_types_of_math_i_need_to_know_to_be_a_quant/e37pe6p/)) but I *am* very familiar with what you learn in grad school statistics and applied math programs.\n\nMy advice is to focus less on what you get the PhD degree in and more on making sure you get into and attend a program that does research in an area that aligns with your career goals. Find out what sort of jobs students get once they graduate with their PhD. The program you want is the program that graduates students who get quant jobs.\n\nI've seen people \"change\" PhD programs between statistics and applied math and physics and applied math, so the coursework isn't *hugely* different, although you certainly will be studying different things. The foundations are very similar though, and from what I gather, it's the foundations that allow you to become a quant.\n\nWhen it comes to a PhD, remember, too, that you'll be spending years of your life devoted to this and are going to be working your ass off. You can get a quant job with any of the PhD's you mentioned, so get the PhD that you're most interested in. The PhD that you're most interested in is the one that is going to be the best choice, because that's the one that you will be able to finish and will be able to be successful in.\n\nEdit: I should add that as someone in stats who has taken some core classes with PhD students in engineering, I've noticed that many/most of them *really* struggle with stuff that's pretty basic for someone looking to apply statistics in their career. For this reason, I would actually advise highly against a PhD in engineering. I'd suspect you might be okay with a PhD in physics, though, but I don't know too many people in that area, so don't take my word for it.",
