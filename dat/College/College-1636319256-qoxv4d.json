  "text": "I really wanna move away from my parents for college because I can\u2019t stand studying in that same house for 4 more years, I love my parents don\u2019t get me wrong, but I need silence to function. What are reasonable ways to go to college away from parents without taking the burden of loans and such? I\u2019m Muslim so I can\u2019t take interest loans. Do a lot of people get accepted to financial need colleges?",

If you are able to accept aid/grants, file for FAFSA, state aid, local aid, major-specific grants, and demographic-specific grants.\n\nInterest-bearing loans for school are potentially a necessity that would be availed of assuming you have made strong attempts to avoid them up until the point where you took any (and paid them off very quickly to minimize the interest). I'm not qualified at all to speak on it but there is a good deal of sharia-specific literature on student loans that you might want to read up on, including interpretations of the current types of student loans available and how they are structured.\n\nYou should research interest-free loan sources. There aren't many options but they are out there.",
