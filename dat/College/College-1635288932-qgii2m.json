  "title:": "Should I Keep My Art Minor?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m in my last semester, which ends the third week of December. I\u2019m taking two art studio classes and the rest of the requirements for my major (Environmental Science). I\u2019m super overwhelmed in my on art class and about 50% of the work I have to do is from that class, leaving me little personal time, little time for other classes, and gives me a ton of anxiety. I\u2019m approaching the end of the semester but we still have so much more work/projects to do. I\u2019m seriously considering dropping the class and by extension dropping my art minor. I need 2 studio classes to get it, so if I drop this one class I won\u2019t be able to get it at the end of the semester. \n\nDo I drop the class and save my self the stress but not get the minor? \nOr:\nDo I try and stick it out and possibly fail the class and get worse grades than I would like in my other classes for the opportunity to maybe get the art minor?\n\nDoes an art minor really even mean anything?\n\nAny advice would be helpful!!!",
