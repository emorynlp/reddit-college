  "title:": "How to move more during online classes?",
  "text": "All of my college classes and all of my educational trainings have been online since the pandemic. As a result I've gained weight, but what's even worse is that I've messed up my back from all of the sitting.\n\nThe professors are ruthless. They don't see our faces, so forget to give us bathroom breaks, or just keep going because they think most of us aren't actually there and we're doing what ever we want anyway.\n\nI just had a class which lasted 5 hours, with one 20 minute break. I'm about to have another 3-hour one in 10 minutes.\n\nI try to move as much as I can when I have free time, but these past weeks I've had exams and deadlines, and I ended up sitting the whole day, nearly every day.\n\nI have an exercise machine at home, but I cannot really use it during class, as they're making us actively participate, so I have to have my hands free in most of the classes. Also, my focus isn't really there when I'm sweating and trying not to die on the machine. \n\nI know some people can just let the class run in the background on mute, but I am not one of those people. I care about my grades and the impression I leave.\n\nI'm honestly defeated and out of ideas. My mind is so fried from all of the classes, that I can't come up with any solutions right now. Any suggestion will help.\n\nThank you!",
