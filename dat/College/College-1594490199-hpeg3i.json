  "title:": "Tips for the students who are worried about their college classes being all online and won\u2019t be able to focus since they are basically self-teaching themselves",
  "text": "I highly recommend you guys buy the book \u201cThe Science of self-learning\u201d that book really helped me when I was teaching myself my classes since I had two semesters in the row of all online classes (This was before covid). Also make sure you guys right every due date down. Personally I use the app \u201cMy Homework Student Planner\u201d since I can write all my due dates down and it will give me a notification on the day of when my assignments are due so I can due that same day. It helps because I have a lot of doctor appointments because of my disability and I can easily forget if I have homework due if I don\u2019t have a physical reminder so that text notification is really helpful.\n\nEdit: The book \u201cThe Science of Self-learning\u201d is by Peter Hollins\n\nEdit Edit: Holy shit! 204 upvotes?!!! I don\u2019t deserve this many I just wanted to share some tips since I did whole year of online classes and can offer some advice but thank you so much.\n\nEdit x3: if you need help focusing while studying I recommend downloading the app \u201cForest\u201d. It\u2019s an that uses the pomodoro technique. Basically you set the timer in the app and watch a tree grow. If you take your phone off the forest to go web search or something like that tree will die and and you have to start over. Most people don\u2019t wanna see a tree die so it helps forces you to get off your phone and actually focus on what you are doing in that moment.\n\nEdit x4: If you have problems with retaining info then I suggest you write you notes in class on paper and then transfer to computer app such as Microsoft OneNote or Evernote. Since you are rewriting it you naturally will retain more of it.",

That\u2019s my theory at least.\n\nNo. That's just.... no. \n\nOnline classes are often more expensive to operate, in total, but the instructional costs are the same as f2f.  There's no quota, they're trying to fit student needs as well as they can. There's also this dumb ICE rule about international students hanging over their heads.\n \nRight now, admin don't want to paint themselves into a corner. They're trying to keep options open as long as they can. Things are changing every day. \n\nThere's no conspiracy to take things out on students. Right now, higher ed is desperately trying to help students stay safe and stay in school. But like everyone, they have budgets and other things (politics) outside their control.",

Treating a vaccine like an inevitability is ridiculous), society will eventually reach a level of acceptable risk regarding coronavirus. We are not going to be quarantining this and social distancing that forever. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so hard to understand about that. It\u2019s unsustainable. \n\nAs corona continues to ravage the country, the medical field gains increased knowledge about how the virus affects us, the best treatments for those that do get seriously sick, and overall how to manage it. If distance learning goes on long enough plenty of universities, and businesses as a whole for that matter, literally cannot afford to stay open and will close their doors permanently. \n\nPast a certain point, society as a whole will eventually say \u201cenough is enough and it is what it is.\u201d I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the right move or the wrong move, but it is the inevitable move regardless of how shitty it sounds.",

I'm getting a BS in the job I already have/do - I even sometimes find it challenging, despite already knowing the material!\n\nI use a combination of Google Calendar/Tasks to keep track of my due dates and make a habit of looking at it daily. On Sundays, I take a look at my obligations for the week (I work full-time) and plan out times I will work on a given assignment. If I think an assignment is going to take two hours, I block off 10am-12pm on Monday. Having that time committed helps me avoid leaving things to the last minute, or having to do schoolwork when I want to be doing something else.\n\nGood luck to you all in the upcoming semester!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  ETA - I highly recommend a Pomodoro technique timer app for your phone!
