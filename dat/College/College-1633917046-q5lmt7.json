  "text": "Im taking an into into psy class (first semester btw) and im terrified. The professor makes us take online quizzes and the midterm is much like them. I didnt do so hot on the last two of them even though i thought i did fine at the time. I know the material but the way the quizzes are formated makes them way harder than is should be. Ive contacted my professor asking for advice and he just said the question are wrong. Im not failing or anything but this midterm could very well mqke that happen. I plan on studying a ton this week before it but every time it creeps into my mind i begin to cry. Im scared how ill be effected mentally as im pretty sensitive and ive never failed a class before. Im so scared to the point of hoping ill be able to sleep and not be kept up all night. Idk what to do.",
