I just need the first semester class for my major.\n\nI really shit the bed on the exam and it was worth almost 50% of our grade. I will fail the exam regardless but if she bumps it up 1% I will pass the class.\n\nIs it worth a shot?",

      "text": "second to a lot of professors here i agree. i never asked for things like these from any professors but often times three would email me giving me an option for extra credit or such if they saw my grade was lacking a bit. i always tried my best in class and i but think my professors saw it. or maybe i got a good batch or professors. regardless if you tried your best know your professors saw it and that it is very likely they will approach you or bump up on their own if it\u2019s only 1% to pass. they do not want you to fail. i don\u2019t think you should ask as a lot of professors are saying not to. but from my personal experience it\u2019s likely they will bump up your grade.",

      "text": "FWIW, as a professor, I don't really give these requests much consideration.  For some of the same reasons outlined here.  It feels too much like special treatment and if all a student has to do to get a better grade is ask, it devalues the work they've done and the work others have done and as a rule, I ignore specific requests.  I tend to take a holistic view of grades and when students' efforts aren't in line with their earned grades, I consider that.  If a student who hasn't done well on an exam has put a lot of effort into classroom discussions or has met outside of class to discuss their issues in advance, that's worth something and is rewarded.  Not helpful to you now, but perhaps something to consider going forward.  If you know you're headed for a wall, it helps to do something about it before you smack into it.  That has helped me in the past as a student and a professional.\n\nAlso, failure is a part of life and a lesson that needs to be learned and a feeling that needs to be felt.  It takes many shapes throughout life.  Failure makes you stronger and it makes you better.  The feeling of failure and the experience of it makes your successes that much more important and valued.  You really earned those successes because your path has been dotted with disappointments and failures.  There is value in considering what failures mean to you and your life path.  Failures hurt and it's easy to get down about stumbles along the way.  Don't.  But also don't think you are doing yourself any favours by avoiding the hard moments in life and school.  That's a recipe for future pain.\n\nI suppose there is a risk analysis in your exercise.  There is a possibility that it does you no good if your professor takes my approach, in which case, there is little risk to you.  There is a possibility that your professor takes a much harder line approach, in which case there is a significant risk that the result is adverse to your interest.  In either event, I would suggest that grade grubbing (or whatever you consider it) is not a good look and is a very temporary solution to a perennial and permanent problem in which you only end up short-changing your future self.  Look at what you get in exchange for what it costs you.\n\nBe well and best of luck to you.",
