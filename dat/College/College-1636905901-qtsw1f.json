  "title:": "trouble making friends on campus (and within my major)",
  "text": "i\u2019ve never had a particularly hard time making friends in new environments before but this semester proved to be particularly difficult. my freshman year was entirely online, people who decided to stay on campus last year already have their own friend groups, and i tend to stick with my friends from high school that i already know or with my roommates. whenever i\u2019m in social situations i\u2019ve been less inclined to talk to people than i was pre-covid. i have no friends in my major (or i haven\u2019t really talked to the people i met the first week of school in my major classes) and none of my roommates are the same major as me so it\u2019s been hard because i don\u2019t have anyone to study with. how can i make more friends, at least next semester?",
