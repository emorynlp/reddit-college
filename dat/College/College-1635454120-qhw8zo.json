  "text": "I have about $4,000 total between my checking and savings account. If I understand this correctly, the more money I have the less money I could be eligible for. I am debating sending the majority of my money to my younger siblings account so I can enter a low number for the fafsa then having my sibling return it to me after.\n\nWould that work? Will they see I transferred money out?",
