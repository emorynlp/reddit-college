  "text": "I feel like I\u2019ve been working hard this semester - it being my very first one at college as a freshman.\nI\u2019m a computer science major and I\u2019m taking an intro class and have never coded before in my life. It\u2019s been a difficult class for me if I\u2019m being honest. I\u2019ve reached out and asked for help and spent hours into this class. I was told that if this was hard for me then it\u2019s only going to get harder/worse from here..\n\nI\u2019ve gotten full points on my coding assignments but my midterm averages around the 60s. \nI try to do practice problems but then when the exam rolls around sometimes my mind blanks or I\u2019m not sure what to do or it\u2019s different than the problems I practiced on. \nI\u2019ve been trying to do lots of coding practice problems - but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s effective. Sometimes I just stare at my problems since I\u2019m not sure what to do and research other/more practice problems or design a study plan and then just like that most of my day is wasted. I just get so stressed out and burnt out. Or I try to copy the code and understand it. \n\nI want to improve but there\u2019s so many resources and not all of them go over the things we\u2019ve learned in class. Sometimes it includes additional content we haven\u2019t learned. \n\n\nI also have been putting work in my Calc 2 class. I have done well I think, I slowly have been improving and got in the 80s on my recent midterm. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m proud of myself or not. Because while I\u2019ve been working hard, it never feels like it\u2019s enough or effective. \n\nToday I really felt discouraged and thought that maybe this isn\u2019t the path for me if everyone is saying it should be easy. Maybe im just not smart. But I also don\u2019t want to give up because I don\u2019t enjoy it, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s hard for me.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how to go about the final for these classes. Im so overwhelmed and pressured. Especially because I need to have good grades for the degree and my scholarship and such.  I just don\u2019t know..",

      "text": "80s in calc 2 is respectable IMO...I don't really know what advice I could give you, but you at least seem like you're being proactive with your study plans and what not. I'd say make sure you're taking a break at certain times too, don't forget to take a moment to do not school. When I lived on campus that hour or so to go to the gym was my built in study break.",

      "text": "Success in Comp Sci isn\u2019t As - I have several friends who regularly got Cs, but are now very successful programmers. If you are dedicated to this degree, toss your preconceptions out the window.\n\nPlan to get Bs if you\u2019re awesome, and expect your degree to take at least 5 years. What you\u2019re learning is hard, and smart people have failed trying. Repetition may be the best you can do sometimes.\n\nIf you\u2019re not passionate about the material though, quit now. You\u2019ll put yourself in a hole if you go forward only to quit later.",

      "text": "I don't have much advice for how to prepare for finals, but as a fellow comp sci major, I was in your situation last year as someone who didn't have any coding experience and I felt a similar way when learning how to code. Hell, I think I still feel that way sometimes when going back and trying out practice problems sometimes. The best thing for you to do right now is to keep harassing your TA's/professors into helping you with code, go to the tutoring center if your university has one, and keep learning the logic of why things work. As long as you keep getting help from your TA's/professors, you'll definitely be prepared for some of those later courses that you'll encounter, as well as becoming a great programmer.",
