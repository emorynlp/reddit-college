  "text": "I'm in my first year of college and I'm thinking of repeating as I'm not happy with my performance this year. I'm half way through and I want to just hit the reset button and try again as I'm too scared to keep going. I haven't been a good student this year and I've been wasting my colleges resources and I want to start again in first year and do better. is this frowned upon by staff in a university?",

      "text": "Other comment mentioned about the worth of taking the same courses again. If you have C\u2019s, take it as a learning experience and move on into your degree. Restarting college seems like a waste of money in my opinion just bc the grades were bad. I have a few C\u2019s on my record and can\u2019t imagine retaking them just bc they are C grade so I don\u2019t have to suffer the content again, especially my gen ed Chemistry class.

      "text": "As an instructor of record I sometimes do question why a student would retake a class with me. If it didn't work out well the first time, I think that it's better for them to take the course with a different instructor because it is too easy for them to fall into the same patterns because they know me.\nIn the end, I don't really care because it doesn't really affect me that much, but I just feel that they'd probably be better off starting over with someone else and with fresh expectations",
