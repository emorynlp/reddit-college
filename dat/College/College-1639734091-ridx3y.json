  "title:": "I'm a junior at university that just failed all but one of my classes, and my mental health was no help. Has anyone recovered from this? Any advice? I need to understand my options to continue in my education (and life).",
  "text": "I'm a junior in college. I pay my own way other than my parents help with my food plan. Only adding that to the back story for financial reasons. \n\nBefore I get the \"just keep going\" comments, my mental health in college has always been bad. But I can't afford therapy.  My family won't help me without controlling (or trying to through guilting me) who I see for a therapist (they would have to fit a bunch of requirements just for my parents let alone me). This semester I could almost never get out of bed. I just want it all to be over. I had dreams. But now, I can't even afford the help I need even if I did trust people because no one I know has that kind of money. My university is booked up, and while administrators are frustrated about that because they are supposed to offer services to students, that expansion is.. Well, slow as molasses.\n\nI was trying to build my GPA from what I thought was a bad first semester slowly so I could graduate with a 3.5 in the honors college (I've never gotten all A's) but I had a 3.1 beginning this fall. Now I'm going to have about a 2.5-2.6. I would have to basically get an entire other degree to get a 3.5, let alone any higher... So my first thought was cut things.. I work because I have to pay bills, so I can't cut that. But I can't cut school right now either because my scholarship to go here will be forfeited if I leave (yes, I checked) and I'm at the minimum credit hours for my college degree (16) I don't see how succeeding and graduating is even possible, let alone anything post graduate.\n\nWhen I was first starting college I was depressed, but I loved the material. At this point I KNOW (like 100%) that it's not a material comprehension issue. In fact, I've probably robbed myself of the opportunity to have comprehension issues because I either haven't learned and I'm just guessing or I've been depressed for so long even if I am smart enough then I'm just not good enough cause my mind goes hopeless quick. I'm not sure. I don't want to be treated differently because my grades are a reflection and snapshot of my mental health basically 24/7, like I don't want to be pitied. I recognize my grades are my responsibility, and school/professors shouldn't feel obligated to help me or let me turn in things late when I can't get out of bed. I need to manage it and do better and be better. That's on me.\n\nBut damn.. I'm so tired of waking up and making my reality of grades worse even though I'm trying to get better on my own. I'm trying. I TRIED this semester and now the silent 3.5-3.0 cutoff of grad school even is going away. Has anyone ever come out of this?? I still... Well.. I wanted to pursue my field. I still had passion about it. I know I'm not good enough but I have the attitude. I could do it if I wasn't stuck all the time in my head. But the computer that will kick me out of grad school before I even start does not give a crap about my excuses. \n\nSorry for the long post. I need advice on understanding how to graduate from here and if anyone else has had anything similar happen? Thanks.",
