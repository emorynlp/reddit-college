  "title:": "Torn between Econ/business and Engineering.",
  "text": "Because Studylink ( in the Netherlands) only allows 4 applications for a given year, I'm torn between following my dream of doing Engineering or Econ.\n\nThe thing is that the Netherlands is more of a financial hub rather than an engineering/science powerhouse and would like to make the most out of my money because I come from outside the EU.\n\nI also know that moving from Engineering to Business is easy but the other way around not so much, so I really can't decide what to prioritize.\n\nI'm currently applying at RUG, Erasmus, and Vrije for Applied Physics, Economics, and Mathematics respectively. The fourth spot will most likely go to TU/e for engineering or UvA for business.\n\nDo you have any opinions?",

Answer these questions to see which is best for you (ME Engineering student senior btw):\n\n1.)Do you enjoy problem solving for hours and hours a day? \n2.)Are you interested in Stockmarket?\n3.)If your homework is too hard will you give up or keep studying through it until you understand?\n4.)Social Life or Exam prep?\n5.)Does taking a class where 50% of class gets below a C grade scare you?\n\nIf you answered 1,3,5 your engineering.\nIf you answered 2,4 your business and economics.",
