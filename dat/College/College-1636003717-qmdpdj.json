  "text": "My one prof is always the \u2018fun teacher\u2019 during lectures. He jokes around and talks about interesting stuff during class which is awesome...\n\nUntil it comes time to do assignments. Now all of a sudden I\u2019m trying to learn all these concepts for the first time from a text. Plus the assignments are quite difficult, and he marks very hard.\n\nWhy would our prof waste our lecture time knowing how much work we have to put into the assignments ?",

      "text": "One of my professors is teaching as if someone is forcing them to. During the class, she pauses a lot, reads everything form the PowerPoint, when someone asks something, she opens the page the question was related and reads it aloud, plus, we are taking it online. When she gives us assignments it\u2019s nothing like the class, it is so complicated and difficult. So- I really don\u2019t know what to do. I have to study literally everything to answer a bunch of questions. I guess they are really everywhere.",
