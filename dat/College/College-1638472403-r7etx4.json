  "title:": "Emailing a Lab Professor Advice",
  "text": "So I'm trying to get involved in research at my university. I made a cv, wrote a few cover letters for the professors that I'm interested in working with, and sent off three emails. I got an answer from one pretty quick, but am still waiting for a response from the other two. It's been around a week or so at this point, and wanted some advice moving forward. Is it okay to email again to kind of alert their attention or how would be the best way to deal with it because I would like some kind of response even if it turns out to be a rejection. Thanks in advance!",
