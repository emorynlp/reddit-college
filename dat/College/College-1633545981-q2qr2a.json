  "title:": "Every work study job has rejected me",
  "text": "I've applied for 30 different on campus jobs this semester, everything from a front desk assistant to mail sorter to social media manager for various departments. 10 rejected me without contacting me, two reached out for an interview and then rejected me before we ever scheduled one, and another handful have had the grace to email me and let me know they aren't accepting me.\n\nI have no conduct violations (academic or behavior) and a decent academic track record. I also have a FWS award that allows for 10 hours of work a week. I'm currently living off $800 a month (including rent and food) and I *need* a job. I don't have a car and there are no off-campus jobs within walking distance. \n\nWhy am I not getting accepted for even the most basic jobs? What else can I do to get money?",

      "text": "Yeah I know the feeling. I also got rejected for many on campus jobs at first. They\u2019re in high demand \n\nMy advice, pick out something niche that most other people wouldn\u2019t think to go for. Even if you think you\u2019re a little under qualified, think outside the box\n\nI solved my problem by applying to work backstage at the theater. I\u2019ve never done theater in my life, nor electrical work. But I just applied and got it early. I was just willing to learn along the way. Been goin great",

          "text": "I've tried, most of those jobs are locked for only theater or adjacent majors to apply for. I applied for a job in my major where I hit every qualification they asked for, including experience that not a lot of my peers have. Didn't know I was rejected until I saw the x on the jobs portal. So frustrating.",
