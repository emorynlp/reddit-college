      "text": "Well if you don't take the SAT/ACT from the get go then the test has no predictive power to begin with \ud83e\udd70 \n\nCollege is in an extremely bumpy place in general right now especially thanks to covid. If people want to take the SATS fucking let them. \n\nBetween debt, programs of interests, commuting/room&board, transportation/car, family/friends, job opportunities-- there's far too much to consider than just taking the SATS and seeing which school you can get into. \n\nPersonally, I have test anxiety. Also dropped out of high school. Never took SATS, went to CC, got a half ride to my transfer school, graduated top 10% of my graduating class (undergrads and grads combined), and am now in a masters program for data analytics. Have had 2 internships one which is year round and with a F350. wtf is an SAT score supposed to do for me lol?\n\nMost people are better off going to CC and their cheapest local university/private college that they can just drive to and not spend money on housing. SATS, aside from being a predictive knowledge indicator, inspire teens to perform super well on a memorization test (little real work applicability concepts) and then get into schools that are more \"exciting\" and \"prestigious,\" that aren't Harvard Yale or ivy. Then based off their sats they can get in, but then end up in more debt because the college is more well known and expensive. Some people are totally fine and don't end up paying more of not less from scholarships. But a lot of people don't get as much as other people and are really being ripped off. I've always seen it as you're paying for other people's scholarships, so they have less debt snd you have more. If you go to smaller colleges and are actually smart, you EASILY can outshine EVERYONE and gobble up all the scholarships and grants even for transferring (and outshine people at your smaller college too).\n\nI graduated with 10k debt (would have been even less if I put more of my internship pay towards it but wasted a lot of it on clothes lol). Also never used a 1.2k grant that I'm now using for my masters program. \n\nSats are like scams. They make you feel proud of yourself and gatekeep expensive schools so you feel more privileged paying more for education and going higher into debt. People only ask you when you're still young and new in your career where you went to school. After the first time they ask and you're at your work for like 2 months you'll never get asked again and no one will care. Same way the predictive power of an SAT is meaningless right after it gets you into a school. Same way the degree becomes meaningless once you've had your first couple jobs and can just slap it somewhere small on your resume to \"check the box.\" \n \nThe way our U.S. college education system is set up is atrocious. Everything in this nation is a business venture. You pay for everything. Same with SATS. You PAY to feel good or bad about yourself and let a couple hour test determine how smart you are and what you're able to accomplish in the next couple years. \n\nWait till you take a personality test for some random workplace and you get denied a job because you don't mold into what they want enough lol. Start studying for that and changing your behaviors now. Screw the SATS, you're studying the wrong material \u2620\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02",

Some people just .. need more time. They can accurately solve problems but it takes them a bit longer. They do worse because they're rushing the whole time and then also don't manage to answer each question. On my first SAT I did worse because of this and time anxiety. \n\nDuring the English section I still had 3 passages left so I panicked and my brain just shut down. I couldn't comprehend anything I was reading and it took me like 10 minutes to be able to start again. It made a 50 point difference in my English score.\n\nMy friend too. On practice exams she was good with timing but then the test anxiety left her with over 5 questions left per section.\n\nIt's not like in the real world you're thrown with a problem at work and forced to solve it immediately. I don't think being fast is an indicator of what you're capable of. IQ maybe, but that's it. The SAT is just not realistic \n\n2) SAT scores are postively correlated to GPA. So, on average, is the predictive power coming from GPA or standardized exams? Even then there's exceptions to this rule.\n\n3) Having only two subjects is not fair or representative (but #1 and #2 would still apply regardless). My brain is wired for English, it was always my easiest subject. Math not wired, but I always wanted As so I studied a lot. Other people may not be wired, or maybe just never cared to try for a subject they don't like, etc. I did better than my friend on SAT but when we took the ACT together she did better; I got a 26 on the science section and she got a 33. \n\nThey say it's because math and english mean you'll be better off in other classes too.. even if that was the case, who cares. There are fields where you can get high GPAs and succeed while sucking ass in both English and Math. You don't need to be prepared for every class and subject.\n\nDeapite my score I know for sure if I was taking the engineering classes my friend does I would not have my high GPA. And if he was taking my courses he wouldn't either. Is either one of us more likely to succeed?",

A ton of how well you do in college depends on how well you study. The days of being smart enough to not do much but still make A\u2019s are gone for 99.999% of people once college rolls around (despite so many people doing well telling you they \u201cnever study\u201d. I don\u2019t know why people act like they need to be ashamed of not understanding upper level collegiate material the first time they hear it). \n\nAs I said earlier, the tests are not directly indicative of your studying habits or discipline as a student. I believe it has been said already, but high school gpa is probably the most reliable predictor of success in college, with one of the main reasons being is that it reflects on how good of a student you have been.",

Specifically for math, if you don't know the math tricks they want you to use, you'll score lower if you try to do math the way you do math in school. \n\nCritics of the SAT/ACT say it benefits people with more affluent backgrounds and that's why colleges should drop it, but I don't know if doing away with standardized testing equalizes anything. If you're affluent you probably already have access to extracurriculars and tutoring and everything else that gives you an advantage. The bias would just double down in those other areas that are more subjective.",

              "text": "It generally gets easier as you progress bro. You become a better studier/test-taker, your profs become more lenient and willing to help you out, and the classes you take are more aligned with your interests. You'll only get better at this whole game. \n\nAn 87 is nothing to get down about, especially as a freshman. For me, my GPA greatly improved throughout college. First semester was a 3.6, ended up getting mostly 4.0's my last few semesters (thx covid lmao). You can still get an A in your class with one 87 grade. \n\nMy advice is to set goals for yourself, large and small. If your goal is to get a high GPA, give yourself a specific number to shoot for, for me it was a 3.85 (4.0 was impossible since I got some B's my freshman year, but a 3.85 is the minimum it takes to graduate with Summa Cum Laude, the highest honors). Set your big goal then FORGET ABOUT IT, dont forget to enjoy yourself in the moment. Then give yourself smaller goals. With your hardest classes, don't be afraid to take the B especially starting out, but always strive for the A. You'll know within the first couple weeks if your class will require too much mental, emotional, and physical energy to get the A, it's ok to not get an A, take care of yourself first. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Then you'll know which classes you can easily get A's in with minimum work. You'll find that balance of aiming for the best possible grade with lowest expended energy. Just aim for more A's than B's and you'll be golden.  \n\nBut at the end of the day all this advice is coming from someone who really cared about GPA. GPA doesn't really matter for MOST people (As they say C's get degrees), it will help you get into even higher education, that's why I care. Learn as much as you can, make some friends with classmates, profs, and other students, develop yourself and your skills, make something cool, and do some crazy shit for the memories. Enjoy it brother.",
