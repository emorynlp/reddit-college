  "text": "Right now I\u2019m on my second year at community college. My plan was to take some gen Ed courses and then transfer to a four year college. Figured this would help the wallet stay thick. Only problem is I\u2019m really not sure what I want. \n\nI enjoy history and culture as a whole but I really don\u2019t know what do in a field like that and still make a decent living. So right now I\u2019m a little off balance I guess.\n\nAny thoughts/prayers for a poor lad?",

      "text": "I picked chemical engineering as a junior in high school and stuck with it the whole way through.\n\nI don't say that to discourage you, but rather illustrate that you and I have a similar mindset. When I made that decision I had a passing interest in Chemistry, I was decent at Math, and most importantly I knew it was a stable well-paying career.\n\nYou have realized that your interests have high competition and possible low pay, and that doesn't sound appealing. So find something more in demand that pays better and you can treat your interests like hobbies. History and culture are great hobbies, you can watch documentaries, eat all sorts of food, meet people from everywhere online, and if you have the resources from your career, go travel.\n\nNot saying money is everything, but it sounds like you are more worried about your general lifestyle than loving your job more than anything. There's nothing wrong with a job that is satisfying, even if it's not passionate.",
