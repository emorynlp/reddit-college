  "text": "Hi, so I'm not sure what keywords to search for in google in order to get this calculation, but...\n\nI have a 73% in a physics class right now, hoping to have 74% before the final once I turn in some assignments. The final is worth 10% of the grade. Assuming I have a 74%, what would be the lowest score I'd be able to get on the final in order to pass the class? I just need a 70% in the class to pass.",
