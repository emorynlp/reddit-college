  "text": "Hey everyone, advice wanted. So I am a 23 year old who was been living out of my van for the last 2-3 years. After I graduated highschool I enrolled in community college for a year, however, by the end of that year I felt so burnt out and needed a change. I began to feel disgusted by society and the rigid parallels we operate on. Such a linear life was not for me, so I decided to travel the country in a van I purchased by selling all my possessions. \n\nMy travels took me far and wide and I would not trade them for the world. However,with time the odd jobs began to catch up with me. I remember I was working in Billings, montana as a auto mechanic. It was late February, and I felt my fingers crack as the frigid air collided into my face on the side of that dark and lonely highway. I couldn\u2019t even get my hands to stop shaking and change that flat, I knew I needed a change.\n\nEver since I was a kid I\u2019ve always wanted to become a famous archeologist. Something about discovering the world of what is unknown fascinates me. Yes, I want to be one of those guys on TV giving tours of dig sites and talking about cool artifacts. Now I have looked and some colleges do offer archeology- but the only thing stopping me now is age. How do I get over the fact that I\u2019m 23? I\u2019m literal old enough to be a dad. Also I don\u2019t know much of how to relate to the younger gen. Back when I was younger \u201cSoulja boy\u201d was the big hype\u2026 now I don\u2019t even know.",

      "text": "It's never too old to go back; people go back mid-career *all the time.*\n\n\nThat being said, for archaeology you really should make sure you look into what the job is actually like, what the jobs are, what qualifications you need. TV will often give you an unrealistic and romanticized idea of what a job is like.",

Who cares how old or young you are? Literally no one who matters in your life will care that you are 23. Go to school. Knuckle down. Do the work. Meet your goals. Do not let other people stand in your way.",

Currently a first-year senior; it will take me an additional year since I transferred in and the University doesn't teach my needed courses during summer. I met plenty of students close to my age at the CC, and have met a number close in age even at University. Congrats on starting your degree. Keep at it.",
