  "text": "i don\u2019t answer questions or raise my hand much in some of my classes because im scared of getting a lot of answers wrong and my prof thinking im dumb or something. the problem is that this causes a lot of awkward silences and i feel bad because my professors always seem so hype for teaching and then we\u2019re just kinda like \u201c\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude10???\u201d\n\ndoes anyone have any tips for getting over the fear of being wrong or just ignoring it enough to answer questions? is it better to just not speak or answer and be wrong?",

It'll make it easier to try the more challenging questions,  but you just have to keep doing it in order or it to feel comfortable. \n\nSometimes just by you starting to do this gets others motivated to speak up too. Not always, sometimes lol. \n\nAlso something I've noticed is when there's a wrong answer given, it shows different perspectives I didn't realize before, sometimes leading to good follow up questions.",

There's nothing wrong in not knowing the answer and teachers appreciate the attempt more than anything else (at least in my experience), specially if nobody is answering their questions. \nIt will get easier after you try it, trust me!",

Professor probably doesn't care either they're probably happy to know that your listening. Realistically most people don't care and if they do its their problem.",

      "text": "I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY! My classes are very silent and I have professors that are hype for nothing. I frequently answer the wrong answer because I see the hope dwindling from their eyes at our dullness. Usually, somebody else will chime in with the correct answer. \n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: I feel bad for my professors cause we the students energize them (in the military, they will mess you up for lack of motivation, might be why I do this). A pumped up professor actually helps you learn better, and being pumped up helps you learn.  \n\n\nBE THE CHANGE OP, save your class. Confidence will always be the right answer, your classmates will see you and feel bad they didn't speak up and you did instead of you being a dumbass. Nobody thinks that, everyone thinks of themselves.",
