Don\u2019t judge your life against someone else\u2019s and think there\u2019s specific things you need to do to have fun because everyone\u2019s different. That being said, you\u2019re only in college for so long and you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice if you don\u2019t try to experience these things at all. You have an entire year of college left, do a few things you haven\u2019t done before and a few that might even scare you. After college you will still be having fun but life changes and you should soak up as much of your life as you can now. As for the comments who talk about focusing instead of doing dumb things, I promise both are possible.",

When you think back on it do you have good memories of college, times spent with friends you made along the way, funny stories that you still chuckle about to this day? The way I see it peoples idea of fun is based on them and gauging your experience based on what may be seen to some people as fun isn\u2019t necessarily your idea of it. Some of the best memories I have from high school were sitting in a parking lot when my 16th birthday hit, sneaking cheese platters into a movie theater under a blanket, and going to an arcade and winning a small stuffed animal. Gauge your college experience not on what is expected of you but your enjoyment of the time you spent there, even if it\u2019s something as small as studying with your friends in the library cracking jokes rather than getting anything done.",

      "text": "I was an unconventional student. I lived on my own and paid my way after high school, then returned to school in my late 20s and graduated before 30. I met an awesome group of friends in my mid 20s and we did all the clubbing, had themed parties, and got really safely drunk. \n\nCollege was not what I expected when I went back, everyone was serious, stressed, and studying. No one would have had time to attend a party if anyone threw one.\n\nNow that you're graduated, you can go all the cool places and do whatever you want. Just put one foot in front of the other and keep walking. The first 6 months on my own I was scared every day, but I learned more in that time than in half my life and wouldn't trade it. Scary things are great, you'll never get anywhere if you stay comfortable. :) You'll be like us Millenials and still live with mom at 30. Think about what excites you and go for it. I know with covid it might not be the right time, but start dreaming of moving to Europe or whatever.",

I found it way more fulfilling doing what made me happy besides trying to fill a mold others made for me. You do you!",

Be thankful. Clubbing is an expensive hobby. \n\nI too had a nerdy college experience and the smattering of nights out I experienced weren\u2019t as fun as my game nights. It was mostly staying up extra late in uncomfortably loud places. Not that they were no fun. Just not terribly comfortable.",

A lot of people do calm down with partying and going to bars after college, but if you live in a city there will still be a good bar scene of people in their twenties. I\u2019m a Boston fan and I\u2019ve been to a couple sports bars that are filled with people 22-29, but that\u2019s when I\u2019ve travelled into the city. I still live at home with my parents at 23 because I\u2019m paying off my student loan, and $50k before taxes isn\u2019t a great salary living in New England. \n\nI have a couple of good friends from college, and my boyfriend who I met in school, but a lot of friends in college are \u2018proximity friends\u2019 who I hung out with when we all lived in the same town, but it\u2019s much harder to keep up with everyone when we are all several hours away in different states. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be down on yourself about having a \u2018nerdy\u2019 college experience. I met people at school who were happy to go out and drink every weekend, and I\u2019ve met people who were happy to not go out to bars at all.",

              "text": "This isn\u2019t necessarily true either. Many many people are more than happy to go to happy hours after work, clubs/bar hopping/casinos on weekend nights, and trips for crazy parties like at music festivals and whatnot. Raves are still definitely a thing on your 20s if you want.\n\nMy advice, keep company with those who do what you want to do. If you surround yourself with people who only work and play dungeons and dragons, then you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when that\u2019s all you do. And I\u2019m saying that as a guy who certainly enjoys some dungeons and dragons every now and again. Buuut, I also have friends who want to get wasted at a college football game, travel to Europe for a ski trip, or go out to a club while playing in an out of state water polo tournament.\n\nYour life isn\u2019t black and white. It is what you make of it. College has nothing to do with it except to open up doors professionally. Usually that comes with higher pay and the ability to financially pay for these endeavors. Go out and do them. You\u2019ll find that a healthy balance will round you out as a person and give you a lot more soft skills that are every bit important as technical skills. Good luck OP",
