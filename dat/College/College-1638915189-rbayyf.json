  "text": "I am a Computer Science Engineer graduate and a Game Developer, I am looking to do a course which is focused on Film, Games and Extended Realities. Film doesn't really fall in the category of Interactive media, so that makes me wonder, if any Colleges out there has these three in one course? or atleast with the option to choose one as minors? \n\nIt would be really helpful. Thank you.",
