  "text": "I really love decorating my rooms but ever since college started I feel a little sad since I\u2019ve had to move every year, and it becomes too much of a hassle to pack everything & keep going. I no longer have a room at home either so I will longingly add stuff to my Pinterest & dream of an aesthetic room someday. I\u2019ve seen dorm rooms fully decked out & I\u2019m amazed at some of the effort people put into it!",
