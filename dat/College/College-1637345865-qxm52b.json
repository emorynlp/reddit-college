  "text": "25 year old woman here. I recently took a test for dyslexia and currently waiting for the results. I was diagnosed with ADHD at 22. My doctor to me I can go back as a junior since I have my associates, and they are going to help me figure out what I\u2019m great at so I can finally start my life haha. Looking at my transcripts, I\u2019m worried these classes won\u2019t mean anything for a cc/uni. Any advice? I would hate to go back as a freshman. I\u2019m too old to be sitting in classrooms for 4 years.",
