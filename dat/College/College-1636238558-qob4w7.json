  "text": "Went on a date this morning and we spent a small amount of time out bad than went to his dorm and cuddled with tv. It was awkward but is cuddling a normal first date activity nowadays?\n\nEdit: to be clear it wasn\u2019t like enjoyable so I am not asking for validation, just wondering if it is common.\n\nEdit edit: he showed up at my place at midnight in a creepy way since I didn\u2019t invite him so yeah nvm",

If some guy invited you to go to his house on a first date, would you? \n\nOn a shallower note, it's off-putting to me just because it's low-effort. That's something small and fun you do in an established relationship, not something he should want for his first impression. There's nothing wrong with casual dates. But there should be some effort, right? On the TV note, he could have taken you to a movie. Other ideas are a picnic lunch,  a visit to a nearby museum, or some kind of on-campus event. What I ask myself, assessing dates, is \"would I want to do this with a friend?\". If I wouldn't, it's not a good date, because I shouldn't have to put up with worse from a partner than I would from a pal. \n\nBut that's just my two cents.",

      "text": "Who the hell knows?  18 yo girls have OF pages now days.  So there is a very wide range of what to expect on a first date. It\u2019s always been confusing. Sometimes you could go out with a girl and not get a kiss at the end of the night, then other times you could get petting.  Other times you could get intercourse. Then no intercourse but bj or anal is ok. Just saying nobody knows what \u201cNormal\u201d is.\n\nSo just go out and be you.  Set your boundaries and communicate them to your date. Then hold those boundaries and hopefully you will meet someone who has the same values or norms.  \n\nThe point is, you are in control of yourself and others should respect that.  If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, you should say so and if you\u2019re not respected, you know that the date should end and no following dates should happen with that person.",

If you\u2019re comfortable enough to go hang out in his room or agree to watch tv/movie it\u2019s likely what y\u2019all are going to be doing, but that\u2019s a choice. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with it you don\u2019t have to and can vocalize that. Him just showing up at midnight without you explicitly telling him to IS weird and is definitely a red flag, if I was in your situation (I\u2019m a guy though) I probably wouldn\u2019t have let him in.",
