  "text": "I'm a father of three. I'm 28. I went to college for about two months when I was 18 over a decade ago and now that I'm older I understand the value and have decided I want to pursue a bachelors. Anyone else complete college with a full time job? I've seen some people say it was hard enough that their GPA suffered and then they couldn't get into med school which is my end goal. I know that if I can get into med school I likely won't be able to continue working, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Just looking for some advice there, thanks in advance",

Totally was doable for me because I worked around my work schedule. I worked at night and sometimes on call at one point. Start off at a Community College if you haven't gotten your associates degree yet. Work at your own pace.",

I make sure I turn in every assignment and sometimes that means getting by on less sleep. There are days where I get off work and I\u2019m trying to get homework done until I go to bed or doing homework on my lunch break. Rinse and repeat. Use your free time as productively as you can. Do every extra credit assignment they offer and communicate with your professor if there\u2019s an issue such as your kid being sick and needing to miss class. Most are understanding if you communicate ahead of time.",

I used to care about getting As (for my gpa and scholarships), but I don\u2019t have the time now for that so all I\u2019m thinking of doing is passing. Also I really just have until summer and I\u2019m done with university. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been cramming classes since 2018 and I\u2019ve never had a break so it really caught up to me so now I\u2019m burnt out. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely doable especially if you have online classes. Don\u2019t worry if you are having any doubts or mental breakdowns, we have all had them. It\u2019s not easy but you\u2019ll appreciate all that hard work when it\u2019s over.",
