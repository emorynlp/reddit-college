      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your bird! I hope they pull through. I\u2019m a prof, and my last bird passed away during the summer, and I was such a wreck. What type of bird is it? \n\nThat said though, some profs will not be sympathetic and will think \u201cit\u2019s only a bird, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d To avoid that, do you think you\u2019ll be able to pull yourself together to get something in by Monday? If you do email the prof, I\u2019d say email now (though with the awareness that they may not see it until Monday), and say something like \u201cmy pet bird is sick and in the vet hospital, and I\u2019m having a really hard time concentrating. If I\u2019m unable to focus well enough to have a good product by Monday, would you rather I turned in a poor product, or would you rather I take a few more days?\u201d \n\nBesr of luck to you and your bird!",

I would be such a wreck if (or I *will* be such a wreck *when*) I lose another bird. They\u2019re family, they\u2019re our babies, and anyone who doesn\u2019t at least understand that has no heart. I hope your prof is sympathetic.",
