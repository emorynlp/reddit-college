  "title:": "CANADA VS UK which do you think is a better option to study in as an international student ?",
  "text": "I'm a student from the middle east , and i am really looking forward to studying abroad , i pretty much can go anywhere around the world , but the UK and Canada are the top options , since i dont have to worry ab whether my degree is in English  or not , plus that they are English speaking countries , and have the most international students (not sure if that is statistically correct , but that's def the trend) so its way easier to indulge into their communities without being an outcast.\n\nit would be great if anyone has experience of studying in one of these countries , even better if both.\n\n **too long; didn't read** : which of the 2 countries , UK or Canada , is better in terms of unis as an international student , as in value for money , racism , quality of life and cost of living.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you in advance",
