  "text": "Do y\u2019all like tests that are just remembering specific details about something like dates?  \nPersonally I dislike them because I generally struggle with memorization which is why I\u2019m relieved when something is open note & book. Another reason is that I feel like I\u2019m not really learning as much as I\u2019m cramming information that will eventually be forgotten a week later.",
