Not while I know someone else out there would pay me.\n\nWhat field is this in? Have you read through the DoL guidelines to make sure this is legal?\n\nI don't have experience with internship abuse because I am picky when I see red flags. No pay goes in the trash can automatically, it means they don't intend to convert to full-time or have a reason to want to train you well.",

Most of the people as far as I know in my program never got paid internships. \n\nI can\u2019t just quit because it was like $600 out of my tuition and my graduation depends on it. If I just quit, I don\u2019t get my degree and I have to start over from square one next year. Paying another $600 where I might fall into a place that ends up just as shitty. \n\nI\u2019m really just trying to survive right now theres no turning back I don\u2019t give a fuck about this place, just hopefully asking people how they managed being exploited",
