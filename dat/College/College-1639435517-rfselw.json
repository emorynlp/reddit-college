  "text": "So I have a chemistry test tomorrow and I suck at chemistry because I don't really understand it as much as I try to learn its confusing. This is the end of my first chemistry course and my mark will probably determine whether or not I get into nursing. My question is say I fail this course and a have a deducted gpa right, but for my other courses I have enough marks and gpa requirements for the program. Will my bad chemistry grade you know prevent me from going and being accepted to the program. And of course I should be worried but for my first year is it you know ok if I do bad maybe not fail but bad at chemistry for my first semester. Like is it expected",

      "text": "It all depends on your program and how competitive it is, you should be able to find the program requirements online. \n\nAt my first college all nursing majors needed a 3.5 with a B or higher in chem, anatomy and physiology, microbiology and Ochem. \n\nAt my sisters school all nursing majors just needed a C or higher in the courses I listed above. \n\nWe won\u2019t be able to tell you how detrimental it is without knowing your school. I would make an appointment with your academic advisor soon to discuss it.",
