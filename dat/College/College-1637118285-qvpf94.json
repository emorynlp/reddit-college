  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a freshman at Montana State and I\u2019m almost done with my first semester. During summer I was excited to check out a new state and meet people but when I got here it seemed like everyone hated me mostly including the people who live on my floor. I\u2019m not great at making friends in general and my social anxiety doesn\u2019t really let me talk to people especially other girls. I can honestly say that I spend just about all day every day sitting alone in my dorm basically doing nothing. My depression has gotten so bad to the point where I barely attend class anymore. It\u2019s horrible and leaves me feeling defeated at the end of every day. I\u2019m planning on going home at the end of the semester because I don\u2019t even know what I want to do for a career and I\u2019m wasting time and money. I feel like when I go home though I\u2019m going to feel the same way because all of my friends except 1 are away for college and I\u2019m just going to be an \u201cadult\u201d that lives with their parents. Is this happening to anyone else?",
