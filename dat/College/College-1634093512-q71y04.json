  "text": "Obviously this could depend on university/college, but was wondering if this would be considered a valid excuse not to sit for an exam, even if the exam is online (home-exam). I am planning on giving them a call.",

          "text": "I would say my case is mild, though the symptoms of fever, extreme tiredness, aches etc meant I was pretty much sleeping and resting for about a week and a half now, and as you know, the 1-2 weeks right before an exam are the most decisive. I feel better now but I have got nothing done so I know I am going to do very bad on it. On the plus side, it\u2019s a midterm, so I could still get a C on the final exam even if I get a very low score on this one.",
