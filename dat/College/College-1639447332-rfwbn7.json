      "text": "figure out what type of friend you want, a lot of people like friends with similar interests, but I like mine with a bunch of different interests, but similar senses of humor. then, make contact. not everyone will be your perfect friend candidate but at least you'll know what to look for. I did stupid stuff like offering an extra bottle soap in the first week to the guys across the hall, now we're best friends and do almost everything together. you're not gonna vibe with everyone obviously, so don't stick yourself with random people that are just okay, or do that and make them into great friends",

Doing a side hobby will help too, maybe sports or side jobs, you'll get to meet people and interact with them. Asking a question from time to time to the person sitting next to you could also spark a new friendship. (But not too many questions though)",

I got so depressed in college because I had no social life that I ended up moving back home, I feel a lot happier here and am excelling in classes. I\u2019m almost done with my AA and will have to return back on campus to finish off my studies and I\u2019m terrified of reliving that experience but it must be done.",
