      "text": "Since I've started this semester, I took note that my stress levels reach the highest if I'm not prepared. I've never truly gotten behind as I've never missed any assignments. It was things like something due the next day that had to be done in the morning or something. That stuff caused me stress. \n\nSo I did what any 32 year old man would do and I stopped being behind. Once I got the time to catch up, I did. From there I used any and all time to get ahead.\n\nNow I'm sitting here bull shitting on Reddit because I'm over a week ahead in assignments. That means tomorrow I'll be working on next weeks assignments. \n\nThe thing is, I'm not having trouble sleeping or getting frustrated at all. It's so terribly simple to get ahead and stay there to reduce stress. It was a small lesson I learned but It's helped tremendously. It means I can take a day to do whatever I want and still not worry about missing assignments or studying.\n\nI mentioned this to some of my 18 year old peers and I was surprised to find that none of them believed that I never study past 4:30 or on the weekends. I just don't have to. I use my time wisely when I have it. I've got Wednesday and Friday off and both those days I consider a 'work' day. I work from about 8 to 4:30 if I have assignments I need to work on. I only take Saturday and Sunday off like a real job. \n\nWhat is stopping you from getting ahead?",

              "text": "So, look. This isn't like an easy thing to take in and accept, let alone hear it. I'm not going to try and tell you that you're wrong and don't have these things but it's important to understand how this works. \n\nAll of those things, are not stopping you from getting things done early. That's just not the truth. Those are being used as a reason for why you're not getting stuff done, yet they aren't the cause. \n\nThis is a victim identity. The issue with assuming a victim identity is that it allows you to abandon responsibility since you're a victim. At this point, all those things you said are reasons why you're abandoning responsibility to get things done, not *why* they aren't getting done. \n\nI've been noticing that this is a trend that's been taken mainstream. It's not just you. It's becoming a common thing. EVERYONE is a victim of something. It's becoming more common for people to be speaking out whether that's the LGBTQ+, minorities or women. The biggest problem is that the acceptance of being a victim releases you of responsibility since it can be attributed to what makes you a victim. \n\nI've been through similar things in my early 20's. I'm assuming that's probably about the age you are as well. I went through a ton of shit including health problems. In the end, I was using that as an excuse to not do the things I was responsible for. \n\nThere will eventually be a transition in your life where this shit goes away. That you assume responsibility regardless of the things that make you a victim. \n\nThe solution right now is that you absolutely MUST assume responsibility for your schooling. It's not all those things stopping you from doing what you need to do. It's YOU stopping you. You'll also find that taking responsibility and getting your schooling under control will greatly reduce the effect of all the things you've listed.",
