  "title:": "Some Incoming Freshman Tips That I Wish Someone Had Told Me",
  "text": "1.) Make your room cozy (if you want). Even putting a few posters on the wall will make a world of difference. Also, LED lights were the best (non-essential) $20 I spent all year, highly recommend.\n\n2.) You know what kind of person you are. By this I mean, if you want your room to be cute and decorated, don't let someone convince you that it's a waste of money/time. I loved having a cozy room to come back to and made lots of friends due to them wanting to hang out in my room.\n\n3.) This also means you know what you use. Don't bring a water bottle if you never use one now. Don't bring that piece of clothing you haven't worn in months because it will just take up space.\n\n4.) Keep the pandemic situation in mind. You probably don't need to pack swim suites because pools won't be open anyways. Also, stuff like a printer may not be as necessary as most classes will turn things in digitally (unless you need it to scan things)\n\n5.) Also with the pandemic in mind, pack lightly and keep containers in your room. You want to be able to move out at a moments notice if things get really bad again.\n\n6.) You will need a lot less clothes than you think you do but will probably overpack anyways. If you haven't worn something by the time you go home for your first break, take it home with you.\n\n7.) If drinking/smoking isn't your thing, don't worry! There are plenty of people who choose not to for whatever reason and most people are respectful of this.\n\n8.) If you do go out partying, you leave and come back with the same people. You make sure everyone got home safe and sound (especially the girls in your group). Don't let your girl friends walk alone at night.\n\n9.) Probably an unpopular opinion but don't be afraid to cut your friends off if they've had too much. It's not cool to pressure someone into drinking more than their bodies can handle. Look out for all of your friends and if they don't do that for you, find new friends.\n\n10.) If someone passes out from drinking, *PLEASE* roll them onto their side. Lots of people die every year from choking on vomit while unconscious.\n\n11.) This may be obvious, but try your best in classes and put them above all else. You pay so much money, to do otherwise would be silly. I say this as someone who partied A LOT and still had straight A's, it's important you find a balance.\n\n12.) Bring a basic first aid kit and some basic OTC medicine. I was very happy to have fever reducer and ibuprofen on standby when I got tonsillitis a month into school.\n\n13.) Lots of people say a TV is a waste but we used ours a lot. Especially with the pandemic happening, you should expect to be inside a lot more anyways. (Same goes for PC set ups)\n\n14.) You'll soon learn that people weren't raised the same as you. Set guidelines with your roommates about cleaning/partying/bringing people over ect. during the first couple days of school. Also, bring up issues with your roommates as soon as they're on your radar.\n\n15.) Be safe if you're hooking up. Let a friend/roommate know where you're going, I found using snap location made me feel safer. Also wrap it up!\n\n16.) Some stuff that I brought that was never used included: Ear plugs, desk lamp, paper clips, post its, water bottle, swimsuit. It all depends on the person though. Ear plugs are good to bring just in case, better to have and not need than to never have them at all.\n\n17.) If you have a car on campus, maybe keep that low key unless you want people asking for rides all the time.\n\n18.) Be safe. Wear a mask outside your dorm at all times. To not do this is so selfish and you're not only endangering yourself, but those around you and everyone they come into contact with. Maybe you would be fine if you got covid, but the asthmatic kid down the hall may not be so lucky. You are not invincible and life will soon show you otherwise if you think that.\n\n19.) Have fun! The 7 months I was on campus last year were the best of my life. I've made so many life long friends and I hope you will too.\n\nFeel free to add more, these were just off the top of my head!",

      "text": "Get a mattress topper! Such a small thing but big difference.\n\nIf you buy a textbook, do NOT open it until you get confirmation from the professor that you will be using it. I\u2019d say don\u2019t get the textbook until the first class entirely, but that can create problems if you then need the text and have to wait to get access to it. But for real, had a physics course last semester and walked in to my professor with his own supply of the book. At least 5 kids who wasted $180 because they couldn\u2019t return theirs.\n\nGood thing to keep in mind: if you find you are struggling, almost every school has free tutoring. If you think you need the help and are in a position to do so, go. Needing some help doesn\u2019t make you stupid. Failing a class because you knowingly ignore that you need help in order to maintain some nonexistent pride does.",

At my new school, I go to the top of the liberal arts building because they\u2019re just individual restrooms nobody uses.",

So I thought I\u2019d be that kid who always left the door open in college. When I got there, I realized I hated doing that, since I never got a moment to myself, so I sort of savored a closed door. So I kind of got screwed over that semester. \n\nAlso I would have to add that when you do haggle over roommate agreements, specify what you mean by clean or messy since everybody has a different definition. To your roommate clean might mean making your bed, nothing out, etc but to me, it just means there\u2019s no food out. Be honest about how much you\u2019re actually gonna clean. Don\u2019t be lazy but be honest.",

I brought tons of summer clothes \"just in case\", but I should've just left them home and brought them back coming back from Winter break.",

For guys I'd reccomend a dress shirt, tie, khakis/dress pants, and black shoes. I find that if you get those non-slip shoes waiters wear no one will notice the difference and you wont break the bank on dress shoes.",

I was dumb and didn\u2019t take a video, so I couldn\u2019t bring it up during our meeting with our RA and Area Director. \n\nLuckily, I had another instance that was more foolproof even though I didn\u2019t have a recording. My phone notification (like a text or something) went off at like 1AM one night but I only half woke up. It woke her up, though. Seriously, she was such a light sleeper that she turned off the outside hall light because it bothered her. Yet she refused to ever wear earplugs or an eye mask (I wore both).\n\nShe came over to my lofted bed, reached up and grabbed my phone, turned it all the way off, and my alarm didn\u2019t go off in the morning so I missed my first class. Didn\u2019t wake me or ask me to turn it off, didn\u2019t just put it on Do Not Disturb (we both had iPhones), and I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d completely shut down my phone until the next morning (like I said, I was half awake). She also woke up before me and knew my schedule, and didn\u2019t bother to check if I was awake, especially knowing she\u2019d disabled my alarm. \n\nFrom then on, I screenshotted every passive-aggressive text she sent me, noted down everything she did, and had a few of my friends act as witnesses for her antics (especially helpful because one friend lived next door). I brought a packet listing everything she had done with proof to our meeting. She ended up moving out, and I got a double to myself for the rest of the year, so it had a happy ending. I turned her bed into a couch, lol. \n\nI could write an essay about her. She made me feel like shit the half semester she lived with me. Most roommates aren\u2019t like that, though, thankfully. Most of my friends had great (or at least, neutral) roommates.",

What I can warn is that if you have a roommate who suddenly opts out and then you get another one who just appears, it\u2019s a red flag. Oftentimes it means they didn\u2019t pay attention and they just needed somewhere to put them. \n\nMy first roommate was like that. I was supposed to room with an International student who opted out of housing. On the first day, my new roommate came at 5 PM and had all of her stuff in garbage bags. She didn\u2019t go to any of the orientation events beyond convocation (it was mandatory) and she didn\u2019t stay the night. And she made me feel so unsafe I thought I\u2019d get raped in my sleep. \n\nWith my second one, I was in a suite and one of our suite mates opted out, so she became our roommate on the second day. Literally the three of us went to shoprite, came back and her and her mom were checking out the room, since her mom was an administrator so I guess she picked. We actually got along pretty fine, but she was a bossy jerk who took over: I wasn\u2019t allowed to walk around in a bath towel when guests were out despite the fact her boyfriend did it, I was basically followed, and she argued with me because I didn\u2019t clean her dishes. \n\nAnd because I was getting more withdrawn with mental illness and work, and because my roommates were either scared of their own shadows or went with the flow, I was the bad guy. Really no joke she stole my tv and they took her side.",

You may not be able to party every weekend or spend as much time socializing as other majors, but you can still have a good time and a healthy social life. I chose a pretty difficult major and I still hung out with my friends pretty much every day last year. And I didn't sacrifice sleep either. Even if it's just getting lunch with someone or playing some board games before bed, making time for that stuff matters and it's not impossible\n\nI do understand however that it can be hard to make friends and prioritize those relationships when you have to spend a lot of time studying. It's a challenge but I'm just saying it's doable so have some hope!",

      "text": "I\u2019m surprised their letting freshmen move in with the pandemic, but I guess the college needs money lol. I added some tips below for anyone that cares. \n\nMost major universities (i think) will have you take a drinking/sexual assault seminar. If you plan on partying with friends, You should give the keys to a designated non-drinking driver so that nobody has to worry about who is/isnt drunk when it\u2019s time to go home.\n\nI personally put my flat screen tv on my desk and I enjoyed it ALOT. I don\u2019t have cable at home, because my family didn\u2019t really use it when we had it. However, it was kind of cool watching tv til like 3am.\n\nDONT BE AFRAID TO MOVE! If you dont like your roommate(s) then MOVE! There is no need for you to be miserable. I moved twice my freshman year. \n\nUse free resources! My college realized that nobody was showing up to events so they started to offer free food like Pizza, Caprisun, Soda, and a gift card raffle to those who attended. Free shit is Free! \n\nLastly (and this is VERY biased), but fuck the bookstore. All those books and items are OVERPRICED! You can save a ton by using Chegg or by simply using other websites to download textbooks for free. Nothing is more embarrassing than a professor saying \u201cYou dont need the access code, a used/rented book will work just fine.\u201d and some student replies, \u201cwait...what???  I spent $300 on this book and I can\u2019t return it because I opened it.\u201d \n\nOn a final note. Most of y\u2019all are paying $10k+ to get a degree, not to party. \n\nTL:DR : You can bring a tv, if your college offers cable. Attend events that offer food and prizes. Drunk Driving and rape is illegal. Save money by using Chegg/Amazon.",

My university's most recent alcohol education tells us that if someone has passed out from alcohol and cannot be awoken or is super out of it, you go into checking if they have alcohol poisoning mode.  If they dont have alcohol poisoning, you stay with them incase they start to get alcohol poisoning and make sure they are breathing and not showing symptoms of worsening.  It is important they are on their side but you STAY WITH THEM, even if you are really tired.  If they do start to show symptoms, call 911, check your town's amnesty laws.\n\n\nThey key takeaway is: if they're passed out from alcohol and you have difficulty awakening them, the situation becomes much different than if they're going to sleep.\n\n\nBackpacking is only helpful if you stay with them consistently because they can still puke and it can get caught in their throat, even of they're on their side.",

My university's most recent alcohol education tells us that if someone has passed out from alcohol and cannot be awoken or is super out of it, you go into checking if they have alcohol poisoning mode.  If they dont have alcohol poisoning, you stay with them incase they start to get alcohol poisoning and make sure they are breathing and not showing symptoms of worsening.  It is important they are on their side but you STAY WITH THEM, even if you are really tired.  If they do start to show symptoms, call 911, check your town's amnesty laws.\n\n\nThey key takeaway is: if they're passed out from alcohol and you have difficulty awakening them, the situation becomes much different than if they're going to sleep.",

              "text": "Adding on to this: If a person has had too much to drink, throwing up is a good thing. If someone is completely incoherent, once they throw up they'll probably come back to their senses within about 30 minutes. \n\nUnless they were chugging grain alcohol, they'll throw up and recover. \n\nBy no means will they be sober or close to it but they'll be in a position where you don't have to worry about them dying on you. At this point you can set them up to go to sleep.\n\nAlso you probably don't want to call 911 or your university rescue unless the individual is showing signs of alcohol poisoning and are not throwing up or they have thrown up and are not improving. A good rule of thumb I found is that as long as they are still able to sit up straight or form relatively coherent sentences, they'll be fine. They just need to drink some water and possibly throw up. \n\nDepending on the situation, you may be risking that individual's University standing and/or career by calling authorities. For example, numerous ROTC students have lost their scholarships due to getting caught drinking underage or with underage individuals. Losing their scholarship also means they have to repay any money they have been given. This can easily leave them without any means to afford university. \n\nNot trying to dissuade people from helping but you need to stay calm, keep track of their symptoms, and feel out the situation without jumping to the nuclear option.",

It's a pain in the ass in the US because you/others need to take into account legal and financial repercussions, often interfering with their health needs.  \n\n\nI'll banter back and say that even though forming coherent sentences is a good sign, it is by no means a foolproof method, and it only helps to stay with them.  If you know the person well enough, you can make the educated decision to leave them to sleep.",
