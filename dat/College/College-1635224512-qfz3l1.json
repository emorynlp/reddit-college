  "text": "Curious about your opinion of living alone in college. I decided to get a 1 bedroom apartment to myself this year after a not so hot roommate experience last year, but I feel like I\u2019ve gotten surprised reactions from some people I\u2019ve mentioned it to. Would you consider it strange for a fellow student to be living alone? \n\nI am a senior and have a fairly active social life for reference.",
