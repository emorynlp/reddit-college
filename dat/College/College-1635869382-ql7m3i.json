  "text": "Just venting. \n\nI'm studying to be an international school teacher in the primary school sector. We were told out of the blue that we had to pass the maths exam - which we initially had to pass in our fourth year -  in the 3rd year instead. If I do not pass this exam by January, I do not get to teach abroad which I would normally get to do. I failed this exam that I took last Friday, and now I feel so dumb and doubting myself heavily. I tried my best and studied my heart's content, and yet failed. It makes it a lot worse when I learned the year above me got support lessons, while my year did not. Moreover, I got my grade via email with a grade and nothing else. I did not see which section I got incorrect or correct. What if I don't make it? Why cannot I pass a simple test? How can I study if I don't know where to start?",
