  "text": "My boyfriend and i are the the same age. i\u2019m a sophomore in college, and he\u2019s never been. \n\nAll he does is work these warehouse jobs that pay next to nothing and gives his mom a portion of his check every week for rent. \n\nFor a while he refused to go to college bc he wanted to pursue music (...) and now he\u2019s decided he wants to go, after seeing all the opportunities it gave me. \n\nThe issue at hand is that his mother is nearly 60 years old, her health is declining, she\u2019s working at amazon 5 days a week, 10 hour shifts and has had to pick up an extra day to make up for the lack of rent money since my boyfriend has been out of a job.\n\nHe\u2019s now changed his mind and wants to put off college for another few years and land a job again so he can help his mom out. \n\nI understand the situation but at the same time i want him to think about his future, and start going to college part time at the very least, so that one day we can be successful together...\n\nAny advice on how to navigate this would be helpful.",

      "text": "Best advice is to leave him alone and stop pressuring him to do want you want him to do so you stay together to \"one day be successful together...\"  Going to college does not necessarily mean someone will be successful.  Sounds to me like your BF was already being successful by being responsible and acting like an adult and taking care of his priorities which you don't agree with. Honestly, if he can't afford to pay rent to his Mom he won't be able to afford to not work, move out (because his Mom shouldn't have to let him live there rent free at his age) and attend college full time. If he really wants to go he could look into one class a semester at a CC and see if he even likes it (many have payment plans now). Either way he clearly needs to work as a priority unless you plan to support him 100% financially while he's in college.",

      "text": "My Dad is a highschool dropout, doesn\u2019t have a diploma or a degree and he is still supporting 3 kids and a wife who doesn\u2019t work. \n\nI understand you wanting him to get a higher education because it IS getting significantly harder to do things without degrees but it is not impossible. But it doesn\u2019t seem like you want him to go for the right reasons. As long as he\u2019s working he\u2019s doing what\u2019s right.\n\nYou mentioned his mothers health is declining and she\u2019s breaking her back working 10 hour shifts 5-6 days at Amazon. And I\u2019ve read Amazons reviews I know that place sucks to work at and you want your boyfriend to just stop helping her? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to afford college without my moms help so I don\u2019t know how you expect him to do so",
