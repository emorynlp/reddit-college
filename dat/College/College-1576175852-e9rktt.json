  "text": "So I came into college with a friend from high school as my roommate but she turned out to be a pretty crappy roommate/friend. Eventually moved out so we don\u2019t talk. I\u2019ve told my mom about it and she feels bad I haven\u2019t made any more friends. I\u2019ve always had a rough time making friends. Not trying to be like \u201cI\u2019m not like other girl\u2019s\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m so quirky\u201d but I have always found it really difficult to fit in with people. All of my friends back home were the ones that approached me. When I do approach people I always feel really awkward and nervous but when I think I did well with carrying a conversation and I think me and the other person hit it off, they never feel the same and we don\u2019t talk anymore. It does make me kinda discouraged with making friends. Being in college, I am always around people in their big groups of friends and it\u2019s like how the hell did y\u2019all become friends? Even since day one, people had their groups already. That being said, I don\u2019t mind being alone. I\u2019ve experienced all semester sitting alone and eating alone and I actually really like it. I don\u2019t have to have a conversation and I can just eat and watch YouTube. It does get kinda boring though and it reminds me of grade school of when I could go a whole school day of not talking. That\u2019s how it sometimes is since I\u2019m not really close to my other roommates. They\u2019re nice though so that\u2019s good. Are any of you guys alone or having trouble with making friends?",

      "text": "I had a similar problem during my first semester of college. My floormates quickly got together into pseudo-cliques and I felt left out. I would do my best to be around other people, such as eating in the lounge that people frequently visited, but I wasn\u2019t able to find a steady friend group until 2nd semester of my freshman year. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for ways to remedy this, maybe you should look at what clubs are available on campus. Mutual interests can go a long way.",

I had friends for the first 2 1/2 years of college, moved in with my best friend, she turned out to be a terrible/abusive person and basically turned all my friends against me and we stopped talking. It is really hard for me to make connections with people. I'm now in my senior year and I do have a few friends but we don't hang out that frequently. No one ever approaches me first, either. I had a pretty lonely childhood too so I'm used to being alone and I do the same. It's not that I don't enjoy the company of others but it's a lot of stress to go through. I would much rather have no friends at all than be friends with people who did not truly appreciate me and with whom I always had to be the one to initiate contact, though. I don't really have advice but yeah, basically, I feel the same way.",

      "text": "I can relate... kind of. During my last year of highschool felt like i wanted to \"re start\" my life. I decided attend uni in a different country. My parents were okay with the idea so I moved from kenya to south africa. The first week after my parents left me I was completely thrown off balance. Everything was so different... their language, food and their currency! I still have to change it from rands to shillings mentally so I can know the value of what I'm buying. I didn't have any family or friends near me. I was so depressed and I didn't want to tell my parents what I was going through. It was mentally tiring for me because I'm also shy especially when I'm meeting  new people and I have social anxiety. That was one thing I wanted to work on in my \"new life\". I remember going to the beach one day( I literally didn't have anyone to hang out with outside class) I met these gay dudes and I dont know what happened but I just talked to them about how I miss home and how I want to go back. Now we've been friends for 4 months. I dont even know how but these guys I met randomly on the beach are closer to me than my own brothers are so dont be afraid to talk to someone you may never know they might just be your next best friend !!!",

You should ask yourself something else, though. Does seeing those words 'being a loner' create anxiety in you? If they do, then I think, deep down, you really don't want to be. If you can read those words and feel nothing, then you are truly blessed with the gift of not needing other people.\n\nIf you do decide to make friends, then just know that it's awkward for everyone. Nobody is a born Cassanova, and the only way to get better is to work on it. Think of it like lifting weights. The more time you get in the gym, the heavier the weights you can lift. Similarly, the more people you talk to, the easier it will be to make friends.",

Whereas the majority of regular students all knew each other for at least 2 years of being in the same dorms, majors, classes, clubs, etc.\n\nA lot of the other comments have great advice, so I'll just throw in my tip. Try to form study groups for classes, especially harder/upper div classes. You can start by asking some questions in a new class that you enrolled in.\n\nFor example: \\*Turn to the right\\* \"Hey David, have you done that equation before?\" Then just take the conversation from there with some back & forth. You'll won't get a cold pissed off face staring at you with a flat \"NO/YES\" (99% of the time).\n\nJust keep practicing this and it'll becoming a lot easier to end up having some \"study relationships\" if that makes sense.",

You can always make acquaintances, but friendship is much more involved then all that and sometimes can be tiresome due to that.\n\nRight now I live alone working full time and I try, once a week, to go out and find someone to hangout with.

Exposure in college is a key thing your more likely to meet people if you spend time on campus than off campus.\n\nI recently transferred to a different college and its been similar trend. You don't know anyone so it feels awkward and like your alone. But gradually it gets better, once you come to your last term it will feel more like you fit in than at the start.\n\ntake care!",

They\u2019ll force you to talk bc that\u2019s how people are and eventually you\u2019ll make friends with someone enough to hang out. Then make more friends via that exposure.

By god there\u2019s posts about college loneliness by the day but the image that you see on the internet that makes it seem like everyone you look up to and know is not lonely is a false, disconnected view of things and being lonely is not just necessarily normal but often a good thing, to have time dedicated to yourself, self reflection and everything.",

Making friends in college in my late 20s was exceptionally harder because I wasn't wrapped up in early adolescence social tensions plus I had more realistic, non-idealistic expectations after graduation. Had a handful of acquaintances for both experiences, but that's about it. I also went to two predominantly commuter colleges in NYC where many people just had their social circles outside of school.\n\nIf you're still an underclassman, I'd suggest beinng proactive about making friends if you can. It's not entirely what college is about, but college is such a stressful experience and it doesn't make it easier to go through alone.",

I can make friends semi easily however coming to college I actually didn\u2019t want to make many friends. The reason is because my best friend from 3rd grade we stopped being best friends my 3rd quarter of high school senior year. It hurt me and we tried to work it out and we pretended nothing ever happened but I knew it was toxic. So it hurt me to leave him. Now coming to college my roommate ended up being an OCD person and he basically passively aggressively talked crap about me and all this stuff and so I was just trying to survive college life with a horrible roommate. What I didn\u2019t realize is that during this time I subconsciously started to become really close friends with this guy and as of right now I could say I consider him my best friend but the thing is is that because I had closed my mind to new opportunities now I have the opportunity to get a real best friend who actually wants to be with me and cares about me. Hopefully this gives you hope!",

That\u2019s why there\u2019s clubs at school and ways to get together online ( I use an app called meetup) so that you can try to find people with your interests and hopefully make 1 or 2 really good friends. If I\u2019m being completely honest you\u2019ll need to find ways to be social and find ways to meet people. I\u2019m the same way where I was very introverted and didn\u2019t have any friends until my mom told me that if I wanted friends I needed to find ways to socialize with others.

For me, it made all the difference when I started taking classes in my major because I met like-minded individuals. I have an amazing friend group now whom I love to death. It's also funny because initially we didn't all like each other, but then we started hanging out after our creative writing class and that become so routine that we realized we needed to hang out in real life. I now consider these friends to be some of the best I've ever had and we are a diverse, weird group but it works. \n\nI haven't been super involved in clubs or extracurriculars, so maybe that made it harder for me to make friends; however, I think it's actually pretty normal. I'd suggest joining clubs/groups you're interested in or taking classes that you enjoy because you're bound to meet some cool people along the way. Also, I took a class with one of my best friends and I initially disliked him; however, once we took creative writing together, he became one of my best friends. So, there is a chance that it just takes time and getting to know someone better before they accept you.",

I live alone, so I feel pretty alone at the end of the day. I personally think I'm socially awkward but everyone seems to think I'm extroverted and great at talking to people (I still don't see it). I hold many on-campus leadership positions and meet with senior administrators weekly while emailing and quite literally texting throughout the week. I still feel alone. I snapchat my friends throughout the day and facetime many of them for hours at a time. I still feel alone. Here's what I'm doing to put myself out there:\n\nI worked out before, but now I really push myself in the gym and put in more effort into the learning aspect.\n\nI started some new hobbies, I looked into cooking and I'm really learning and growing my cooking skills\n\nI got really into reading and my reading list is now 90 books long. These books help me learn new skills and different things I'm slightly interested in, hopefully leading to new hobbies.\n\nI started working on myself and all the things I'm self-conscious about. This has drastically improved my day to day life and interactions I have with people.\n\nI've focused on good friends as well, don't lie to yourself or others to make friends. Be as authentic as possible, people should be friends with you, not the character of a different you.\n\nI started hanging around common spaces in my major and doing my homework in those spaces. I know a lot of people, especially in my leadership positions, I started seeing the real \"grind\" side of people. As we \"grinded\" in the same place we started to know each other better and make more jokes to each other. We see each other around and talk about when we'll be in the lab later that night. **If I have one takeaway, make friends within your major.**\n\n**Definitely get involved if you aren't already.** I can say, the networking opportunities that getting involved and being friendly with people offer only happen in college. Your network is everything, you don't have to be everyone's best friend, but you should be able to talk to them if they were next to you in a class.",

The objective shouldn\u2019t be meeting friends you just chill with so much as finding people with similar things that interest you.",

Everyone chose high school A and I chose high school B and I was all alone in the first semester there, really, no friends to talk and everyone had their groups from the first day. I felt awkward and when I tried to talk to someone I felt that we didn\u2019t have topics of conversation so I couldn\u2019t make any friends. At the begging of the second semester a group of people that I haven\u2019t seen before began to talk to me, and I began to feel really good with them and eventually they became my best friends. I think sometimes you feel like you are the only person that thinks like you and that is the reason you haven\u2019t make any friends, but eventually you find the right people, the ones that will support you and help you to arrive where you want to go. Those are the real friends, and I can assure you, they will come eventually.",

I\u2019ve moved around schools multiple times and with that I had to make new friends multiple times. Back in middle school and high school it might\u2019ve been easy because your teacher might\u2019ve just grouped you and some other people together and you guys would just connect from there but with college it seems like it\u2019s more of an independent kind of thing. One way that I made friends moving into a high school where I only knew like 20 other people at was by getting involved in sports and activities. Maybe find something your interested in and try to meet new people there. If you don\u2019t connect with them that\u2019s okay there\u2019s always other interests you might have and other activities you may want to try.",

Reddit, or at least this sub, can sometimes be an echo chamber of people who had or are having a hard time making friends in college because someone who's had it easier likely isn't going to be making a post about it. Just do your best when you get there to take advantage of opportunities to meet people and try new things, and keep a positive attitude as best you can!

Currently in the process of moving out but communicating with my Res Life Coordinator is really hard since they're so busy. But I'm almost completely alone in school. My roommates made an entire group chat without me, the people who live on my floor are all friends with each other and it's basically this huge friend group, but I also hear these people talking shit about me behind my back quite often. Obviously I don't want to be friends with people who are talking shit about me! So I stay in my room, watch Youtube/Twitch and play video games, I draw, and I spend a lot of time texting my boyfriend and some of my other internet friends. Considering the toxicity and overall negativity of my roommates/floormates, I feel content with being alone for now? But sometimes it's really inconvenient when I need to go to Walgreen's or something but don't have anyone to go with (I'm not gonna go anywhere alone bc this is a big city school). Hopefully once I do move, I can befriend other people on my floor, but for now I'm kind of okay with being alone.",

I'm like that, have always been reserved and have a very set 'limit' for socializing. \n\nFinally, don't feel discouraged about it. It's hard to click with every person you meet.

      "text": "Honestly, learning to reach out to people as an introvert has been one of the biggest developments I've gone through in college. It feels weird admitting it's scary but it really is so I get where you're coming from! I'm lucky that I met some really nice people who approached me my first year; when I met their other friends I was able to work on reaching out more and now I'm much more able to make friends with completely new people.   \nIt's something you gotta make a conscious effort to do, but once you get used to it things get a lot easier. You got this! Classes, clubs, study areas for your major are all great places to meet people. When I get nervous I like to think think of it more as working out your \"social\" muscles rather than the usual fear of someone not liking me. If it doesn't work out, I still got a \"workout\" in so it's a win either way :)",

I turned into a bit of a game in my head; theres no real end goal, you're just levelling up your character. That in turn made it less scary when I did start being more friendly with people, no pressure to get it right, you just reached the next level.\nIt can be tough, and it can feel disheartening, but it's such a life-changing skill to have it's worth it. \n\nGood luck, friend",

I know it's a lot easier said than done. I only managed to defeat my anxiety because I was so lonely that I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nIf I saw anyone with memorabilia for something I liked, I struck up a conversation. Most of the time, it didn't go anywhere. That was really disappointing at first, but I kept trying and a few people ended up sticking around.\n\nI also stopped judging people based on their appearance and my first impression of them. I used to write off a lot of people as just \"not someone I'd hang out with.\" Once I stopped doing that and kept an open mind, I started making friends. Almost all of my friends are people I would have never seen myself being friends with a few years ago.\n\nThe last thing I did was just letting people know how I felt about them, even if it seemed cheesy. I'm a shit friend. I was and still kinda am bad at making it obvious that I care about people. Now, I do what I can to be upfront about it. I straight up tell my friends that I see them as friends and really care about them. I have a hard time figuring out what people think of me and I bet other people feel the same way, so I do what I can to be easy to read.",

I also made lots of my friends in high school because they approached me (actually for me it was more so that I had one or two \u201cins,\u201d or friends who were part of a larger friend group and I just sorta gradually assimilated into it because they helped me directly or indirectly by giving me more social confidence). It\u2019s really hard for me too because I go to a small school where I knew no one going into it and haven\u2019t made any friends, which you might think would be easier but it\u2019s harder for me since there\u2019s a lot more, I guess, individual pressure? I think it\u2019s fine if it doesn\u2019t really effect you, but at the same time building social skills really helps in life when it comes to things like interviews, networking, etc.. which really kick off in college (my impression anyway, I\u2019m a first semester freshman too). I think there\u2019s a difference between being lonely by choice because you prefer that vs being lonely because you might lack social skills and/or have anxiety. For me it is the latter I think, which makes it really hard for me to \u201cjust put myself out there\u201d and join clubs and all that, among other reasons, and it\u2019s bothering me and making me really depressed, personally, and am considering transferring, but I don\u2019t know yet.",

My senior AVID teacher also told me I need to try and get out of my shell because of networking and interviews.

In high school I used to try and find a person that\u2019s shyer than me (pretty difficult lol) and then make friends for at least that class so I would have someone to do projects with. Maybe I\u2019ll try that method again next semester haha. Definitely relate to it being hard to put myself out there.

I been getting really lonely and bored in my free time and it has been having effects on my me health.  I know people tell me to join clubs but it\u2019s not that simple. It really difficult for me to step out my comfort zone because of even a little mistake give me soo much anxiety.  I commute so there\u2019s that. For me overall it\u2019s pretty much the same as highscholl which sucks since I wanted to at lest be a bit more confident",

          "text": "Yeah I can relate to that, I think I\u2019m a mixture of being introverted but also having anxiety with stepping away from what\u2019s comfortable for me. My mom brought that up and was saying stuff like how she knows I like my alone time but she wants me to have fun and join stuff. It\u2019s just hard when you can\u2019t naturally click with people. It\u2019s like after middle school, people found their groups and stayed with them so now it\u2019s much harder to make friends. I was also hoping to put on this kinda confident persona since barely anyone from my high school came to my college but it was much more difficult than I thought it would be. Good luck dude, I hope we can both find a way to get out of our shells!!",

It\u2019s just hard getting to the point where I put myself out there and then it doesn\u2019t work which makes me discouraged to keep trying. I know I definitely need to in regards of getting internships and jobs, especially since I want to become a doctor. Next semester I want to at least say hi to someone in class in hopes of sparking conversation, especially in my harder classes.",

Not expecting a friendship out of it which is fine especially since today was the last class, but I was talking to 4 people since our professor had us have discussions about death and we had a really good conversation along with going on tangents lol. They were all older (20,24, and I think around almost 40) than me so I don\u2019t think they would want to hang with an 18 year old lol but it was awesome talking to them. I definitely gotta try to talk in the classroom more so I at least have people to contact for studying and stuff and I guess go from there. Thank you for taking time to reply! I didn\u2019t expect so many people to reply and I really like reading them all and replying",

The age thing doesn't really matter, can almost guarantee the older people are feeling just as lonely and out of place as you are and looking for some companionship to normalize their situation.  This will honestly probably be your easiest socializing starting point.",

People don\u2019t say to join clubs just because it\u2019s an easy answer, it can literally be the difference between feeling like an outcast and eventually being depressed/ dropout/ whatever and making a solid group of friends/ having a sense of community at your school. I joined running club and I would probably be in community college if it weren\u2019t for that. Now 1 semester in, I have a lot of friends, tons of things to do, and I\u2019m fit. Trust me, join a club",
