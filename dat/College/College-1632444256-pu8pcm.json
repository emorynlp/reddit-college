  "text": "Especially for a quarter system. Some lectures take forever and so you spend half the day taking notes. Then you have labs that also take so much time. You also have reading and assignments.\n\nI feel like I have no time to study. One of the classes the easiest one I feel like I don\u2019t learn anything. I just BS the class. Then I focus only on 2 classes.",

      "text": "That sounds about average. That's about either under full time or just about full time. That's like taking 3 classes in a semester format.\n\nFor example, I'm taking 20 units right now in semester format. That would be about 30 units or double of what you're taking right now. Though the difference is that semester format has more time, and arguably, quarter system is more intense.\n\nJust do what you need to do. You seem to be doing good and understand that BSing is enough to get an A sometimes and that's ok.",
