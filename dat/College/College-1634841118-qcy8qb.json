  "title:": "How do you explain depression as the reason for absence to a professor",
  "text": "I've been dealing with depression for a few years and even now I'm on my 4th year at college and I don't know how to properly explain to my professor the reason for my lengthy absences. I didn't reach out to them beforehand about being absent the day of an exam but when I was asked the day after I didn't know how to respond. I knew the reason why I didn't show was due to my depression but how do I express that? I don't feel I should express it to them. I also don't want my professor to think im lazy or don't understand.   \n\n\nWhich I think is what they think of me now. I could tell their tone was a bit offended and even frustrated by the way they wrote. Using phrases like \"I will do as they say cut you some slack\" and even  lightly insulting my age by claiming \"it must be your first semester in college\"   \n\n\nI feel awful and nervous about even continuing the class because I'm scared to face this professor now. My plan is to try my best and just attend class as much as I can but I wish I could explain to my professor I have depression.   \n\n\nI'm scared I won't be taken seriously though since I don't have any specific accommodations for my adhd or depression listed at my college.  I also don't want the professor to think they need to report me for telling him I have depression because professors are mandatory reporters of stuff like this.  \n\n\nHas anyone else had to be in this situation?",

      "text": "Why don\u2019t you have accommodations? If you\u2019re able to work with the accommodations office and your provider that would be the route to go. Otherwise, professors aren\u2019t exactly mental health professionals and you\u2019re at the whim of whichever professor who also likely isn\u2019t necessarily spending a hefty amount of time judging you, you\u2019re absences or performance.\n\nI think most professors want to see their students succeed but don\u2019t have the capacity/expertise to evaluate mental heath crisis and issues their students are having. You could potentially say you have some other illness, personal reason, etc., that is causing issues with your academic performance and the result would likely be the same. \n\nI have mental health issues and have had to deal with some disruptive life circumstances but I talked to my advisor, worked with my provider and the school accommodation office(I got an eval and was lucky to be able to afford it) and received reasonable accommodations that have made a positive impact on my academic career. If you think you\u2019re going to fail, maybe drop the course if you\u2019re able to. Lighten your course load and focus on getting to a place where you can take care of yourself and school. (I\u2019m a non-traditional student and although the windy path through school has been tough, I have a different perspective about doing what you can to finish vs struggling through the entire experience)\n\nWhen it came to contacting professors before all this, just like work, the slew of reasons/explanations don\u2019t necessarily change the outcome. Read the syllabus, see if an extension or make-up is possible and maybe don\u2019t ask questions that have already been answered (in the syllabus). Sorry for such a lengthy response but I hope this helps! College isn\u2019t the easiest to navigate with depression or anything but support and resources hopefully exist at your school that will help! You\u2019re definitely not alone in this experience. Good luck!!",

      "text": "First thing I'd do is get in touch with your provider(s) for any documentation necessary, as well as your school's disability resource center, as these are two very crucial resources to have when dealing with college and disability. Disability resources is more than just helping you figure out accommodations, they are *also* your advocates if disagreements relating to your disability arise when dealing with professors. For example, at my school, students are encouraged to CC their access consultants in their correspondence with professors in the event that there's a disagreement. They can vouch for you (not disclosing anything you don't want disclosed), clarify policies, and weigh in when needed. The whole point of disability resources offices is to ensure that college remains as accessible as possible to the differently-abled.\n\nAs far as reporting goes, I really don't think that you'd be reported unless your teacher has reason to believe that you're an immediate danger to yourself. On a personal note, though, I only tell people about my depression on a need-to-know basis. All I tell them is what I'm required to--that I'm registered with the disability resource office (and therefore have a documented disability), and supply my accommodation letter. \n\nOne thing that should be mentioned is that your instructors are not required to provide retroactive accommodations outside of certain circumstances (hospitalization, illness, etc.), they usually do not constitute \"reasonable\" accommodations. While most of my professors have been understanding and more than willing to provide retroactive accommodations, it's explicitly written in our disability accommodations letters that they *do not* have to provide retroactive accommodations. It is our individual responsibility to be communicating with professors and TAs when things aren't going well. For example, if I'm having a particularly bad episode, and I feel that I might not be able to take my exam, I should notify my professor ASAP so that something can be worked out. If I don't contact them until after the exam is taken, this makes it significantly harder to provide reasonable accommodations for. The longer that you wait, the harder it is to accommodate, and there's a point in time where accommodations would not be reasonable. For example, you wouldn't be entitled to accommodations if you missed an exam and asked to make it up 6 weeks later. Obviously there are exceptions to this, like if you were hospitalized for 6 weeks straight, you would be entitled to make that work up, and not all disability-related absences are forseeable, and so on. But in general, you notify your professors beforehand when possible, otherwise ASAP.",

If you did bad on it because you didn't study because of your depression would that be a valid reason to allow the proffesor to retake the exam?",
