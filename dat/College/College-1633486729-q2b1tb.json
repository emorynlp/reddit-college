  "title:": "Is this normal roommate behavior?",
  "text": "I am subleasing a room in a 3-bed apartment, and the other 2 girls are college students like me. I had planned on moving in this weekend after signing the subleasing agreement and all that, but I just got a text from the 2 roommates saying (in nicer words) that they want me to wait until after they meet me for lunch to move in. They\u2019re not in town for the weekend, so they want me to stay out of the apartment for another week. \n\nThis upcoming long weekend is my fall break, so I planned to get all the time-consuming stuff done before my exams and presentations, but now I can\u2019t because I have to wait for the girls to get back in town and have lunch with me. It seems like I have no say in this matter, and while I\u2019m able to wait a bit, I can\u2019t help but wonder if this is normal behavior. I mean, I guess I\u2019m a stranger to them, but it\u2019s not like they own the apartment. Do you think they\u2019re justified in preventing me from moving in until they want me to?",

I've shared house a few times and honestly you would also want to meet them prior to moving in for your own sake, in case they end up being crazy lol. That isn't to say it's inconvenient for you, but it's definitely normal and a must for many, because they also don't want to live with someone a bit off. Hope that helps!",
