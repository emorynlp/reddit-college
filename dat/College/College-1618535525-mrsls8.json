This particular instructor has a full-time job, teaches middle school in the afternoon, and teaches night classes at the college.\n\nBefore covid I was at school from 6am - 9pm Mon-Fri. I had 30 minutes of \"free\" time, but that was in the morning for one meal. So, eating in class was my only option. I would bring granola bars, or granola and trail mix or something that wasn't smelly or gross to hear someone eat.",
