  "text": "   Excuse any typing errors please, I\u2019m on mobile at work right now. I\u2019m 21 this year and started my 3rd year of college in August, and I have lost all motivation to attend my online classes or complete any work. I am only taking 11 credit hours at the moment because I was dropped from my 3 credit hour class for not attending. I work 24-36 hours a week but only on weekends and I have nothing but time to complete my work. \n\n   My issue is that with the pandemic, my mental health has taken a steep decline. I mean, I wasn\u2019t exactly mentally healthy to begin with but now I\u2019m even worse off. I can\u2019t get any sleep and when I do fall asleep I can\u2019t get out of bed. I\u2019m just really struggling right now, and it\u2019s showing in my grades. \n\n   I\u2019m only barely passing one of my four classes and it\u2019s too late to withdrawl. My depression isn\u2019t an excuse for how shit I am at time management and I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t complain to my professors about being depressed because who gives a fuck, honestly? I\u2019ve kind of accepted that I\u2019m going to take a really bad hit to my GPA, and lose my scholarship but I don\u2019t know where to go from here.\n\n  There\u2019s pretty much no coming back from my situation because I have more zeros and absences than I do time in class, so my question is... what do I do now? I feel like I should take a break from school but I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ll come back. I\u2019m feeling really hopeless right now and I have no direction. What would you do if you were me?",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, and a lack of motivation is tough to deal with. I\u2019m in my 4th year of school and have dealt with this feeling before. \n\nWhat got me out of a rut like this is meeting with my professors. Basically I just say \u201cHey, I haven\u2019t been trying my best, and it\u2019s showing in my grades, but I want to improve. What can I do?\u201d\n\nIn my experience, professors generally want you to succeed in their classes, and having a conversation with them is incredibly motivating. \n\nThere IS a path for you to get your grades up, but you won\u2019t find it until you talk to your professors about it. Reaching out to them is the first step. Hope this helps!",

I\u2019ve shown them that I don\u2019t care so of course they won\u2019t care either. \n\nI more so meant can I come back from this in the long run? Like, is college even still an option? If you saw my grades you would probably agree that passing these classes isn\u2019t happening.",

      "text": "I have been going through the same thing!  \nTo summarize:  \nI have always struggled with college upon arrival, but more so since the pandemic. I was a Computer Science major (which is known to be difficult) and last semester I literally passed 1 of 5 courses. I withdrew out of 2 courses (school had a late withdrawal period due to COVID), failed one, and well ultimately failed another. The worst thing is that I am confident that under better mental circumstances that I could've passed at least 4 of them. It has REALLY taken a huge toll on me. I feel ashamed and like an utter failure. I already know that I have to do an extra semester and my university has placed me in the next class year. I should be a junior, but technically I'm a sophomore due to the # of credits I have. May not sound like the end of the world to some, but for me I hate thinking about it. I am a minority and my family isn't far from well off. I feel like the world is on my shoulders to succeed, but I am failing terribly. I'm all for learning from failure, but there's only so much I can fail. I am not rich to be able to afford college forever and my school only has a certain amount of patience with me. This isn't even half of it, but I'll just leave it there. As of now, I am doing alright academically but hanging on by a thread. I wanted to take a break for this semester, but ultimately decided to suck it up. I have to get my degree and I intend to do that no matter what (almost). I am surprised I haven't lost my scholarships. My GPA tanked!! I practically had to beg them not to cut me off. Okay, enough of me.  \n. . .  \nI am not religious, but college has me praying on my knees in tears. I'm not even kidding. I've been somewhat in your shoes, so if I were you I would do what I think is best for myself. First off, email your scholarship and thoroughly explain what you are going through. You are human and you are going through a lot. Even consider going as far as lying if it might save your ass. Ask your any advisors or what not for advice. Pray if you're into that thing. Cry. Cry some more. But realize that you can overcome this. Yes, it sucks! GPA isn't everything. What matters is that you go through college, get your degree w/ as little debt possible, and come out with a positive attitude. Don't give up and succumb to the negativity. You already accepted the worst and that is a good thing. But also accept the best in your situation. Even if you professors don't care, email them. It can't hurt you academically if you don't. So you might as well. Fuck your pride. So what you haven't handed in work. Go to them regardless. You'll fail regardless. Plus they probably already know what you haven't handed in. You never know, it may just work out. That same email you send to your scholarship, send them an appropriately edited version. And I want to emphasize once again, LIE IF YOU THINK IT WILL SAVE YOUR ASS. Nothing too crazy, but maybe bend the truth a bit. Give them a sob story, but also confidence in you that you're serious about this. GPA may take a hit. Professors/Scholarship may not give af. And even if most of this is salvaged, your mental health isn't gonna fix itself overnight. Get help! Use the school's therapy for now until the semester is over. Maybe think about taking a gap semester. But if you really want it, you have to go back. I can't force you to. You may never feel ready and once you go back all those old feelings might come back. Work on yourself in that time. And even study so you don't break the habit. This is too long, but good luck!!! I am rooting for you! And I am struggling alongside of you. We can do this!!! If all fails, then come up with a strategy.",
