  "title:": "How do I get more motivated to get myself to class?",
  "text": "So right now I am in my 2nd year of uni, but the previous year I had only online classes, so I didn\u2019t have to physically get to campus at all. I didn\u2019t even move to where my uni was, I was just staying at my parent\u2019s house. After physical classes started this year I moved to a dorm and I was super excited to go to actual lectures, study in the library, all that stuff. But after 2 months I sort of started to realize that I can\u2019t really focus in physical class the way I could in an online one (I know, this is the opposite of what most people experience), so I started to have a feeling that attending lectures is pretty much worthless. It also started to get colder and darker outside and therefore harder for me to get myself out of home.\n\nRight now my attendance is pretty shit. Sometimes I will wake up, get dressed and be ready to get out of the door but then realize that I will probably be 10-15 min late. This will lead me to deciding to come to the 2nd part of the lecture, which will in turn make me realize that there\u2019s not much point in me biking a pretty long distance to the campus just for half of a lecture, which in the end will lead to me just staying home that day. Or even if I am on the right time, I just start to convince myself that this class is not that important and there\u2019s no point in showing up.\n\nHow do I motivate myself to actually get myself to the lectures? Sometimes I just don\u2019t wake up on time at all, sometimes I just feel really tired and not in the mood for getting outside and sometimes I just stay home for no rational reason. There is no mandatory attendance so I technically don\u2019t have to be there, but I know I\u2019m missing out on information that probably is gonna haunt when the exams come. I just don\u2019t know how to get out of that unmotivated mindset.",

And it\u2019s even harder when I don\u2019t really have friends in those classes to make the 1 hr of lecture less lonely and have someone to talk to afterwards. \n\n\nI think we just need to make friends to motivate us a lil more but that\u2019s hard ;-;",
