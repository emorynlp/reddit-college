  "title:": "A Discussion About Academic Integrity\u2026",
  "text": "I already know this will ruffle some feathers, so to start I want to be clear that I am not advocating for cheating. I do however, sometimes wonder about the standards of academic integrity and what goals they support\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean:\n\nAn incredible amount of effort, energy, and attention is dedicated by professors and universities as a whole towards preventing cheaters, or catching them in the act. From what I\u2019ve read/heard talking to people, it ranges anywhere from creating very \u201csterile\u201d testing conditions to diligent hunting of anyone who could possibly be cheating.\n\nIn response to that I ask, what\u2019s the actual purpose of all that effort? What\u2019s the goal?\n\nOf course the answers fall in the ballpark of creating a fair playing field and testing a student\u2018s true knowledge. But I\u2019m not satisfied with those. Why are those so critical?\n\nOnce again, I read/hear from people who look up A LOT at work, but it\u2019s normal and expected. They aren\u2019t a bad person or an idiot for looking up the resource/answer.\n\nWhy do schools emphasize content learning/consumption over teaching functional, usable learning skills? Of course every field has some root knowledge someone should know to get a starting job, but I don\u2019t believe 4 years of semester focused learning necessarily helps lock that information in.\n\nInstead, it seems to me, that academic integrity standards exist primarily to support University reputations. It lets them claim the most rigorous courses of study. It lets them get clean data to compare against other schools so they can market themselves as better.\n\nI personally think that\u2019s a poor reason to adhere to harsh AI policies. While I believe college is important, I don\u2019t believe it should be a crazy competitive business market. Otherwise you get policies like this which are not necessarily in full interest of student benefit, justified under the guise of another name.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts/opinions on this. I\u2019ve missed some points I have because my phone is lagging and I don\u2019t want to make this a full essay.",

      "text": "One concern I have is about students having the necessary skills to go out in the world to do well and make the whatever they touch better. I worry about my students who buy papers at paper mills. I worry about students who pay others to attend class and do homework for them. When the cheating student goes out into their field to work, they will use the diploma to vouch that they have integrity, knowledge, and ability that they need to do no harm to themselves or others. \n\nAdditionally, I hate having to catch cheaters but we spend time doing it because it is better a student learn now in the safety of schooling than it is when they could really create harm. Finding plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty is the worst part of my job. I don't even look for cheating, it is often blatantly obvious. Then when I catch it, it takes hours of my time I'd like to spend elsewhere, including giving meaningful feedback to students. Cheaters have no clue the hardship cheating brings to others. They're often only thinking of themselves.",

Why is looking something up on the Internet frowned upon pretty much universally, when I can forget about it later on and look it up, to nobody's detriment?\n\nEdit: Obviously, this is a GENERAL rule. Exceptions may apply. For example, I would expect a surgeon performing an emergency surgery to not have to spend precious time looking up how to perform the surgery.",

Memorizing the code for limes is easy. Remembering what you learned in college, post-graduation, is harder. Especially information that was taught in an unrelated general education credit. \n\nMy point is - if there is information I can afford to look up, why not allow me to do it?",

Pretty much all general education\n2. Data Structures & Algorithms. Basically, how to represent things in computer memory, and a few algorithms you can use to do stuff with them. I'm 99% sure I've long since forgotten some of what was taught there (although I was once asked about Big-O notation in a job interview. I am told, however, that much of what they do in a coding interview has no relation to the actual job.)",

Knowing how to use the word processing programs and spreadsheets now is a life saver.\n\nI sometimes test applicants on a specific task that they are not going to do daily in the job becasue they dont\u2019 know enough for me to test them on the job thing, I am not testing them  on if you know X but 1) how do you deal with this problem and what are the steps you take to resolves it and 2) this was something you said you could do on your CV.  How much can you actually do the thing you claim to do. And other such things.\n\nIf you neither remember nor use anything , it is 99% of the time because you did assignments like you just had to level up and collect mana and not to actually learn the goals of the assignment.\n\nThere is little evidence that concepts are ever truly forgotten.  Maybe I don\u2019t remember exactly if I do exponents or square roots int he PEMDAS thing, which I could look up, but I dont\u2019 forget that an order of operations exists.  You only \u201cforget\u201d concepts you never truly learned.\n\nDetails you remember more with use.\n\nI didn\u2019t always have a doctorate.  Once I had a BS and was a bartender.

It makes sense that you study that content until you know it in your bones so to speak. \n\nIn some cases, it's teaching philosophy. Some teachers believe the best way to hold students accountable for learning is to test them without access to resources. In other cases, teachers use active or problem posing learning because they see learning as happening other ways. Freire found that when students crammed for tests that they forgot the material soon after the test. I know that to be true for my own learning. So some teachers might let students use resources because they view the test as another learning opportunity.\n\nI can't speak for all teaching philosophies but this is my take on that question.",

Then their employers will be skeptical of *any* degree from college X, so they\u2019ll stop hiring students from college X. Or they might become skeptical of any CS degree in general and add leetcode/offshore interviews (which are ironically also bad indicators).\n\nIt works the other way too: if a college has a really rigorous curriculum, it will get a better reputation and graduates will get jobs easier. See MIT and Harvard.\n\n*That being said*, I agree there are things professors to do deter cheating (e.g. lockdown browser, not letting you view past questions) which are counter-productive. More importantly, professors who give hard work for the sake of hard work (busy work) are doing it wrong. Not only do obnoxious cheating-prevention and busy work hurt well-qualified students, they actually *inhibit* students from learning important material, since the students are spending all of their time cramming industry-useless knowledge and working on 100 variations of the same problem. This type of teaching produces degrees which are meaningless to employers *and* hard to achieve at the same time.",

My students tell me they can hear my explanation of many items when starting out in their careers.\n\nI do hold my students to high academic integrity standards,  and the majority rise to the high academic rigor requirements and meet the integrity standards.\n\nAs someone else commented students who cheat take up far too much of my time with meeting them, counseling them and then writing the reports for the academic integrity office.  I do all of this because I think it is important for the the majority of students who do the right thing.\n\nI personally do not believe cheaters should prosper, perhaps I am old fashioned.   Then again,I do not think paying money means you just get a piece of paper - students need to learn and master the material.  The piece of paper means that they have done so.  Want to just pay to get a piece of paper?   Do not attend a college that is accredited - the piece of paper means the student had to do more than just pay some money.  Students who receive their degrees from an accredited college had rigor and academic integrity requirements.",
