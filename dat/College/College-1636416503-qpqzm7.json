  "text": "Hey all, current junior in college. Was curious as to how your institution handled housing selection with students? My school decided to do a \u201clottery\u201d system, based off of GPA/ mix of seniority. However when I came down to the lottery I was screwed over. Placed in last (had a 3.5 gpa cumulative) and moved off campus because I was stuck in a dorm where no staff cleans up. Even had semen on the toilet seats in the communal bathroom, so you see my reason for leaving.\n\nAnyways thanks again.",
