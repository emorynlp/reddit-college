  "text": "I'm currently a freshman with a lot of credits carrying over. I looked over the requirements I had to graduate and found out that I could graduate in 3 years, 2.5 if I did a couple extra summer classes. While I know the general area I want to go into and potential jobs I find interesting, I don't know exactly what I want to do. Given my situation, is it worth it to try to graduate early or should I maybe try to take some other extra classes along the way that I find interesting to graduate in 4 years? Cost won't be an issue for me b/c I have a full ride.",

      "text": "Classes are important, but so is participation and experience related to the field you are interested in. Many upperclassmen spend sort of their time at internships to gain experience and build their portfolio for potential employers. You may miss some of this opportunity by rushing graduation.\n\nIf that\u2019s not something you care too much about, then by all means speak with advising for advice. Do what feels best for you, but if there\u2019s no need to rush the process, why rush it?",
