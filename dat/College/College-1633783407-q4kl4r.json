  "text": "I am a bit exhausted about how frustrating to studying something I love, but not able to understand it. I have been scoring as low level in my IQ test (89). Something that hit me hard, cause there is research said that it is impossible to pursue high level IQ demanding career with low level IQ. I was neglecting that and I am in engineering right now. I struggle a lot to digest lesson. This is my dream major, it was my dream since I'm in middle school, I love tech and science.  And I don't want to waste it away. And I don't want to be limited by my IQ. But yeah, this is what I got. I got 5 C out of 7 classes for 1st semester and 3 C and 2 D+ out of 6 classes in my 2nd semester. Good job. I know this gonna be hard for me to do this, but this was my dream. Knowing that I'm not able carrying the burden of this situation is heartbreaking. I always crying on my desk doing 2 question of homework at the end have to ask my friend how they solve it. It takes me hours to solve what my friend can solve in ten minutes. I just try to keep at it. I am so obsessed with this field and this is the only way. So yeah so unlucky to born like this.",

At the extreme ends it is fairly good at telling if you are in trouble or wildy superior to averag.\n\nAnt thing +/- 10 or so form normal has no sensitivity .  So stop with the  IQ tests.\n\n2) I work with some really genius people who are the top of their field and are a million times smarter than almost everyone, but many of the peopel who are still successful in this environment are people who learned how to be good, in a workman-like way, and are organized , personable, and do their hw and follow through on stuff.  I have to work longer and harder than my colleagues at some things.\n\nThat includes going, hey, I keep getting Ds. What can I do to not get Ds anymore,  \n\nStop comparing yourself to one friend .\n\nOfficial hours, tutoring center, active learning techniques, and prep for class instead of just going to class etc.\n\nI also work with people who have developmental disabilities, like Down syndrome etc, and there is no benefit at all to anyone saying i was born like this.  Those peopel can make massive improvements by using appropriate strategies , so can you",

      "text": "Hey man lately I've been thinking that maybe I overestimated my capacities, I was a good student at school. Even in college I do pretty well in theoretical classes, however in practical classes I'm just not good enough. I want to be an animator one day, I do an art major yet often feel sooo behind, and I'm not even sure if my major is helping me get the skills I require to become one. I often think I might never achieve my dreams but I just keep going forward, I guess is all about knowing and having faith (in whatever you believe in) that you\u00b4ll want day get where you want to, and even if you don't, remember that life isn't all about where you get professionally, but more about what you do with what you have, how much you can impact others and help them grow, you can be successful in other areas...just keep moving forward, good luck! A movie I love, a classic, maybe to clich\u00e9 for some, but that I personally love is It's a Wonderful life, it just calms me down to know that I have a purpose and that it all isn't about getting to a point by yourself but helping others too",
