  "title:": "Hey Freshman! ITS NOT A BIG DEAL TO BE LONELY THE FIRST QUARTER/SEMESTER IN COLLEGE",
  "text": "After the gazillionth \"It's been 2 hours on campus and I don't have friends\" I feel inspired to make this post.\n\nMaybe I can't relate because I had a weird high school experience myself but I imagine most of you have had the same friend group since elementary school and don't know any different. \n\nIt's not a big deal to be alone sometimes. People come and go, have different schedules, or just nothing in common. Put yourself out there and do everything you can but just starting out at college you'll honestly tie yourself down if you expect to have a \"group\" right off the bat. Your interests and whats important to you will change, for now it's perfectly normal to talk to as many people as possible and as you explore college as well as yourself some things will stick and others won't, that's just life. Don't interact with people with an expectation they'll be your best friend, relax, and enjoy getting to know others from different backgrounds.\n\nTrust me, literally NO ONE cares if you're doing things alone sometimes. Get comfortable with yourself, because that's probably the first step to getting comfortable with others.\n\nNow can y'all chill with these posts please?\n\nETA: This doesn't just apply to freshman. After covid it's only expected we all feel rough socially rn, I'm a junior and still feel lonely as heck pretty often.",

I mentioned trying to meet as many people as possible because I think thats the best advice out there, it likens the chance you'll always have a familiar face around and from there on its easier to connect with people. But people won't just pop up and invite you into their group.",

If I can make friends, go on dates, and have flings, I am sure you guys can too.\n\nThese are things that help me.\n\n* Don't be cynical, or a misanthrope. People generally think much better of you than you think they do.\n* Following the above tip, you can start conversations out of nowhere with people you added on your contact list. Show them you care.\n* You can be honest. People will appreciate you admitting if something is awkward or difficult for you to discuss if you are putting in effort.\n* Work on your emotional bullshit in your own time. \n* Don't try to fix other people's emotional bullshit in your own time.\n* People's favorite topics are usually themselves. Asking about what they do for a living, or their major is a great opener.\n* Politeness is appropriate in any situation.\n* Join clubs and organizations to meet people, do volunteer work.\n* Put effort into bathing and personal hygiene. I can't believe I have to say this.\n* Don't be needy. The best way to not be needy is to have a life outside of personal relationships. Like internships. Work. Arts and crafts. Working out.",

Usually there is something that brings everyone together at university, but often those things change from time to time over the 4 years to eventual graduation where everyone separates off to their new work location. But that's because for myself I focused more on academics and career similar to my other friends eventually everyone goes down their own path.\n\nLike you said if people just put themselves out there they will make friends likely it's really a numbers game of finding your group.",
