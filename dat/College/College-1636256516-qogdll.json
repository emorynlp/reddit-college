  "text": "Hi I am in college rn and sorta struggling with my classes im not sure if this is right place to ask but I am struggling in some of my classes i tend to do well on quizzes and practice problems, etc but come exam time, Im getting at best C\u2019s i could study for days and it just doesnt seem to produce results. For my one class I meet with my professor after each exam and we go over where I went wrong and it seems to help me understand but I have trouble applying what I learned/did wrong to the proceeding problems and exams. My other class my professor essentially forces us to self teach and does not offer office hours and I cant seem to grasp the material entirely. Id also like to mention that I dont go to a particularly difficult/competitive school and they dont offer many resources.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

If you could teach the concept you\u2019re learning to someone else, you\u2019ll do good on the exam. \n\nHow\u2019re you currently studying ?",

          "text": "I am a little scared to go to a tutor as the courses I am taking are generally \u201ceasy\u201d courses and are gen eds. I am scared the tutor will judge me for not being proficient in such easy classes. As far as studying goes I typically go over the quizes and practice problems that are released. A problem I run into is that when I do the practice problems I might struggle in one and then ill figure out the answer via online or resources from my prof. But then fail to utilize that in the next problem, ill go through this cycle and almost convince myself I understand the material because I understood the answer I found (if that makes sense)",

              "text": "tutors (at least at my school) get paid or receive credit for tutoring so that would be pretty rude if they judged you! \n\nI do something similar to you. You can understand the problem as you\u2019re watching someone do it/explain it but then when it comes time to do it by yourself you can\u2019t do it? is that what you\u2019re saying? \n\nThe best thing i\u2019ve found for this is repetition, especially if it\u2019s in math/chemistry! \n\nThe easiest way you can do study is to pull the problems you struggled with on the homework and compile them and then go over them with a tutor. They will be able to watch you as you do the problem and then help when you get lost but allow you to do 90% of the work.\n\nis it STEM related or a different topic?",

And yes that\u2019s exactly what happens as soon as I try, I struggle, for example doing something simple like mole conversions, I\u2019ll get through one problem but when I get to a new one with a new equation and new masses, etc I go completely blank.\n\nI will give your method a try, thank you for your help!",

There isn\u2019t such a thing as too easy of a course to justify tutoring because every student is different and has different strengths.\n\nI also recommend doing tons of practice problems to master the material and make sure you remember how to apply the concepts in every situation. Check to see if there are relevant video tutorials and practice problems on Khan academy for any of the units you are studying.",

      "text": "In my tough classes I used to make a buddy in the class and study with them. We would do the practice problems next to each other than switch papers and comment. Sometimes we would just talk through our reasoning. Just being in the same room helped me sometimes. I would then go to the professor on anything I had problems with and also labs like the math lab or writing lab. I would also use online sources to clarify like khan academy. I would try social learning, peer learning, mentor learning, different media like online videos and online practice lessons. I would just immerse myself in whatever I was learning. Reading articles about the topic and mapping out the textbook was also what I used to do. I would and still read the text have a notebook open and pick my favorite quotes or points write down the page number and the summary. I would then reference it a couple of days later with fresh eyes or when I was writing papers or doing an assignment.School is rough but you can get through it. You just might not have found your way of learning yet. Some ideas try small bursts of studying. Like 10-30 min of studying then take a break. I heard we learn best in bursts. Also stay organized map out your week and really plan yourself. You will feel more relaxed knowing you have a plan of attack. My background 3.75 in undergrad double major in supply chain and management 3.88 uw supply chain masters currently studying a masters in project management at Georgetown and have a 4.0. https://www.harvardbusiness.org/insight/short-bursts-not-shortcuts-the-value-of-learning-over-time/",

I do the readings and everything, but after each chapter (or section, etc), I talk to myself as if I was trying to explain it to someone else. \n\nAlso, depending on the class, YouTube has a lot of great videos that explain things differently. Sometimes how something is explained in a textbook isn't the way that you can understand, but YouTubers have different perspectives that may make something \"click\" better.",
