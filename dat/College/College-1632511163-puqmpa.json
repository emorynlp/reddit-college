  "text": "Is it normal for someone in thier mid to late 20s to be a university student, and therefore engage in typical univerity student behavior? (ie partying/socializing/drinking, within the realm of reason and responsiblity, while aslo acheving thier academic goals?)\n\nPs. By partying I dont nessisarilly mean totally crazy, balls to walls, all out frat parties.. but sufficently enjoyable social events where people partake in thier substance of choice in a responsible and mature way.\n\nBars and clubs scenes are also a factor in this question depending on campus culture, country and laws surrounding the drinking age.",

It\u2019s considered normal. And in some other countries, like in Scandinavia, it\u2019s common to take a gap year or a few gap years and start college when you\u2019re more mature. But a lot people take gap years even in America. Or some people don\u2019t know what they wanna do yet and they decide later. I\u2019m in college now, I just started at 22 and I go to American college (in Europe) but most of my classmates are American and 18/19 year old. Nobody even knew I was 22 until I told them tbh and there are a few people in their late-20\u2019s or early 30\u2019s in my classes and they party with us too. Nobody thinks it\u2019s weird.

      "text": "I\u2019m 27 and just graduated from a large public university with a great party culture. I also lived in the dorms as a transfer student (age 25).  I spent more time partying than I should have, but I survived a top school with good grades.\n\nI joined the military, went back to school at 23. At first I was hesitant about acclimating into the college culture however, it turned out great. I spent a good portion of college at parties, or club tournaments.. most of the time I was the oldest person there. \n\nI had a great college experience but here are the things I realized:\n\n- The top comment is 100% accurate, you cannot expect students to be as mature as you are. You\u2019ll realize students don\u2019t know how to pace themselves drinking, carry themselves drunk or high, or stay composed in times of stress/chaotic environments. This is a learning period for everyone. \n\n- I realized no one even cared to think about my age. I will say that I do look younger than my age so most people are surprised to find out I\u2019m older. \n\n- it\u2019s less about age and more about an individuals maturity and awareness. For example, in the military I had supervisors that were 15-20 years older than me that I would consider immature. In college, there are many students that were more mature and composed than many of the adults my age. It\u2019s less about their age, and more but the individual. My point is, surround yourself with people that share your same ideals of maturity and fun. It\u2019s college, you\u2019ll find your people. \n\n- students will look start to look up to you for guidance and decision making. Be prepared to be seen as an older sibling. I trust that you can be someone they\u2019ll look up to while also being capable of having fun. \n\n- my biggest concern was making anyone feel uncomfortable because of my age and actions. Because you will have to acknowledge that age commands you dictate yourself appropriately. You have the life experience to judge right from wrong.\nSo, it was important for me to hold myself accountable and to higher standards especially when partying with younger students. \n\nI hope that\u2019s something you share. If you can do that, you\u2019ll have no problem enjoying college culture.\n\nDM for more questions, hope it helps. Congratulations on going back to school, it\u2019s a hell of an accomplishment.",

When you narrow down onto 4-year undergraduate degree, about 10% are over 24.\n\nTakeway is, though your college will vary, it may well be every tenth classmate is over 24. Some handful of those will be interested in socializing with younger college students.\n\nOther takeaway is when we talk about college, even when we can reasonably assume we're talking about full-time residential education of 18 to 22 year olds in 4-year programs, a huge chunk of college students aren't that. There are part-time students, students who live at home, older students, and students in two-year programs.\n\nSo to answer your question, the presence of such students is normal, just less common and, sadly, unfamiliar to those we think of as the typical college student.",

      "text": "25 isn't that far off from 22. Depending on how you look for your age, you wouldn't stand out at some parties. However, it depends on the culture of the campus. I went to a commenter school, transfered when I was 20 and I felt so young, everyone else was mid 20s + in a lot of my classes. A lot of said older people talked about parties they would go to on campus. Life doesn't end at 22, if you want to go, do it. Just don't hit on the people who are 18-20 cause if you are late 20s I'd consider that too young",
