  "text": "Here\u2018s some backstory: My university has the system that you can sign up for exams on the date that best fits for us. If we sign up for a date and don\u2018t show we\u2018re locked from taking it on the next date. The exam I\u2018m talking about was Bioethics and it was at 12pm (which is so not early) But I couldn\u2018t sleep until 5am the night before and when I woke up at 9am on the day of I fell asleep again without noticing and only woke up again at 2pm.  I feel so god damn stupid and now I don\u2018t know if I should tell my professor what happened or what I should do in general. (It wasn\u2018t an important one gladly but still) I feel like not telling him and just dealing with the consequences since this is in fact totally my fault.",

Some tips for asking that worked for me: be honest, be humble, and don't make excuses. Let them know that you know you messed up and yes it was your responsibility to wake up on time. And let them know that you're not expecting them to do so but if there was any chance at all for you to retake it you'd greatly appreciate it, etc",

You've already called yourself stupid a million times. The professor is likely going to be much more forgiving than that even if they don't want to be considerate of your situation. Asking for some slack can't possibly hurt as bad as your own disappointment at this turn of events.",
