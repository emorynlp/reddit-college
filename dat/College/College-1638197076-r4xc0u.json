  "title:": "I overslept for my exam and I\u2018m so angry at myself",
  "text": "Here\u2018s some backstory: My university has the system that you can sign up for exams on the date that best fits for us. If we sign up for a date and don\u2018t show we\u2018re locked from taking it on the next date. The exam I\u2018m talking about was Bioethics and it was at 12pm (which is so not early) But I couldn\u2018t sleep until 5am the night before and when I woke up at 9am on the day of I fell asleep again without noticing and only woke up again at 2pm.  I feel so god damn stupid and now I don\u2018t know if I should tell my professor what happened or what I should do in general. (It wasn\u2018t an important one gladly but still) I feel like not telling him and just dealing with the consequences since this is in fact totally my fault.",
