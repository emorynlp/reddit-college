  "text": "I had a family emergency come up earlier in the semester where grandfather had a heart attack. I was given an extension for the HW I missed and completed it. I had another emergency come up and have medical documentation to provide for the past week I missed to make up this weeks hw. I emailed my professor asking for an extension and explaining to him, and he said \u201cClass policy doesn\u2019t allow hw extensions\u201d. What should I do about this? Can\u2019t he get in legal trouble for this?",

Professors are free to deny any extensions for any reason, even when family or other issues arise, as long as the syllabus does not contradict the decision. Even if he gave you one before, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guaranteed to get one again. Also, timing can be an issue. Did you reach out in advance to ask for an extension, or did you wait until the deadline passed?\n\nIf you want to try to complain to the department chair, that would be the next step, but keep in mind that it may not go anywhere.",

And if I have documentation then there\u2019s nothing they should be able to do about it tbh. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d rather let me make up 3 missing Hws rather than get sued :).",

Professors have extraordinary amount of freedom to run a class as they see fit. It's damn near impossible to get one fired or even in trouble, even for things like Holocaust denial. I'm in the middle of an issue with my school after my professor was spreading Anti-vax propaganda and when I alerted the faculty I was given a punative F on my final assignment. I'm still having meetings about this now and it happened during the summer semester.",
