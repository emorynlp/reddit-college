  "text": "So I had this history midterm that was due last week and my professor gave us a week to do it. The thing is the, the assignment was locked on canvas so we nobody in the class could do it! We emailed him and everything but didn\u2019t get a response till the day the assignment was due. Now my professor said sorry for the issue and said it was fixed and midterm was due Tuesday(10/26). So I go to canvas and go open up modules and the midterm is still locked, I also tried to access it through assignment but it was still locked. So we emailed him again but we didn\u2019t get a response till the day the assignment was due again! Now in this message he said the assignment was open and to get it in as soon as possible.  So  finally the midterm is open but I was now occupied with other classes and midterms, my jobs and other task. Because of this I failed to realized the midterm submission closed at 12 tonight(10/28) so I\u2019m no longer able to submit it . I was just we wanted to know if it was okay to submit it a day late because I feel it\u2019s definitely the Professor fault cause of his technical difficulties and how does he aspect to get it done within a smaller time frame than originally planned?!",

      "text": "I'm sure he'll be understanding. Your situation is valid and seems like the prof's fault, it's not like you intentionally didn't do it. Since they're not answering, try to go to their office hours and talk to them in person. It comes off as genuine and that you really care. If they don't have office hours, send another email after a day or two to remind them.",
