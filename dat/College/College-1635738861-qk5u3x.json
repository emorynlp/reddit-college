  "text": "this is my third semester of college but i\u2019m technically still a freshman due to the absolute dumpster fire that was the spring 2021 semester. i\u2019ve changed my major approximately six times now. before i started applying for schools i wanted to become a nurse like my mother, but i am absolutely terrible at math so i was like, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d i was accepted as an english major to college. i went from english to political science to early childhood education to general studies to a business-geared ICP (individualized curriculum program) and i realized that i have no motivation for this particular field. i just decided to drop half of my course load and prepare for next semester because i finally decided what i want to do. too bad i didn\u2019t come to this revelation sooner so i could have saved everyone a lot of time \ud83d\ude02",

              "text": "Hi :),\nI\u2019m ITP student right now. It\u2019s really difficult but amazing field. One piece is of advice, be really careful about the program you choose. There a lot of AA program out there that advertise like you could do that two year program and be done, but you can not take the certification exam without a BA. Also different program focus on different elements. For example my program is really focus on linguistics and culture. So, we don\u2019t start interpreting until year 3 so that we have a really strong foundation when we do. You want to make sure you choose a program that is a good fit and will get you were you want to go. Good luck :)",
