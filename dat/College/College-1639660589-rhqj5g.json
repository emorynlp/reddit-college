  "text": "Hi guys. So I believe my professor gave me the wrong final grade on my transcript. I will explain, blackboard says I have 828/1085 points out of all the running assignments, I calculated that and it\u2019s a 76%. On her syllabus it says her class is out of 1000 points and 3 papers are out of 120 total points, and the final is out of 300 points. Blackboard says the 3 papers are out of 150 points. So I subtracted 30 points from each final score on all 3 papers and divided it by 120. Added up all my completed coursework, and I ended up with a 72%. Either way I calculate it I still end up with a C in the course. I added in penalties for missing class, and make up work, and I should still have a C in the course. Blackboard has this section called \u201cClass Average\u201d and it is a 66.7%, I looked into it some more and found out class average is all the students grades averaged out. I have emailed her, but she\u2019s on her honeymoon, but I\u2019ve already been admitted into another school for the spring semester. (I\u2019m a transfer student) I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I should do or how I should go about it, I don\u2019t want to flat out tell her my grade is wrong, but even if I have 5-6 zeroes I still would have a C. And her syllabus doesn\u2019t have any penalties for missing class either.",

      "text": "Your school should have a grade change procedure for when final grades were entered calculated incorrectly. You usually have at least a semester or year to do it, so wait until she gets back from her honeymoon and then you can send a reminder email unless for some reason you need the grade corrected right away. If she doesn't respond with either an explanation of the grade that makes sense or an offer to correct it you can talk with your advisor and the department chair about next steps.",

      "text": "Either she doesn\u2019t care (possible), or it\u2019s an issue with blackboard\u2019s calculations vs what she\u2019s using offline. Blackboard doesn\u2019t have the easiest user-interface on the backend.\n\nGiving her the benefit of the doubt, the only thing that matters is the letter grade - the score doesn\u2019t go on your transcript. It sounds like your letter grade is accurate, so you\u2019re all good. If other students have issues, they\u2019ll raise them.\n\nBut, if the class average is only 66.7%, I imagine she\u2019ll be having a stern conversation from the dean. A poor class average is the sign of a poor teacher, not poor students.",
