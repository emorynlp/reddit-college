  "text": "Hello everyone! I am 31 and dropped out of college many years ago and have a chance to go back. My company works with Strayer University and completely covers all costs. Has anyone done one of these programs before? Did it actually benefit you? I\u2019ve read mixed reviews, but my thought is it\u2019s a free degree so why not? Any tips or advice is welcome please!",

So if the yearly tuition your employer pays is 14k you would subtract 5250 and pay taxes on remaining. Your taxes maybe around 2-3k a year. Your employer will most likely take that from your check over a certain period. All associates and bachelors are taxable over limit. Some masters if you answer questions a certain way you don\u2019t have to pay taxes on the benefit. For instance does this open you up for a new career? If you want the full picture about costs ask about taxes. Also school is a time commitment so factor opportunity costs. On the flip look up salaries of jobs that will be open to you if you have a degree. Look up jobs outside of company that you could get too. You might also want to ask if you have to stay at the company a certain amount of time after the degree. Although if it\u2019s a small org you might not want to for politics.",
