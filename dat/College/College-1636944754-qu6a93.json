  "text": "Ok so I have no idea which subreddit to put this on but this subreddit is full of educated mostly early 20\u2019s aged people so I thought it would be good. I am 20 years old and I am getting a general transfers degree right now. I live with my parents but need to move immediately as it\u2019s taking a horrific toll on my mental health. I live in a shitty dangerous city and I want to persuade a career in e-commerce. I use social media for my e-commerce store so having beautiful photos and networking with influencers is a must for me. I was thinking MIA,LA, or PHX. I have made a pros and con list of every city yet i\u2019m still stuck. I want to live in a city good for networking and nice weather. I also wanna live somewhere with no crazy taxes. \nLA pros: networking,full of young ppl, dream city since forever, \ncons: taxes,expensive, \nPHX pros: close to LA so i can travel there while establishing my carrerrr, expensive but cheaper than la & mia. beautiful desert location.\ncons: boring night life, no culture, feels like a strip mall\nmia pros: beach duhh, so much culture\ncons; i feel like no young people move there to start out their life, only like 30+ people. also idk any spanish currently \n\n\nI also don\u2019t know if I should go back to college after i get my associates degree. I would really appreciate some guidance.",
