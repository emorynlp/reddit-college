  "text": "Hello, I hope that this is in the right subreddit. I have an assignment for one of my courses where we have to make a survey and ask others to complete it. It will take a few minutes to complete and will be completely confidential. We just wanted to know your opinions on online exams. Thank you so much for your time!\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwlNHj8pRD1kASzE9hJpdBpv3UvCilKWR6AYBLIejoz4I0\\_g/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwlNHj8pRD1kASzE9hJpdBpv3UvCilKWR6AYBLIejoz4I0_g/viewform)",

For instance, there\u2019s a question where you say that your grades have either gone up or down because of online proctoring, but there was no option to say that they haven\u2019t changed",
