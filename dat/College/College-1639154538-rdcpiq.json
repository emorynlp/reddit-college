Honestly, college hasn\u2019t been bad, but it\u2019s not really my thing.  I would rather get a job at a tech company and have them teach me how to code even if it takes a while.  \n\nWhat I like about college is that it helps you be more independent in a way that will help you when you get out of college.  I also like the fact that you have many opportunities to make connections with others.\n\nAt the same time, sometimes I miss being home with my dad as him and I are close.  My college is only two hours away though, so i do come home for some weekends.  I also just hate the fact that we have to take extra classes that aren\u2019t that necessary for our major.

Got out of high school and went straight to community college, where I took 25 credits/semester and finished my associates in a year with some summer classes. \n\nWent on to undergrad and did a semester at 15 credits (by insistence of my advisor) and with no job (by insistence of my parents) and was bored out of my mind, so I went to the gym, kissed boys, took yoga classes with my friends, and volunteered a lot with an organization that was important to me for that one semester. The rest of my time in college was under Covid, so I took a more than full time load, double majored, while working two part time jobs and catering for a Greek house on my campus on an as-needed basis. \n\nI\u2019ve always hated school. I was always quiet and treated like an outsider, and overall it was like my own personal hell. I did whatever I could in college to achieve as much personal freedom as possible (working to make $$$) while finishing my courses asap to graduate early and get it over with. I ended up graduating double major with a 3.8 GPA in 3 years. \n\nNow I\u2019m working an entry level office position in the field I want to work in while I study for my grad school admissions test (LSAT). \n\nCollege is 100% what you make it. If you like doing Greek life, and heading a club, and organizing study groups and soaking in the nostalgia of academia, do it! And if you\u2019re disliking college, I know everyone says this, but go do something! Get out of your dorm and interact with people in some way. Take the relaxation yoga class at your gym. Get on bumble BFF and get a group of people to go play monopoly with in the dining hall on weeknights. Go to parties, meet new people, try new things, and learn as much as you can. \n\nNow that I\u2019m working, I can\u2019t wait to go back to school for my JD. I miss my notebooks and my fancy highlighters and pens. I miss wearing school gear and having it feel current and not nostalgic. And I\u2019m ready to advance in my career.",

Even in classes which hypothetically are 'in person', the vast majority of the work requires a computer to at least finish up the assignment; the longer the commute, the longer I'm away from my home office, where I can actually get the work done. Frankly the most interesting thing I had to learn was the bus routes of the city I live in, and my biggest stressors involved walking to the bus stop with the 'luggage'.",

Like you pay this group of people to be your friends because let\u2019s be honest they probably wouldn\u2019t talk to you if you\u2019re not in the frat and get involved with parties just seems stupid to me. \n\nBut anyway didn\u2019t plan to have a college experience was honestly just wanting to chill but guess the universe had other plans.",

      "text": "I used to dream about the college experience. My first quarter in uni, I used to reach out to anyone I could meet. I joined clubs, joined discords, group chats, you name it. I would literally hit up people and drive 20-30 minutes to campus just to meet with one student for boba, simply because I was so desprate to make friends. \n\nThey didn't know me, and I didn't know them. Yet I was willing to make that connection. For some reason, the second hangouts never happen and I'm always hit with the generic \"It was nice meeting you\" response. And I never hear back from them again. I ended up getting dissapointed because no matter how hard i tried, no matter how much I tried reaching out to people, the social awkwardness was still there. In the end, I began questioning myself If I was the problem, or if I ever gave off bad vibes. I stopped hitting up people after that.\n\nHow do you make friends in college if everyone is so closed off and unwilling to get to know people? \n\nSo yeah, I gave up on the possibility of having that social aspect of college, as well as the so-called \"college experience.\" Which is nothing but a pipe dream our covid-stricken world. Rn, I'm just trying to get that paper, and the thought of graduating alone doesn't seem too bad afterall.",
