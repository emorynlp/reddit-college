  "text": "I need advice. Like WWYD. I am 25, so \u201cnon traditional student\u201d and I\u2019m just now completing my first semester. I have taken and dropped pre-calc 2x now (wasting money like I have it to spend \ud83d\ude44) I just can\u2019t get past it, and I keep thinking to myself maybe I just don\u2019t get a 4-year degree? Maybe I just get an Assosiates degree where the only math class I have to take is statistics. And I would be done next year with school. At my CC I am a biotechnology student and was planning on continuing at a university to study environmental microbiology and genetics but is all the debt going to be worth it, I live in a very affordable state and 40-50k is very much a livable wage. Also if I don\u2019t have to transfer then I don\u2019t have to be so crazy and exhausted by my grades. Right now I\u2019m a honor student through my school and part of a national honor program in which I\u2019m a VP. Idk if I just made to big of a leap, if I\u2019m rationally thinking, or depressed and trying to find a reason to take the easy way?",
