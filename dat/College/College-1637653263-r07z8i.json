  "text": "I need some advice. My parents look like their health is dwindling and they have a lot to worry about. They are pulling out a huge mortgage, which means they can\u2019t pay for my college expenses. They used to rely on me when I was back home for most stuff since my mom can\u2019t drive and my dad does basically everything. Im in California, so I can transfer to a community college and transfer to a UC afterwards. I just keep thinking about it, should I stay behind and go to cc to help my parents ?",

Granted, I don't really know their situation. \n\nI've adopted the thought process that I don't owe my parents anything. It's true. I didn't choose to be here, they chose to bring me here. It was their idea to raise a child altogether. For me to owe them anything because my dad decided to keep it in is crazy. \n\nBe careful spending your life tending to others who can't help themselves. Your parents are adults. They need to figure out how to fix their situation and not drag you into it. That's completely unfair. Having a child to use their labor to satisfy your needs is... unsavory. \n\nYou need to focus on yourself. If they can't pay your college expenses, you should find a way. I don't think it's up to you to save your parents from their own doing. I really think it's a bad idea to change your life to cater to theirs, even if they do need help. These are things that grown adults should be prepared for. \n\nUnfortunately, they aren't going to stop aging. I'm 32, my parents are mid 60's and watching them get older has been interesting. I live 300 miles away and don't see them too often. When I do, I can always see the differences between the last time I saw them. They're getting older. It is what it is. They have their own struggles too but that's their life, not mine.",

I made the decision to leave school and move back home. Turned out to be one of my biggest regrets. \n\nI did not do well in CC. Being back home and taking more responsibility left little room for school and I was never able to finish. I do well financially now, but it took me a lot longer and a lot more work to get where I am. Degrees just open up more doors and opportunities. \n\nLooking back now, I realized my mom was a single mom that raised 3 kids by herself. I\u2019m sure, whatever she was going through, she could have handled it. As a parent now, I would want my kid to stay in school. \n\nInstead of going back and \u201chelping\u201d, maybe look at ways to not be a burden on them (Don\u2019t mean that in a negative way). If they are paying for school, look at loans or scholarships. Get a part time job for some extra cash. You\u2019ll be in better position to help when you finish school. Make that your priority.",
