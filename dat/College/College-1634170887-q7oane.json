  "text": "This happened last year as well. I feel like I\u2019m having deja vu. The first 3 weeks of the class seemed like so much work and I didn\u2019t adapt to it well and the professor wasn\u2019t great. I started to ponder about dropping the class. I was extremely close to dropping the class. But I took the first exam and it turned out that I did really well. \n\nThis is the same situation all over again. \n\nI studied for 1 day and I got an 88% which is not bad considering the average was a 68% \n\nBut anyways I am going to keep the class and continue to work hard.",
