      "text": "Hi, there. \n\nI would suggest trying to find your college\u2019s subreddit if there is one. If there is one, you can ask for people\u2019s recommendations. Also, somewhere on the college\u2019s subreddit, there is a search bar. Type keywords like \u201cgen ed\u201d, etc. in the search box. There are high chances that people asked these questions and you can find them through by using the search on the subreddit. \n\nIf your college doesn\u2019t have a subreddit, talk to the people at your school.",
