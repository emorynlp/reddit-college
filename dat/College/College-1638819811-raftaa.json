  "text": " I did a good preperation. I made all the notes in class and memorized them. The professor said to make notes and not to preffer the book . Still he gave questions from rhe book and luckily i did memorized everything from the book. And what i got? 45/100. Fuck !!!!!!!. I have been struggling with this subject. I got bad grades in 3 of the exams and passed in one and that one exam i did was essay type,( we have multiple choice not essay ,) because i arrived 5 minutes late and he said i cannot take my exam. So he made an essay exam and i passed in that. But worked hard in my final exam and still didnt pass. I am a freshman and i am in first semester. Fuck !!!!! I really wanna cry and break things.",

It's ok to be mad and disappointed but don't dwell on it, What's done is done... all you can do now is dust yourself off and look at your study habits amd your semester as a whole and make a list of what you change to ensure this doesn't happen again and make the necessary adjustments. Good luck.",

She required way too much out of her students and required regular \u201cSocratic\u201d style interactions that felt lackluster at best, and definitely not an open and encouraging environment for thought and discussion. The rest of my poli-sci classes were very interesting and enjoyable. I hope that you find better luck with this class and that you don\u2019t give up :) you got this",
