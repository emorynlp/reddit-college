I considered majoring in it myself but I knew I would probably struggle too much. I have wanted to drop out several times. I don\u2019t like school and I have ADHD so college has been a miserable experience. I\u2019m on my 8th year of college just to get a bachelors degree. I have kept pushing through though because I knew I\u2019d be mad at myself if I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m finally about to graduate and I\u2019m proud of myself for not giving up even though I have hated this entire experience. If you want to finish college, you are absolutely capable of it. You just need to figure out the right major for yourself.",
