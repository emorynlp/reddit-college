  "text": "My professor gave me the wrong grade for my overall final grade. I was given a B- instead of a B. He did the same thing with my midterm grade as well, except he gave me a C instead of a B. My midterm grade was updated on BlackBoard but still hasn\u2019t been updated on my academic transcript. I\u2019m worried this is going to happen with my final as well. He hasn\u2019t responded to my email about my incorrect final grade. This professor has caused me so much stress over grading, who would I even go to if he doesn\u2019t fix my final and my midterm for my academic transcript??",
