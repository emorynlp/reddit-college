  "text": "I dropped out of university about 3 years back and until recently I felt like an absolute failure to myself, family, and teachers. Thankfully I didn\u2019t go through with my attempts during that time, got myself some professional help, and today I finished my last final this semester and passed all my classes. Feels like a massive step in putting that chapter of my life behind me.",
