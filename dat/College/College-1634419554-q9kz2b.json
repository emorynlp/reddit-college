  "text": "My heart is beating faster than normal and I can't my leg can't stop bouncing even though the class starts in four days. I already know the times and where I'm supposed to go. I just don't know how to relax and stop feeling as anxious as I am right now.\n\nMy dad says that it's okay and there isn't as much noise and people inside a classroom in comparison to high school but that somehow doesn't calm me in the slightest.",

      "text": "Deep breaths (box breathing helps anxiety), move through it (go for a walk, shake your arms around), have a snack. Think about what you'd tell a friend who was feeling anxious.\n\nRemind yourself that anxiety is your body trying to keep you safe. Thank your brain for looking out for danger, but there's no danger so no need to be so vigilant. Lay down and tense all your muscles at once, then let go with a big exhale.\n\nAlso, your dad is right. You'll feel awkward at first but so does everyone else. Everyone's so wrapped up in their own lives and concerns they're not thinking about what you're doing, promise. And college classes are definitely chiller than high school.",

      "text": "First off, congrats for getting to this point. This past year and half has not been easy on everyone, but you made it here.  You're in school, taking classes, probably working and tackling home life/family/personal issues too. Remember, you're not in this alone. Every student has been taking online classes and likely started in-person classes only last month. They're nervous. You're nervous. The faculty are nervous. Just remember to see out the support your school offers, even if it's just to talk to someone about how you're feeling.  And if you need a break from the class, take it.  Sometimes a few minutes outside or without a mask on can make all the difference. Best of luck. You'll be fine. \ud83d\ude00",
