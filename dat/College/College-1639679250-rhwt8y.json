  "text": "This might seem like a simple question. But my Mom has a varying opinion on what I should do. I think I should graduate as a junior and start community college early before transferring to 4 year university halfway for less tuition. My Mom thinks I should graduate as a senior but use that year to take community college classes as apart of dual enrollment, so I can get the same classes for cheaper. The only problem is I think the community college classes have slightly less credit. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\ntl;dr\nShould I prioritize a cheaper tuition over full credits I\u2019ll eventually have to make up?",

      "text": "It sounds like you want to go to your state university. First thing to do is to find the credit transfer policy from your community college. Look up \u201c[University Name] Transfer Equivalency System [Community College Name].\u201d You should be able to find a long list of all the credits that transfer into your university and what class (if any) they count for. \n\nNext, look up \u201c[University Name] General Education Requirements.\u201d This may also be \u201ccore class requirements\u201d or \u201cdivisionals.\u201d Basically, you\u2019re looking for the classes or categories of classes that every student needs to take regardless of their major. At my school, everyone needs to take ENGL 101 and 102, 3 science classes in different fields, 3 labs, 1 math class, etc. \n\nNow, find the general education classes that have corresponding direct transfer classes at your community college. Make a big list of them. See what, if any, of those classes you can take as a senior at your high school. \n\nDual enrollment doesn\u2019t look bad for a college applicant at all, and there isn\u2019t any difference between the credit you get for a dual enrolled class as a high school senior or taking the same class as a full community college student. Credit is credit. \n\nThe important part is that you don\u2019t take classes that won\u2019t help you when you transfer. Take ones that will give you general education requirement credit so you get them out of the way. If you can take classes that do that as a senior and at a reduced rate, then do it.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling lost, reach out to the counselor at the community college and your high school counselor. Loads of people do community college to a public university, so the CC counselor will know what you need to do and what classes are best.",

          "text": "This is very helpful, thank you! I initially thought the dual enrollment credit would be the same as the credit earned from taking the class in college, but my counselor said it might only transfer like 80% of the credits needed to not have to take in college for some reason. I\u2019m actually interested in a out of state university so I was worried if the variance in state curriculums would have an effect on all of the credits transferring too. Maybe there was miscommunication on my part, I\u2019ll ask my counselor to clarify what she means. Thanks!",

              "text": "Alright, I think I understand what your counselor means. I think they\u2019re saying that some of the classes you take dual enrolled won\u2019t transfer over. It\u2019s not really possible to get partial credit: you either do or you don\u2019t. \n\nOut of state will complicate the situation more since they\u2019ll be less integrated with your community college system. Less stuff will transfer as prettily. You should still be able to find the two credit conversion things I mentioned though, which will let you know what works and doesn\u2019t for transfer credit. Public universities will be more accepting of transfer credit than private ones, generally.\n\nAlso, make sure you\u2019ve looked at the price for out of state tuition, which is often three times higher for non-residents. You might have already checked this out, but wanted to give a heads up.",

The other important thing is to find out if the classes are dual or concurrent enrolled. Dual enrolled means you have a high school teacher working with you, and you are getting highs school credit. Concurrent means you are doing it by yourself, not associated with your school. You are just a regular college student (after you do some extra paperwork), and get all the credits that come with it.",

      "text": "Which classes have the highest potential to transfer to your desired schools/major? I did dual enrollment and two semesters at community college. I also graduated early (December vs May). My dual enrollment credits didn\u2019t do anything for me. My cc credits were specifically tailored to my major/desired college, so they helped me out more. Also, can you take APs, IBs, or something similar? My AP credits gave me quite a bit of credit in the end. \n\nMy answer is probably a bit more wishy washy than you want, but it really depends. You need to consider what classes you can take and how they transfer. Otherwise, you risk wasting a year at cc for credits that don\u2019t help you in the end. Do some research and try reaching out to advisors at your top school(s). That\u2019s how I got mine to work out so smoothly. That said, it helped that my top school was my local state school and was in my home town while the cc was a town over. \n\nAlso, you should consider what you want and why. I graduated early because I was so bored and desperate to leave high school (my best friends had also decided to graduate early) but it was lonely not seeing my friends every day. In my experience, the people at cc were very nice (even though most of them were a good four years older than me at least) but since we were all commuting it wasn\u2019t a very social environment. I don\u2019t regret my choice at all; I\u2019m just pointing out that it wasn\u2019t without its costs. Overall, I had a plan, stuck to it, and it all worked out. That\u2019s all I can suggest for you. \n\nAnd just a personal anecdote to show how it worked out. Between cc, ap, and one class test out, I could\u2019ve graduated college in three years without going above 16 credits a semester. But let me emphasize again that\u2019s because I specifically chose my cc classes knowing they would transfer and exactly how. I stayed an extra year to get another bachelors and a graduate certificate and along the way picked up a free associates as well. Now I\u2019m getting ready to interview for phd programs.",

              "text": "My transition was really smooth since I was in state for everything. No regrets. But I\u2019ll tell you what I did and what I would suggest you do in more detail if you\u2019re interested. Go to the schools and see their plan of study. Choose things that aren\u2019t major specific but that might be harder for you (as a Biochem major I chose calc and physics personally). I\u2019m not familiar with film or film school so I don\u2019t know what that would look like. Also, it depends on you. Then see if the schools have a transfer credit database where you can see how classes transfer. It\u2019s even better if you can also find an advisor in the program and contact them. They may or may not answer, but if they do they will have even better knowledge of what can transfer and what cannot. My advisor was so helpful when I was doing this. Also talk to your high school counselors and cc to get more info about dual enrollment so you can get all the information to make your best decision. Honestly, just talk to the cc in general to see how to apply, especially if you\u2019re applying as a guest student (I had some difficulties but they got resolved by talking to the cc). Since you\u2019re first gen, my main advice is especially to talk to everyone you can and not be shy about being new to the system. I\u2019m a professor\u2019s kid so I was comfortable navigating it all. But my dad (the professor in question) was first gen and always talks about how he felt other students knew everything while he was completely lost. Keep talking to people until you find the person who can get you the answer you need. It\u2019s how I got so far. I\u2019ve made some missteps in my degree planning but talking to the right person always set me back on track. See if the cc have scholarships you can apply for too while you\u2019re at it. Also see if you can find a 4 year school that has an agreement with the cc to accept students or who will give scholarships to students from ccs. Or that allows you to take gen eds at cc to make your degree cheaper (they may not advertise it well. My college allows students to be in a program where they take gen eds at cc and their major specific courses at the 4 year but I would\u2019ve never known if I hadn\u2019t met people doing it). If nothing else, they\u2019re a good backup for you while you chase whatever your dream school is. The only time you might be cautious about cc credits is if you\u2019re planning to apply to grad school or especially med school, because people suggest there is a prejudice still in place against cc. But I will say even then it\u2019s not a deal breaker. I\u2019m getting interviews at highly regarded PhD programs with cc credits and an associates. \n\nTo give you an example of what I suggested I\u2019ll show you what I did using my majors and school. I searched Purdue transfer database then clicked the link to [here](https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwtxcrd.p_select_info). There I entered all the info about the cc and class to churn out how it transferred or alternatively I could pick a class at Purdue and see what class was equivalent at the cc. I also searched purude plus my major and course plan of study to go [here](https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=10&poid=12643&_ga=2.139449331.197469634.1568032779-1333141381.1561056722) or [here](https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=18779&_ga=2.6138481.370420862.1639620307-1322179910.1638990887). Then I selected candidate courses from the non major listing.  I could plug those into that database as well. If you have aps or other related credits, see if there\u2019s a database for those too. The next part might be a bit harder. I searched my major plus advisor to find an advisor to contact and email. You might also need to find the staff directory for the program to find the contact info. Then send an email explaining your situation. My dad unfortunately handled that part so I don\u2019t know exactly what he said. If they write back great. Have them help you figure out if you\u2019re missing anything. \n\nHope this all helps and the best of luck to you! Starting college early was such a confidence boost for me. I am so thankful I did it, because when I started at my four year I already knew I could do college classes well and how to be a college student. As someone with anxiety, it was such a nice transition. It also helped that I got out of some difficult classes (calc 2 for one) and had more flexibility for my degree. Just make sure you get advice specific to your situation. Multiple opinions if you can. Also, always double check. Advisors have a lot of students to take care of. Make sure you know what you need to do as well.\n\nETA: you can always look into taking cc classes while you\u2019re at your four year too. My brother and friend did over the summer. Also, testing out of unnecessary classes could help you. I tested out of my speech class. A lot of people test into higher levels of a language if that\u2019s a requirement to shorten the amount of classes they take.",
