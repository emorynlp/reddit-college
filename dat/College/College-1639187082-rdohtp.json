My only expense is my doctors bills but it\u2019s really low priced. Dorm, again I\u2019d only buy things like food at our student center or when I went clubbing. I barely went to the grocery store because 1. I didn\u2019t have the fridge space and 2. I was forced to have a meal plan. Living in an apartment with my roommate, I\u2019m paying for groceries which are easily $50-75 monthly; I got doctors up here and they charge you for breathing; and my rent is $800 a month and I\u2019m not working while I\u2019m here, so I have to ask to be reimbursed for my medical bills and food expenses. But all in all, I\u2019d rather stay in my own apartment than at home or in a dorm. I will never want to live somewhere where all my roommates have to share one bedroom and one bathroom. Never again.",
