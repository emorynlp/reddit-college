  "text": "So I recently Graduated in May (go me), but I am having the hardest time looking for a career path. I had a meaningless summer job, so I didn't have to figure out my life plans right away. The moment I start looking for jobs, I start to feel incredibly defeated and unqualified. I get so upset because I don't even know where to start looking to find jobs I'm interested in. Ive had about 100 interviews, making it to the 2nd and 3rd round, but never getting the offer because there's someone just a little bit more qualified than me. Tbh right now i have no desire to work. I dont want to do it. It doesn't sound appealing at all and I dont know if its because I'm absolutely clueless about the career path I want to pursue. I graduated with a degree in Political Science, but I truly don't have an interest in it anymore. I am so burnt out from studying Politics for the last 5 years. I am feeling so lost right now trying to find myself again, finding passions because I really feel like I have no interest in anything anymore. I miss the aspect of being in college surrounded by my closest friends. I miss having a community. I wish someone had told me how lonely I was going to feel after college. Does anyone have any advice on 1.) how to find a job that will make me feel fulfilled and 2.) how to rediscover my passions? Will it get better? because right now it doesnt feel like it will. Any advice really, I'm feeling so defeated. thanks in advance",

      "text": "Hi friend, I just want you to know that it\u2019s normal to feel mixed up and unsure after graduation. Here\u2019s a bit of advice that got me out of my rut, but your experience may be different. \n\nJust do something. When I graduated (spring 2020 lol) I hit a pretty rough patch of depression. I wasn\u2019t motivated to do anything or interested in anything. So I got a job at Kroger. Recent college grad, B.S. in chemistry, honors scholar and I sliced deli meat for a few months. That job gave me something to do so I was at least out of the house and earning a little bit of money. \n\nThat job also gave me the motivation to find literally any other job. The people I worked with were nice but I did not enjoy the work. I was lucky enough to find a job in my field. Is it my dream job? Do I feel passionate about it? Will this be life? - No, but it\u2019s a stable job, it\u2019s a steady income, it\u2019s not too difficult or overwhelming and I\u2019m still learning new things. \n\nLife is so much more than a job. So just find a job doing something and if it takes over your life and makes you miserable, you can always find a new job eventually. And in the meantime you can find other things outside of work to do. Projects, hobbies, seeing friends, learning a new skill. \n\nGood luck friend, you\u2019re asking good questions but unfortunately there is hardly a one size fits all answer. I hope it works out for you!",

      "text": "As a non-college graduate (I know, why am I even here!) just pick something you are interested in.  I mean a degree in poli sci, what were you going for?\n\nIf the answer is\u2026 a degree, you\u2019ve done it!  Congratulate yourself and take all that you have learned and put it in the \u201cknow\u201d column.\n\nNow look at the \u201cwant to know/be better/aspire\u201d column.\n\nI didn\u2019t graduate college and I started at the bottom.  As a receptionist.  I can still, to this day, be a receptionist if I wanted to.  I have the skills.\n\nI\u2019m not.  I\u2019m a business intelligence analyst.  Because I followed my curiosity.  But I have seventeen job titles under my belt I can rock with no problem.  I choose my challenges (ie: when I choose to move up).  \n\nThe key is to find something that will lead you into something else, challenge you to the next level, when you are ready.  It is how you avoid work place stress from not being good enough, and workplace boredom of \u2018I can do this with my arms tied and blindfolded\u2019.\n\nIf you can, don\u2019t worry about the money.  Don\u2019t worry about the title, or the prestige.  Just start somewhere and know you can do better in x amount of time.",
