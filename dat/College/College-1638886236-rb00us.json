      "text": "I know joining a club can be a good thing, as you get to meet new people and can spend some time to yourself. As for making a club, it would depend on what type of club you would start. If you wanted to start something like a community service organization or an academic related club, (I assume you will be placed in the president position for the organization if it is created) then you can use that on your resume/curriculum vitae and can possibly gain an edge over other potential employees as it can show leadership roles and possibly time management. Now if you're starting something like a social club (think the stereotypical fraternity/sorority with all the drinks and nonsense) that is a bit different for the resume/CV, and I'd likely not include that.\n\n\nHowever, you can make friends and take a break from all the stress from classes doing something you enjoy. I joined my university's horsemanship team and that's one of the most fun things I have done in college. I just go to the farm for a couple hours and ride horses and don't even think about my homework. \n\n\nIn short, there are multiple benefits to starting an organization at your school. I'd see if you could get some more information on what you would need to do if the club is formed and consider the benefits and the drawbacks.",
