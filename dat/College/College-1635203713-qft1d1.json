  "text": "So I'm a sophomore in college who commuted last year and is now dorming. The first week I had the first mental breakdown of my life so I have proceeded to go home a few times a week since then and the balance has allowed me to focus better on my schoolwork and be more present in social activities.\n\nHowever, I'm starting to feel lost again. After people tell you your whole life that college will be this amazing time, hating it makes you feel like there is something wrong with you. I can't get motivated to go to club meetings and all I do is watch youtube and do schoolwork until I get to go home again. I would commute but my drive is one hour. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Like they don't enjoy campus life as much as they thought they would?",
