      "text": "It is an array of coordinated special events to entice alumni to return to the institution to participate in traditions and maybe make a donation while they are there.  \n\nYou will probably experience a major sporting event, like a Football game.  \nThere may be a formal or semi-formal dance/party.  \nThere might be the exhibitions of institutional traditions such as a concert, or student-led field games or similar activities.  \n\n\nThe university is trying to expose you to traditions that you can share with your classmates and feel connected to the people & the institution about.  \n\nThey will leverage those traditions later when they ask you for money.  \n\nIf you ignore the traditions it will end up being a long weekend of activities better-organized and better-attended than usual.",
