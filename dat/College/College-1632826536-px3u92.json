  "text": "Hi guys! So I got an invitation to phi theta kappa, but I dismissed it very easily. However one of my dream schools I want to transfer to has mentioned on their website that they are working with PTK on scholarships for transfer students, exactly what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m in my first year ( got invited based on my summer grades) and I know I won\u2019t be able to be very active this year due to covid and settling in. Should I join now, or wait until I can be an active part of the organisation? Anyone who joined and transferred, did it help with your transfer? Thank you",

I ended up getting an academic transfer scholarship because of it that covers half my tuition. So, it definitely worked for me. TBH, I wasn't even active with the club, I don't think most people are.",
