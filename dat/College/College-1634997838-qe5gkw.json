  "text": "I have some articles open on the topic my essay is on. They have all paraphrased from an original book that says dates (1965) or (1974) for example. Can I paraphrase what im reading from the article or do I need to find the book and read what they paraphrased originally and do the same? I am in 1st year so this isn't like im doing a serious research I don't want to get done for plagiarism. It would be a lot easier to paraphrase the article than trying to hunt down original book and find the pages.",

For example, with APA your citation would be something like -original author- as cited in -article i am reading-. Just check with the style guide you\u2019re using!",
