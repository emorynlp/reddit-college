  "text": "Title says it all. I had a mix of both during my stint at college.\n\nAt the time, I liked the nice professors better. However, now, as a graduate I honestly think I would\u2019ve been a better student if I had more \u201cstrict to the syllabus\u201d professors that would\u2019ve put their feet down more, and forced me to get my bad sleep schedule and procrastination habits under control. \n\nWhich teaching style do you personally  prefer from college professors?",

      "text": "It's good to have a balance, IMO. Some of my best mentors are people who challenged me intellectually and pushed me to do my best work, but they've also been the folks I can come to when I'm struggling or when I need professional advice. A good prof can absolutely balance rigor with kindness.\n\n\nWhen it comes to grading, I've preferred the \"tough but fair\" profs. It can sometimes be frustrating not to get a great grade on something you work super hard on, but when someone takes time to read my work and give me critical feedback, I know they're trying to help me improve, instead of just letting me do mediocre work. Positive feedback is helpful too, so I'm not saying I want someone who's just like \"this is trash\" but I do appreciate when I'm told what to do better next time.",

          "text": "^^^ this 100%. \n\nAlso, to me, the strict \u201cstick to the syllabus during lectures, no late work tolerated\u201d professors are my favorites. I just took a Brit lit class and the instructor had daily participation points in the form of activities that require understanding of the readings, no makeup/ late work accepted (ofc there is exceptions) and it makes for an effective class where everyone participates. On the other hand I had the nice considerate prof in another class who accepts work no matter how late for full credit, doesn\u2019t make us discuss in class etc\u2026. Therefore the quality of the class goes down because everyone knows the standards are low. At some point I wish others would realize the easy A profs are not entirely beneficial to us beyond the grade looking nice on the transcript.",

I also think it depends how helpful the Professor is with assignments too. I\u2019ve had trouble with assignments before with a \u201cstrict to the syllabus, no lates\u201d type Professor and he was no help when I reached out to him for assistance on an assignment (despite consistently telling us to email him if we ever needed help) If they\u2019re gonna be strict and firm then they definitely should be more helpful.",

But I adore my English professor who is able to be a super nice, laid back and considerate guy while also somehow having total control over classroom management. I think it\u2019s seems like a mutual respect thing, I can tell he cares about his students. Every time he speaks every one in the class listens, so he\u2019s walking proof that you don\u2019t have to be a hard ass in order to teach effectively.",
