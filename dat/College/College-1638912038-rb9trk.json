  "text": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to post it but at this point I need a place to write my thoughts down.\n\nSo I\u2019ve just completed my first semester and so far it\u2019s been miserable. I have no idea how to make friends here. I\u2019ve tried to talk with people in my classes but that hasn\u2019t worked. I tried to join a discord for new students on campus but I\u2019ve drifted from that. What makes it even worse is I\u2019m dorming too. Needless to say my self esteem is in the toilet atm. So I need some advice. How do people make friends in college?",

      "text": "Hi, fellow third-year student here. It also took me months to find a solid group of friends and eventually my best friends. This is how I did it:\n\n**I joined clubs** related to my interests, hobbies, and/or cultural background. Never made a friend through class or walking in the halls. (Making friends in college has proven to be way different than high school.) \n\nI would suggest finding some clubs that sound interesting to you. You can usually find a list of all the student organizations on your university's Beinvolved or student affairs websites.  From there, try to **follow their Instagram or email lists** to find out what their next events are. Many clubs have mass group chats where it's easy to converse and find someone to hang out with! Attend events often, strike up conversations with people that seem nice, get their social media, and try to ask to hang out outside of club events. Some easy hang out ideas are studying together, grocery shop, and getting dinner. \n\nIt's never too late to join a club! Although the semester is wrapping up, your school may have an Involvement Fair in the beginning of the next semester. It's a great event where you can talk to student organization representatives. \n\nOverall, I hope you know that almost everyone in college struggles to make friends! It simply takes time *and* effort. If you ever need anyone to chat with, feel free to PM me anytime.",
