  "text": "I am considering transferring to a few schools all with a student population between 20,000 and 30,000. My major is mathematics and at all of the schools I am considering they give out less than 100 bachelors in math per year. So my question is if any of you went to a big university and got a degree not a lot of people got say less than 200 students got your degree at a school with more than 20,000 students. What was it like once you got done with your prerequisites and started doing the classes for your major? Were the classes small? Did you get a lot of one on one time with your professor? Did it feel like you were going to a massive school? We\u2019re classes hard to get/sign up for? Any insight would be very helpful.",
