  "text": "Ever since I started school this semester, i\u2019ve been coming home with extreme feelings of worthlessness and hatred of myself. I\u2019ve been depressed since middle school but I never tried to get help because well I just thought it was something that couldn\u2019t be fixed. This depression though feels more extreme. \n\nI\u2019m 20F and a junior in college yet I have not accomplished anything significant. I have transferred to 2 different schools because I kept switching majors and i\u2019m slightly behind in my intended major. I was an average student in high school and I remember regretting not being more involved and studying more. To this day I regret not living my life as a real teenager and instead being a shut in with depression. \nI thought college would be better but I feel worse. I\u2019ve joined many clubs and tried to befriend classmates to no avail. I feel like I don\u2019t belong and I don\u2019t look like majority of the people on campus. \n\nI feel extreme jealousy and yearning when I see friend groups and couples together on campus. I also get extremely jealous when I drive past greek row and see everyone partying and having fun. More than anything i\u2019ve wanted to be this person but I can\u2019t be it. I was just not meant to live this life. I know no ones life is perfect but they do seem like they\u2019re having fun. I can\u2019t believe i\u2019m going into debt just for me to come home and watch tv. I have a high GPA but it doesn\u2019t really matter since I don\u2019t qualify for any scholarships or internships. I\u2019m such a loser who has no friends and nothing to look forward to. \n\nI haven\u2019t had suicidal thoughts in many years but this semester has brought them back aggressively. I\u2019m burnt out and only care about due dates. I feel like a failure and i\u2019m too embarrassed to face my family because I know they\u2019re disappointed in me. My mom prayed that I would get some friends and confidence before I came here but it did not work. I have never felt so ugly and worthless than at my current university. I\u2019m so scared for the future and I looked into getting a psychiatrist but none of them take insurance so i\u2019m going to be like this forever. These are supposed to be the best years of my life and I once again have nothing to show for it. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "Take a leave of absence and go work for a ski resort. Vail resorts offers reduced cost employee housing for full time employees. It's not great pay but it's enough to pay bills and save a lil. It's an amazing community of people who like skiing snowboarding and nature. Just get a frame of reference for the world. I have to take leaves from academia to remember what humanity is like. The male to female ratio is usually super high in mountain resort towns, so you will get hit on and yeah a lot of chill people, a handful of crazies, depending on the state there might be a big drug scene, but that's avoidable. The employee housing sometimes feels like a dorm, just without that status-y judgy shit. Get through this semester then take a break fasho.",
