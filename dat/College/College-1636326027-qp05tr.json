  "text": "\n\nMy college\u2019s rugby team is struggling to pull in some new players, and I\u2019ve already asked pretty much everyone I know personally if they\u2019d like to play, with mixed results. Despite this, I still want to try even harder to get some guys to come out, so here\u2019s some further context along with an idea I had: I go to a small D3 college, and the football team here is pretty bad. Every year, there\u2019s a pretty sizable amount of kids who drop the football team, usually freshmen. I also know one current rugby player who said something to the effect of \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to put in D1 time commitments for a D3 sport\u201d. So, my current idea is to dig through the stats of some freshman players, and see which ones have gotten no/very little playing time over the course of this season. Once I find those guys, I\u2019ll shoot them an email letting them know that we\u2019ll be playing rugby sevens in the spring. Since football plays their last game in the fall, I\u2019ll ask if they want to become two-sport athletes, while also kinda secretly hoping they drop football completely in order to also play fully 15 on 15 rugby in the fall, since it\u2019s only a club sport at my school and would be less of a time commitment. I have some mixed feelings about the idea, but I\u2019m just trying to do everything I possibly can to ensure that this team is even around in a few years. Do you think this would pique anyone\u2019s interest, or would most people think of this as sort of a ridiculous request? I should also note that I\u2019m thinking about doing the same thing for the soccer, cross country, and swim teams, since they also finish up before our 7 on 7 season starts.",

      "text": "This should be more of an executive council decision than a Reddit question. Some of my college teams best players came from football and ROTC, but we didn\u2019t do too much active recruiting beyond just having the former football players and current rotc kids talk to the incoming freshman and have them try it out. \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with numbers there\u2019s no downside to recruiting from wherever you can get it.",
