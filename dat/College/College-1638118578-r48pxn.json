  "text": "I had to miss an exam but had an excuse so Ill be able to make it up just fine. What worries me though is that ill most likely take the exam in the professors office and this makes me really anxious. The idea of being 1on1 in a small room being watched while i take a hard test has me so scared. What if the fear makes me blank? Idk what to do about this but ill really nervous.",

Usually when exams are being made up you\u2019re in a small group with other students who are also making up exams or at least that\u2019s how it was at my college. The few times it was just me and the prof 1 on 1, they spent the entire time on their laptops/working on other stuff and only paid attention to me when I had a question. Good luck!",
