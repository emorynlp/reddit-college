  "text": "Ok so I'm attending college full time (12 hours) I qualified for the $5,945 (or whatever it is) and accepted maximum student loans. When I checked my pay out today, it said my Pell only paid $812. I'm so confused? I was counting on this refund. I'm about to go speak with financial aid but has this happened to anyone else? I also am taking A term and B term classes.",

      "text": "Usually, grants, scholarships, and loans are applied to tuition balance first, and if you have any extra from any of those sources, you get that as a disbursement. So you wouldn't be getting the whole amount of the Pell Grant, just what's left after the college is paid. I hope this makes sense.",
