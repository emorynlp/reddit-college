  "text": "It feels absurd that they can do things like switch class online on a whim just because they feel like it. I have a class once a week and this tenured asshole has had about half of the classes online with no jurisdiction or oversight, just because. It\u2019s not even hybrid, it\u2019s supposed to be in-person. Why the fuck is this allowed?",

              "text": "The asynchronous format works well for some people but not for others, which is why there are usually different kinds of sections offered for higher enrollment courses. Teaching online isn\u2019t easier in the grand scheme of things, and there may be a reason the professor is doing it this way (ie, high risk), but if the course is supposed to be face to face, that should be the way it is delivered. Have you reached out to the department chair to obtain clarification on how the course is required to be taught?",

I fucking hate how I have a class which has a \u201cyou can\u2019t pass if you don\u2019t show up\u201d and they literally make the class zoom like an hour before because they don\u2019t feel like coming in. Mind you this is a 100% project-based class so the lecture is a literal waste of time, and watching them hold my grade above my head while they do whatever tf they want really grinds my gears",
