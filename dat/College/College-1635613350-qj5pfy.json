  "title:": "Can I get a D in a major course?",
  "text": "I\u2019m supposed to be graduating in December. On that note, one of my classes are rough. I\u2019m looking at scoring around a C in that class but am trying to figure out what the results are should I get a D in the course. The only requirement I could find for my school is a cumulative 2.0 and major 2.0. That said, I know at one point one of my classes required a B to continue on the degree path. They since got rid of that class requirement but it makes me nervous about the class I\u2019m in now. It\u2019s a 400 level course and not a prerequisite to anything. My advisor is terrible and it\u2019s impossible to get ahold of her. I emailed her once 9/25 and again 10/2. Nothing. Given that I\u2019m supposed to graduate in less than a month and a half this is really important information\u2026\n\nAny guidance is appreciated!",

Is there another Professor in the program who advises students? They might know the answer. Do you have a graduation expert? \n\nFor my program, you needed C\u2019s in all major classes to graduate. If your school just says 2.0 overall than you might be fine. But you should do your best to get that info in writing to be sure.",

      "text": "It depends on the class, school, and major/program. Some programs require a C or better in all classes for the degree. Others will let you get away with a D in electives even if said electives are required for the major (for example, a psychology major might be required to take any six upper level electives for psychology and might get away with a D in one). You need a C for any pre req in the major. \n\nCheck your degree requirements. If it's true you only need a 2.0 major gpa then it might be fine if it's not a pre req. That's what my advisor said for my degree but it may or may not be the case for you depending on college and major.",

I only see requirements stating remedial courses don\u2019t count towards our required hours, needing an additional 30 credit hours if working on a second bachelors, and needing 48 hours at the 300+ level. I do see grade requirements for other programs though so I believe I should be okay. It definitely varies greatly by program. Thanks!",
