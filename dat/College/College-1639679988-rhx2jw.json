  "text": " I'm an incoming freshman who has just finished his first semester. I was dumb and didn't do an entire section of a course which resulted in me getting an F, while in my other classes I got an A, A, and B. My major is biology and I planned to go to med school, what are my options now. Is there any way to make the F not count on my GPA or show up in my transcript? Should I just change majors? I just need some advice.",

My university doesn't do that - here, you could retake the course as many times as you want, but *all grades* remain on your transcript and are factored into your GPA.
