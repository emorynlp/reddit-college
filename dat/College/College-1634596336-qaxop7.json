  "text": "I didn\u2019t go to college right after high school, and decided to work and save up money instead. Now I\u2019m older, and I\u2019m thinking about going to college. The thing is, I\u2019m getting kind of old and I\u2019m interested in going to a party school. I feel like it would be extremely weird to start school at my age. I probably shouldn\u2019t expect the full college experience right? I\u2019m probably going to be around a bunch of 18 year olds and things might be awkward.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m actually 23 right now, and I turn 24 at the end of March of next year. By the time I transfer from a community college, I\u2019ll be 25 or so.",

      "text": "Ah! I can answer this!\n\nSo I did undergrad right after HS and, at 24, decided that I wanted to get an additional bach degree since my job gave annual education stipends. I ended up back in undergrad at 25 and nobody thought that I stuck out or didn't fit in but let me tell you....\n\nThese were children.\n\nWe may have looked very similar, but I actually dropped out before the semester was over because it was quite frankly uncomfortable. NO judgment, it was just 18 year olds being 18 year olds, but these are teenagers that have never voted, are living away from their parents for the first time (not even all of them), have never paid taxes, etc.\n\nWhen you watch college movies, remember that those are 30+ year old actors pretending to be 18 year olds. While you will visibly fit in and probably even be pretty cool, consider that the difference between a senior prom and a college party is \\*months\\* . Most college students can't legally drink and a half the freshman class are virgins. It's a MASSIVE 7 year difference.\n\nThe likelihood of you \"meeting people\" that you want to hang out with and develop a long term friendship with will be pretty slim. These aren't peers, generally.",

At a party school, nonetheless. \n\nYes, there is most definitely a maturity gap, nobody is going to deny that. However, college isn't meant as a form of socialization. You aren't there to make friends, meet a significant other, etc. Are they perks on the side? Absolutely, for most people. They might not be for you, and that's ok. You're there to learn and to progress your future.\n\nEven then, you'll still meet people you enjoy talking to/occasionally grabbing a beer with. One of my closest college friends is 35 years old and returned to get another degree himself. I have other close college friends that'll check in on my cats when I'm out of town or on vacation. \n\nUltimately, this is something only you can decide on.",

      "text": "Might get downvoted for going against the grain here but 25 really isn\u2019t that old, especially among transfers. I transferred from CC when I was 20 and I was literally the baby of the group. Most of my friends were 22 to 26 at the time. We still partied and had a great time. Went to a few off campus things and no one really cared how old you were. Granted, I didn\u2019t go to a huge party school but I did go to a school in the UC system. I wanted that \u201ccollege\u201d experience and I feel that I got it (even if COVID and the strikes at my college affected the majority of my time there). I went to parties, bars in town, threw my own parties, did dumb \u201ccollege kid\u201d stuff, joined a frat, etc. \n\nCollege is just what you make of it. If you\u2019re worried about people thinking that you\u2019re too \u201cold\u201d then it\u2019s highly likely they are frosh and not worth hanging around. Yes, you\u2019re right that transferring isn\u2019t the true \u201ccollege\u201d experience we all see on tv, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t have a good time. It\u2019s all about mindset and the people you surround yourself with. If anything, just being a transfer will allow you to connect with other people who are just like you and you won\u2019t have to deal with petty shit that should\u2019ve stayed in high school.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about meeting others who are closer in age to you see if the colleges you\u2019re interested in offers transfer student housing. My UC pretty much dedicated an entire dorm building at each college to transfer students so I def got the dorm experience lol.",

I think some people on this post are making it seem like I only want to do school to party and that\u2019s simply not true. Of course I\u2019m in school, so I can get my degree and earn more. This doesn\u2019t mean I want to end my fun days or life at 25. When I\u2019m 30, I don\u2019t want to have any regrets. Like oh I wish I would have \u201cgone out more or done this\u201d etc.. Life is too short for that. \n\nI probably won\u2019t end up at a party school. It was kind of a theoretical thing. I just want to transfer somewhere decent and affordable.",

              "text": "Exactly! You can totally have a social life and still have decent grades in school. I recently graduated with a 3.9 GPA, worked, and had a social work so it\u2019s definitely possible (even if it wasn\u2019t easy). \n\nI saw from another reply that you\u2019re also in the Bay Area so I would totally take advantage of the TAG program for UCs and whatever direct entry CSUs your CC has an agreement with if you\u2019re interested in any of them. Takes off a lot of stress when acceptances come out. I tagged into Santa Cruz and went there. They were a great school for transfers since it offered tons of resources that were specific to transfer students (even offered 23 and up apartments for housing on campus), but if you\u2019re not getting financial aid or on a scholarship, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it since it\u2019s INSANELY expensive to live there. Beautiful campus, though. Finding parties takes a little more effort since greek life isn\u2019t huge on campus due to some policies the school has but they do occur off campus or deep in the forest. Tons of kickbacks if that\u2019s more your speed, as well.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the age gap (if you could even call it that) too much. My partner\u2019s housemates are all in their late 20s and we\u2019re all still good friends. If anything, most people will probably just think you\u2019re the same age as them and have your shit together. And, yes, I agree that life is too short to have regrets :)",

Objectively there isn't a huge age gap for you but qualitatively you may find that your perspective diverges because either you have spent more time outside of the normal 4 yr scenario supporting yourself or just because there are tiny differences between you and the slightly younger cohort. I'd say just go with an open mind that your enjoyment will vary and ultimately remember you're going to earn a degree to pave the way for your future.",

From 18 to 20, I was partying all over the country too, and it still got boring. \n\nIf you are 25 years old, and you are going to put yourself in debt to party, you probably aren't making power moves. My advice: get into the best school you can afford, make some friends who share both academic and personal interests, work hard and get good grades, and learn and grow. If there are good parties to attend, hit em up! But don't choose a school based on the party atmosphere, and don't let it get in the way of why you are there. You don't need to spend tens of thousands to go to a good party unless you're dumb as cork.\n\nAlso, if it's any consolation, I'm 25 and just started my undergrad anew. I had a whole career before, and have decided to make a change. So don't feel bad about starting late. Its probably better that you took some time until you knew you were ready. Many kids go to school right after HS and waste money by taking something they hate by accident or not focusing on their GPA and opportunities. Use your maturity to your advantage.",

      "text": "Ummm, I don\u2019t completely know. It\u2019s all about how you present yourself. You could present yourself as an old person that it\u2019s only different from the rest because of the age gap, or you could present yourself as an experienced person that knows the ins and outs of things, a person that happens to be older because of how much experience they\u2019ve got. Or perhaps you present yourself as something else. I\u2019m not trying to say that you must create a persona for college, no. I\u2019m saying, the way you perceive yourself affects how others perceive you. It really all comes down to your personality, your hobbies and your passions. Also how smart, aware, and how experienced you are in social settings/events. Sure, I can bet that some people might think you are weird because of your age straight out of the gate. Also the topics of conversation might lack. But maybe that changes when they get to know you, if they are open to get to know you of courses. If you don\u2019t have any ill, deceiving, manipulative, or evil motives when it comes  to socialize with people, I think you will be mostly fine. You won\u2019t have the same college experience as a 18-year-old, but that does not mean you can\u2019t have a good college experience. Your experience might be different from the rest, but still be good. You must know what you like and what you don\u2019t like. If you are in college, doing the things you like, you are most likely to socialize and bond with people that do the same things as you. The interaction would be based on the activity, not the age, the age would not be crucial. Example: let\u2019s say  there is a lake near the school, let\u2019s say you like fishing and swimming and all lake-related activities, you are likely to bond with people that also like lake-related activities. Age wouldn\u2019t be the catalyst for the interaction with someone else, the lake would. So, do what you truly like, be confortable, don\u2019t have ill motives, and be honest and kind.",

              "text": "Depends on the party culture and what your degree is in. Some fraternities and sororities will not allow graduate students to join, and thus they may not be a place where you can hang out or party with any grad students period. And that trend is pretty standard. It would also surprise me if a university *allowed* a grad student to join a sorority or fraternity, considering some do not allow their grad students to even have an extraneous job beyond their duties in their grad school and whatever TA-ship they may have. Especially considering that some studies indicate that cheating is more prevalent in fraternities (Bonjean & McGee, 1965; Goldsen et al., 1960; Harp & Taietz, 1966; Stannard & Bowers, 1970), and being directly associated with someone who may be a TA (for research/grad funding) and would have answers to tests or other work, or be responsible for grading other members work, could be a direct conflict of interest. I also never joined a sorority in college, and don\u2019t plan on it. It costs a pretty penny (think about a couple hundred to a grand or more). And after overhearing my dorm-neighbors talk shit about other girls rushing their sororities my freshman year, I decided I just didn\u2019t want to be friends with those girls, I didn\u2019t want to be around them *at all*. Why would I pay so much to be surrounded by bitches that would force a drunken smile to my face but tear me down to other members behind my back? I\u2019ve paid far less for people like that in my life and I\u2019m not looking to go out of my way to meet any more. I\u2019m also not at school to party. I\u2019m here to get my degree and that\u2019s my main focus. If the fact that a school is a party school is the main reason it speaks to you, or even is the top contender for why you pick one school over another, then you need to reevaluate your intentions with school. Setting yourself up for success means understanding that academics and academic resources for your particular degree are far more important than if there\u2019s a Greek life that speaks to you. That\u2019s how you set yourself up for success. Your social life is important but will happen regardless. But I\u2019ve always found that friends made sober are far better than those that drink to go lie to my face.",

They\u2019re more focused on finishing their degrees and starting a good career. And I finally get that at this age. But what I am saying is it\u2019s okay to go to parties, just be mindful of what type of parties you go to. From my experience there are event parties(Birthdays, Holidays, etc.)/rangers, and regular weekend parties or kickbacks these are the parties you want to go to if you want to socialize. If you really want to make a connection, meeting people from class, school events, clubs and activities are your best shot. Most of the friends I made are with the people I see and struggle with everyday. People you meet at the party are usually those you have one class with then say \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you around\u201d",

We had a guy last year pledged my fraternity who was 22 and a freshman he fits in just fine... In general if you are going to be like in the 25 year old category but transferring in you would be technically classified I think as a junior which isn't too unusual you may make some more friends with lspend with like the juniors and seniors at the University which every year people make new friends shouldn't be a problem or maybe you would maybe fit in a bit more with the grad students which you can interact with students without a problem both graduate and undergraduate. Some universities mix graduate students with undergraduate students for 405 100 level courses upper level classes so you should be able to meet some grad students or juniors and seniors without a problem.\n\nYou will have some more life experience but you won't be that much more experienced than people that have a few years of college under their belt it's not too unusual for people to be working part or full time in going to school these days.\n\nThe freshman may feel like a little younger than you expect just because yeah they did just graduate high school but they tend to lose the high school annoying annoying factor around the end of their 1st semester or quarter whatever once they get into the swing of things with college.\n\nBut if you were translating if you were transferring from a community college with 2 years under your belt you would technically be walking in to college as a junior not a freshman so you would be in classes with people closer to your own age... Oh there's a guy in my fluids class That is 35 getting his undergrad hes a cool dude we hang out sometimes... A 25 year old at a college party isn't really an issue in any case.. His grad students come to frat parties just as much as undergraduates... So people are just looking to have fun just don't judge other people and you should be good.... Everyone is in college for their own thing so just most people don't really care how old you are so long as you're chill and you're just there to study like everyone else lol\n\nKeep in mind most people on a college campus are between the ages of like 17 and 35 Alice students at at least for students so you should be fine fine",

Or perhaps choosing something you truly want to study, so even if the party aspect doesn't happen, you still grow and learn a lot.

You work harder because you\u2019re less distracted by the social stuff. \n3. I still made friends.

I only went to college for the first time after getting out of prison in the 80s when I was 25. You can bet your ass i went to frat parties, even back then there were plenty of people in thier 20s in college who still partied.\" \n\nI agree, I think young people take life too seriously these days and eventually trap themselves by focusing too much on careers. You 20s are time to explore, experience, make mistakes, learn and have fun. You have your whole life to work, don't rush into a career, even if it's one you know you'll love.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to work full time and do school full time. I would never graduate doing that so...I\u2019m trying to speed up this process so I graduate from cc at 25 instead of 26. Next semester I\u2019ll probably end up having to take 18 credits. Wish me luck, this shit\u2019s going to be hard. I\u2019m probably going to have to pull a bunch of all nighters to make this happen. \n\nI\u2019ll probably end up at a regular school once I transfer. Maybe I don\u2019t need to go to a rowdy school to still have fun. My education is the most important thing, but I at least want to spend the other 10% of the time doing lit shit.",

It can get out of control & unless you know how to handle yourself at one it can get \ud83d\ude2c intense. I'm pretty sure there are more clubs in your area that are not filled with college students drinking away their midterm papers & homework due at 11:59. Plus local clubs are more monitored. College parties equal underage drinking & drugs & no knowing who is putting what into what. Cops show up all yall gettin arrested. Use your college time to get your education.

      "text": "For sure go. \n\nI\u2019ll be real, it probably will be weird if you\u2019re hanging out with fresher type people out of high school partying. \n\nBut...there\u2019s more people than that a university. I got like 5 years on you and I\u2019m in school, and I\u2019ve found other 25-30 year olds in undergrad and in graduate school that I\u2019ve been able to hangout with. You\u2019re not alone out there. There\u2019s plenty of non traditional people as well.\n\nThat said, don\u2019t be a dick to the younger people either. Let them be. I haven\u2019t had any problems really with them they\u2019re just in a different chapter of their lives. It\u2019s actually funny some times, because inevitably you\u2019ll have to work with some of them through school. But yeah, just chill & be who you are. \n\nI say party school because any school will give you academics. Any school will have some other people there as well. But not every school is a party school or has the social infrastructure and planning history behind it, in that regard, to be a party school. And if your prospective institution is also a sports school, then stack on that not every school has invested so much into building that brand to have had attracted enough attention on a national level to support a decent sports program. That stuff takes years and years to do and a lot of money. The benefits of these types of schools is that they provide more options for the students to have a social life and they directly stimulate that aspect of school, to where it isn\u2019t just doing assignments & getting grades. There is something to look forward to outside of class! Or there is at least an option of something to do on a Friday night! That\u2019s pretty nice & convenient honestly.\n\nMy school doesn\u2019t have the above stated environment. Instead it completely lacks any student life. The institution had decided research & marketing to international students was the way to grow and their probably not wrong, but that means in the meantime until it gets large enough (fairly newer institution) it will have a social drought and be only that. Lots of academic type folks. Lots of talk of research & job skills, seminars all that, etc. these are the \u201cthings to do\u201d here. Aka more work haha. Avoid these types of schools if you can. Best way to do so is do your research!!! Really, ask people that go to those schools about their student life and visit the schools. Really dig in. Because every school\u2019s marketing team will say the same thing, \u201cthis school is the best\u201d lol of course it is! That\u2019s the 1000th school I\u2019ve come across that\u2019s apparently the \u201cbest\u201d, wow tough decision lol. They\u2019re all the best, guess it doesn\u2019t matter right? Wrong. It does. Choose wisely lol",

I\u2019m currently doing online school because I live in the Bay Area and people are terrified to return to campus (mostly professors) It\u2019s crazy because we have the vaccine now yet professors are afraid to come back. People can\u2019t be afraid of COVID forever. Things need to go back to normal. \n\nIf you feel like you would do well with online school then do that. With online school though, you won\u2019t meet anyone and you probably won\u2019t learn that much. Also think about whether or not you would enjoy sitting on the computer for hours on end lol. \n\nWould you be able to afford rent while going to a big uni and working part time? \n\nIn person is way better than online school.
