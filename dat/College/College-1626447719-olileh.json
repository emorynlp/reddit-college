  "text": "Younger Zoomers might not catch my drift here but damn I remember when easybib was a accessible website with literally two buttons \u201ccite\u201d and \u201csearch\u201d Now it\u2019s the digital equivalent of a magazine tabloid. There\u2019s a ton of ads everywhere, a bunch of annoying pop ups, a lot of text all around the site that blocks and obstructs everything. I also now have to watch a 30 second ad JUST TO CITE A SOURCE. I\u2019m just saddened to see what was a simple and helpful service now become a monstrosity of web design.",

The Mendeley word plug-in was great. It looks like Zoterro works better with websites, but  Mendeley worked great for me with web citations. \n\nI see people suggesting Latex/Bibtex, but unless you're in academia or some field where you'll be publishing a lot of papers (like medical or government research), I wouldn't bother. These tools allow you to do amazing work but aren't as common as Word. Learning to use Word better with a citation manager will be way less work and allow you to collaborate better with more people. Also, if you do switch to Latex, both Zoterro and Mendeley will generate bibtex files, so you don't lose much.",

There was no other site like it, and the few sites I saw were not good. It took YEARS before I found a decent alternative, and they\u2019re never as simple as the original online tool that I used. Most of them were monetized, showed tons of ads, and required downloads or accounts to use.\n\nIt sounds like Chegg is doing a similar thing here.",

My favorite is automatically detecting my universities proxy and applying it to the sites i want it to so every time I enter some journal article I saw on Reddit, it automatically sets the proxy and i get full access. Otherwise it's a pretty cumbersome process sometimes",

There\u2019s tons of kids in my last Calc class that only passed thanks to chegg, and I imagine it might be the same with more upper level courses",
