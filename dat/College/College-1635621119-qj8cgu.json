  "title:": "Behind on some homework",
  "text": "Im behind on 2 hws for one of my classes (one is about 2 weeks late and the other is like 6 days late) and I dont know if I should try to finish them (and get very minimal points) or just move on and use that time study the material to really understand it and get an early start on future homework. There are around 6-8hws in total for this semester which in total is 20% of my grade. At this point i think getting the material is more important but idk, how would you guys handle it?",

      "text": "Well first, read your professors syllabus and see how late she can accept work. Keep in mind, a grade is always better than a 0. If she doesn\u2019t accept late work, just study the material. If she does accept late work, email her the reason why it was late and turn it in. Then after finishing work, study the material.",
