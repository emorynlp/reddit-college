  "title:": "Worried about dropping a class. Should I?",
  "text": "I\u2019m taking 4 classes this semester. Pre Calc, English, Microeconomics and Chem 121. We are already halfway through the year, and my grades are terrible besides economics. I am a hard worker in my classes, but ever since college started I have been extremely lazy and unmotivated because I do not feel like teaching myself online. I need Chem 122 next semester, and I know for a fact that it\u2019s going to be even worse. However, I do want to retake this course again next semester because I need it for Engineering. I can easily bring my grades up by only having to worry about three classes. I already sent an email to my advisor, but I want to know if anyone else had a similar situation as me or if anyone has some advice. Thanks.",

      "text": "You should ultimately do what you will feel is best for your academics. \n\nBut before you decide to drop your chemistry class, make sure it is before the withdraw deadline so you only receive a \u201cW\u201d on your transcript and not get marked for incomplete. Also, make sure it doesn\u2019t mess with any financial aid you may have received. If dropping that class put you as a part time student you could end up being ineligible for the scholarships and have to pay the amount covered by them.",

          "text": "I contacted my financial aid about that just now. Would you say it costs a lot if I have to pay back? I\u2019m willing to pay, not that much, if that meant I can worry less about a class. I never wanted to be a part time student, but I guess I may have to be one for two months. I guess I\u2019m more concerned whether or not I can still transfer after two years with a withdrawal.",

              "text": "The \u201cW\u201d on your transcript wouldn\u2019t be the issue. If you withdrew from the class after the withdraw deadline, then that would be an issue as the class would  still affect your GPA or transcript some way depending on your school\u2019s policy. A \u201cW\u201d itself is harmless and you will still be able to transfer. You just don\u2019t want to make a pattern of \u201cW\u201d marks. \n\nAlso, depending on the credits/hours of your classes and minimum required to be considered full-time, you may still be full-time depending on your circumstances. I\u2019m also not able to give you an estimate of how much it may cost. I personally withdrew from a World Religion class and transferred to a Spanish class for the quick-term. However, I still had to pay $400 to compensate for that short period I was considered a part-time until the quick-term semester actually started.",

                  "text": "Interesting. Like I said, I\u2019m most concerned about my credit hours because I want to leave after my second year to a regular college. I don\u2019t really want to switch classes because I still need to catch up on a ton of missing assignments for my other two classes. I guess I\u2019ll wait and see for the financial aid and my advisor to reply back. \n\nSide question, how do I bring this up to my mom? I have pretty strict parents and I\u2019m scared dropping a class would look really bad and they won\u2019t like it. Now that there\u2019s isn\u2019t a specific place to find grades at my community college, she doesn\u2019t even know that I\u2019m borderline failing.",
