      "text": "Don\u2019t go into debt over your undergraduate degree. I would say that if you work better in an in-person environment, see if you can go to a community college that\u2019s closer to home so that if you want to commute, you can. If you work well with the online format and financially it\u2019s better for you to go through a top university, then I would do that instead. Either way, don\u2019t go into debt for your undergrad. As long as you get your diploma at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t really matter where you attend.",
