  "text": "So I\u2019m currently in an upper level history course with a professor that responds to any and all questions with \u201ctry googling it\u201d or \u201cre-read the syllabus carefully\u201d. His syllabus offers no insight into what the class has questions over, and while google is a great source, there are multiple answers for different questions and none of us know which is the answer he\u2019s wanting. \n\nFor example, we have to write a 15 page paper over some small conflict that happened in Europe in the 20th century, and he says we have to use primary sources and cite them correctly or else it\u2019ll result in an F in the course (so not just an F on the paper, but you\u2019ll literally fail the course). Many students have asked questions about what qualifies as a primary source to him since google gives conflicting results, and he continues to emphasize that we just need to google it and figure it out. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue but the fact that he says if we don\u2019t use the correct primary sources it will result in an F in the course, I\u2019m not sure what to do. \n\nAlong with this, whenever I try to ask him questions, his responses are often weirdly rude or a little condescending. I asked him about certain sources I found, and he said again \u201ctry googling it\u201d and finished it with \u201cYou do know you\u2019re in an upper level course right (literally just a 300 level course)? There are much higher expectations here and you can\u2019t just expect answers to be easily handed out. I shouldn\u2019t have to teach basic concepts you should already know\u201d. How do I go about confronting a professor like this when he refuses to give out answers to anything no matter how simple the question? Also if anyone has any insight on what counts and doesn\u2019t count as a primary source that would be great as well.",
