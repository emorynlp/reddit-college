  "text": "I've been out of school for 5 years now. Been working here and there to help out my parents. Finally I'm at a job where pay is good and slow in business. I've thought about going to college but honestly I've forgotten mostly everything. How can I refresh on topics? Any books I could buy or classes that cover through basics? I'm not sure where to start.",

      "text": "I am going to use my story as an example of how it worked for me...\n\nI am 31 years old - I started college for the first time last year. Which means for me, it has been 12 years since I went to school last. I am not going to lie - it was rough at first. Getting back into study habits, finding my groove, and relearning skills that I have not used since highschool (I graduated in 2008).\n\nSo - I started with three classes total. Granted, I was working full time, but did not want to overload myself for my first semester back after so many years of being out. It really helped me be able to dip my toes in the water before diving in completely. I am now taking 5 classes this semester (dropped down to part time work). Five classes is hard, but I am somehow still managing a 3.8 GPA. I say start slow, at least for the first semester - and if you want to take more classes in your next semester - go for it. You'll be fine as long as you fully commit yourself.",

I'm actually looking for something to refresh my math as I'll soon be taking a math class for the first time in 28 years, they've completely changed how math is taught since I last did it. Hopefully someone else will come along with some decent advice.",

I'm horrible at writing but really good at reading and was approved for honors English. \ud83d\ude06 I also managed to place for the required math class for 90% of the degrees at my school when I took the test several years ago which surprised me due to the amount of time since I last took math and that I have dyscalculia.  The developmental courses are certainly expensive (at my school they're all 4 credits instead of the typical 3 that regular courses are) but I'm sure they're worth it in the long run if someone really needs it.",

      "text": "I'm 32 and came back to finish my Mechanical Engineering degree. \n\nI started during a summer semester taking an anthropology gen-ed and a Statistics 381 course. I was surprised how fast things came back. I got a 4.0 that semester. \n\nNow I'm taking 12 credit hours and commute 45 minutes one way to school 3 times a week. It's still easier than I anticipated. Even classes that are difficult are still very achievable for me. At this point, I've got 4 As and 1 B. I couldn't be more happy to be honest. \n\nI think it's understated how important the discipline you learn from working is. I've never missed an assignment and never turned one in late. I usually stay ahead on my assignments, which overall reduces any stress. \n\nIf you stick around here, you'll see what our younger peers struggle with. It's mostly procrastination and the worst ones aren't doing assignment or going to classes. If you do your assignments on time, go to all classes, and study more than just the day before the class, I think you'll be fine. \n\nThere are resources at college to get you back up to speed. There are usually tutors available for free and I imagine that they would be infinitely more useful than reading a book. Take the placement tests honestly, as they'll help put you where you need to be to reduce retakes and withdrawals. \n\nThe experience for me is so much different. I'm enjoying it more than I ever did before. I feel like this was the perfect time for me to go back to school. I would highly suggest going back. I'm an intelligent person and always did well in classes in high school. I didn't have discipline the first time at college and inevitably got to me. Now, I'm old and going to college is so much more rewarding and easy than the 10 hour shifts of woodworking I was pulling.",

      "text": "So I'm 22 been outta school since late middle school and working in my family business just went back to school for the first time in over 10 years. However I first went to community College for the first year and then transferred to my dream 4 year which is awesome. However it is a struggle since you have to relearn a lot that's why I took community college cause I did some basic math and science which I didn't get in high-school cause I didn't go.\n\nAlso because I am going in state my school has a roadmap for each degree with classes that they accept from the in state community College system. So i was able to knock out many basic intro to X classes along with a lot of math like precalc and Calc. This really helps save money plus get a taste of what college work is like. You don't need to pay 30k a year for calculus lol\n\nAlso what worked for me is only taking 12 credits a semester, I'm also working almost 40 hours a week rn with school so cannot do much more but even if I could you don't wanna overdo the classes and then almost flunk or actually flunk 1-2. I did that at CC I took 18 credits and failed 2 classes which I retook the following semester but only took 12 credits and got straight A's. My point is just understand yourself and how much you can take cause it's not only about doing as much as possible.  College is a really amazing experience but just remember not to burn yourself out cause that will cause real issues (mental, physical, emotional, etc.) trust me I know...\n\nFinally the whole attitude that I got was that everyone in college is looking to make new friends and plus nobody done crap for almost 2 years with Covid so you can just walk up to folks and they'll start hanging out with you. That is SO FAR from the truth. I'm at a big school here but people will stick to themselves or only game online and don't really want to do anything. You have to go outta your way to reach out to folks a cultivate a friend group. Whether that be joining clubs or talking with folks jn your classes just be aware that it's on you to find your niche, I didn't realize that coming into my 4 year university\n\nBest of luck I'm rooting for you it's not easy going back to school after several years but your definitely more mature than most especially the 18yo freshmans cause you have insight",
