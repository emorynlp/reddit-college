  "text": "I screwed up and didn't check the time for the final and missed it. I knew it was at 12pm, but we only had an hour to do it, but because I thought it was like last time that it was open until 11pm I missed it.\nI called my professor, and he was understandably angry. He said call again later tonight, it is now 5pm, and I am trying to call him but no answer. Shall I just drop it and not do the final?\nI know I only have myself so blame, and I should have done it at 12, but because I am tired idiot that did not happen.",
