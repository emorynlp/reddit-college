We never talked about it in class but it was listed in the course handbook that I, unfortunately, didn't pay attention to.\n\nI'm going to try to finish it today but what do I tell my professor?",

It's actually a breath of fresh air when a student is honest. Just ask for an extension and come up with a deadline for yourself. Just state that you need a couple of days to finish up and ask if that would be okay. Even if the professor will dock you a small amount for being late, it's better to have some points taken off a good grade, then to get a bad grade on a poorly written assignment. You just have to be ready to put in the work to get it done! - A college professor",

There\u2019s nothing more annoying than getting this email when it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t even read the last policy. If it\u2019s something small (like 10% for being late), don\u2019t ask for an exception\u2014that\u2019s a super reasonable policy. If there\u2019s no late policy listed, then I recommend the above. Basically, take your penalty or ask for a reduced penalty (not no penalty).",

That's on you at least you realized it before like Sunday or something. Professors sometimes don't mention assignments they expect people to be able to pay attention to the syllabus they give you with a breakdown of what's going on in what do you win at the start of the year. That's what college is academics mixed with adulthood it sucks because you have to force yourself to manage your own time and that can be a challenge.\n\nBut at least you got the realization before it's due so it's due so take a deep breath let yourself panic for about 5 seconds 5 seconds let that breath out take another deep breath and then get to work.\n\nLibrary. I don't know what the subject matter is or what your paper is on but that's your best bet to get you done start researching Finding sources brainstorm you know how to write a paper..\n\nYou have written of research paper before, In high school and probably called at this point. So figure out what you're looking at figure out how long it has to be B and just start writing.\n\nIt's going to suck it might take you a while but 2 days is enough time to throw together A decent paper that can get you a respectable grade but double grade but you have to manage your time . Which means prioritize Good luck but you've got time so take advantage of it . Write the paper you can write a decent research paper in 2 days. Thankfully with the Internet it's actually feasible The good luck.",

If they\u2019re not one of those rare \u201cyou must be responsible for everything no matter what\u201d mean professors, I would 100% be honest and ask in the email if there is anyway you can still get partial credit despite your mistake.
