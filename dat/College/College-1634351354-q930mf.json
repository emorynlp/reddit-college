      "text": "I'll give you my point of view from studying electrical engineering in Puerto Rico. \n\nIn the first year, you get a taste of what freedom is and, I guess you could say that's what TV depicts: having fun, hanging out, going to parties and meeting new people. \n\nHowever, with that comes the part that is never shown in TV: you have freedom to make choices but those choices carry consequences. Procrastinate or let your guard down and the F's will rain on you. Those F's then bring a strong sense of fear and panic with them as you scramble to fix your semester on which point you notice that you're behind on a lot of material and the stress just stacks up. At that point, you think you can count on your friends but they're either the same as you or, they were only looking to take advantage of you for some group project or assignment and so, they know nothing about the subject. \n\nOh and let's not forget that now you have the weekly allowance that's below minimal wage. You will NOT be eating at restaurants, going out to get coffee, or spend every day at the mall because you have to choose between that nice shirt or eating something other than Cheff Boyardee or Ramen Soup.\n\nThat's just the first year. The further you go in, the more you notice nobody cares about you, the professors start teaching less and demanding much more, only 1 or 2 friends is what truly matters, and that you REALLY shouldn't had left those assignments for the last moment because now you have 4 tests each comprising of 4 chapters out of which you didn't pay attention in class because yeah. Oh, and if you did, you don't care because at this point you've learned that the professors will take any chance they can to screw you over in a test.\n\nIt's all hard work. None of that luxurious fun life style you see on TV.",

It sounds cool at the moment because you want to fit in, but you could have went on in life without it.
