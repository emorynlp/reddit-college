  "title:": "Help: with APA in-text citation with same website, different data tables",
  "text": "I am using U.S. Census Bureau for some data collection.\n\nI am using several different tables and data from different subjects like: sex, age, race, occupation.  \n\n\nHowever, I don't know how to write the in-text citation for each of these as the data is different.  \n\n\n\"The male to female ratio to the total population is 1:0.8 in 2019 (source)\"  \n\"Males 18 and older are more prone to being in construction jobs by 18% in California compared to Males 18 and older in Arizona (source)\".  Same website used, just different tables. \n\nThese are just made up sentences.  \n\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "Owl Purdue has good resources for how to cite things in APA. [This link](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_electronic_sources.html) should give you what you\u2019d need, however, if the information is in different tables but on the same page, I -believe- you can get away with citing them as one source. Depends on how picky your professor wants to be about citations I guess. \n\nI\u2019d personally pick one, stick to it as you\u2019re writing, but double check with a professor or a writing tutor/center at your college!",
