The main thing that was kinda annoying was that I didn't know anyone after all the other freshman had spent a semester getting to know each other so it was hard to make friends at first. Also orientation wasn't required to settling into campus was sort of difficult because I wasn't familiar with it or the website, etc. Overall it was definitely the best choice for me, though.",
