  "text": "My roommate has had this bottle of vodka in our room for a while now and it\u2019s been empty for about a month and he hasn\u2019t thrown it out.  I left early for break and he had a mutual friend pick him up a few days later. He just got back today and sent me a picture of a note saying the RA searched our room and found the bottle. It was always under his desk so I wasn\u2019t worried because I had nothing to do with it. Now I just found out that they put the empty bottle on my desk before they left as some sort of joke I guess. Basically the bottle was found on my desk and I\u2019m wondering how I\u2019m supposed to get out of this one. I never even touched the bottle but the fact is that it was found on my side and I\u2019m not sure my friend will say it was his and that he put it there. I realize the first time is probably just a warning but I\u2019m still a little worried and really don\u2019t want to deal with this right now.",

          "text": "That is probably a good idea but talk to your roommate 1st before you do that and just have him say yeah he found it like in the street or something and he thought it was cool and could be used as like a decoration for their room if it was empty they can't prove he didn't just pick up a random glass bottle in the street. If you talked to your roommate he could say that he was planning on turning into some sort of art piece or something for the dorm , Like a decoration of some kind or that he was planning on trying to build a ship in a bottle or some shit. Or he just wanted something cool to keep pens in or like  Something artsy. That your roommate could say if he isn't an art major that he was considering exploring the medium as a potential minor or a second major and that he just had a creative idea when he saw the bottles so he picked it up and since it was empty he didn't think there was anything wrong with just having it in his room since it was just a glass bottle. After all if there was no alcohol in it you just have a glass bottle they didn't catch you with any contraband you they just caught you with a glass bottle that used to containContraband alcohol. So just say or have your roommate say he picked it up in the street after you say it's not mine and here I can call my roommate and have him explain the situation to you. Just make sure you talk to your roommate 1st and you have the story straight so it so if he is saying he picked it up in the street and was planning on turning in to some kind of art project or something you back him up on that or he backs you up on it whichever that usually will get you out of some kind of trouble.\n Since they didn't actually find any alcohol in your room just a glass bottle I don't know what the exact rules or wording of your housing agreement is agreement is but if they don't find anything actually in your room typically they won't really be able to do anything since a glass bottle is just a glass bottle you're not in high school anymore.\n\nIt just depends I would read your housing agreement thoroughly and whatever the dorm rules are with regards to alcohol because if there was no alcohol in the bottle it's just a glass bottle typically so the arts and crafts explanation and just finding it in the street one day and bringing it back to the dorm to use for a project might be perfectly reasonable sorry if I couldn't be more helpful again this is your situation so take everything I said with Is a grain of salt and really do what's best for you in this situation and use your own judgment again you're an adult you have to figure stuff out talk to your roommate  maybe",

You are probably right that it will just be a warning or a slap on the wrist, but having that conversation would be a mature decision. Also talk to your roommate about boundaries. What your roommate did was just a jerk move.",

Life happens and US universities are just like this when it comes to alcohol.",
