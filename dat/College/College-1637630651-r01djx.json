  "text": "Seriously why the hell should I be graded for something I\u2019m paying out the ass for when others in my group just don\u2019t show or contribute?\n\nI have to develop an entire fully functioning quality website copyright and data use/privacy compliant, 8 html pages, CSS page, and JavaScript, and Python data scraper, that\u2019s supported on all device types.\n\nMy job was the Python JavaScript and looking over their html and css. The course didn\u2019t teach Python or JavaScript so as I\u2019m the only InfoSec/Computer Engineering major I took responsibility for those and they were supposed to due the html and css with me overlooking and helping 4 other people so 2 pages a person and using bootstrap so mostly wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to put together using it\u2019s assets. \n\nEverything seemed to be going ok until realizing the work my group \u201ccontributed\u201d was fucking either stolen work, information that\u2019s un-cited and have no clue where it came from to check validity, their contribution of ideas are as abstract as maybe added a website feed to update data, and look into sidebar capabilities, downloaded from website maker companies.  I could go on.\n\nI thought they were doing good from what they had sent previously because we were given three weeks development time and their previous group contributions of things weren\u2019t to bad as far as research and stuff (this was the abstract ideas phase in between that and the project were modules of self learning.) As the only member of the group with any coding experience I\u2019ve asked many many times throughout if they needed help or if they needed something explained etc. Nope all good. Turns out they were probably cheating. \n\nSo now I have exactly one week to do all this. And my the presentation video as well as PowerPoint and documents edit it rely on them to do their introduction recordings for the video and prepared to present. \n\nThey fucked me over hard and I work 4 days third shift 10 hour shifts so then lying about understanding and being able to help attempting to cheat/plagiarize the majority of their work and then me having to start from scratch I\u2019m fucked.\n\nI fail this course I fall under full time and loose my scholarship. All because 4 others are fucking incompetent, freeloading bitches who are unwilling to ask for help or admit that they don\u2019t know something.",

And my response as well of when he said that looked like something he couldn\u2019t do (none of us could with the amount of time it was a professionally made site) with me agreeing on yeah we couldn\u2019t do that and was going to delete it. \n\nAnyway the professor gave me permission to drop all four of my team members this morning which sucks for them since they have no idea how to code and have 3 days till it\u2019s due so I predict they\u2019ll fail or drop with an Incomplete at the last minute.",
