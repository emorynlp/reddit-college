  "title:": "Questions on how to transfer as a freshman in University?",
  "text": "Its as the title says, I am already enrolled and going to an out of state university as a online freshman. I just recently got a Permanent resident card, so my parents think it would be a better idea if I were to attend a college or university in my state. So do I just show the places I am applying to my highschool transcript? Or do I show them my grades from the first year of university? I don't really know how it works so I was just asking. Just apply as an incoming freshman?\n\nAnd I don't just mean taking courses from an instate university or college while still attending an out of state university, (a misconception my advisor had when I told her I wanted to transfer). I want to totally stop attending the out of state university and start attending the instate university.\n\nIt would be great if you all can tell me when I should transfer too, like the end of freshman year? or beginning of the second semester of freshmen year if possible? But I feel like the sooner the better.",

      "text": "Depends on what the university you want to transfer has as their requirements. My school requires your official high school transcript and official transcripts from university for transfers. Also check to see what the school's deadline for transferring in Spring 2022 is, the deadline should be very soon or already passed.\n\nSee if you can speak to a Transfer Counselor at the in state university you want to attend, they should know exactly what you need to do since its a pretty common story with Freshmen transferring and will have better advice than anyone here can give.",
