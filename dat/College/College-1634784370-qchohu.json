So I know how having an advisor works or should work at least. \n\nI had my first meeting this year with my new advisor, she\u2019s my biology professor (I\u2019m a bio major, pre-dental), she\u2019s only been working for two years and she\u2019s 28 so I\u2019m her first ever batch. The only class I\u2019m doing bad in is in hers lol but I\u2019m actually trying. She asked me what I was going to do about my grade and I said \u201cI contacted a tutor and plan on meeting with him weekly until my next exam. I know he takes your genetics class and he was going to introduce me to the study methods he\u2019s using.\u201d I really thought that she would be happy that I\u2019m actually trying to pass her class by reaching out to a tutor but instead she snaps at me saying that genetics is nothing like biology and that biology should be easy. She said the study methods he\u2019s using for genetics will not help me for biology. I was honestly speechless so I didn\u2019t saying anything and just nodded. \n\nAren\u2019t advisors supposed to be more supportive than this? Should I change my advisor? I\u2019m doing better in Chemistry, should I just change my major?",

      "text": "\ud83d\udc94 I\u2019m so sorry.  If changing advisors is an option, it might be worth it. \n\nIME (12 years as undergrad advising coordinator), the quality and supportiveness *really* varies.  Faculty are overworked, and that\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s a huge reason I really prefer a professional advising model with faculty career mentoring, instead of bogging faculty down with academic advising.  But that\u2019s neither here nor there.  \n\nYour experience is, sadly, not abnormal.  But you might have better luck with another person\n\n\nDo *not* change your major because of her.  Only change your major if Chemistry is a better fit for you & your career goals",
