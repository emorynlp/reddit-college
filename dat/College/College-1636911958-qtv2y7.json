  "text": "I (18M) joined computer science in college and I feel like a piece of shit. Made my way through High school without studying properly, I know some 'algebra'. \n\nPast 2 years I feel like my brain is stagnated academically [I got mobile & internet 2 years back since then I am learning investing, crypto (invested some), writing a novel, etc]\n\nI am a little out of shape and everyone seems like they are all perfect, they got good grades and all. I feel so insecure. \n\nI am very much interested in computer science, but I lack fundamentals like some calculus, need help!\n\nWhere do I start? So, that I can have the good foundational math needed for college. \n\nNote: Sorry for poor English, it's not my first language",

      "text": "Hello, I'm not a college student (12th grade) but I'm self-studying calculus right now. I'm in the same boat as you - not very strong at math, but realized that I'm interested in a field that requires strong math skills. I'm using Calculus: A New Horizon by Howard Anton, and I think it's a really good textbook that explains why you're doing things rather than saying \"okay, this operation just works because it works, you don't need to worry about why\" like a lot of math teachers do. You can probably find the textbook online, with a bit of clever searching like I did... ;) \n\nI saw a piece of advice a while ago saying how the keys to learning math are understanding why it works and actual situations where you'd apply the knowledge, and a stupid amount of time and practice. Without knowing why you're learning what you're learning it becomes a lot harder to understand the concept, and easier to lose motivation. I've also found that the reason I thought I was bad at math was just because I wasn't putting enough time into practicing, so that might be the case for you too. Good luck! :D",
