      "text": "Think really carefully about what \"a great job\" would mean on a day-to-day basis. Does it mean being outside? Going lots of different places? Sitting at a desk looking at screen and making good money? Feeling that you're helping actual humans? Being able to choose where you want to live? Figure out what a great day or week at work would be, then figure out what jobs would provide that day/week, then figure out what majors lead to those jobs.",

      "text": "I had the exact same problem when I was in my last year of high school. There wasn't much I could apply for because I dropped math as soon as I could. I'm a computer science student now and I'm so happy I chose it. I didn't have any programming knowledge but I manage fine now. My moral of the story is: if you get out of your comfort zone, maybe you end up finding the perfect major. Cross out the majors you absolutely don't want to do so the list gets shorter. Then if you have a list of potential majors, look up some information about them and choose a few that look interesting. \n\nI know it's hard to make a definitive decision, good luck on finding your major",

It took me A LOT of effort to finally understand it. I began with Python at school. If I'm right you can start free tutorials on Codecademy if you are interested. With the motivation and the will to take the effort, everyone is able to learn how to code.",

Maybe an A- really is average now, but try not to sell yourself too short. College is very different than high school and if you find something you have the work ethic and motivation for, I don't see any reason to think that you won't necessarily excel.",

You can make more with an MBA but it'd probably be more work.  It'd be easier schooling though.  Nursing is harder schooling but better hours in the real world.  Business is a toss up, easy major though.  \n\n\nEngineering pays pretty good but it's way harder than nursing and business as a major and the work life balance can suck pretty bad.",
