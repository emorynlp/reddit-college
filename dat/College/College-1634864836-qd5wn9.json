I would recommend trying to get internships or entry level jobs in fields and see if it gels for you.  If you can't do that, then meet people in different jobs and ask them about the type of work they do.  I've generally worked jobs that paid well, but I was miserable with the job duties or the work environment.  So, I would really suggest you start getting exposure early so hopefully you can find a career that you enjoy and pays your bills.",

      "text": "I read a book. After thinking I wanted to do neuroscience, the summer between my junior and senior year of HS I switched my life goals and started looking at environmental science. I wanted to do ecotoxicology (etox). What reaffirmed this was reading Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. I switched universities thinking I wanted to dual major or minor in stats because I liked statistics in HS as well. I did not minor in it but I have been doing envs related statistics in R, and will be undergrad TA\u2019ing on it this spring. I haven\u2019t regretted my major or what I\u2019ve been doing with it. Try to think about what interests you. If you find yourself really into nature documentaries or animals, try to find a job that deals with those things. If you really want to be in a laboratory because you like science, do that. If video games excites you, try something with computer science. If you like watching crime documentaries, try forensic science. Try to make a list of things you like, and take the most entry level courses you can find related to it. See if you like them. Some universities also offer a section called \u201cundeclared major\u201d which is for students knocking out their gen Ed courses, and who will select a major later",
