  "text": "Basically the paragraph is something under the lines of \"\\[Authors\\] do this study, blah blah. Additionally they analyze \"\\[quote\\]\" and do so and so.\" \n\nI'm not sure if it's not clear that the quotes come from the authors and I'm worried that it's too late to do anything since it was already due and possibly already being graded. I also don't want to potentially get marked for plagiarism since they take that very seriously.\n\nI'm honestly having a bit of a panic moment and can't tell if I should be worried or not\n\n(Also forgot to mention this is for MLA format)",

Mine said \"This (author) said in this (article)..\" proceeded by some long quote that I meant to indent but formating messed up when I converted the document and it ended up embedded. After the quote I had parentheses with last name and page number and they gave me zero and accused me of plagerism.\n\nI set up a meeting with them and it was obvious they didn't even read what I wrote. They just saw the similarity result and no quotations and gave me a zero. I explained to them that if I were trying to plagerise, I wouldn't say who wrote it and put the source in the bibliography with a page number.. they dropped the case",

It should properly attribute any ideas, paraphrases, or direct quotations to your source, and should direct readers to the entry in the Works Cited list.
