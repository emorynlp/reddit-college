  "title:": "does anyone else find humanity courses to be the most difficult?",
  "text": " I find them to be difficult because they all require writing requirements and developing arguments/essays about things you are not an expert on or you are simply not interested in. For instance I had to write for my philosophy course four essays that each required a 1000 word count. We had to develop arguments on why we agree or disagree with certain philosophers key ideas. For instance, 'is the unexamined life worth living? why or why not?' and then had to tie in sources from the book, from a youtube video, and our personal life. That is not including the countless other discussion questions in which we had to develop arguments for them as well. Then, in English we have to defend academic rigor (in the form of quantity of homework assigned) but we have to use multiple perspectives such as professors, administrators, different type of students. No outside research or sources are allowed so we basically have to formulate reasons on behalf of professors which I am not one, or administrators, and yet again I do not run colleges. It makes me feel dumb.\n\nI am not saying they are useless, actually these classes challenge my critical thinking and writing skills so they are valuable albeit just very difficult and annoying. I have always been really good at Math and I like doing math assignments because they take like 20 minutes assuming you know the methods for solving the problems. It is very mechanical you just know the formula, plug the numbers in, and get the right answer in. It makes getting high grades easier because you are not being graded on 'didnt provide enough detail here' or 'i dont really know where you are going with this line of thinking' things my english instructor has told me.\n\nAlso, a takeaway if you struggle with developing essays I would suggest only taking 1-2 humanities courses per semester. I made this mistake this semester and have been teemed with essay writing which has made this semester very stressful.",

It makes me feel dumb.\n\nYou're not dumb. You're just experiencing the fact that true adult-level, non-superficial thinking is a serious matter.  It takes effort, and it's a skill that only improves with work over time.  So these classes are helping you improve your ability to think, which is a very worthwhile goal.  It doesn't even matter that you're not particularly interested in some of the stuff you're thinking about.  The reality is that adults have to face and master situations that they're not particularly fond of or interested in all the time.  There is absolutely no downside to developing good thinking and reasoning skills, so just view writing these analytical papers exactly as you would going to the gym.  Instead of training your body, you're training your mind.  And in the end, a sharp mind will take you a lot farther in life than a toned body.",

      "text": "Yes because I am not as interested or invested in them. I\u2019m a science major. I love statistics and science. The only humanities course I enjoyed was leadership theory and praxis. Give me a lab paper and I\u2019ll craft it perfectly. Can I write an analytical argumentative paper focused on a humanities subject? Sure. Do I want to? Not really because I\u2019m not interested, excited, not intrigued by the subject. It has been irrelevant to my major, and has not aided in my critical thinking skills at all. It isn\u2019t going to help me get a job after my degree and isn\u2019t something I\u2019d mention in my applications to graduate school because it\u2019s not beneficial to my professional, career, nor academic development. Hated taking them and hated having to even try in them. And in most, I did the bare minimum to secure a B. (edit: featuring all the hate I'm getting for shitting on the humanities)",
