  "text": "So, I'm an animation degree major and I've definitely bitten off more than I can chew this semester. Out of 5 classes, only 2 I have turned in assignments on time. One class, and the major stress factor, is my senior animation class, producing a 1 - 3 minute film. I've gotten headaches, wrist pain from drawing/typing, and just mental struggle. \nNot only that, I've taken up a second job during weekends upon my regular part time job, so only real time I have to do any sort of progress is after midnight, adding more towards the headaches, getting little sleep. I have to remind myself to take showers, my dishes aren't done for days on end, and I'm getting auto emails about almost failing classes. I don't even remember the last time I've vacuumed.\nAnd I don't care, the only motivation I have is to not fail. Scraping by with any points I can get, submitting stuff that's late to just get any points at all, and just trudging through class. Burn out, anxious, and just apathy towards my degree is all I feel.",
