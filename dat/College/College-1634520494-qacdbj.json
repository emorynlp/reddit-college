  "text": " Would anyone be willing to share their thoughts on which degree would be best/applicable if I want to study aging in depth? Why we age, how, and how one day we might be able to stop/slow it using medicine/technology/whatever? I've looked around and the common answer I'm seeing is biology, but also biological Engineering/biotechnology etc.  Not sure if I should specialize or just get a solid foundation with biology first, any advice would be applicated! I also almost have an environmental science degree so Ill need to see how much the classes I already have match up.",

      "text": "i would switch to biology and then take a masters in some kind of biotech field if you think you need it. Depending on what you want to do (like if you want to conduct the research study yourself) depends on the level of education (like you might need a masters or likely a PhD). But I would just go with the path of least resistance till you graduate which I think would be switching to major in biology. \n\nIf you went the bioengineering route you may be required to take the engineering specific classes. Like for some colleges, there is calc 1 and there is also calc 1 for engineering.",
