  "text": "Right now I'm in community college. I only took two classes this semester but I ended up failing both of them. It's way too late to drop them now. I have like a 40% in both of them. Probably even lower now. I did take a college prep class, 8 week course, and got an 85%. But I don't know if that'll help. If I turn things around and start making better grades next semester will I be ok or is it over for me?",
