  "text": "Hello,\n\nSo this might Sound weird but please let me know. Basically about a week ago my mom got a surgery where they had to open up her stomach for something. Thankfully she came out fine, no cancer was found, etc but she is off till like the end of the year. Ever since that surgery I\u2019ve felt down and not 100% especially because I am a rarely around her and when I went back for thanksgiving break I was sick and barely got time for her\n\nBasically I have this one assignment where I have 4 parts (I did 3/4) but it\u2019s due within an hour and I can\u2019t finish the 4th part and whenever I\u2019ve been working on the assignment I\u2019ve just been down and it\u2019s been hard for me focus",

      "text": "Give it a shot, hope for the best, and in the future maybe let them know ahead of time. Then you can say \"I'm going to do my best but I wanted you to be aware, is there room for accommodation?\", Rather than saying at the last minute \"I didn't finish, can you be merciful?\"\n\nSame result, but by giving notice you're showing foresight and awareness and he can assume you're maybe helping her or something. Now he has to give you the benefit of the doubt (which I hope he will) that you didn't just slack off and dig this up as an excuse.",
