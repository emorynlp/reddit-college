  "text": "Sophomore if that makes a difference. I know that sounds like I\u2019m a perfectionist or something but it was such a simple class. I just messed up and ended up getting a B. Almost everyone probably got an A in the class but of course I\u2019m one of the dumb kids that got a B. I hope this doesn\u2019t bring my gpa down too far. I feel like this is starting to eat me alive. I can\u2019t stop thinking about all the things I could have done instead. I don\u2019t know how to get over this.",
