  "title:": "Should I stop helping others so much and focus on myself?",
  "text": "The last four years, I\u2019ve made quite a few friends and lost quite a few friends. In fact, all but one is gone(dropped out/failed) as I finish my last semester. Over that time I\u2019ve become someone that people could rely on for help with most anything. I liked being that person. However, this year I can\u2019t help but wonder if I care too much.  \n\nThe one friend I have left at this school constantly asks me to check her work(which has been fine by me). She recently changed her major to one that requires a lot of the classes I\u2019ve taken in the past, so I\u2019ve been giving her a lot of advice, reading her papers, and helping with assignments. I\u2019m not doing her work for her, but I\u2019m pushing her in a direction that I think would get her an A. This semester, I\u2019m taking a gen ed class that she has taken before and that she\u2019s actually minoring in. I had asked her a question about one of my assignments and she answered with a simple \u201cIDK\u201d. Over the last month, I\u2019ve asked her for some help and advice since this is something I\u2019d think she\u2019d be at least a little interested or knowledgeable in. I get the same response without her even really listening to what I\u2019m having trouble with. Even her tone just sounds so uninterested and dismissive.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t expect her to help me just because I help her. I\u2019ve never expected anything in return before. And I certainly don\u2019t expect her to know all the answers. I just feel kind of surprised and let down that after all these years, she can\u2019t find it in herself to even show that she cares. Maybe it\u2019s the wrong way to think, but it makes me want to give her the same response when she asks me for help. That maybe it will get her to reflect on her own response and realize how it sounds. Perhaps that\u2019s the wrong way to go about it, but I\u2019m frustrated. It makes me wonder if I should just stop helping altogether and let her figure things out for herself like I did when I took those classes.",

Now she complains to me(all the freakin time) about how she thought she failed all her old classes because she was always helping her.  Which is just a ridiculous excuse, but if she thinks that\u2019s a possibility then she should stop asking me so I can do my own work.",

Its like the oxygen masks in the airplane, you have to put yours on first and then put your kids masks on second. The reasoning, you can't help them put on their mask if you are passed out.\n\nYour friend doesn't want to help you, and ive gotten that a lot, too, especially with family. Hence my statement. Its okay to say no, you could also ask for help when they ask for help, like a study group.\n\nOtherwise, set some boundaries.",

      "text": "I am experiencing the same thing. I am taking a STEM class with this one person, who constantly asks me for help. At first, I was okay with it because she didn\u2019t ask about every assignment and didn\u2019t ask questions that could easily be answered by just reading the textbook. After a few weeks into the class, she began asking me to check her assignments, which I wasn\u2019t really cool with since she expected me to give her the answers. She also became kind of\u2026 demanding. There would be times were I wasn\u2019t even home and she would insist that I help her with the homework even though I didn\u2019t have my notes with me and I was busy. \n\nI would then ask her questions about assignments she has already finished and she would also just answer with IDK and the like.\n\nAt this point, I have stopped helping her so much, and if I am not in the mood (i.e. I am doing other assignments, relaxing after a long day of school, etc.), I don\u2019t even respond to her texts. This might be what you need to do. You might feel like a bad person, but you have to prioritize yourself, especially if that other person is not willing to help you despite everything you have done for them.",
