  "text": "Hello Reddit, \n\nI moved to Ohio about two months ago for a job (originally from WV). As it turns out, I need to take two classes for a licensure here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is: would I still qualify for in-state tuition in WV seeing that I already have established \"residency\"here (e.g. apartment, ID, utilities). Unfortunately, it will be at least a year before I can obtain in-state tuition at an Ohio institution. Would this mean I could still take a WV-based online course for subsidized tuition? Am I in a limbo position currently where I have no \"in-state\" options. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!!!",
