  "title:": "Graduating at 27... I feel beyond shitty",
  "text": "So due to my naiveness and very stupid life decisions, I'm graduating way too late. It's been such a rough journey for me, pushing through just trying to do the right shit. I feel like crap because my friends have (obviously) already graduated, have stable jobs, and I've only ever had part-time jobs here and there. I feel like I'm too old to look for a job as a newly-graduate, it's so embarrassing.\n\nI would like to know if some of you graduated later in life, some useful advice would be appreciated.\n\nI already know that \"life isn't a race\" but with all honesty, I feel like society screams \"BE REGULAR OR SUFFER\". I feel like this lack of real-world experience negatively affects many aspects of my life. I find it hard to make friends bc I can't relate to other people's experiences, not to mention mention dating. I feel so sdjkfhaskdjfahsdkjfa  \n\n\n  \nEDIT:  \nFirst of all, I want to apologize. I have this narrow-sighted way of thinking. I kinda hit a low point today and I thought my life was crap. I also have peers who are older than me and I actually cheer them on and feel very proud of them. I guess the only person guilty of making me feel bad is myself. Thank you for reading this, and let's keep going",

I\u2019m 19 and I know people at my college who are 25-29 who are freshman in college. I don\u2019t think any less of them. Every individual is different/goes through different things/choose different paths, so they may not go to school right out of high school. And sure, society does scream \u201cbe regular or suffer\u201d, but there are so many people who truly don\u2019t give a fuck about social constructs. Do you man. Don\u2019t feel anything but proud of yourself! Congratulations \ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73I wish you the best!!!",

It seems that one must have no ambition to try something else in life but reading stuff on paper. \n\n\nIf you lived life after school and before university, you will profit from it so much more.",

I was nervous about going back as an \"older\" student, but every single person I've told that I'm in school has had nothing but positive things to say about it. It's not about age. It's about drive and commitment.\n\n\nYou hit a huge milestone, dude. You're still young.

It might not necessarily be the norm, but there are plenty of people out there who have gone thru the same situation and felt the exact same way.\n\nAnd even though I feel this way, I know ultimately it doesn't matter. It may be the reality that someone who started earlier has an advantage over someone who started late, but its still possible for someone who started late to speed past those who started earlier. And even then, you should be happy for everyone who makes progress in their life, and not belittle those who aren't as fast in progression. Because how you progress your life doesn't matter in the slightest, what matters is what you are capable of and what you become capable of.\n\nEdit: also I want to add, people's capabilities shouldn't divide them either. In general you should always be happy for another's success. I mean a healthy level of envy can actually be a good motivator, but its unhealthy to compare yourself to others too harshly. It's pointless to anyways, cause you could just be learning from them instead of wishing you were in their position.",

What you posted is relatable! I also didn\u2019t graduate in the traditional 4 years. It took me nearly 6 years to get my BS degree and yes, I felt a bit old when I sat in class with the people I assumed were younger than me. I had to deal with my own life\u2019s journey trying to figure stuff out on my own. I had no guidance growing up. I know that\u2019s not an excuse to not go forth with what you want to do, but it would have been so much easier if I had mommy and daddy\u2019s financial blessings and guidance. I cycled through these thoughts that if I had parents who guided me on all this that it would have been soooo much easier for me and that I would not be feeling awful about myself\u2026but unfortunately I did not have that luxury growing up. What I learned is that when we are not granted with the \u201cbest\u201d things in life we have to learn how to work with what we have and try our best to use these resources. This does not mean we settle, but that we use what we currently have to propel ourselves to whatever we want to do or have. Yes, we\u2019ll have to work harder than others who already have it because that\u2019s just how it is. Some people have it easier than others. Comparison is a thief of joy as they say. Be proud of what you have accomplished so far. Keep doing what you need to do to get your goals. Either you do that, or you stay where you\u2019re at.\n\nAnd don\u2019t apologize for your rant.

Some of them have masters, and one of them is working on a PhD (he was a stupid smart cookie). I've compared myself to them so often at the beginning of my college career. But over time, it got easier to be proud of what I've done, even if it wasn't the most \"traditional\" route. And you will too! Just make sure you celebrate hard when you graduate, because you've earned it.",

That you have made some 'stupid' decisions and managed to bounce back in a few years to finish your degree is amazing.\n\nI still think the way you do and I will be graduating at 29. Something that has helped me is going to therapy and realizing that not only was I ill-equipped for the challenges of adulthood, but I was taken advantage of emotionally, physically and psychologically as a result of coming from a family where I was neglected.\n\nOkay, you had a path divergent from your peers. I recommend finding adding new friends to your routine who've had to make some stark turns as you have. Friends who are direct in a kind way where you can share your vulnerabilities about how you feel, but who gently put you back in your place. Grounding yourself will be crucial as you apply for these full-time permanent jobs.  I was fortunate to have a few 'career' type jobs when I took a break from my degree, but I did not have the right people in my life to coach me through it. So I went a bit mad.\n\nYou are not going to do what I did. You're going to find your people who also struggled, whether you come from $$ and were neglected or come from low-income and were neglected, or maybe you experience racism transphobia, whatever it is \u2014 find the people who will get your head right when it goes batsh\\*t. They will help you make better decisions because they will balance your thinking and remind you who you are and where you come from.\n\nIt's going to be okay, just as long as you recognize the support you need. And it sounds like you do <3\n\nAs far as making friends, do some internal work to figure out who would share the exact vulnerabilities you have and figure out where they hang out. It could be something as small as joining a group therapy for mature students or graduates. Maybe your school has a mature graduate alumni group. I promise you'll find the 'thing'.",

This is the only life you are guaranteed and being 27 should give you an inkling on this perspective- it can be difficult to feel you are out of the flow but just know that no one else is demanding that of you - only you. \n\nYou will find your way- have more trust in yourself and above all be kind and patient to yourself. No one else is going to do this for you so don't abuse the person in the mirror.",

Also, from my many years of being present in hiring panels (mostly supply chain, and large-scale procurement projects), university experience rarely would outweight experience. What I'm saying is, get out there, and get as much applicable experience as you can. That, and only that, will give you confidence in workforce. \n\nI tend to hire confident job seekers, who are willing to learn, and can keep up. The more you apply for jobs, the more you realise that personal experience, will outweight whatever you think is holding you back. If you put the effort in, you'll get what you'd want in return. \n\nBest of luck with your future ventures.",

Learning new things doesn\u2019t scare me at all and I\u2019m being rewarded heavily for it in my job at a tech company.  If people graduate too early and land a job where they don\u2019t have to keep learning, they can forget how to learn new things properly 5-10 years down the road.  From there, they stick to what\u2019s comfortable and stop growing. You\u2019re already a well seasoned learner and have proven so because you graduated at 27.  Not only will you catch up in the \u2018race\u2019, you\u2019re going to surpass a lot of them if you keep up that attitude of being a life long learner",

Plenty of people get a degree right out of high-school, enter industry then switch careers alltogether. It's really nothing to feel bad for. Besides taking the time off from school I'd bet gave you plenty of other life experiences and that stuff goes alot farther than some of the classes you have to take. Cheer up m8, you did it!!!",

Nothing I do will stop the progression of time. The only thing I can control is what I fill that time with. So, you're 27 entering the workforce. Cool. You have something your 22 year old counterparts don't.... five years of growing up, hard decisions, overcoming your struggles. THAT IS REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE. Trudging through dumb jobs is nothing compared to getting mature and your head on straight. Employers don't care about how long it took you to get here. They care about if you can do the job, if you'll do it well, and if you'll be an asset. Use that gap as an asset. It is your selling point. You're more mature, you got here because you knew what you wanted, you're not applying for jobs trying to discover yourself.  You're the safe bet and the better investment. Lean into it.",

I also was able to land my first great job in my field at 27, even though I didn\u2019t try to move until a couple years after graduating. Nobody I knew had a hard time due to age; they can\u2019t legally ask your specific age when interviewing anyway. I wish the best of luck to you too!!",

And I'm sure good things happened in college, too. Maybe you met some cool people or learned at least one useful thing.

All my friends went straight to expensive 4 year colleges and were extremely successful, whereas I went to a community college and sank slowly into alcoholism and depression. However if I hadn\u2019t had those experiences, I wouldn\u2019t have the mental skills I have today that make me resilient. Im thankful for everything that has happened in my life so far, and I no longer care that my life didn\u2019t go the same way as my peers. I probably won\u2019t graduate with my BS until I\u2019m 35 or so, but that\u2019s just my pace and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to do it.
