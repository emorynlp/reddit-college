I just feel like if I was the one that owed them money I wouldn\u2019t stop hearing about it until I paid them, now they owe me money they\u2019re ducking and dodging me",

      "text": "Well, the end of October has passed so you should email again, as a reply in the same thread in which they told you to wait until the end of October. The way you're feeling is valid and probably true, but sometimes it's just the way it is and we have to follow up ourselves since it's in our own best interest. Also, due to the pandemic everything did get messed up a bit, I know my college's financial aid office is struggling a bit with staffing and keeping up so disbursements and refunds are coming in late. It could also be a system issue so I guess sometimes we have to give the benefit of the doubt.",
