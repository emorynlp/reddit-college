  "text": "To start: Yes I know reddit is not the best place to ask when it comes to dating, sex, etc.\n\nBut what are some hacks to your room that you think would make having your partner around nicer? So far what I've come up with myself is adjusting the bed height for better \\~ergonomics\\~, getting a nice(ish) speaker to play music, and some LEDs rather than having the dorm light on. What other ideas do you have reddit?",

You\u2019ll need one and seriously want the other. \n\nI personally like to have some form of white noise. I usually run my fan. But speaker wise, I like the Creative Pebble.\n\nFinal thing is it\u2019s nice to have a candle. Not sure how sensitive dorm fire alarms are, but purging the smell of dude is usually a plus for me.",

IUDs are very effective, but rarer and minorly invasive. All hormonal birth control can be less effective cause of stuff like flu meds and antibiotics.\n\n_Especially_ for you Americans, use two methods. If nothing else, do you really wanna risk 18+ years of child support?",
