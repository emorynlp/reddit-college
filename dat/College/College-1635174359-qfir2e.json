  "text": "Hello, I was wondering if anyone could recommend any resources to help me with my chemistry class. At the moment, with campuses restrictions, my school is not offering tutoring and aside from that does not offer many other resources. I somehow graduated high school without ever attending a chemistry class and now my lack of fundamentals is starting to effect me. I\u2019ve found myself confused in class at times because of miscommunication from a professor who cannot understand what I\u2019m confused about when I ask question. On top of this, when graded assignment are given back they will mark the problems I\u2019ve done wrong, but will not note why what I\u2019ve done is wrong. This has compounded my confusion even further and know I no longer feel like anything I\u2019ve learned is correct. At this point I am grateful for any help anyone can send my way. Thank you.",
