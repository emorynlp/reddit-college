  "title:": "Falsely Accused of Cheating In College",
  "text": " A few weeks ago, I took a test in at my college's disability office in because I have had problems with chronic headaches and bowel movements. These tests are pretty late in the day and don't allow for extra time unless you get it approved by your disability advisor. They only apply the extra time you need based on how long you've been in the bathroom and I've been having to use it a lot so it eats up my test-taking time. You also have to go when the office closes, no exceptions so unless you have accommodations saying you can come early, they wont let you. I had an appointment with my advisor but it wasn't until the day after I took my test and I desperately needed to finish this test because if I didn't, I would fail the class due to my academic standing in it.\n\nTaking all this into account, I took some scratch paper from my book bag (That had a previous test mixed in with it because I was studying for this one prior to taking the test) and began the test. Not even 5 minutes into it, I got knots in my stomach and knew that I wouldn't have time to finish so out of desperation, I put the test in my back pocket and decided to take it while I was in the bathroom so I could finish on time. The proctors caught me on camera and now the dean of my school is charging me for cheating and said that I could write an appeal to potentially overturn it.\n\nNow I'm not excusing what I did, from their point of view I can see why it looks like I cheated but that wasn't my intention at all. They take all electronic devices before you even take the exam and I only had my wallet and keys on me so I had no outside help whatsoever. He's saying that I left the test on the table as a decoy and cheated while I was in the bathroom which wouldn't make sense considering that they took my electronics and would see me on camera putting the previous test there so it wouldn't matter if I used it as a decoy or not. I have a really good GPA and scholarships that I cant afford to lose. I would hate to have this on my record over something like this. What should I say in the appeal. Help would be extremely appreciated.",

      "text": "Yeah unfortunately taking the test out of the testing center for any reason without permission is a likely a violation of some sort at your college. Also even if you didn't use outside material, trying to gain even more time by taking it in the bathroom counts as cheating. Try to appeal and retake this later.",

                  "text": "From my understanding, she gets extended time based on how long she\u2019s in the bathroom but only as long as the testing center is open. Earlier she mentioned that the testing center was going to close at 5 and she was approaching that time. In order to avoid this problem you need an additional accommodation that allows you to start your test early. She has a meeting with her disability advisor later to try and add this, doesn\u2019t help now. At the time it seemed like her only option was to take the test paper into the bathroom to try and finish it there. \n\nThe better option probably would\u2019ve been to just explain the situation to the worker at the testing center and just ask if someone could stay later with you. I don\u2019t know the people at your college, but at the DS center at my college they probably would\u2019ve been understanding and someone would\u2019ve stayed late with me just for the one time. It\u2019s a tough situation though.",

You may need to hire an academic integrity lawyer if you end up having a hearing. \n\nSince you didn\u2019t actually cheat I think you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I hope you don\u2019t get an academic integrity violation on your record. Best of luck.",
