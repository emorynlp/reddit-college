  "title:": "I had a panic attack during a stat test and got a 23",
  "text": "I have always had trouble with math but this semester I\u2019ve felt like stat relatively clicks with me. I got an 80 on the first test, and have gotten an A or B+ on pretty much every other grade in the class so far. I have had three different midterms this week, and just did not have the time to do the practice test. I will admit that I wasn\u2019t prepared enough as I should have been for the test, but I wasn\u2019t unprepared enough to get this bad of a grade. I have ADHD, and get certain accomodations to help me during exams. I unfortunately did not get extra time, as I\u2019m apparently not disabled enough, which really sucks because I work really slowly compared to other people. I have tried to appeal for it but my university continually shuts me down. Otherwise, I get to take my test in an isolated room, away from other distractions. The thing is, I still always find a way to zone out, even if I\u2019m in an empty room. Thats just what I ended up doing, and I wasted away ten minutes of the one hour timer I had. I looked at what I had just done, and I began to internally tear my self apart, just getting really mad at myself. So I wasted another fifteen minutes or so, and finally pulled myself together to do the test. But even If I knew how to do the problem, I just didn\u2019t have enough time to do it well. I was able to answer most of the questions, but almost all of them ended up being wrong. I have never been the best student, but this semester I have been doing better than usual. I feel like this is the first time I have been proud of my preformance in school for a while. A panic like this hasn\u2019t happened in years for me, and I got similar results on the test the last time this happened. I remember going to my teacher and asking them if there was anything I could do, and they said no, so I\u2019m hesitant to even tell my professor about what happened. But I felt like all of this was out of my control, and I can\u2019t help but want to fix it somehow. I put my grade into a calculator and found out I can still get a B- if I get at least an 80 on my next two tests, but Im just not confident that I\u2019ll be able to. I\u2019m planning on getting a tutor, and should\u2019nt have another week like this until finals. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Even if you don\u2019t, kind words would be appreciated, I really need them right now.",

      "text": "I think you should tell your professor and ask about retaking the test or what else you can do to make up the work. In my experience, professors tend to be a little more understanding as most of them have gone through many years of college and remember how stressful that time was. The worst that can happen is they say \"no sorry I cant do anything to help you\" and you just gotta move on. \n\nI really relate, I also have attention issues (probably adhd but i haven't gotten tested) and I've been in this situation before in high school math + science courses. It sucks so much that your university won't let you get extra time when that would solve the issue... it's like why does it matter if it takes someone 2 hours to complete these problems instead of 1? So much better to have students understand the content rather than just be fast at doing it :/ Good luck I hope this turns out alright.",
