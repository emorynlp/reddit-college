      "text": "i like it way more than paper notes. i use goodnotes ($8 on app store) and have it downloaded on all my devices so i can access my notes even if i don\u2019t have my ipad on hand. makes life a lot easier. \n\ni have the m1 ipad pro, but i had a stipend so that\u2019s why i decided to splurge. according to friends, the ipad air and ipad 8 both work well if you\u2019re only looking to take notes and aren\u2019t looking to do anything requiring a ton of processing power or using it as a laptop substitute. the pencil depends on what ipad model you get, so focus on the ipad model and then just get its respective pencil model",
