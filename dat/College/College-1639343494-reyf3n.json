  "title:": "I have some questions about dual enrollment. Info in description",
  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in high school. I\u2019m about to start my second semester of this school year in January. I want to go to community college for 2 years and then transfer to a university. But right now I want to do dual enrollment so I can have a head start. I have a lot of missing credits which I\u2019m making up currently. I want to enroll in community college next semester and take a class or maybe a few while still being in high school. In high school you get 5 credits for each class a semester and in college you get 10. If I enroll in community college classes right now will those credits that I receive from those classes count as my high school credits? Or as my college credits? And let\u2019s say if I complete all my classes and credits this year and in the college will I be able to just start going to college next year since I\u2019ll be done with my high school requirements? If this doesn\u2019t make sense feel free to ask questions I just rlly need help lol",

      "text": "I participated in dual enrollment in Minnesota for my last two years of high school. My school did it not by a credit-to-credit basis, but a class-to-class basis. If I had an english requirement to fill, I took a college English class that my high school advisor deemed an acceptable substitution, same with every other subject. I completed all of my high school requirements after the first half of my senior year, but I wasn\u2019t able to graduate until the rest of my class did. Even if I was allowed to graduate early, I would have \u201cstayed in high school\u201d just to finish up more college credits for free. I\u2019m not sure about other states, but the way it works in MN is every credit you earn through dual enrollment (PSEO) counts for both high school and college, meaning that they will show up on your college transcripts and be transferred to other colleges and universities. It\u2019s best to schedule a meeting with your advisor to figure out how it will work for you, they are a very good resource to have.",

You receive credit for taking the college course and your high school should credit your graduation requirements for these classes as well. \n\nAnd let\u2019s say if I complete all my classes and credits this year and in the college will I be able to just start going to college next year since I\u2019ll be done with my high school requirements? \nYes!! As long as your counselor approves the plan of taking soley college classes. \n\nSounds like you need to get more information from your dual enrollment counselor. \n\nMy student is enrolled in DE, finished all of necessary graduation requirements in junior year, so now all college classes are extra credits for HS, but fulfill degree requirements at college. My student would be a freshman the first semester, but then jump to junior level essentially second semester of enrollment, after 2 years of DE. Saves parents $$$$ as our state pays for tuition.",
