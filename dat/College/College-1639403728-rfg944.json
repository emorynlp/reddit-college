  "text": "\nYou can do college for the money or for your passion, there is no right or wrong answer there.\n\nMy question is for people who do it for the money, and than switch to their passion after they earn enough, or their sick of their degree after they get it. Or are they sick of their job despite it being high paying\u2026..\n\nIs that realistic? Is it even possible? \n\nDo y\u2019all older people regret not choosing what you wanted to work on earlier and developing skills for it earlier? Or do you feel confident and content now that your livelihood and future is secure with money and that your fine with starting anew at a older age.\n\nWhat is your goal in life?",

      "text": "Neither. Look for a career that offers a good work life balance that pays decently. I work in supply chain management for the federal gov, very boring career and pay isn\u2019t that high. BUT, I will never work on a weekend or past 330, I have every holiday off, a ton of PTO and sick time, and about 50% of my day is browsing Reddit or listening to podcasts. I really don\u2019t mind working until retirement age, which I believe is 62, if my career is this easy and flexible.",

      "text": "I am not that old but I did work for a bit, i am not passionate on my work. I was a electrician in the military but now I study economics. It does not matter what I work wether its passion or money. I love my time, when its work time I get down to business, finish tasks at hand. And I would go home chill, game, hangout with friends. Now as a student its the same, studying time I focus, leisurely time I fo as i said.",

      "text": "I would guess that it depends on why they're passionate. I feel like the word passion gets thrown around a lot, when really sometimes it's just something that you like. And in that case you can probably enjoy a lot of majors that people are \" passionate \" about as a hobby in some way or another. The other kind of passion would be hoping to enact change and therefore needing to be in a position of authority like working as a degreed position.\n\nFor example, history or astronomy or illustration etc can all be enjoyed as hobbies. You will have less resources and less training, but can be explored and enjoyed. Something like climate change, socioeconomic injustices and issues, and other morally based \"passions\" probably don't feel as satisfying just answering questions on threads or watching documentaries or maybe going to a rally or two.\n\nI'm excited about education and hope to become a teacher as a \"first retirement\" when I'm in my 50s or 60s. But for now I'm content to mentor people at work, at church, answer questions on here, and I even started a YouTube channel.",
