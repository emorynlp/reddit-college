  "text": "We've had the option of hybrid classes (online/offline) for the last 2 months and I've been attending classes through laptop . But around 50% have chosen offline classes so most \"friend groups\" are already made and it's going to be hard making friends easily . Tomorrow is going to be my first day of offline college and I don't know a single person , any advice on how to go about the first day ?\n\n\nP.S - I'm not that bad at making friends , but I'm a bit shy around new people and don't socialise much",
