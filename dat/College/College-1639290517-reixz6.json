  "text": "Ok so I took my final. The teacher gave us two attempts to complete it 3 hours each. My first attempt I did not do very well and I used the full 3 hours. I noticed upon completing the first attempt that I could see what I got right and wrong and what some of the correct answers were.\n\nSo I took the exam again  with my first attempt as a guide making sure to enter the correct answers and I did much better and finished it within 20 mins (because the deadline was in 20 mins).\n\nMy professor is not stupid so hes going to obviously see the difference in scores and time taken. \n\nI feel like this is technically cheating but I saw the opportunity and took it. I'm afraid that I'll get in trouble for academic dishonesty or something. \n\nDo you think I will?",

Since it\u2019s the same questions AND you can review it after you take it AND see the right answers the first time, it\u2019s like it was planned for the students to pass. So I wouldn\u2019t worry about it",

If this were me, I would definitely *not* consider it cheating since it was my fault I accidentally checked the box to show the correct answers after each attempt. It would be tricky for me to handle as far as grades for the class (how to handle the fact that some students may not have realized, etc.), but that's all the prof's problem, not yours. In these cases, I always appreciate when a student emails me a heads-up like \"Just so you know, the answers appear after the first attempt. I don't know if that's on purpose or not.\" That way I know there's an issue I'll need to deal with.",
