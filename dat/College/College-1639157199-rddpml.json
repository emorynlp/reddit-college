      "text": "It's normal to fail a course or two in college. No one expects perfection on a transcript. Plan your next steps. Will you be taking the course again to replace the grade or fulfill a graduation requirement? When? If not, then are you satisfied with your overall GPA for whatever your next steps in life are? Would re-taking the course even impact your overall GPA that much?",

      "text": "You\u2018re not a complete failure. I think the first way to cope is to remember that it is not the end of the world. This feeling of anxiety and panic is not going to help, nor is it true. Talk to your counselor about any concerns you have and how you can prevent this from happening in the future. I doubt your GPA is going to plummet just because you failed one class. It may go down a little but it shouldn't change drastically. However, hearing this reassurance from your counselor will probably make you feel a bit better. If you have to retake the class, discuss options with your counselor such as maybe taking the subject with a different professor or looking into your college's tutoring options if they have any. The fact that you care makes you a hard worker, not a failure. Take care of your mental and I wish you good luck!",

      "text": "As someone who has failed/dropped classes before, I can relate. Online classes are awful and kill all motivation to learn for me. And even then, seasonal depression is a very real thing that can have a strong effect on it as well. You just have to think about the big picture, because honestly if this doesn't delay your graduation then it probably will not affect you at all. If you pass the classes after failing them at my school, they cover that failure up on your GPA as if it never happened. I would go to your councilor and ask if you have a similar system to that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, 1 failed class is FAR from the end of the world. Nobody in a job interview is going to ask about your GPA or how many classes you failed.",
