      "text": "It had all of my old grades and courses in it.\n\nThey do not take your old GPA with you. The GPA at a new school is just for that school. Although, they may use your old gpa for some things.\n\nThe college of engineering at my college did use my prior GPA in some sense. There was a GPA requirement that I was just below. So when I first started, I wasn't directly accepted into the college of engineering. \n\nSome weird formality allowed me to be a physics major for my first two semesters since physics and engineering shared a lot of courses so I could establish a GPA. After my first summer semester, I was able to transfer to the college of engineering without any issues.",
