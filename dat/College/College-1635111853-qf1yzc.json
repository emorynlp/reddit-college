  "text": "Through the span of my high school career, my grades have progressively gotten worse due to mental health and family-related complications. This has led me to get into a sub-par college. In the past few months, however, I have begun to recover a bit. If I manage to improve my grades and participate in extracurriculars within my first year of college, would it be possible to transfer to a better one the following year?",

      "text": "Yes, it is possible.  That\u2019s exactly what I did- went to a local state university with like an 80% acceptance rate, got the grades up and transferred to a much better university.  Just make sure you take courses that will likely transfer over and apply towards your prospective major or at least core requirements.  You don\u2019t want to be a junior and be playing catch up your last two years.",

It's happened to me and many other people I know. \n\n> If I manage to improve my grades and participate in extracurriculars within my first year of college\n\nUnless you're shooting for an Ivy, extracurriculars are unlikely to matter. Schools just want to know that you can do well as a student there, and your GPA is what gives them that information, so be sure to prioritize GPA above all else (not above your mental health though-- your mental health is more important than your GPA).",

      "text": "Thanks u/BenignRaccoon for tagging me, because I live for posts like this.\n\nOkay, I was a 1.67 GPA high school student with no motivation at all.\n\nAs of right now I'm completing an AA&S in Science and an AA&S in Engineering with around a 3.8 GPA\\[Made a B in a 5 credit Precal + Trigonometry class I took over 8 weeks to get into the engineering program and a Greek Mythology Course\\]\n\nI'm applying to MIT and Columbia and have guaranteed admissions to UVa & Virginia Tech because I'm a VCCS student & meet all requirements for guaranteed admissions. So yes absolutely, I don't know too many people I went to high school with who listed UVa or VT as their \"Safety\" School.\n\nWhat's your intended transfer major, and how can you demonstrate your proficiency in the skills needed to do well in it? I'm going into Chemistry and plan to do a minor in Mathematics. I work very closely with our Chemistry and Physics professor on campus, I actually work for the Chemistry Professor, and I'm doing some work in the Physics lab as well. \n\nAdvice I can give, treat every class like it's important to your major, I was terrible at English and always took them during summers to get them done quicker, but during my second college composition I began to flourish in my writing abilities and now the English professor who taught that course is one of my favorite faculty members. She's helped me with Phi Theta Kappa Scholarship opportunities & such. \n\nOther advice, take 3 years if you need, 12 credits is the magic number for financial aid if working off the system most colleges use. Community College is a joke to some, but I've stayed up a many a night on Zoom or Discord helping Virginia Tech Engineering Students with Calculus and Linear Algebra. I went from the 2nd lowest GPA in my graduating class to one of the top students at my college even considering I'm in the Engineering program.\n\nThis isn't about me though, it's about you. You can do a lot if you really put in the work and have dedication, pull yourself up when you fall & make the best of your experience. I'm not going to say you can do anything, but you'd be really surprised what you can do. If you need any particular advice, feel free to message any time. I do major advising, and I'm pretty good with understanding transfer agreements, how credits transfer between schools in the state, etc. Mostly familiar with Virginia Community College System though.",

I appreciate all of the advice and will apply it as much as possible to my academic approach.  Good luck on your MIT and Columbia applications, You seem very ambitious, so I'm positive you will get in. I will contact you if I have any further questions down the line :)",
