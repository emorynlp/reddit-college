  "text": "Hey all, \n\nHope everyone is having a great week. \n\nBasically, I have a midterm coming up for a class that I'm retaking.I have been reviewing material every day for weeks and doubly so once we found out what is on the exam. \n\nTo say that I'm nervous would be an understatement. I fall asleep thinking about logarithms, I wake up thinking about logarithms. I get up at 6am to do 3 hours of questions and then an hour in the evenings. \n\nI'm terrified that there will be something on the exam that wasnt mentioned on the midterm review sheet. \n\nIs it appropriate to contact my professor (who is basically Mr.Rogers), explain how I've been preparing and then ask if its enough? Just to have that confirmation? Just looking to reduce my anxiety at this point so I can chill tf out lol",

      "text": "Of course. It's better to try to do that than to go into the exam with and lot of anxiety and no reassurance. Especially if you're polite and professional about it.\n\nLast year I took a literature class that consisted only of reading texts and coming in to discuss them, so I felt very unprepared for our written exam. I went to my professor's office hours and basically blubbered to her about being afraid of humiliation and failure (I can be super high strung at times lol) and she was really kind and helpful",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your comment. You are so right about it being better to go in with reassurance. Also, high strung and afraid of failure, yep sounds like me around midterms. My professor is like Mr.rogers if he taught precalc so I have high hopes for his response, I just don't want to bother him. \n\nThankyou again!",

I woke up in the middle of the night a few days ago because I had a dream that made me so sure that my dog was going to get squished if I didn't calculate logarithms right -\\_-. It's crazy. I spend hours a day on this so I guess that's why lol.\n\nThank you for your comment, I appreciate it alot.",
