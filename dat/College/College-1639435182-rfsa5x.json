  "title:": "College senior with ADHD wanting advice with how to finish out strongly (and how to not let adhd control me)",
  "text": "I\u2019ve never had amazing grades in college. High school was just easy for me, so I didn\u2019t think my grades would suffer as much as they did in college. I was even put on academic probation last semeste. I let distractions/life get the best of me (i know, but please don\u2019t judge). But next semester is hopefully my last semester before officially being a college grad, and I really want to turn my behavior around. It\u2019s never too late. I don\u2019t party, I just get distracted and seem to ignore schooling, as I feel overwhelmed, even in the beginning of each semester. I think I get overwhelmed because I have to do a lot of video editing for my major, and 2 meetings per class per week doesn\u2019t properly prepare me to make full blown perfect videos, so I freak out and leave it alone until last minute. I already have a planner, too. I just want to see if any other students in similar situations could please share tips for how they overcame this! Really really wanting to end strongly, just for myself. I want to be able to feel peace and confidence when ending my semester next year, instead of panic, fear of failing, and regret like I\u2019m feeling now. Any tips are appreciated. Thank you!",

      "text": "Choose a couple days to go to a quiet public space for an x amount of hours. Make it a habit and you will start get used to the routine and at the same time, have those boundaries for your mental health too. I find that with ADHD, routines are key!! Operating in chaos is just overstimulating and super stressful. In doing this, you will also have time to ask any questions beforehand should you have any, with time to make reasonable changes and submit the best work.\n\nETA: have it be the same times every week too so you know what to expect each week.",
