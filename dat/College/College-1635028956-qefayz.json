  "title:": "My Roommate Assaulted Me, What Do I Do?",
  "text": "TW: physical assault, racism, sexism\n\nSo, I recently moved in to a nice dorm as a freshman in college, and I did not know my roommate beforehand. I met him on the roommate portal for the college, and he seemed relatable and nice, so I chose him as my roommate. \n\nHowever, once I moved in, I realized that he was very different than I thought. I could tolerate our polar opposite political views, his carnivore diet, and his annoying tendencies.\n\nHowever, what I could not tolerate were his physical tendencies and insults.\n\nMy roommate constantly insults and belittles others, where he has called women \u201cfatasses\u201d and \u201cbig tits,\u201d objectifying them. He has very twisted views about women and minorities, to the point where he has said flat out that he hates all Asian people.\n\nOk, so you might be reading all of this so far and be saying \u201cyeah, he\u2019s a dick, but that\u2019s life.\u201d And this is what I told myself too. Until he was physical with me.\n\nFirst, he fake kidnapped me by texting some of his friends to put a bag over my head while I was walking to the dorm at night. I played along in the moment, but this is a very fucked up thing to do, and the justification I made is that my roommate just loves pranks and this is how he is.\n\nSecond, I got a grade back for an exam I didn\u2019t want to reveal, and he grabbed me and shoved me onto a chair, holding me down until I revealed my grade to him. I don\u2019t really care that I had to give up my grade, but I care A HELL OF A LOT that he grabbed, shoved, and held me down like it is nothing.\n\nThird, my roommate was trying to annoy me by taking over my conversation with someone else by spouting nonsense. I got really frustrated, so I went over to him, tapped his shoulder with a pair of clothes I was holding, and told him to stop. He then proceeded to get up, scream \u201cYou\u2019re dead!\u201d at the top of his lungs, and he pinned me against the wall, screaming into my ears questions about my name , my date of birth, and my favorite color. I felt so confused and violated, so I answered his nonsensical questions and he let me go. While he had me pinned to the wall he screamed in my exposed ear, where every time I would turn my head, he would just go back to screaming in the exposed ear.\n\nStill, I played this off for the night because I didn\u2019t want to address it. Finally at a group therapy session, I worked through what had happened and finally understood what he had done to me was assault. I confronted him , and he didn\u2019t seem to care at all and said what he had done to me was \u201cjust a joke.\u201d So I left him notes that I wasn\u2019t joking and that I was serious about feeling uncomfortable with his actions. At this point , I drove home, broke down emotionally, called my friends to tell them what had been happening, told my mom what had been happening, and validated the feelings I had held in for so long of feeling taken advantage of and violated.\n\nAs of right now, I plan on confronting him on Sunday night when I get back to my dorm with the RA on call in case he gets violent.\n\nMy parents want my roommate to get kicked out of our room by the school, and I kind of do too, but the college doesn\u2019t seem to take stuff like this very seriously and I feel that I will have to leave before he gets kicked out.\n\nHas anyone dealt with anything similar to this, and, if so, what did you do and do you have any advice? I am kind of at a complete loss emotionally and am very unsure of what will happen next.\n\nThank you all for reading. I hope I can get through this.",

It is very likely they will allow you to switch rooms, even during covid lock down we allowed room changes for situations like this. Seriously, just talk to the staff and don't discuss with your roommate. It seems likely that he will escalate the situation. Be safe!!!",

The roommate also had a bf in high school that liked to partake in drive by shootings and would hit the roommate while my friend was present. \n\nColleges don\u2019t listen and it\u2019s terrible. But they HATE bad press. Honestly get your parents involved and have them come to your university and demand to directly speak with the Chancellor/director/head of your school. Make a BIG deal about this, file any reports you can, and honestly have your parents threaten the school too to take the situation public if they don\u2019t do anything. \n\nMy friends mom did this after the school kept ignoring the issue and she showed up after being told no one could see her and *magically* was able to see our very \u201cbusy\u201d chancellor. The roommate was given new housing in a new dorm within the week. before the new roommates also made a complaint and she was banned from student housing lol \n\nI\u2019m sorry your dorming experience has been awful and scary, it\u2019s something that can really ruin someone\u2019s college experience.

Don't consider yourself to be untouchable because you think you had the bright idea of walking into this with your phone on record. You should do your best to ensure that you don't come face to face with this person while you're alone again. Have an authority figure with you, and do your best to make other living arrangements until this gets sorted out. If I were you, I wouldn't let myself be alone with this guy for a second. Get a restraining order as soon as possible. \n\nIt may seem like I'm overreacting, but I'm genuinely worried about your safety and I sincerely hope everything gets resolved soon.

      "text": "This goes pretty beyond anything normal especially for college. It would be ideal from your comments to be more proactive in both getting away from this individual and making sure they never come in contact with you again. Through of course contacting your RA and hoping either they handle it or escalate it to someone able them. \n\nAlong with I would write everything out in detail including full names of people, dates, time, locations, etc of all events in some document. Myself I would bring it to the police and ask for their advice, this might be better than expecting them to do anything as that could be escalating as you are concerned instead you are asking for advice moving forward. This also puts them on your side in case anything happens as it has been shown this person is unstable.\n\nI would even say this goes a bit beyond this subreddit and you should consider posting in r/legaladvice to cover all bases",

Tell your RA everything, make sure campus authorities are aware and have them close as back up. Also take a friend with you for support. This has escalated from a situation where you can just walk in and be like \"I do not like what you are doing.\", If he didn't care the first time, believe me when I say he won't care now so confronting him is essentially pointless. Notify all the relevant people of his behavior and let them do the work. If they don't do anything then don't sit back and take it. \n\nPS. You will not be escalating the situation so do not hesitate because you think you are. The situation was escalated the moment the fake kidnapping thing happened. Him and his friends could go to jail for that shit. You could have been hurt. So stay away from him.",
