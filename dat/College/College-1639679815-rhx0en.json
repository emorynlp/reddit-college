  "text": "Freshman currently attending a community college who wants to transfer by 2 years into a UC. I\u2019m sorting out all my GE\u2019s and thought it\u2019d be a good idea to take a winter session. (US schooling System) \n\nThe classes I wanted to take are: \n\nPsychology(behavior sciences requirement)\n\nChicano studies(humanities requirement) \n\n art history(arts requirement). \n\nWould this be possible to manage?",

Double check if your college/university is respecting in regards to transfers and post graduate. \nYou're not going to learning much at all in anyway you rationalize it. Only way to pass is to cheat or have the professor make a joke out it and assign like two assignments and a discussion forum.\nKinda like my winter courses for the past two years.\n\nOtherwise, hell yeah, take it. Pay for chegg and use it well lol",

Unless you know that one course is literally like the one I'm taking now for winter lol. If one is just two tests and a discussion, go for that and make it 9. Otherwise play it safe and take 6ish hours",
