  "text": "One that I've already narrowed down was an English major. As of now, I'm still trying to find out what kinds of jobs people with an English major have gotten. I've done some research and I'm continuing to research. Any information about an English major or jobs relating to it is welcomed.\n\nAnother major, the one I'm undecided about what probably have something to do with math or business. When I was still attending a community college, my advisor suggested picking my major based off of classes that I liked doing in high school. In high school, I enjoyed doing math, but out of the specific math classes that I took, I enjoyed the financial math class the most. I should note that despite it being called a financial math class, it was a college credit class available for the high schoolers. In actuality, for the community college, the class was a business class. \n\nIn the class, we did things such as:\n\n* Budgeting\n   * Utilities\n   * Budgeting\n   * Cash flow\n* Retirement\n   * Retirement income\n   * Social security benefits\n   * Pensions \n   * Life insurance\n* Credit\n   * Down payments\n   * Finance charge\n* Taxes\n   * Income, property, sales tax\n\nI really enjoyed doing things like that in the class. I'm not knowledgeable nor do I even know where to start. What kinds of jobs deal with that or what kind of major I should even be taking as someone who enjoys that kind of thing.",

      "text": "Not an expert, but sounds like accounting or finance might be good major options. I knew some people who were English majors. The thing about a liberal arts major (in general) is that doesn't lead you to a specific career path, so you have to do work on your own to get experience in whatever it is you want to do. A lot of English majors went into marketing or HR from what I've heard.",
