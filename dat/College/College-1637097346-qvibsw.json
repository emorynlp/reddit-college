  "text": " Title,  \n Looking for an online 1 year Masters in Finance degree.  \n \n\nHas to be either Regionally or Nationally accredited.  \n Online  \n Not looking for a career related in this field just would like to do the degree and casually learn.\n\nDo to health reasons I might not finish but I need to try....  \n \n\nSome preferences:  \n No GRE  \n No proctors if possible, I don't mind writing papers.  \n No group assignments.  \n Disability assistance if possible  \n A reputation of been \"easy\" doesn't hurt.  \n Doesn't require a bachelors in Finance as a prereq  \n \n\nCouldn't find anything that met this myself besides SNHU, which there's is 15 months though  \n [Liberty University](http://degreeinfo.elearners.com/lu.htm) is 1 year but have too much religion for me.  \n \n\nSo if anyone can throw out some college for me to look at and compare I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks!",
