  "title:": "In shock after finding out I need to retake Calculus 2. How do I go about this?",
  "text": "I was trying to have my first good semester since covid hit, but I ended up choking pretty badly on my Calculus 2 final. This is a course that I cannot avoid as it\u2019s required for my major (Computer Science). Over the winter I am learning more tips about organization which I feel would help me, but I\u2019d still like some other pieces of advice on how to make sure some of the mistakes I made don\u2019t happen again (most notably falling behind on homework). Luckily I don\u2019t think I need any kind of intense mental help, and if I can get a good start next semester I should do well as my confidence is built back up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
