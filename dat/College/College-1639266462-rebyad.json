  "text": "Does anyone know why this might be the case? She didn't enter individual grades, just put in one grade, an 88/100. However, our grade is made up of 3 short essays, a project, and a final essay. I received an A or A- on everything I've done so far, the only thing I haven't turned in yet is the final paper. Im stressing about it because to get an A- in this class I'll have to get at least a 96% on the paper, and it's the most difficult one so far. I was expecting to have at least an A- already and I'm confused about how I could possibly have a B+",
