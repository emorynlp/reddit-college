  "text": "Marine bio major and beyond?\n\nHi everyone, aspiring marine biology major here. Is going for a B.S./B.A. in marine bio a worthy career path? Does it necessitate a masters or phd for a good job? Is it even worth getting into now? Apologies for asking these questions, I\u2019ve looked online about this but also wanted a more direct answer. If anyone wants to know I was looking at Roger Williams marine bio track. I also asked this question on the r/marinebiology subreddit but my post got removed. Thank you!",

      "text": "Anecdotally, everyone I know with that major (which is admittedly just two people) are now working in 1) an aquarium store, and 2) the aquarium section of Petco. Not the best pay.\n\nI'm sure there are good jobs out there, but it's a niche field and my experience with niche fields is that you have to go in really knowing the market and preparing for the better paying jobs from day one and also that you should be networking because in niche fields everyone knows everyone, so to speak. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't know the market, so I can't help you there. Consider asking some professors in the field if they're familiar with the opportunities. Some are oblivious, so be mindful of that, but other professors keep track of what prior students do after they graduate and are more \"in the know.\"",
