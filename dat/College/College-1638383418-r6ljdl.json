  "text": "So long story short I have a C average in classes as a history major, although my major gpa is holding at a 3.0 and I\u2019m just starting to freak out about my future prospects.\n\nSimply put I absolutely suck at studying, paired with ADHD and big functioning autism. I also had a major depressive episode earlier this year which lead to my grades slipping. I\u2019m starting to feel like theirs no hope and I don\u2019t know what to do",
