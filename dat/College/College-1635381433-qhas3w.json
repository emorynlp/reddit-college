  "title:": "(Business major) What jobs could I get if I major in accounting and minor in business management?",
  "text": "Currently enrolled as a business management major, but it's my first semester and I'm very flexible. As much as I wanted to pursue something that required more creative minded thinking, I happen to excel in accounting related work, and after an honest but sad assessment, Ive realized business management is way too f**g broad. Accounting might be a better option, however, I still want to minor in something of interest to me. I have 28 credits coming in from PSEO towards my Gen ED requirements, so I have room to choose a minor. My question, is how much would a business management degree help an accounting degree, and is there a different minor (I'd prefer not computer science because I currently have minimal knowledge of computers) that I should pursue instead of business management to pair with my accounting? Thanks in advance",
