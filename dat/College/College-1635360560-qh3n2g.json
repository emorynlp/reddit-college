  "text": "Hi everyone! I am a graduate student studying online dating and would appreciate it if you took part in a short survey for a class :) In the survey, you will see 6 fictional dating profiles and answer a few short questions. The target sample is undergraduate students in the US over the age of 18. Those who complete the survey will have the chance to enter a raffle for 1 of 2 $25 online Amazon gift cards. It would also be very helpful if you could pass around the link in other groups.
