  "text": "I just finished my second year of college. Originally I was planning on getting my bachelors in Global Studies with a minor in Arabic.  My concentration was in \"languages and cultures\" and this year they changed it to Spanish countries only. So I would have to learn Spanish and take several history classes in Spanish. I dont care to learn Spanish at all honestly. And I'm annoyed that thats what they have limited it down to like wtf. Ever since I started the language department has been getting smaller and smaller at my college. My first year the Arabic professor decided to go on leave they told me to wait and he's never came back. \n\nSo since I dont want a degree in politics or Spanish history. I'm thinking of majoring in a foreign language probably French (because it's only that or German) and minoring in something that would be consider useful. I just need ideas. I was thinking maybe French\\\\business",
