  "title:": "Calculus Professor just assigned 8 hours of lecture, and 32 quizzes over Thanksgiving break\u2026 Please help.",
  "text": "I wish I was making this up\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m a Freshman in Calc 2 and due to my professor rambling on and on in class about useless stories, and his \u201cincredible math skills\u201d he\u2019s super behind on content. So naturally, he had the genius idea of assigning 4 chapters over break, each chapter containing 4 30-minute lecture videos, accompanied by a 30 minute timed quiz for each video. He\u2019s just using his old lecture videos to assign to us. \n\nWe got assigned these today, (the day before our break) and they are due November 29th (the day we get back) So he\u2019s basically forcing us to teach ourselves the content and spend an ungodly amount of time studying during break. To make matters worse, the exam on these 4 chapters is also the day we get back from break.\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering, is it normal in college for professors to assign this much work during break??? Anyone with similar experiences? And any advice on how to get all of it done? At this point, I\u2019m so stressed out and now I won\u2019t even have a Thanksgiving break. Thanks Professor!\n\n\nUpdate: \n\nWow, I didn\u2019t expect to be given so much good advice! Thank you all for your concerns and great advice regarding my issue at hand. \n\nI ended up emailing my professor in order to clarify his work expectations for us over break, and he ended up telling me that there will be only 16 20-minute quizzes, not 32 as he originally stated. That makes more sense due to my calculations of 4 chapters, each with 4 videos and a quiz after each video.\n\nIt makes me feel a bit better about the situation, but it\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, and quite frankly, pretty shitty of him to assign over break. As stated above, he is the type of professor that has a very difficult time actually teaching the course, and as a result, gets very distracted, goes on half-hour tangents, and brags about his degree. He also expects us students to often know much more than we actually do, so he gets frustrated when we ask questions. \n\nIf I can take anything positive from this experience, it is that I will finally be able to learn Calculus 2 in an uninterrupted way. I will be free of his useless tangents and stories, so I can hopefully better prepare for the exam this way, as opposed to his \u201cteaching strategy.\u201d \n\nThanks all!",

I can't remember having a college course where the schedule of coursework was ever pushed more than a couple days in either direction.\n\nI guess my only actual advice for you is to shoot for one chapter a day, over the course of four days. That way you at least get a few days off before staring back up. 2 hours of lecture, 4 (I'm guessing short, section quizzes) and whatever homework assignments each day is actually pretty doable when you break it down. Don't get me wrong, it sucks. But sounds like you just have to do it. You might be surprised- maybe you'll get through the material faster than you expect.\n\nGood luck dude.",

      "text": "While I wouldn\u2019t call this \u201cnormal\u201d, it\u2019s certainly in the realm of possibility. Generally there\u2019s no rule saying professors can\u2019t assign work over breaks. \n\nBut I think what you\u2019re really asking is if there some kind of action you can take to make the professor rethink this assignment. I would, in this order: \n\n1) Email the professor and explain that you think it\u2019s too much work to be done in the time frame, especially with students traveling to see family and whatnot. Maybe ask for an extension or for him to cut down the amount of work. \n\n2) If he flat out denies your request for some flexibility, you can contact the department head and explain that the only reason he is assigning this much work is because he has failed to keep on track during class. The department head will then (ideally) negotiate with the professor on your behalf to determine if the amount of work is too much for break or if some flexibility on due dates needs to be allowed. \n\n3) This is a final and really extreme measure that I think you should only take if both the professor and department head refuse to work with you at all (unlikely). If that is the case, and you feel like this amount of work over break constitutes an academic grievance, you should contact the dean of your college (not of the whole university, but of the college of business/ science/ liberal arts whatever you\u2019re in) to file an academic grievance report. At this point the dean steps into the situation and determines whether this assignment has basically affected your grade or ability to perform in the class. Again, this is the LAST thing you should do. College deans take these reports pretty seriously and only consider them valid if you, the student, have done your due diligence in remedying the situation. \n\n\nThat being said, this isn\u2019t unheard of. The best route may just to be to complete the work (or as much as you can in good faith) and then when professor  review time comes at the end of the semester, note the professor failed to keep the class on track and that lead to you falling behind. \n\nGood luck, I promise it gets easier workload wise as you go on.",

It's *not* a total cancellation of all academic responsibilities of any kind.\n\nSo, while it's not unreasonable for there to be some modest expectations of studying or assignments over the \"break,\" it definitely sounds to me like your professor's expectations are less reasonable that most.  You've gotten unlucky, and the only thing to do is to charge ahead, doing the best you can on the work.\n\nGood luck.",
