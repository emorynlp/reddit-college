  "text": "I have an open book exam where I am able to use course lecture slides, my own notes and textbook which is great but my prof says that if I wish to reference any notes they should be printed. My prof noted that \"Once you open the Canvas exam, you are NOT permitted to leave the exam page to view any other internet page. The Canvas log will record you leaving the Canvas page\" so it seems like I have to print all my notes but I have a pdf of the textbook and I feel like it's unreasonable to printout a textbook... What should I do? I'm not going to print out 1000 pages just for an exam. I want to access my notes and textbook on separate tabs but since canvas records you leaving the page will it be seem like I'm cheating?",
