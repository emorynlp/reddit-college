  "text": "So how do I know something? Is it because I remember it? This is really like the first era of my life where I am actually studying material & actually really trying & giving it my all so like this is all kind of new to me. I feel like I am just remembering information & definitions. For some reason, I feel like there is like a higher level. I can describe the material & also readily identify things on a model for example. But, is that what knowing the material is? Like I said, first time really actually doing schoolwork truly so first time I am feeling this. Might sound bizarre but it\u2019s a real question from me.",

      "text": "Memorizing something is being able to take it on a test and then forget about it a month later. Knowing something is like understanding it so intimately you can recall it without much effort. Also, a lot of school work is like that tbh, focus on learning the core skills of whatever field you're going in is and   pay closer attention to them when/if they pop in your classes.",

          "text": "To add on to this, forgetting material after tests is *very* common. But you're taking so many classes throughout your college career that you'll eventually understand what your degree is about even if you can't remember 100% of the material for every class.\n\nAlso, many classes go over the same concepts, which makes your brain remember that material even if you had forgotten it.",
