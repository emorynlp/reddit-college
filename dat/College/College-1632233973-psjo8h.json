  "text": "Hey, what do you guys do to reduce your work load/stress. I really want to do well in my classes but, I still want tp have time for hobbies/social life(which i dont have), to explpre and just to be able to relax. But, i feel like i dont have the time for any of those. Right now I spend about 5-6  on work ( often more than that and like 80% of that is my pos math class) and i have about 16 credit hours a week. I know thats technically not alot and im probabaly just lazy ,but to me it feels overwhelming and I know its only going to get harder in the future(im only a freshmen and i dont have an on campus job yet). I want to succede i just dont necessarily want to sacrafise everything else. Also my major is Computing in the Arts with a minor in either computer sciense or film studies if that changes anything. Anyone in a similar boat? Any ideas?",
