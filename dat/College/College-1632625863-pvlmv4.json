Both the new AND the old lessons require practice.. \n\nI\u2019m completely lost...",

It might also help to create some sort of \"cheat sheet\" of major concepts from the course as both a study tool for the final and a nice reference for the future.",

These are good tips to follow for the future (to avoid doing the same problem I\u2019m facing now)\n\nHowever, past me wasn\u2019t really helpful :(   \nHe wrote very messy notes occasionally and never saved them for later. \n\nAny advice for someone whose previous self didn\u2019t help at all? \n\n(Again, I appreciate the advice you gave me.. hopefully I\u2019ll manage to follow it and stop making my life harder)",

And every year, I have to re-learn it just like everyone and struggle with it (obviously memory does come back, but not fast enough..)\n\nI\u2019m guessing my problem is with practice.. but how do I do it now for older courses if I literally barely catch up with current courses?",
