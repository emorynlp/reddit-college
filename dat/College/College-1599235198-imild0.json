  "text": "I've struggled with math since high school, but have never gotten tutoring or been able to improve my skills. Now that I'm in college, I only need to do one simple math class to graduate. Though I thought it would be easy, I've started to struggle, but I'm embarrassed to ask my instructor or other classmates for help because, as I've said, the content is really simple, and I seem to be the only person struggling with it. What should I do?",

If you think you may have that, please contact your student accessibility/disability office! Chances are that they may have some recommendations for tutors who have worked with this case, course substitution offerings, more time on the tests, etc. You are not alone in this and should not feel embarrassed at all. The people at your college will want to see you succeed and will help you to do so, but they only can if you ask.  Good luck with your class!",

      "text": "Idk, I\u2019m in a top engineering school studying some fancy sciency thing and just completed calc 3 before stepping on campus. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t struggle with math. I have dyscalculia which is like dyslexia for math. Not really a specific diagnosable thing, just a general term meaning a learning disability specifically in math. For me it\u2019s arithmetic. I still struggle with the times table but can explain differential equations and integrals to you. For some it\u2019s remembering numbers, I know I used to have trouble counting properly, when counting I might repeat numbers so at 79 go back to 60 and not notice till it\u2019s too late. Like you wouldn\u2019t say a dyslexic person is bad at writing, it just takes a bit longer to read(yea I know about rearanging letters, dyscalculia does that too but with numbers, it\u2019s hard for me to differentiate 9 and 6 often. Cards and dice are tough for me). But none of this is to say your bad. And even if you don\u2019t have this, what I\u2019m trying to say is ask for help. No one is too stupid for anything. It\u2019s about will, it\u2019s about determination. Determination to do what you need to do, forget about anyone else. They don\u2019t care enough to look down upon you. Sometimes the only advocate for you will be you, unless you seek out help, but to seek out help you must first, well... seek help. Even if it\u2019s the fundamentals, they\u2019d be happy to help you. Sometimes teachers recognize you understand the material but not the basics and can help you from there",

      "text": "Rough because I\u2019m so late to the party so hopefully you get this message. But first of you can do it, you just have to put your mind to it. I used to be bad at math as well. In middle school I failed the advancement for math so I was a year behind all of my friends in highschool. I failed algebra 2 in HS, then went on to fail college algebra 2 times and finally got a C at my local community college. Somewhere along the way I decided that I loved to create things, work with my hands. This led me to choosing mechanical engineering as my major. It is now my senior year and I haven\u2019t failed a class yet and I use math daily. The best way to learn math is to talk to your professor, don\u2019t crutch on your calculator to solve problems, try to learn the theory behind math and why it functions the way it does. Remember PEMDAS, your order of operations, figure out trig rules, you only have to learn it once to remember it forever. However, don\u2019t go in exams, barely get by and then dump all the info you learned. Basic mathematics is the hardest to grasp as it\u2019s your foundation. Once you learn these fundamentals everything else is simply adding pieces to the puzzle. Hope this helps.",

Half of it is because they realized there's no shame in asking for help. It's how they conquer their classes so successfully. You would not be taking these courses if you already knew everything. Free your mind of this shame. It's not energy well spent. And also note that you are in good company. A lot of people struggle with math.

I draw when I'm upset, when I'm bored, when I'm sad. My parents let me draw directly on walls, inking sumo wrestlers crawling out of chimneys, eggplants with long arms. On physics tests when I blanked on an answer, I'd draw a man shrugging, saying *I simply do not know,* using the test time to shade the bags beneath his eyes.\" - Chanel Miller, *Know My Name* (p.71, hardcover)\n\nI recently attended a virtual book tour event with Chanel and Rebecca Solnit and Rebecca remarked that she loved this concept of Chanel drawing on a physics test. She said that it showed that while Chanel didn't know the answer to a physics problem, she showed the teacher she had a multitude of other important skills or talents. I agree. Physics wasn't her strong suit, but illustration and writing are.\n\nAll of this is to say that you needn't define yourself as \"too stupid\" because you can't do maths. While I do recommend you seek out help (I find forcing myself to ask at least one question each class to be useful), your mathematics abilities do not define you. I am sure that you are great at plenty of other things. Don't let this bring you down.",

They are more likely to help and will not say you're bad and math or so. \n\nAbout few years ago I was study in a new country and I did not know anything about calculator (my home country does not allow students use calculator). I was so stressed first because I could not figure it out and it was like two days before the exam. Everyone else in the class know it since middle school, but me. On that they the teacher allowed us to practice a bit, I was so embarrassed trying to use that calculator since I really had no idea how to use the graphic section, making solving some of the questions impossible. The girl next to me just began to teach me how to use it. I knew her a month before and we became friends because she speaks the language I speak in my home country. She never got mad or disappointed(I know she is not always at foot temper!) even if it took long to teach me. \ud83d\ude01Good friends are really helpful and they are less likely to make you feel uncomfortable to ask.",

Honestly, when someone doesn't understand a basic concept and asks for help, I gladly help, and it just feels normal. I know that the teachers usually feel the same (at least the ones I talked to). But when at the end of the semester someone gets even the most simple questions wrong I just think \"where the hell was he/she all year? why didn't they just ask for help?\". It's okay to not understand stuff and ask for help from your teachers and tutors. Most of them will be happy to help.

      "text": "I had a similar problem my first semester at college while taking a physics class. I didn't understand the material and didn't understand the math that was supposed to be prior knowledge. Because of this I was thinking \"its not the professors' responsibility to be teaching me these things. This is supposed to be prior knowledge.\" By the time I asked for help, it was too late; the material had advanced to a point where the stuff we learned, in the beginning, was being used VERY heavily for more and more complicated problems. Because I never understood the base material I didn't have enough time in the semester to re-learn all the material and start to understand the current material. The professor met with me and we discussed what office hours are for. I found out that even if I somehow forgot what 2+2 equals, it is their job to teach me anything that has to do with the class. I made a big mistake not asking for help earlier, and had to drop the class as it wasn't possible for me to get anything other than an F. However, I also learned a valuable lesson in the process. Please don't make the same mistake that I did. Also, Im guessing that since you are writing this post you know that you should go and ask for help. You can do that by going to office hours, or, if your school has a tutoring program, you can get a tutor. Both of those things will help you. One last thing, you are not stupid, no one goes through school without having trouble with the material. High schools in the US also teach different things to students/have different standards for what is taught. In high school for me, I took a physics class and never once talked about vectors. My friend graduated without learning about sin, cos, or tan. Everyone is different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add that the app \"Photomath\" has saved me numerous occasions and works as a great study tool. You show the math problem up to your phone's camera and it tells you the answer while showing all the work step-by-step. It even worked for my pre-calculus class.",

She never gave me the questions but she was gearing more towards more specific topics that I'd need to know for the exam. She knew I was trying and struggling with a lot and she definitely saw that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMath teachers are really awesome and really bright people and for the most part don't want you to fail. Math is one of those subjects that you really have to love if you plan on becoming a teacher with it. And it definitely showed in nearly all of my math teachers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly going to office hours and working one on one helps a lot - don't feel stupid because you're just going to hurt yourself in the long run, and thats being stupid.

      "text": "Saying you're too stupid is already a problem/mistake you've made. No one that's good at math has an aptitude for it. It's just practice and being able to follow again, like instructions for anything. Trust me. I did awful in math in highschool but math is currently my favorite subject in college (CS major). I'm not gonna sit here and say it's just in your head or bla bla bla, but also not reaching out for help is just another mistake you're making. \n\nPeople are *in love* with helping and teaching others. It's why we have professors, teachers, tutors/tutoring centers etc. I'll bet you ain't the dumbest person to walk through some doors or shoot an email asking for help. I probably am lol. Point is, build up some courage and ask for help, and don't compare yourself to others. Patience and baby steps. You're not stupid. No one is\n\nAdd on/edit: I think the best thing for you to do is muster up the courage to get some help. It'll help in the long run for your confidence and determination to do better in math or at anything in which you're intimidated. Don't try to go around it, and don't even try to cheat. It's a popular consensus across the dang globe that math is hard, no matter how simple sometimes, you're not the only one. My dad doesn't even remember how to do division lol. It's alright no one will judge you",

      "text": "Asking for help is nothing to be embarrassed about. I use to work in my school's math tutoring center, and I have so much respect for the people who would come in often, have a ton of questions, and need a lot of help. And to be honest, it was more impressive to me when someone would come in for help with arithmetic or basic algebra than advanced calculus. Why? Because someone who's studying advanced calculus is probably naturally pretty good at math, they probably like it, and maybe they've finally gotten to the level where it's not \"easy\" anymore, but they're more likely to find the challenge kind of fun. On the other hand, someone needing help with pretty \"low level\" math probably doesn't enjoy math, maybe even dreads it, and just wants to get through the class so that they can graduate. I guess my point is I find the attitude of, \"I'm bad a this, I hate it, it makes no sense to me, but goddamn I am going to learn it.\" pretty impressive really. \n\nDoes your school have a tutoring center? Maybe you would feel more comfortable going there knowing that if you come out totally embarrassed you can just never go back and probably never even see the person who tutored you again. That obviously wouldn't be a great outcome, but keeping the option in mind might help you get your foot in the door (or the zoom room). Alternatively, I'm sure your teacher would much prefer that you come to office hours constantly and ask all your \"stupid\" questions and pass than to have you just quietly fail. And if you can't bring yourself to do either of those, or try them and can't make either a regular thing, there's youtube videos on literally everything, and often hearing the same concept explained a couple of different times by a couple of different people can help a lot, so there's always that.",

My strategy was to go to SI and have them help me with homework problems that I couldn't do or struggled with and get it done there. The plus side is I got my homework done three times as fast, understood it coherently, got all the points for it, and averaged really well on my test. Got all A's throughout University in this system. Great system for getting it done and understanding. Also don't feel bad if a graduate student isn't as communicable as another one in the room. Just do what you can and if it's really not happening don't feel rude to try someone else.\n\nFAU was awesome in that every day of the week essentially had an open block for us. But if there's no time for you (work), definitely email the professor and or find a friend in class. Good luck!",
