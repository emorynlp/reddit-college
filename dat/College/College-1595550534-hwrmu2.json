  "text": "I\u2019m taking an online summer class on Zoom. Roughly 2/3 of the enrolled students actually show up. I noticed an extra person today. His screen name is \u201cHarry Balzak\u201d and he has some stupid creepy face thing as his image. He keeps whispering Rachel, growling, and making fart noises into the microphone. Just started trolling the chat threatening people. We\u2019re literally just trying to take notes bro. This school costs a lot of money and we\u2019re all adults, I don\u2019t understand the desire to be disruptive.",
