  "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to place something like this, but I'm starting to get worried and had to ask someone somewhere. The deadline for professors to grade assignments for the semester is December 9th, and one of my teachers hasn't put in a single grade the whole semester. We've had twenty assignments plus two final projects. I've turned all of them in on time but nothing has ever been graded! I emailed him about it a few days ago and didn't get a reply. Tried again yesterday and haven't heard anything back. Is this normal? Is it going to mess up my financial aid if he doesn't post them? They're not zeroes or anything, there just... isn't anything there.",
