  "text": "Hi. I'm in my fifth full time semester of college, but I still haven't transferred out to a four-year yet and don't know when I'll be able to. Im hoping I'll be able to by the time I'm 21 or 22. I'm a bio major and would have taken my major classes much sooner had a pandemic not occurred and forced everybody online. So I focused on gen ed while I waited for college to return in-person so I could take my major classes then (mostly because of the lab work). I was going to be taking all major classes this semester, but not even two weeks before classes began my college changed plans and forced us online. So now I'm only in one major class this semester and had to re-work my entire class schedule.\n\nI want to transfer out asap but I don't know when I'll be able to because of everything that's going on. I feel extremely insecure because I know I wont be able to graduate with a bachelor's in four years, and I'd rather not graduate with a bachelor's at 24 or something. I'm hoping I'll be able to transfer out to a four year at all at this point...\nI don't know. Are any of you guys dealing with this or something similar?",

      "text": "Yes, it's normal. Source: Worked at a community college; scheduling's a bitch and shit happens so it's pretty normal to have transfer time delayed. This was pre-pandemic, too, so I'm sure it's even more common now.",
