  "text": "A lot of ppl are probably in the same boat as me, but hear me out.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I was a nearly straight A student who was punctual, focused, and driven. Nowadays, I find myself willing to accept a C with with these online do-it-yourself classes. All my good school habits are out the window, and now I'm trying to remember how to take notes again. I feel like I'm getting borderline ADHD in that I can't sit still anymore or focus in class, even outside of class. I'm more forgetful than ever too. I know a change of scenery for hw or classes would help, but it still feels different than being on campus. I haven't been back on campus yet as my classes don't need to, but I should next term (Winter 2022). These days, I'm also late for everything, and don't care to go out and see friends anymore like I used to. Leaving the house at all is so draining, but staying in all day is also draining. I've also seemed to have lost the same drive I used to have for my degree, even tho I love biology. Depression doesn't help, but I have meds for that. To make matters worse, I'm developing a horrible procrastinating habit that I don't want to take back to campus life. \n\nAs people start going back on campus and numbers continue to rise, I wonder if I'll ever be able to go back to how I was before the pandemic when it comes to education and discipline. It's obvious things will never be the same, but how do I get back to that work ethic and drive I had before? Has the transition back to campus been an easy one for others? I just want to know what other ppl have to say on this matter, because there's no way I'm the only one.",
