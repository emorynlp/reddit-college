  "text": "For my speech class we had to submit an outline of our speech for our peers to review. I copy and pasted the introduction of one article because i couldn\u2019t think of one but was gonna work off that one and go back and change it. However I forgot to do that and submitted. I did cite the article later in my paper and I emailed my teacher fessing up and explained that it wasn\u2019t my intention and I do have it changed for my actual speech but I\u2019m still freaking out pls help",
