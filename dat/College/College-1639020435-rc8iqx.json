  "text": "So, this last semester has been really hard on me. I took a final yesterday and I\u2019m about to take one for another class tomorrow. I really have no hope that I\u2019ll get the grade I need. One course I know I got an F and the other I am pretty sure I\u2019ll either fail or get ~D. I just wanted other peoples perspective/experience on failing a course. I plan on taking the course I failed again, within a semester or two, but I just need some sort of motivation and hope that my college career isn\u2019t going up in burning flames. I\u2019m also a \u201cPre-Med\u201d student, but this semester has me *really* second guessing my intelligence and whether or not I\u2019m cut out for this.",

I\u2019ve done pretty well all semester but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ll do too well on the final. It\u2019s cumulative but the final covers like 75% of the one exam I didn\u2019t do too well on.",

For my school the new grade overrides the failing grade on the transcript as well so the GPA hit wasn't there anymore.",
