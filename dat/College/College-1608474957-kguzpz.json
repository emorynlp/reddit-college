As an adjunct prof, I get paid next to nothing while I also stay up late trying to finish writing my PhD thesis and worrying about if I\u2019ll have a job next semester. \n\nNobody was prepared for this, and it\u2019s been stressful for everyone, but I want to say too that some of my students really made it worth it. I know everyone tried their best, and I hope I was as good to them as they were to me. \n\nAfter this last week of finals, three of my students reached out to say that they enjoyed the class and to share stupid, funny stuff from Tik Tok about our course material. I\u2019m sure they had a thought or two that they shouldn\u2019t send it because it\u2019s embarrassing or something, but I absolutely loved hearing from them. It made me well up a little.",
