  "text": "Okay he doesn't use a DSi but he might as well be. His webcam is so bad and he sets it up in front of the white board but we can't read anything he writes because its so low quality. I've made sure its not just my internet because everyone is complaining about it. He mutes everyone during class so we can't verbally say it to him and he seems to ignore the chat and emails about it. I'm assuming he's teaching from campus, unless he has wall mounted whiteboards in his house, so I would expect him  to be using a university supplied computer and webcam.",

If he\u2019s not allowing you to unmute or answering the chat, how the heck are students supposed to ask clarification questions on the material he\u2019s teaching?\n2. If he doesn\u2019t respond to student emails, how is he even teaching at all?? That\u2019s one of the most basic duties of the job.",

We\u2019ve alerted him through email but I think he may not know what to do as there\u2019s been no response.

The only reason I wouldn\u2019t go to IT directly is that they will likely tell you they can\u2019t initiate a support ticket for a professor based on an interaction with a student (but they absolutely could if staff called it in).",

Two adjuncts I know are on Medicaid/food stamps. Many collect unemployment in the summer months and crowd fund for medical bills and car repairs. It is very possible they make $20k-$30k a year or less, even in a major city.\n\nAlso, one thousand-year-old Bob might not be able to go to campus right now because, you know, he could catch COVID and die.\n\nI know this sucks for everyone all around.

          "text": "For real, I have to ask.  Why is the constant refrain to every problem with every professor to \"go over him/her\" to the dept head?\n\nThe reason I ask is that   I feel like this doesnt really reflect an understanding of the actual dynamics of an academic department.  The chair of a dept is not the boss of the dept in the same way that, say, the manager of a store is.  The chair cannot order faculty to do things.  The chair does not have hire/fire capacity.  The chair really can't do much at all without the consent of at least the majority of a dept except maybe set up an offending prof's schedule with a shitty time slot of a lab or something.  That's because  the chair is a colleague who is typically equal to everyone in rank and either volunteered or was voted in to the position. Their extra duties include creating course schedules, begging faculty to fill out committees,  mentoring new faculty, and pleading our budgetary case/agenda to the dean. In return s/he gets load release. But the point is, it's a rotating, consensus-based SERVICE position (almost invariably middle-rank profs as well).\n\nWhy does this matter?   Now I'm not saying if professor conduct is a legitimate problem you can't go to the chair, but for minor issues, at most the chair can maybe mention something to an offending prof in passing in an email.  This is especially the case if the prof is associate rank or higher.  (With pre-tenure or  NTT we have a bit more flexibility). Obviously illegal or unethical conduct is a little different, but encouraging students to immediately email the chair over something like this is just going to over-burden the chair.\n\nSource: I am the chair of a dept.  Please stop emailing me about the resolution of Bob's online lectures (although Im always happy to hear from our students!).  We have university-provided web cams/laptops and im pretty sure theyre older than most students.  Getting them set up so that Bob, who is 1000 years old, can use them was in and of itself a miracle.  Please call IT and email Bob.  He just recently linked his email to his phone. He's very proud.",

OP did email the teacher, and he ignored it and the rest of the class who also spoke out about it, in class, via IM. This shit is unacceptable for a school op is probably paying thousands of dollars to attend. Sorry, but as department head, it's your job to keep you department in check, that's why you're the leader of it. If you let an instructor shittily teach his class after hearing that hes doing a bad job, that's on you as much as it is on him when students complain and drop the class. Also, IT isnt going to do anything unless the instructor asks them to, a student cant set an IT appointment up for an instructor. (Unless you're in some whack ass world) this whole issue is less about the camera being bad, and more about the instructor blatantly ignoring his students, and thus giving them a subpar classroom experience at best. That's a Chair issue.",

Obviously if a faculty member is straight up ignoring students for an extended period of time I will 100% call the faculty member out on it (within the boundaries of dept norms, of course), but the OP doesn't make clear that this is the case.\n\nI think more than anything, I was aiming to temper expectations about what dept chairs can actually do when students  \"go over a profs head.\"  (Again, more of a reaction to the countless advice posts and I just chose to comment on this one).\n\nYou say it's my job to keep a \"dept in check\" as if I'm theyre boss.  Yes I can promote good pedagogy.  Yes, I can try to put the better teachers into classroom situations where their skills do the most good, but ultimately I am constrained. I can certainly encourage this faculty member to resolve this issue. Being a bit tech savvy, I am constantly trying to encourage are luddite faculty to embrace technology in and out of the classroom.\n\nWhat I can't do is straight up force people to alter their classroom.  Again, if this is an ignoring email thing that's one thing. But if this faculty member has an assigned classroom space and is using university equipment, I cannot force the faculty to do anything. I can let him know I've heard about issues, encourage him to seek IT's help, but that's the extent of what I can realistically do.  I wish I could upgrade all our tech, but I've got zero wiggle room in our budget as is.\n\n\\[personal rant:\\] I mean, I have one classroom with a projector that has intermittent functionality issues (projects purple for some reason).  FOUR YEARS I have been trying to get it replaced or fixed.  FOUR YEARS.  Every time IT comes to 'fix' it and every semester I get an angry email/comment from a faculty member about it.  Frankly, I consider it a miracle we all got newish laptops for our online class space. For context, I'm at a low tier public college so we depend greatly on the state bloc grant.",

Professors are now seen as nothing more than the front-line workers of no real consequence.  If the high school kid working at the Apple store doesn't resolve the situation to your satisfaction, no problem, you just ask to speak to the manager.  If the manager can't or won't do what you want, no problem, just threaten to complain to the district manager, and so on.  If your professor took off a letter grade because your paper was a day late, no problem, just complain to the department chair.  Maybe nothing will happen, but maybe you'll get lucky and the chair will intervene just to make this nuisance go away.  If that doesn't work, there's still the dean, the president, the board of trustees, the department of education, the news media, the state legislature, Congress, the Pope, and, finally, when all else fails, students have occasionally been known to turn to prayer hoping that divine intervention will fix everything.",

My research was severely hampered because my PI was stuck in meetings rather than doing or guiding research. \n\nIt isn't a good job and doesn't have power. Your email to the chair will just be lost even deeper in his inbox than in your professor's. Try going to office hours or stopping by that actual office (which is very hard right now). The vast majority have no interest in wiring to give a lector that you can't learn from. He may just have no clue how to fix it. You might suggest a document camera which will be arranged to point down at a book or sheet of paper. Then the prof can sit to lecture and write nearly on flat paper vs trying to arrange himself and a white board to both be visible.",

These are true statements. The reality is that the student should tell the prof the audio/video quality is poor, the prof would ask the chair for better equipment, the chair would either say sure or sorry no money, deal with it. Or the prof might already know the chair will say no and thus continue with their current set up and tell the student to deal with it. At that point, for the student to go to the chair directly is just going to annoy everyone. Personally I had to go to Walmart and buy a shitty microphone to go with my 10 year old webcam when we switched to remote instruction in March. That\u2019s my resource. I mentioned to the department that we need better resources, and we got nothing. So the reality is that we have to deal with it.",
