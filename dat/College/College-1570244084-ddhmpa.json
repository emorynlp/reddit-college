Everyone understands you need to be in class, but they also appreciate you making an effort to not pass on your illness.\n\nFor reference, if you have had a fever, vomited, or had really bad diarrhea in the last 24 hours, you should NOT go to class (or out in public, at all, really).\n\nIf you have a persistent cough that lasts longer than two weeks, please go to the clinic.
