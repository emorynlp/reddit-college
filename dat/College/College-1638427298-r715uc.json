  "title:": "Terrible Semester (Junior & First Year at Uni)",
  "text": "I've already dropped 2 courses this semester, nearly going to get a D in one of my classes, and maybe at best a B in my other class. This is my first year at University in a major that I already want to swap out of 1000%. I struggled so much and pretty sure I hit the lowest of lows in my life during this semester. Coming from Community College to online University was a huge jump and I didn't think it'd be this bad. I don't want to put the blame on anything other than myself, but I've been living in a bad situation for the past year or so. It's just a terrible environment, I want to get out as soon as possible, but now with how schools going I've been even more depressed and trapped because of how badly I am doing. I feel as though I wont get anymore financial aid or maybe even kicked out of school. \n\nkinda just rambling but I have no other way to put it right now.",
