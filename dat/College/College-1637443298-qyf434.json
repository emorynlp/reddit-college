  "text": "I can\u2019t focus on more than one subject adequately enough to feel satisfied in what I\u2019ve learned. And I don\u2019t care how long it takes tbh, I care far more about not being stressed. I have a job I\u2019m happy with. I read this quote that says \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how slow you go as long as you don\u2019t stop\u201d. I wish learning one thing at a time was more the norm. I completely dropped out of college because the work was overwhelming",

It will take an incredibly long time to complete a degree going that route, but if that isn't your goal, then it's irrelevant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are seeking a degree, you could probably make it work if you took two subjects in a term, or some combination of that with summer and intersession courses. But at two classes a year, you probably won't even be able to keep up with the changes in degree requirements.",

It may also raise questions for employers as to why it took you 8+ years to graduate from a bachelors program. \n\nA better plan would be taking 2-3 classes a semester and then taking winter & summer classes to even out the load you are missing during traditional semesters or doing online college at purdue/ASU. Seems like that would be better as you go at your own pace.",
