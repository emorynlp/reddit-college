  "text": "I currently have one right now and it's a pain in the ass. A painful 4 hr of doing 1000+ repetitive tasks + more procedure just to get 25$ per month at best performance. It really isn't worth it especially I've been told that my salary is gonna come by JANUARY. The whole thing seems like a labor trafficking.\n\nI know most jobs aren't relaxing at all but I'm looking for one that's reasonable for its salary. I'm fine with getting 25$ per month as long as it's not stressful unlike my current one. Also fine with working hard as long as it pays right. Any part-time job that is reasonable, I'm fine with it.\n\nDo you guys know one?",
