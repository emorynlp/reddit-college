  "text": "When I'm eligible to study for free (work benefit) next fall, I'll be about 24 years old. I've obviously been out of school for some years now, and never attended college or university. For someone intending on starting an engineering degree after my 5th year of being out of school, what would any of you recommend to acclimate myself to 1, working full time+ while being in school and 2, reaching an acceptable level academically when I've not studied for 5 years? \n\nAny advice on these, as well as any additional advice would help, I know my situation isn't wholly unique, but none of my friends or peers at work went this route to get their education. If any of you can, you would be much appreciated.",

      "text": "Given you\u2019re an engineering student and you\u2019ve been out of school for 5 years, I would highly recommend that your math skills are up to par and not rusty. Assuming you\u2019re not taking any remedial classes, you\u2019re going to get thrown straight into calc 1 and presumably physics 1 as well. Both calc 1 and physics 1 assume that you\u2019ve mastered algebra and trig already, so if you\u2019re going into those classes rusty on your math skills, it\u2019s going to be a really rough time.",

It may be overwhelming since you have perspective and you will be sitting with very nervous college kids.  Everyone will look up to you even though most will be too chicken to admit it.  \nSo 1- treat school like work and have a schedule so you don\u2019t fall behind\n2- you seriously will be fine.. work experience is more than enough already. Your degree is cherry on the top. So you don\u2019t need to be magma cum laude to be successful.  Don\u2019t fail but also don\u2019t kill your self. Try to stay above average/top 30% of class I\u2019d say",

Balance everything early in the semester, find a routine for organizing and completing assignments. Schedule in time for yourself, gym, hobby, haircut, pedicure, dinner, dates, etc. For me this schedule structure balances social life, work, and school the best.",

      "text": "First - everything worth doing is worth doing poorly.  It's better to hand in an assignment if you're 75% done then take a zero.  Second - brush up on your math skills.  You absolutely can not succeed if you don't fully understand calculus, so take the time with that.  Third - the best way to study it to make sure you can solve the problems without having the solutions in front of you.  So many people make the mistake of feeling like they \"know\" a problem if they read through it and understand it.  But then when presented with a blank piece of paper for the exam, they can't remember.  Forth - go to office hours!  Most professors love to talk about their topic, this is where you can make sure you really understood the lecture content, how to solve the homework problems, etc.\n\nLastly - start all homework assignments ASAP.  This way you're thinking about them as you go about your day which makes your work more efficient and you have a sense of how long it will take you to complete so you understand how to plan your week.  So many students realize sitting down the night before an assignment is due that it's a multi-day assignment rather than a 2 hour assignment.",
