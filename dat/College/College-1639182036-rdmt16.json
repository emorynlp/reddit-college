  "title:": "FSA ID- can't update one of my parent info",
  "text": "I need my parents to sign the FAFSA with their FSA ID so I can submit it. However, when I tried to use my mom's account, I found out that the SSA couldn't verify the information with what they have on their file. So I went and update her personal information on settings, and realized that the SSN number was wrong. I put in the correct one but it won't let me save. It keeps saying \"**Failed to save changes. This form contains errors or has missing fields. Please make corrections and try again.\"**\n\nI am not sure how to proceed with this. I used multiple different browsers (Brave, Safari, Firefox) but they all keep saying the same things.",
