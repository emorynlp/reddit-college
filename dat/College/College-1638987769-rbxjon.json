  "title:": "Did I screw up a chance at an internship?",
  "text": "About 3/4 months ago I met a very successful business owner in my desired field (computer science) at my job while working at a country club. He gave me his email, we emailed back and forth, then he gave me his number and we spoke on the phone a few times but I didn\u2019t keep up. He spoke about giving me an internship once I reached my junior year of college, (I\u2019m in my freshman year). He definitely liked me though because we ended up finding out that my family is from where he is originally from, which is outside of the United States. Now I\u2019m kind of hesitant on reaching out to him because of how long it has been since we last spoke or that if I text him he probably won\u2019t even remember who I am",

      "text": "3/4 months is really recent if he was willing to wait for you to become junior and take you into an internship. I would send a friendly email updating him that you got into college and see if he responds back, the issue here is if he's actually going to keep his word and get you some business couple years later so might as well give it a try since you don't lose nothing for trying",

      "text": "In the professional world that's nothing. You could reach out to people you knew 5 or 10 years ago once you're in your career and it starts the conversation. They realize you want help looking for a job and you realize they have something you want, and as long as you weren't a jerk, every ody is usually pretty willing to help out.\n\nThis guy probably wouldn't think anything of it.",
