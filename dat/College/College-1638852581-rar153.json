  "text": "Hello! I (20F) live at home but provide 95% of my financial care and provide all necessities for myself. Right now I am in the process of a Medicaid application because I cannot keep up with my medical bills and am facing an unknown but expensive medical condition. \n\nIt\u2019s automatically putting me a dependent like I was for the 21-22 school year but is there anyway I can become an independent student? \n\nI saw the student aid report about how to determine dependent versus independent  but would maybe talking to my college solve anything or help me out? \n\nI\u2019m just not sure what to do seeing as this is all happening so suddenly and I cannot afford my university next year.",
