  "text": "Hey, second year college student, first year on campus. My school has a quarter system and we\u2019re pretty close to the end of Fall Quarter and I feel like I\u2019m so behind on everything. I keep failing my quizzes twice a week, I got a 44 on a midterm, I already dropped a class, and I don\u2019t know what else to do. I can\u2019t bring myself to keep cramming cause whatever I try I just end up failing again. I\u2019ve never had a quarter this bad in high school or college and I really need to rescue my grades (I have two Fs, a couple assignments and a final to save each). I just need to pass this quarter so I can have a mental reset. Just need some encouragement or advice to get me motivated again.",
