  "text": "I want to major in art as well as fashion design. I originally wanted to go to an art school but it\u2019s too expensive so instead I\u2019ll do two years at a cheaper non-art focused university. The university doesn\u2019t offer fashion design as a major though. If i transfer after two years, would it be too late to change to a fashion design major?",
