  "text": "I (NB19) was very drunk the other night with some friends. I\u2019m an affectionate drunk, and this guy (19) was very affectionate back and I cannot stop thinking about him. It was nothing more than friendly gestures (rubbing my head, laying on the floor together, etc), just to clarify. I am currently in a loving, long-term relationship with someone else and don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t throw the relationship away for one guy who might not be into me, but should it even be a question if I was truly in love with my current partner?\nI guess i\u2019m looking for opinions or support or similar experiences. \n\nTLDR; I think I have a crush, but I might just think that because I was drunk. Having conflicting feelings about current romantic relationship withsomeone else.",
