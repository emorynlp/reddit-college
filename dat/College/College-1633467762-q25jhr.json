  "text": "I\u2019m studying psychology and I feel so dumb. Everything about lectures so far is pretty easy and clear but that\u2019s not my concern. The point is that everyone have a ?solid?? personality like they are so well spoken, they aim for big things and they know why they are here or maybe they pretend to know but it\u2019s still more effort than me. \nI don\u2019t know what I wanna do with my life, I don\u2019t have the slightest idea, no direction I wanna go. I don\u2019t aim for anything, I don\u2019t care about anything. All of my education I had the mindset that studying things that you don\u2019t like is useless. Right now I\u2019m lacking in knowledge. My colleagues are discussing philosophy, politics, history etc. and all I talk about is memes, pop culture etc. \nI have a class that is called academic skills and we have to write a 10-14 pages of a academic work about psychology related topic. I cannot write at all, I\u2019m not creative at all. My normal writing is bad as hell, I\u2019m not able to use the academic language. \nAlso - this friday we are going to have a oxford debate and I will make such a fool of myself there. \nI just feel like I\u2019m some kind of impostor that doesn\u2019t belong there.",

      "text": "I feel the same way sometimes. Just remember that writing and thinking are skills. Maybe you and I will never be geniuses in our fields, but the more we actively put an effort into learning (and writing papers especially) the better we will become.\n\nFor me, I have to constantly review the basics of how to write an essay. Don\u2019t get down on yourself and if you feel you need some time to figure out if this is really what you want to do, take that break. Sorry this is really rambling, but I did mention I have issues writing papers.",

I want more than anything to give all my attention to school, but then everyone looks at you like hey you shouldn\u2019t be in school right now, and most of all you should be working a real job as they say. I just know there\u2019s no way I could balance the 4 classes I\u2019m committed to and a full time job. I think I\u2019m just gonna become a trucker. Finish this semester as well as possible and move on.",

      "text": "Remember, perception is not reality. I guarentee you, some of the people you are comparing yourself to feel that way as well - maybe not in the fields you mentioned, but certainly in other areas. People tend to put on a confident, collected facade because that's emotionally easier than admitting that something is wrong. It's not fair to compare yourself to others because you do not know their full situation - we never truly can - and you are also your own person with strengths and weaknesses like the rest of us. \n\nThat said, if you feel you're struggling, there are likely resources that could help. Seeking mental health care can help you practice self-compassion that can unburden you and allow you to do your best. \n\nRegular writing tutoring may also help you improve your writing. Many schools have free writing centers. Find a tutor you work well with and then attend tutoring regularly so that you can develop your writing skills. \n\nYou dont have to be the best or smartest right now (or ever, honestly). College is about growth, and it sounds like you are taking some steps to grow. Be kind to yourself along this process, figure out what you want to improve on, set your goals, and then find the resources you need to meet your goal. Learning this skill is much more valuable than being able to simply talk smartly about a subject.",
