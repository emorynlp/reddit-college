  "title:": "UPDATE: My college is getting rid of my major. I\u2019m so angry.",
  "text": "I deleted my previous post because reasons but I was informed that my university was doing away with the biology and chemistry majors to make room for the nursing program. This made me extremely concerned because I am a biology education major. I\u2019ve emailed around and reached out to directors and counselors. I\u2019ve been told at the end of this school year in May, all the classes I need will no longer be available at my campus. They will still be available at the campus that is an hour and a half drive away from me. There will be no kind of accommodations like hybrid classes or anything to help us biology and chemistry majors.\n\nSince moving is not an option for me, my options are: sacrifice even more time and money and drive 12 hours a week to go to class and labs, or switch to elementary education. Switching to elementary would mean I\u2019ve wasted money and time on biology/chemistry classes because they\u2019re too high level for elementary so they wouldn\u2019t even count towards that degree. \n\nI\u2019m distraught and all kinds of things. Words can\u2019t really describe what I feel right now though. I\u2019ve worked so hard and paid a lot of money to have the rug ripped out from under me. The university basically said \u201cfuck you and good luck.\u201d Honestly, at this point I think I should just drop out and work a low paying job till I die. Anyways, that\u2019s my update.",
