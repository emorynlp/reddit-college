  "text": "Hey guys, my professor is only giving us a few hour window to complete a test through lockdown browser but the time that my test is due, is a time that I usually don't stay home because my parents are extremely toxic and it's so hard to focus at home with classes. \n\nSo I usually go to the library to attend my classes, but my test date and time is screwing me and I was wondering if lockdown will detect my mask wearing during the test?",
