  "text": "Have anyone ever done this,I have my associates degree in business administration and getting my bachelors in accounting online.If you did this how did you do it and was you exhausted? I feel like because my classes are asynchronous and because I plan on at least getting a full time sit down job that it may be a-little bit easier.I am open to all advice even from people that didn\u2019t take this route.",

Time management is key, as you\u2019d expect, but so is learning to say no (which sucks, but you\u2019ll burn out if you don\u2019t set boundaries). \n\nMake sure you plan out time not only for your classwork, but also household chores/life management stuff. Be as efficient as possible about the small-but-important things on your to-do list, like running errands. And *sleep*. Sleep is vital.",

      "text": "Are you planning on doing school full time or part time? I just started a master's program while working full time, and it wasn't so bad, but I'm only doing one class. Next semester I plan to do 2, but I don't think I'll ever do more than 2 per semester. But that does mean that to graduate in any reasonable amount of time, I'll be going year round. So Ill be doing 10 classes over 7 or 8 semesters.\n\nIt's definitely doable though, I would just ease into it and pace yourself if possible.",
