  "text": "UPDATE: she emailed me back with \u201cnever mind I will grade your paper\u201d \u2026 so does that mean I was right and she never read it..? \n\nSo I spent all of Thanksgiving break working on a 10-page paper. I used Chicago style, which is what my professor wanted, and so I did that and used footnotes for my in-text citations. I doubt she even read my paper bc if she knew anything about how I wrote, she would know it\u2019s in my words minus my in-text citations. From what I understand, it\u2019s ok to get information from a source and change up the words to show you understand what\u2019s being said and, in my case, include a footnote after said information to show it was obtained from a source. I don\u2019t believe this is plagiarism. I\u2019m very confused as I\u2019ve never had this issue before. I responded to her email immediately, and I\u2019m still awaiting a response. Has anyone been thru something similar? If so, how did it go for you?",

      "text": "When you say you changed up the words, how so? A mistake students sometimes make is to take a sentence like \"White and his coworkers found that chocolate cake boosts mood 3 times compared to red velvet cake\" and rewrite it as something like \"White and his collaborators found that chocolate cake improves mood 3 times more than red velvet cake.\" Even though some words have been switched out with synonyms it's not really successful paraphrased and in your own words when that happens and can still raise alarm bells. (Examples here: https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/evidence/citations/incorrect)\n\nThat said, if things are cited with the appropriate source and the paper attempted to use it's own wording, even if it wasn't entirely successful then it often gets treated more generously than a paper that was just directly plagiarized with no citations.\n\nBest advice, go to the meeting and make sure you understand why the professor is concerned about plagiarism and then work from there.",

I asked my professor to meet at her earliest convenience, so hopefully I can sit down with her and understand why she thinks I plagiarized. I appreciate the response! I\u2019m so confused because I\u2019ve been writing papers like this for years at this point and never had an issue.",

Changing or switching a couple words isn\u2019t going to do much and you\u2019ll still end up with a very high similarity % even if you cite every piece of info. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is what happened or not, just explaining a possible reason for this.\n\nIf this is the case, I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal and it\u2019s something you can probably explain to your professor.",

The deterring factor of plagiarism is whether you presented someone else\u2019s ideas as your own. Assuming you did noting intentionally wrong, then be open and honest. Unintentional plagiarism would likely result in a 0 for the assignment (maybe for the course but that would be excessive).",

Also, in plagiarism their is a limit i.e. maybe 3 or 4% of your paper might be similar to published material and that is not considered as plagiarism. If you can't find a free software, then simply copy/paste 3 or 4 lines from your paper in google and see what it pops up. If it shows the original text, then maybe you have a problem.",
