  "text": "Hello guys! I am not a happy camper right now. I started a new class, and the professor is extremely strict about turning in assignments on time. The problem is, sometimes I mentally can\u2019t finish work on time. All my other professors I\u2019ve had have been extremely accommodating, but looking at the professor\u2019s syllabus, she doesn\u2019t seem like in any situation she will be reasonable, including no internet and for extreme reasons, we need documentation! So, I emailed the person who makes accommodations for me to ask to add extra time for assignments, and she says in these words \u201cBeing able to turn in late assignments is not a college accommodation.\u201d Like why? I had this in high school, and now it is taken away from me\u2026 so I sent a mean email that would most likely get me suspended or expelled, but at this point I don\u2019t care anymore. Here is the email. \u201cThen maybe college isn\u2019t for me. If you and (college) don\u2019t accommodate my needs, then I will find a different way to be successful! College is useless and you guys truly don\u2019t give a crap about your students\u2019 mental health. Too much money just to be set up for failure, college is a freakin joke. And no, I\u2019m not going to take care! I am now going to sleep for 2+ hours and eat a crap ton of junk food!\u201d I want to advocate and protest at this point! Our mental health matters, and it just makes it harder when you have a disability. Sometimes I just mentally can\u2019t handle school and it is heartbreaking that they don\u2019t care about us, especially with disabilities (I have Autism and ADHD for those wondering)",

      "text": "> The problem is, sometimes I mentally can\u2019t finish work on time  \n\nIs this officially documented with your university's office of disability services (or whatever your school calls it)?  \nIf this isn't a documented medical/mental health issue, professors are not obligated to offer accommodations on their own.  \n\nThis is the way the process works.  \nI agree that it's unfriendly.  \nBut this is the process.  \n\n> All my other professors I\u2019ve had have been extremely accommodating  \n\nIt's great that they are all nice people. But they aren't obligated to do this without official documentation.  \nPlease understand there are thousands of students at your school.  \nA huge portion of them would love to scam, scheme and otherwise abuse the system to their benefit.  \nTheir lack of integrity complicates your life. Sorry about that.  \n\n> I emailed the person who makes accommodations for me to ask to add extra time for assignments, and she says in these words \u201cBeing able to turn in late assignments is not a college accommodation.\u201d   \n\nWell, that isn't exactly how that conversation is supposed to play out.  \nYou should define your challenges / difficulties / issues, and the university should offer up suggestions on how they can accommodate your challenges.  \nIf you start the conversation off with a demand for a specific accommodation, it kinda sounds like you might be trying to manipulate the system.  \n\n\nIt's kinda like going to your doctor and saying *\"I have serious, intense pain in my head. Please help me.\"* compared to *\"I want you to give me a prescription for the strongest pain killers you have.\"*  \n\n\n> Like why? I had this in high school, and now it is taken away from me\u2026  \n\nIt wasn't taken away from you. You haven't formally requested this accommodation from this entirely new institution of learning.  \nDon't put this on the administration.  \n\n\n> so I sent a mean email that would most likely get me suspended or expelled, but at this point I don\u2019t care anymore.  \n\nTake a break. Sleep it off. Relax. Calm down.  \nThen call them or schedule an appointment to visit them tomorrow and start this conversation over, beginning with an apology for your rudeness.  \n\nYour request is a reasonable one. The way you have requested it needs to be improved.  \n\n\n> College is useless and you guys truly don\u2019t give a crap about your students\u2019 mental health.  \n\nMaybe.  \nOr, it might also be possible that your request for assistance/accommodation came across the wrong way, and you need to take a softer approach.  \n\n> Sometimes I just mentally can\u2019t handle school and it is heartbreaking that they don\u2019t care about us, especially with disabilities  \n\nDon't put all of your problems on those around you.  \nYes: You deserve an appropriate accommodation.  \nBut nobody involved in that process deserves to listen to you fling shit and hate at them either.  \n\nCoping Skills. Remember your coping skills.  \nWork WITH the institution, don't fight against them (yet).  \n\nYou are asking for something that is not the norm.  \nYou are asking for something that not everyone else receives.  \nAdvocate for yourself and explain why you need this.  \n\nDon't make demands.  \nExplain your challenges, and listen to their suggestions on how the school can help address them.  \n\nIt's a hard, cold, nasty world out there.  \nNot everyone is interested in helping you.  \nNot everyone is obligated to help you.  \n\nYour university's office of disability services is there to help offer solutions.  \nMake sure they understand your challenges.  \nWork with them, don't fight against them.  \n\n\nGood luck, and I'm sorry you are experiencing this difficulty.",
