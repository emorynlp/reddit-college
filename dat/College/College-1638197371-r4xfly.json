  "text": "If yes, I'd really like to know because I'm really struggling with this situation. Whatever happens in college, it just gets to me so much that when I come back from college to my dorm, all I think about is what went wrong and how people reacted to me. I just don't know how to stop being treated like a doormat. I just hate it. Also I don't like students in my class.",

If I let every embarrassing moment get to me I wouldn\u2019t be sitting in the university cafeteria writing you this, I would be at home in my bedroom. I recommend you try talking to new people and actually trying to get to know them. They too are probably skeptical of you and are trying to evaluate your personality and social standing.",
