  "text": "Hey guys! \n\nSo I have this roommate who's a fine person and who's very generous. He's also a heavy sleeper so I can make as much noise as I want and not disturb him. However, he's possibly the messiest person alive. Clothes, shoes, food wrappers, chip crumbs, and more litter his side of the room. Not only that, but he drinks A LOT. He usually gets fucked on the weekends, and maybe even on the weekdays. Now, as someone who likes to drink and have fun, this isn't a problem- if only he didn't piss on our carpet! Yep, you heard right, he full-on PEEEEES on our carpet. The last time it happened he assured me that he'd never done that before and that it'd be the last time. Well, it happened again last night! And guess who has to clean it up- ME! I mean, if I could just leave it there for him to clean I totally would, but if you let pee dry on the carpet you risk it staining, leaving an odor, or reaching underneath. Thank god his pissing wakes me up so I can clean it up right away. I've \"woken\" him up both times as he was peeing and all he does is make a face and goes straight back to bed. Wait, I haven't even gotten to the good part- I've recently been diagnosed with OCD! No wonder I never like being in our room! Because I suffer from contamination OCD, cleaning up his piss sends me into a frenzy because it's so fucking gross. After the first time, I was unable to sleep on the weekends without drinking Nyquil or any other substance that would numb me, because I'd have the anxiety of him coming back wasted and pissing again and me needing to clean it up. Planning to talk to my RA about it today. What sucks is he never remembers ANYTHING.",
