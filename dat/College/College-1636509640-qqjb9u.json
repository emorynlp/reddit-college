  "text": "The title says everything. My class cheated on a written test, teacher found out, put everyone the lowest grade. Problem was my team and I had the highest grade, with a lot of effort. Friday we are gonna meet to see what can the class do, and probably the teacher is going to make another harder test...\n\nDo you have any idea what could we possibly do to defend ourselves? What can we say, or show o whatever to prove we didn't cheat. I hate my classmates, I wouldn't give them my answers even if my life depended on it.",

And what evidence do you have that I 1) logged into the class chat, and 2) looked at the answers?\"",
