  "text": "i got Fs in 3 classes and a D in one that i satisfied already so Financial Aid won\u2019t cover them. it leaves me with a gpa of like 2.3. I can still get into a non competitive university tho cause i got accepted into one last month, if i was ever planning to transfer to a better school in the future so you think it\u2019d be worth it to pay to retake those classes or should i just worry about getting my grades up in university?",

      "text": "Yes. Usually community college classes will only count your highest grade so you can easily turn that class where you got a bad grade to a good grade to boost your gpa when you transfer. Remember, The cost of retaking a Community college class is nothing compared to a 4 year university.",
