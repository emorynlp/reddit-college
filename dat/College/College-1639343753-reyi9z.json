  "text": "This came up over in the Professors subreddit and I\u2019m a bit baffled. Someone had a student finish a 25 multiple choice (and one essay question) test in 26 minutes, and was trying to find out if that was a sign of cheating.\n\nSo my question to you all is: Is it that unusual to finish primarily multiple choice tests so quickly? I just had a 25 question true/false final (no idea why) and knocked it out in 3 minutes. If the test is set up so you can\u2019t go back and check your answers, there\u2019s no point in dawdling. In fact, it slows me down when it\u2019s open book since I can check my answers.\n\nI admit, I have OCD and there seems to be a compulsive aspect to my online test taking, so I probably rush because of anxiety. But I\u2019ve probably barely cracked 10 minutes on any multiple choice exam all semester. Is it really that odd?",

I'm not a professor though so I don't know how they view it.\n\nFor me though, someone who finishes an exam too quickly might not be cheating \u2014 but I do view them as overly confident. In a recent exam one of the girls finished early. Then after the exam she \"boasted\" about how easy it was. I thought that was a bit smug, I knew that many people (including me) did not feel that this was a particularly easy exam. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt though, she is a really smart person but is also very helpful to everyone (she definitely helped me many times when I was struggling with homework), maybe she just didn't realize how hard the exam was for most others.\n\nBut still, it came back to bite her. After going over the exam she realized she made a big mistake that will cost her a lot of points. Later, the results come back and more than half of the class failed the exam. I went to talk to her, she actually passed but did not get a particularly good grade. I kind of wonder whether she could've done better if she just didn't leave the \"easy\" exam early.",
