  "title:": "My mom threatened to not pay for college if she can\u2019t track me.",
  "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I needed advice. I told my mom she can\u2019t track me in college and she immediately asked me \u201cwhat are you going to be doing that I can\u2019t know about????\u201d. I have never done anything. Like seriously ANYTHING. I have no friends, have never gone to a party, haven\u2019t had a sleep over since the 9th grade, never snuck out, never been in a wreck, never underage drank without them knowing and never done anything ever. But she still tracks me on Life360. She then asked \u201cwell do you want me calling and texting you all the time?\u201d  She already does this WITH the tracking. She threatened to take my car, take my phone, and not pay for room and board (I got tuition and fees paid for). She is overly cautious of everything and the type that goes to bed at 8 pm. I\u2019m careful but she just plain out doesn\u2019t do anything ever and has no desire to ever. I know it\u2019s downtown Birmingham and it\u2019s dangerous but roommates track roommates! And friends track friends. I don\u2019t want to do anything crazy in college, I just want to be able to go out without my mommy knowing my every move. Is she being ridiculous or me?\n\nUPDATE: Wow! I am so surprised and honored so many of you cared about me and my situation to respond to me\ud83d\ude2d and I got two hugging bear awards??! I\u2019ve read about half of the comments so far and y\u2019all have suggested everything from softwares, burner phones, sucking it up, going out anyways, a heart to heart, paying for my own stuff, loans, and everything in between. And some suggesting my mother may even be right. \n\nTo clarify some things: I am 18, I will be 19 this year, I have a job but I just can\u2019t make enough to support myself yet, my DAD (who I don\u2019t think anyone has considered yet) is partially on my side, Birmingham is dangerous but my mom is especially scared bc she is not from the city. \n\nMy mother is controlling and overly cautious of everything. She is toxic but I don\u2019t believe her to be \u201cabusive\u201d (maybe that\u2019s just the language of the abused though). She also 1000% has anxiety as someone suggested. I understand why she wants to track me, I really do. But I just want to go out to eat with friends without her asking me who I am with, when we will be back, how is Sarah\u2019s mom?, and what I ate...\n\nI want more than anything to be independent. I acknowledge that I\u2019m not yet (and it kills me). I make $8.50 an hour and am trying to come up with another \u201cside hustle\u201d too. \n\nI appreciate you all. Thank you for making me not think I\u2019m crazy (for once)\ud83d\udc97",

      "text": "It is abhorrent to threaten to remove funding for college  under any circumstance. It's effectively blackmail. I'm not sure how student loans work in the US but here it's based of parental income. I did not have a choice, my parents were expected to make up the difference or I wouldn't have been able to eat. In the UK you are not allowed to take a greater loan even if you wished to. \n\nMy parents also blackmailed me, for something different, they were unhappy that I smoked weed. I did this very occasionally and was 18 at the time. They told me they wouldn't support me through university if they caught me again. I wouldn't care if I was able to take out a larger loan. That's fine, that allows me to make a choice. But I couldn't, I was stuck. Granted it was smoking weed. I cut it out mostly and eventually my parents stopped caring and we get along very well now I've been away for a year. \n\nFortunately my parents would never track me but i can assure you if they did and tried to blackmail me about that I would have cut them out of my life. I cannot understand parents that want to track their children. It's pretty disgusting imo.",

      "text": "Oof\n\n*Okay this advice only works if Mom and Dad still live together...*\n\nMom is having anxiety issues, she is hyperfixating, and her need to be constantly watching you is becoming an addiction for her. This behaviour is out of control, and she needs to talk to a therapist about her fears, anxieties, worries, and addiction to wanting to watch you constantly. And treating you, threatening you, is going to make you less safe because she is forcing you to cater to her unreasonable needs for constant connection - it will not work and she will be forcing you to leave your phone at home just to not deal with the constant anxiety Mom is having. She needs help, and she needs to know that her demands are unreasonable. \n\nWith all this in mind, there is a proposal of a compromise. Since Dad seems more reasonable, what if Dad has the Life360, with a pass code that he can use to check up on you... but also play as a bouncer to mom's anxiety. That way it is not constantly checking, and questioning. \n\nControlling behaviour is her way of trying to cope with her anxiety. Again, Mom needs therapy. You might want to talk with Dad first about this plan.... treat it like an intervention for Mom.",

It\u2019s really hard, but I found that I could use my iPad to keep my tracker on there when I was going somewhere when I didn\u2019t want them to ask questions. Both my roommates and friends had my location through another app for my phone so they made sure I was safe and knew where I was at all times.\nIt\u2019s really hard to try to be independent when you still need help. I am currently looking for jobs and made my own bank account, separate from my parents so I could deal with everything myself and have an easy transition for when I take off my tracker fully. It takes a while to break off, but you can do it over time. It also helps to get some loans, especially if you need them. Everything takes a while but eventually you\u2019ll fall into a place you need to be in; not what your parents want you to be in.",

      "text": "This sounds like the type of parent who would call the university asking to do a well-being check on their child, curse out the person on the phone for not taking their concerns \"seriously enough\", ask to speak to the supervisor to complain, and even when the supervisor tries to convince them their child is fine and likely just busy, the well-being check is conducted and the student just had their phone off to study. One parent came all the way from China because their adult (they were in grad school so NOT a child) didn't answer the phone. I'll never forget the look on the student's face. I just looked at them like all you had to do was answer the phone. I think to help you and your parent avoid all of this, a serious heart-to-heart needs to be had. I could see if you gave them any reason to be distrustful but you haven't. It could be possible they are dealing with excessive worrying (I don't want to diagnose her but sounds like they might need to talk to a professional and see if anxiety could be to blame) For her peace of mind you both need to start giving and establishing a sense of independence now. Her worst fears are based on a lot of reality, to be honest. Some students do go off to college and get buck WILD! I saw it as an undergrad and in my career. But that doesn't mean that will be your fate. Trust and communication will be very important moving forward or these will be some very miserable college years. You need to have a backup plan though because I have seen some parents do something as shiesty and conniving as stopping payments for dating someone they didn't approve, poor grades, changing majors, or the absolute worst in my opinion after their child comes out as LGBTQ. I HATE those parents the most (where is the angry face on here...insert angry %$\\^% face)  Wishing you luck on this!",

      "text": "Honestly it\u2019s her rules she is spending her money on you. There obviously isn\u2019t compromise with her. Let her track you. I think the lesson is that when people do things for you expect that there are strings attached. Try your hardest to get to a place where you don\u2019t need to get help from others (more like handouts) and be self sufficient. Look, these are crazy times. She obviously needs boundaries but as a mom I can tell you I carried my son for 9 months and am raising my child everyday putting in so much work. If something happens I want to know right away I want to go kill someone if I have to before they can hurt my baby. I can see where she\u2019s coming from as the mother and also understand from your perspective because I had crazy parents who did the same thing to me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok let me be clear.. but look at what you\u2019re getting.. free college? Her requirement is that she tracks you. What you can do is get a job and get another phone pay your own bills and leave the phone in your dorm. As long as it\u2019s just the life 360 I don\u2019t see the problem. I don\u2019t know the whole relationship or why she is like that so I can\u2019t really judge. My parents were abusive and controlling because they didn\u2019t want to get caught and liked sabotaging me. I got the if I can\u2019t track you I won\u2019t pay for college too. Look, she\u2019s not going to let go. You can try to sit down and have a boundaries discussion (RESPECTFULLY AND CALMLY) with a mediator.. but know that may be the start of many discussions. She might just not budge. She\u2019s an adult. You\u2019re now an adult and learning how the world works. One day she can\u2019t track you. What do you want to do? Do you want her to pay for college and you just turn on life 360? Or do you say no to that and go into debt or drop out? It\u2019s up to you. I\u2019m not trying to make you feel bad either.. it really is up to you what you want to do. Try your hardest in your youth to look at this with long term perspective. Breathe. Our family can get under our skin the most sometimes. I understand that. I don\u2019t know what the situation is with your mom. But you can only control yourself. Think about talking through it with her with a mediator perhaps prepare with a therapist far in advance, let her track you or you take on the payments. Breathe deep, plan and think. You\u2019re not being ridiculous and she is being a mom. Moms tend to have a hard time letting go and tend to be fiercely protective of their babies. I\u2019m a mama bear myself. She hopefully will learn boundaries eventually. Maybe buy the book boundaries and read it then suggest she reads it and tell her how you feel about this over a lunch you pay for and again come prepared and calm. It will happen eventually. There will be a time she has no control over you or ability to track you.",

I would suggest that if she doesn\u2019t budge on the subject, live with it for at least your first semester.

      "text": "ok - if I\u2019m being honest I\u2019m glad to know this was not just me. I\u2019m a bit opposite in that I\u2019ve done some crazy sh*t in college, so my parents have reason to be concerned and to want to track me. I\u2019ve been a good kid my whole life, though, and, up until college, never did anything or even wanted to try anything crazy. Even when I do, I\u2019m cautious and I talk with close friends about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve talked to my parents about it since they were raging at me about spending the night at my boyfriend\u2019s place. Out of all the things they could be raging at me about and that was what they chose. Granted, I grew up in a religious household and, while I do still hold those beliefs, I still want to do some self discovery and do some exploring in college life. Of course, you do you, and you do what makes you happy, so if that\u2019s not something you wanna do, that\u2019s totally fine. But regardless, when you go to college, you\u2019re an adult and it\u2019s about time your parents start letting up on the reigns AT LEAST a little bit. It took me a lot of talking to them before they stopped threatening me in the same way, and they still track me, but they\u2019ve let up on it. If you haven\u2019t already, I recommend sitting down with them and trying to tell them to trust you, especially since you\u2019re an adult now. Try explaining to them that, especially since it sounds to me like you\u2019ve been a good kid, to let you go out and start experiencing your life without the helicopter parent over the shoulder. Eventually, your mom isn\u2019t going to be there to supervise everything and you\u2019ll need to know how to be dependent and not lean on her. The more she can understand that now, the more it can improve your parent-child relationship and the more she can trust you, especially if you once in a while feel like you want to/can tell her some positive things about your college life. Especially since the more she does it, the more you\u2019re not gonna wanna talk to her and the more your relationship is going to be strained down the road. If there\u2019s anything you can do to try to convince her and help her understand that while she wants the best for you and is looking out for you, she\u2019s ultimately making you not wanna be as close with her, which will damage the relationship in the future. I hope this is somewhat helpful, I\u2019m still navigating some of this for myself since my parents are very overprotective just because they want what\u2019s best for me and want me to be safe, but the more I have communicated with them and asked them to respect my space and let me learn about life and adulting, the more it has benefitted our relationship and has allowed them to trust me more with my own safety.",

I use to have the same tracking issue, except by my aunt who has never been there for me. Eventually after her being even more disrespectful I deleted the app. It made no difference tho because she wasn\u2019t paying my tuition or providing me a car.",

      "text": "I am a college professor. She is the one being ridiculous. Part of the entire point of college is to finally separate yourself from your parents and learn how to become an adult without being under the rule or influence of other adults for the first time in your life. You\u2019re supposed to figure out who you are and test out independence so that you can get used to the idea of having to take care of yourself just to be sure that you can make it alone. Colleges provide things like room and board so that you can test out having to remember to go eat and having the most advantageous dwelling as possible very close to campus. Eventually you\u2019ll likely want to move off campus into an apartment and feed yourself but you\u2019ll quickly notice that it\u2019s hard to maintain apartment rent and it\u2019s harder to get to classes and the food you buy and cook yourself kind of sucks and that cooking every day for yourself isn\u2019t really all that fun.\n\nHaving your mom track you during all of this is problematic. It\u2019s not about whether you will be doing anything wrong (you probably will from time to time), but having all of your movements watched in a way that isn\u2019t passive, but active and involved. Honestly, if she ends up tracking you at college, then it may just be worth your while to leave your phone in your dorm room 100% of the time. It\u2019s really not worth having a college experience if every single thing you do is being watched by someone. And you have to not answer the phone every five seconds for your parents when you go to college. That\u2019s an unreasonable hold they have over you.\n\nA lot of parents talk about how important it is that their freedoms are respected, that they want to be able to exercise their personal freedoms without being told what to do, but this is entirely ironic given that so many parents these days are incredibly and overly involved in their children\u2019s lives in an authoritarian way. They don\u2019t realize that the authoritarian rule they have other children right now is going to cause a gut reaction in their own child\u2019s lives that will make them resist the idea of any kind of authoritarian rule for now and forever, especially the type that watches over people 24/7 or that enforces rules or tells people what drugs they can and can\u2019t do or what genders they have to be. I feel like your generation is going to be so repulsed by the idea of not being able to exercise their own freedoms after living in homes of people who control your every movement or at least watch them that you\u2019ll never agree to live in or sustain an environment like that ever again.\n\nSo, yeah, stop that crap as soon as you can because it\u2019s ridiculous and you\u2019ll be an adult. Good luck out there, fellow adult.",

Sit down with her and explain how you feel about the situation (the lack of privacy and trust, how you don\u2019t normally do anything to begin with) and come to a compromise. \n+ You\u2019ll keep Life360, but the constant texting about where you are and what you\u2019re doing needs to stop. \n+ When you leave your dorm, you\u2019ll text her when you\u2019re at school and how long you\u2019ll be unavailable. Start texting her throughout the day conversationally like \u201chey mom, I\u2019m eating lunch, just thought I\u2019d check in on you.\u201d Then you\u2019re the one doing the checking. Let her know when your phone will be off if it needs to be off. \n\nI think your mom probably has your best intentions at heart. It is a bit much to threaten taking everything else but she\u2019s looking out for you. \n\nI\u2019m 22 years old. Graduated. I have Life360. My whole family has it so that if we say \u201cI\u2019m coming home\u201d but we don\u2019t arrive home , then we have a backup to check where any of us are. We always text to say hey I\u2019m at this location or hey I\u2019m leaving this location. It\u2019s just a matter of safety. I mean, one time, my sister went to a concert out of state. She was supposed to text to let us know when she left, but she didn\u2019t. The only reason we knew she wasn\u2019t dead or anything was because Life360 showed us that she was en route home. \n\nSo I know it seems like much, but you can explain your feelings and come to some sort of compromise that will allow your mom to feel safe and for you to have some privacy.",

      "text": "Honestly, I\u2019m surprised by the number of people that are telling your that your mom is unreasonable or toxic. She\u2019s afraid something might happen to you because something is always happening to someone. Granted, she might be goin overboard, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily that she doesn\u2019t trust you. More likely, its the rest of the world that she doesn\u2019t trust.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to break it to you, but despite what a lot of people are telling you here, if you\u2019re still financially dependent on mom then you\u2019re not independent and you\u2019re essentially not an adult yet. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that your mom is right and you\u2019re wrong, but those are two things you need to acknowledge.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, I\u2019m not sure how you should approach this tbh, but I really don\u2019t think you vs mom mentality (which many people here are recommending) is the best way to go. I don\u2019t know either of you, but assuming you vs her mentality is only goin to strain the relationship.\n\nYou can try to fool your mom with some of the tips here, and you might even be successful. But if she ever finds out it certainly won\u2019t end well. What\u2019s more is that by resorting to methods like that you\u2019ll kind be proving some of her fears right\u2014 that you\u2019re not mature enough to be fully on your own.\n\nI think the best thing for you to do is have a heart-to-heart with your mom and come to some sort q compromise. Maybe you can make a point to check-in with her every so often or something like that. \n\nI want to be clear by saying again that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong by wanting to be independent, but you can\u2019t control your mom. What you can control is how you approach this point of friction. And I think that if you approach it like an adult maybe she\u2019ll start treating you like an adult.\n\nEDIT: I honestly think that the best possible compromise is her tracking you via that app for safety reasons with the mutual understanding that you're grown and you're going to do what you want. Best of luck to you both!",

Talk about first college experience ruined and trust broken. So yeah it sucks and is inconvenient but sadly I would rather have my freedom than fight my parents.",

If you really want to be independent or just a bit more freedom, it comes with paying for your own bills and having to support your own needs. That\u2019s how it is when you grow up. If you can\u2019t do it on your own yet, then it\u2019s up to them what rules they place. If that doesn\u2019t work, compromise with them.",

OP is probably a legal adult (or will be very soon), so the mom is no longer under any obligation to financially support her child. It\u2019s a sad situation, but the child kinda has to eat shit and learn to love the taste of it if they don\u2019t think they can survive without their mother\u2019s financial support.\n\nMaybe my perspective is twisted because of my own experience. My parents passed away when I was young, and I was raised by my aunt and uncle. I love them to death, but they definitely had no means to financially pay for college so I had to go into debt/pay as much as I could for my college. I would have killed to have somebody pay for my college, even if it meant following some unfair rules. Then again, I would kill to see my mother again no matter how overbearing she may be, but I guess that\u2019s another discussion (not looking for pity). \n\nI\u2019m trying my best not to judge, but I personally feel that a lot of these unrealistic responses come from people who had their college unconditionally paid for by their parents/guardians and therefore find it outrageous to think that anything to the contrary could be possible. To put it simply, they don\u2019t realize how damn lucky they were, and it\u2019s warping their expectations of reality IMO",

OP can tell her mom to suck it, but then there will be consequences (namely car and tuition), or OP can tolerate the invasiveness and spying (and learn to avoid it) and keep the car and tuition. \n\nWhatever OP does there will be consequences, and sometimes it's not always easy to make decisions and sometimes swallowing an appalling behaviour from a parent that can be mitigated by having a second phone or a location spoofer might be better than not being able to go to college/get in debt/not be able to pay tuition...",

Ofc, I only recommend this if you are a responsible adult (not a minor!) and won't be doing anything insane or risky (such as excessive drinking, sexually risky behaviors that can get you kidnapped/abused/etc). You could fool the tracker by getting a new phone, using one of the apps the other commenters recommended, or asking your mom if you can \"graduate\" to self-reporting every day by phone call. After all, college means you're learning to take on more responsibility.\n\n From what I've seen (aka, me), parents that don't let their kids fall/fly out of the nest end up having adult kids in their mid 20s living in their basements. Self-accountability is a skill that should be learned early on, in the teen years when your mind is still developing - NOT after graduating at 21-22 years old.",

No decent parent should ever threaten to ruin their child's life by pulling funding, much less over an app to track your every move. If you didn't get this app, your college education and thus scholarships would be over. What kind of parent would allow that to happen to their child? Not one that actually care about their kid's success. This tells me that they care more about owning you than they care about you becoming your own person, that they'd threaten you over something so ridiculously small. \n\nShe doesn't need to know your every move, she doesn't own you, and she shouldn't have the ability to decide for you where she thinks you should be at any given time. It's just controlling for the sake of being controlling.",

Like a heart to heart no screaming type of talk so that you can both somehow reach a middle ground.\n\nI used to fight with my mom about this a lot in the past and she told me all about her worries and I told her to just basically trust me since I'm the kid she raised and that she should know me better. \n\nA little guilt tripping did help with that lmao.\n\nWe did end up reaching a middle ground which was basically me updating her where I am each time me and my friends would move to a new place so basically i'd text her \"hey mom we're on our way to so and so place then we might go to this and that\" kinda like that and then i'd tell her i'm on my way home or if we could meet up somewhere and go home together something like that.\n\nWhat she basically told me that made me get why she was like that was because she was afraid that i'd get kidnapped or hurt or anything of the sort and she wouldn't know where to start to look for me. \n\nIdk what your relationship with your mom is like but I know how much my mom loves and cares for me and would probably go crazy if she lost me or my brother due to unfortunate circumstances so I get why she's very overprotective and your mom could probably be the same.\n\nI hope you both reach an understanding somehow.

      "text": "My 2 cents:\n\nCollege is a really important time of growth. Your number one priority should be doing the things that will help you get to the best place 5 years from now.\n\nYou have to pick your poison. You'll pay for everything you do and everything you don't do in your life. So you can let your mom track you and its annoying and makes your resent her, but you don't need to worry about your phone, car, or room and board. You could probably even ask her for some cash now and then.\n\nOr you could pull a power move, get a part time job, buy a bike, show up at her house one day and hand over your keys and your car. Tell her you would rather work at mcd part time and bike your ass around town with a cricket mobile plan than be under her thumb anymore. You could totally do this and you might feel great about it and everytime you think back on it. But it will impact your studies and thus your growth. \n\nIs it going to be worth it to risk having suboptimal outcomes from college? \"I have a low paying job and debt from paying for my own room and board but at least I was an adult for a bit.\" True but that's not what successful people do. Successful people bargain with the future. \"I'm going to eat shit now so that I can prosper later.\"\n\nSo it's up to you which way you want to go but think about the long term. When college is over, it's over. If you do well you'll have a great paying job and pay for two phone plans with no problem: one number you give your mom and leave the phone in a drawer and another is your actual one. Or you might do so poorly that you never get off of mom's phone plan. My cousin is actually like this right now at almost 27. Choose wisely.",

My go-to excuse when I wanted to go out in college was telling my mom I went to sleep and had to keep my phone on silent because my roommate complained about her calling all the time (she actually did) and I'd just leave it in my dorm and go out with friends. \n\nLooking back, that was more dangerous than if my mom wasn't tracking me because we often went to crowded clubs or frat parties and it would've been so easy to lose my friends in the throngs of people there. And not having a phone to call anyone, plus I hadn't had any of their numbers memorized even if I did have access to a phone. Parents often don't understand that when you try to micro manage and control your kid too much, you're potentially putting them in a more dangerous situation than they'd be in if you were just supportive of their agency.",

Your mom's right in a way, that being out at night can be dangerous, but there are tons of ways to make yourself safe and it seems like that's what controlling parents always overlook. In their effort to control us, they just make us not trust them with information that could come in hand to help keep us safe. \n\nHere are my tips about being out at night that my parents never taught me (which did put me in a sticky situation or two - never something I couldn't get out of thankfully): never go alone (especially as a woman), and if you do go out late with friends, have a few guy friends tag along because a larger group with guys is less likely to be harassed. Never have your headphones in (not even one, you want to be able to hear footstep patterns and/or breathing near you), look up the proper way to hold your keys while walking so you can a) open your door quickly and b) use it as a weapon if needed. And don't go to an isolated location without a trusted friend knowing where it is. Let me know if you need any more tips or just want to chat. Believe me, I know all about over-protective, nosy mothers lol and I still managed to have a tiny bit of fun during college anyways.",

I think your mom is just extremely worried about you and wants to make sure you\u2019re safe and she can find you if anything happens.

Lol my mom has my location and I still live my life as normal I go to clubs, bars, shopping, etc. You\u2019re an adult if your mom wants your location in return to paying for college don\u2019t let that stop you from living your life and meeting friends! \n\nAre you super close to home where she\u2019ll be able to drive to you?",

Based on what you said, honestly a good idea would be to have a sit down with her and just discuss about this situation and try to explain how college works, if she is super against everything, you can try to ease her into giving you more freedom by telling her that you can call her once in a morning and once in the evening and go to once in a evening after a while etc etc.\n\nObviously, you try to find ways to sneak out and do all the things as she is not going to be there and no matter how hard she tries to track you, there are going to be scenarios that she can't do that and it's gonna escalate even harder.\nSo, the way I see if the best way is to straight out talk to her, now changes might not happen immediately and you might have to be patient but always try to acknowledge her feelings and express that you understand where she is coming from and that she needs to believe that everything she has taught you until now will help you in college and thank her for paying everything and for taking care of you.\n\nJust keep explaining things to her but try to do it as gently as possible while also acknowledging her teaching, sacrifices etc. \n\nThis is just my opinion based on what you have said and it might not work 100% but I still believe that communication is key. Good luck to you !!",

          "text": "This isn\u2019t really good advice though. Honestly, I think her mom is bluffing big-time, because if she really is that afraid for her daughter that she feels the need to track her, then dropping all financial support is certainly going to put her in more danger and more risky situations. OP needs to know that her mom is definitely not OK, and making this kind of ultimatum is insane. It speaks to a great insecurity that this woman has about her daughter, which speaks to insecurity she feels about her own parenting. Opie\u2018s mom is very clearly trying to manipulate her into behaving a certain way by threatening something like this. She knows it\u2019s basically presenting her daughter with a false choice in that there is only one real option here.\n\nThat being said, OP definitely does need to work within the situation and be prepared for things to change. I would suggest to OP that you spend your first semester really trying to find a group of friends that will have your back if shit hits the fan. Because of this, I would definitely just go with the take that you should do you know when your mom is tracking you. You might also talk to the University financial Aid folks and let them know about your situation and see what would happen if she pulled support. After all, if you knew that you could likely get more financial aid to cover your costs if she pulled support like this, then you could probably more comfortably make some decisions. I\u2019m not sure it would be easy, but it might still be doable, so you should definitely explore your options, if anything just tell your mom that you don\u2019t need her financial support anymore. I would try to play along for the first term and see how things go, but just be prepared for that to not last. Finally, if there\u2019s anyone else in your family that you can talk to you about this, then I would suggest you do so. Again, I understand your mom\u2018s concerns, but what she\u2019s doing is insane. Having someone else talk with her could potentially help things, though it may also not get you anywhere. It\u2019s a complicated situation and I definitely wish OP the best.",
