  "text": "I just failed my first class at university. I\u2019m on my fifth semester and just failed my first exam. I signed up for the re-examination. Yet I don\u2019t know what to do different. I studied well, take notes and show up to all lectures. I\u2019m thinking of talking to my professor for good advice, but I feel so lost and I just don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nAny good advice to get over this feeling of being dum and lost?",

Everyone also has those few classes that just don\u2019t come naturally to them and they struggle with. \n\nMeeting your professor for office hours is a great place to start, they will help guide you through prepping for the re-exam. good luck.",
