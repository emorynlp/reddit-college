  "text": "Hello there. I'm currently finishing up my first semester of college, and I am now beginning to sign up for classes for the Spring term next year. I'm an AA degree student, and I need a Core science class this upcoming semester. I have narrowed down the choices between either an Astronomy or Earth Sciences course. I'm not great with math, so I'm leaning more towards Earth Sciences. From anyone who has taken either course, what were your impressions, and would you suggest one or the other?",

      "text": "My astronomy course had like no math. It really depends on how the professor structures it. However, whatever math one would see in astronomy would be pretty elementary. We\u2019re talking GE astronomy at a CC here, not advanced astronomical physics.\n\nEarth science wouldn\u2019t have much math, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as interesting as astronomy imo.",

          "text": "Hey, thanks for the reply. I actually was interested in Astronomy from the beginning, but I heard from a peer that they decided against it due to the math required (granted they hadn't taken the class before, but it made me nervous). But if that's not a real issue, then I'd definitely choose Astronomy.",
