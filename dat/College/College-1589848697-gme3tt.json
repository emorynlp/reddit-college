      "text": "Recently retired professor here. Can anyone explain why getting an A is so important? In the last ten years or so, it seemed like everyone expected an A, first of all, and many thought it was appropriate to ask or even insist that their B is changed. \n\nI inflated grades so much that in reality that B probably should have been a C, and most As should have been Bs.\n\nAlso, I always rounded up on my own. An 89 was an A.  How far down I  would go into the 80s depended on their overall work and any signs of improvement. \n\nBut if someone had the gall to tell me how to do my job, I was a lot less flexible.",

I had a friend go ask a professor why she got a 98 instead of a 100 on a paper, that works against you. \n\nI'm glad you got your A though!",

      "text": "Final semester in undergrad at a large state school I was assigned a paper for a class.  It seemed a fairly easy assignment from a professor that knew most of his students were checked out at this point.  It was basically to write about your plans after graduation.  I wrote a very good paper and it talked about how I had been accepted the semester before into my top choice graduate program for my course of study at a great school and went on to explain how I hoped to use what I learned to improve myself and jumpstart my career.  The professor gave me a crap grade (way below all the other work I had turned in that probably wasn't even as well written) with little to no explanation.  I ended up getting a B in the class which was the lowest grade I received in undergrad.  After a little research I found out this professor used to teach in the prestigious grad program I was accepted into and was canned.  Talk about bad luck.  I probably should have raised a stink but I let it go because I was already accepted to grad school.  I still get kind of pissed every time I think about the fact that I graduated with a 3.89 instead of a 3.9+ because of that bitter old man.",

If everything is perfect but the formatting is terrible, that's not a 90/100 -- it's a rejected paper. If everything is perfect but the citation is shoddy, that is also a rejection. I used to use numerical rubrics but students would often decide that one category wasn't worth their time, and they would neglect it because it was only worth 10% on the rubric.

It usually means that the student is close to mastery but just needs a bit more polish.

When I say 'rejection,' I'm talking about whether a shortcoming in their writing would cause it to be automatically rejected.  For example, if poor citations and formatting would cause the paper to be automatically rejected from a scientific journal, that paper cannot receive an 'A.' Or, if the the organization of the paper would get you in trouble with the PI of your lab, that paper is not an 'A.' \n\nAs I mentioned, the categories are not numerical. There is no weighting at all because complete failure in any category will sink the paper. If a student totally neglected citations or formatting, but did everything else excellently it is probably in the 60-65 range. All of the assignments are iterative, which means that students complete a few drafts along the way. If, by the the third draft, a student is still submitting a paper with zero citations, their grade is going to suffer badly. Fortunately, most students work out a lot of these problems in their revisions.\n\nAn 'A' paper is ultimately a paper that wouldn't be automatically rejected by a scientific journal. If it is good enough to stand a chance, that's an 'A.' If a paper is 'superior' in every category, that's going to be a low 'A,' probably in the 90-92 range. Excellent in all categories would be 100. If a paper were excellent in all but one category and only acceptable in another, that is going to probably end up an 88 or 89. \n\nStudents desire clear cut weighted categories in their evaluation, but one problem with that system is that it doesn't train you for success in writing in the real world. I train my students so they understand and can perform at the standard that is required in the academic and professional world. I am happy to say that many of my students have gone on to lead successful careers and have published on their own.",

This person is specifically asking about that rounding error. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t send an email to the professor for the specific reason that if the student completed the assignments on time and were engaged in class, the professor will very likely round the grade.\n\nAs far as if it hurts to ask, that is entirely dependent on the dynamic or interpersonal relationship between the professor and the student. More specifically, if there is one. Has the student gone to office hours or made any attempt to seek out the professors help in areas where the student was least proficient with the material?  If so, it likely wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask, then again, if that were the case the professor would very likely round the grade anyways.\n\nSince it is for the Capstone/Senior Project (or whatever you want to call it), the student will likely want a recommendation letter for grad school from that professor. In this case, asking for a grade change isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nTLDR; if the student has to ask for the round up, the professor is likely a tight ass who isn\u2019t going to do it no matter what.",

If you didn't miss those assignments, I think you would have a shot if you asked. If it wasn't so late in the quarter/semester, you could have asked earlier to make up some of the missed work and they might have accommodated you because the pandemic has been hard on everyone. But now it is likely too late to make up for missed work. (However, I don't know the schedule of your institution.) The combination of late request and missed assignments is a hard hole to get out of.\n\nSo, what you are left doing is just asking for a bump, which may well be answered with an e-mail saying something like \"it's not fair to the other students in the class if I only raise your grade.\" To be frank, I don't think you have grounds to request a grade bump, so I would advise just waiting to see what happens. If you are less than a percentage point from the next letter grade, I think there is a chance that they might decide to bump you up anyway.",

This subreddit\u2019s idea of grade grubbing being \u201crude and greedy\u201d is another persons idea of being proactive and just exploring all your options before those final grades go in. If it doesn\u2019t work out? Okay. If it didn\u2019t work out specifically because you asked? That\u2019s just silly. \n\nThere is no lesson to be learned from a prof who does what the op claims to do. Why? Well because the student who asked will never actually know that by asking, he screwed his chances of getting a bump. So all we have here is a professor with a backwards and slightly vindictive mindset with the power to affect the future of his students.",

This bump, however, is only reserved for the students who did not ask for one while those who did get screwed.

If the decision is close, folks who are tactful and ask can make the difference. \n\nThe idea that the student should just give up is a loser mentality.

No way to verify if it's correct at all. I had her email me a breakdown of both of my grades (two classes). I don't understand what's so difficult about putting grades in the online gradebook, as all of my other professors do. I like being able to check my grades throughout the semester and calculate what i need for a certain grade. There was one time where I could have used less than a point to go from A to A+ but it was my fault for missing the extra credit meeting. The only people demanding and threatening are people who didn't try and don't deserve the grade.",

If they show up we have volunteers who whisk them away to some panel on financial aid or whatnot, and tell them \"You can see your kid again at dinner if you decide to stay around.\" Some parents really have a problem letting go, enough so that it's a major issue keeping them out of things that aren't intended for them around move-in.",

I've never once in 25+ years of teaching changed an earned grade because some student was unhappy or wanted after-the-last-minute extra credit. I round up when it's warranted by the numbers, not when asked after the end of the semester. You get the grade you earned based on the work you submitted. If you have a 91.5 I'll round it up-- in fact, my spreadsheets do it automatically.\n\nI got one of these \"is there anything I can do\" emails last week from a student who ended up with an 84% in a class and wanted to *turn in missing work from January and February after the semester was over* in hope of getting an A. I had to write back \"The only way you could have earned an A would have been to write better essays all semester.\"",
