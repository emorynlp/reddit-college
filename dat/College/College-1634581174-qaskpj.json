  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman at the U of Oregon. I\u2019ve been here for a little over a month and I\u2019m struggling to get my feet under me. I haven\u2019t made many friends and I\u2019m a little worried bc the only friends I\u2019ve made aren\u2019t people that I feel like myself around. I\u2019m thinking about transferring schools and going to ASU in Tempe. I have a couple of friends in Phoenix and I\u2019m super familiar with the city. \n\nI\u2019m just worried that I might not like it and then I will have wasted time and money at two schools for no reason. \n\nCan anyone give me some advice or help talk me through making this decision? Thank you",

      "text": "Don't look at college as a venue for making friends. Obviously you should endeavor to make some friends or you will be bored and lonely, but that is not and never should be the point. You're there to get a degree to enable you to get a job in the field you picked. You should decide whether or not to transfer based on academics primarily, and only make an exception if you're beyond miserable.\n\nEdit to add: it's hard to tell from your post, but you may be at the point of miserable enough to make that exception. So don't take this as \"don't do it\", take this as a caution.",

All of the people in my life said \u201cthat\u2019s the way to go, you\u2019ll figure it out at college\u201d but I don\u2019t know if I can figure it out in a place where I\u2019m not happy.",

              "text": "Whoever told you \"figure it out at college\" is full of shit. I would finish this semester then take time off to figure it out. If you want something to do while figuring it out, you could stay and just work on your gen eds until you do, but you should absolutely not go beyond gen eds without knowing. But you're probably better off doing your gen eds at a cheaper community college and not university. School ain't cheap and having loans against a degree you discover you hate too late to change your major is crap. And just going to school without knowing because \"that's what you're supposed to do\" is how you get in that boat. \n\nYour school may have resources to help you figure it out as well, engage with those.",
