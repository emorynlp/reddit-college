  "text": "I am an 18 year old high-school student graduating early in January 2022. \n\nThis is my plan. I am going to find a full time job from January to June. I am going to save enough to pay for community college out of pocket. Then I will attend community college full time and work part time. As I get my associates, I will work full time and then go to school part time to get the remainder of my bachelors degree. Is this a good plan? I am willing to take strict criticism and would love ANY help and receive ANY advice I can\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "First off congratulations on graduating early! I did that as well and most certainly don't regret it - good move! Secondly, I think the first section of your plan where you go to community college full time and work part time is very smart. However, when you transfer to your bachelor's degree, you should probably continue to work part time. You would be surprised how much even a few of regular college courses eat up your time. I for one would not be able to handle the stress of college and a job if my job was full-time. One of my friends works full time and goes to school full time and she's completely insane from the work. For regular college, don't be afraid to focus on your studies - apply for loans scholarships and financial aid. Your grades and mental health will thank you!",

              "text": "If you're smart about it, you can go to college with minimal debt. FAFSA will be your friend, especially if your family falls into lower income brackets. The government wants to give as much money as they can to lower-income people who show promise in their grades (which you most likely do by graduating early). If you had good grades in high school and continue to do well in community college, you will most likely be ideal for tons of federal aid. Keep in mind that the government subsidizes colleges - they want you to go there and will help you. Additionally your college may have their own financial aid program. That means two sources of financial relief if you are willing to do some paperwork. And keep in mind scholarships - look for some within your field of study. A lot of companies give out scholarships to students within their field because they want more of those people to work for them AND they get tax breaks if they give away enough money. They have all the reason in the world to give as much money as they can to students. Apply to as many of these as you can. If you do all of the above, you should be able to get away with minimal debt. I know someone who did this, and only paid about 10K for four years. That may sound like a lot, but it's very minimal compared to most of our peers. A little bit of debt is ok, because it will be paid off shortly when you graduate, and you won't spend your life chained to your student loans.",

Two years of community college is great to get rid of the gen ed classes for cheap.\n\nYour plan looks solid but which college are you planning on transferring to? I assume your state public college? If so, then you might even be able to go to your states college for the same price/cheaper than community college.",

And with me being this knowledgeable I want to 100% skip on dorming and definitely go to an instate college. Unfortunately the only colleges around me that are instate (within 30 minute drive) are private.",

Also, I\u2019d worry less about debt. Try going to your local community college and speaking with a financial aid counselor and see your options from there. The current view on debt scares a lot of people away from college, but if you educate yourself you can use debt to your advantage.",
