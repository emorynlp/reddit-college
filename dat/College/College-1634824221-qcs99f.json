  "text": "So its time to fill out the fafsa and I am currently in my first year of college. I am still financially dependent on my parents but now this has me a bit confused. My family lives in Georgia but I moved to Pennsylvania into the University Commons next to my school (not a dorm).  Am I considered a resident of Pennsylvania? Do I need the license plate and driver's license to say Pennsylvania on it now? I haven't even applied for any kind of medical insurance because I dont know if I am considered a resident.",

      "text": "No you\u2019re not a Pennsylvania resident. You need to establish residency there which includes a drivers license and getting your car registered in PA. If you\u2019re dependent of your parents you are likely a resident of the state they\u2019re in. Also you can be a resident of a state but still be out of state for tuition purposes",

      "text": "Best thing to do is to make a quick call to your university's financial aid office.  The staff there answer this question and others like it about a thousand times per day.  My sense is that you probably don't qualify as a PA resident yet, but your college will be able to give you definitive information as to what makes a resident vs a non-resident.  Good luck.",
