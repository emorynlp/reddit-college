  "text": "So I was accepted to both pretty quickly since there rolling. I\u2019m from NJ and both were safety schools. I want to know which is better on the terms of education if these are my only options (I applied to the business school as a finance major).Alabama seems to get a better reputation then wvu but I\u2019m not sure.
