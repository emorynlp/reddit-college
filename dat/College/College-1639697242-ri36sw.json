  "text": "So as the tilte says, i fucked up,\n\nI will probaly pass 4-3 out of my 8 classes . The best grades i will get of those 4-3 classes will be C's and D's.\n\nThis is all my fault, i was lazy and unmotivated to study, i only studied in the last two weeks, i did began to understand the subjects, but it was far to late.\nI dont even know why, it was my dream to study in a collage , i worked so hard to get in , and i just threw it away, ( well made it really fucking diffcult to stay in)\n\nI skipped so much of my classes bc i coudnt get up in the morning, im so so damn dumb, i dont know what to do. In that two weeks i realised i could done far better , and i really love this major, the whole field it self, but i threw my chances . I really should just grow the fuck up finally and face my actions...\n\nHas anyone ever been in my shoes? What did u guys done?\n\nEdit: First of all , i would like to thank everyone , for all the comments. Every advice, everyone who told their experinces, it helped a lot. I Will definetly try to read everything and reply to them. I just want to thank everyone again and im really happy that i found such a great community with so many wonderfull people",

But I know people who have taken as many 9 or 10 classes in other countries. That\u2019s still a lot, and they spent the majority of their time studying. \n\nFor American students, the average is 5 (15 credits). If you\u2019ve got good time management I\u2019d recommend no more than 7 courses (21 credits). But if time management is not your strong suit, I\u2019d suggest no more than 4 courses (12 credits). It all up to the person though.",

      "text": "I was an amazing student in high school. Graduated top 10 in my class, 4.0, voted most likely to be successful. Then I got to college and everything fell apart. I still managed to pull good grades, but it was mega stressful because I suddenly didn't have any structure and had so much more to juggle. Come sophomore year, I totally stopped going to classes. Just couldn't get myself to do it. \n\nI ended up getting diagnosed with ADHD half way through my sophomore year. The psychiatrist said she sees it happen often with college kids- especially girls. Might be worth looking into. Getting diagnosed made me feel so validated that I cried. I would've never guessed that I had it, but it all suddenly made sense.\n\nThe fact that you feel terrible about yourself tells me that you're not just \"lazy\". You could have some executive dysfunction going on. A lazy person doesn't care about how they do.",

I wouldn\u2019t really recommend taking less than that if 8 classes per semester is what it takes to graduate on time. \n\nI don\u2019t know about your country, but where I live a standard BA is 3 years, so 6 semesters. In order to get your degree, which is 180 credits in total, you should study at least 30 credits per semester if you wish to graduate on time. It\u2019s especially important in my country since uni is free, but if you don\u2019t pass at least 60 credits per year you\u2019re gonna have to start paying for it, which no one wants to do. 30 credits per semester could easily add up to 10 classes per semester, which i know sounds crazy, but isn\u2019t actually that bad. I\u2019m taking 36 credits (9 classes in total) this semester, but they\u2019re all mandatory classes us 1Ls have to take. Next semester I\u2019ll only have 21 credits worth of mandatory classes so I\u2019m planning on taking 9 credits of super easy and fun classes to maybe balance the workload a bit. \n\nI recommend you do the same for the spring semester. Figure out the least amount of credits you can take per semester (if it\u2019s important for you to graduate on time) and then figure out what mandatory classes you need to take next semester. I\u2019d recommend you to take only those super important classes in your field for next semester and then spend the remaining credits on some really easy classes just to get the minimum amount of credits required.\n\nHope it made some sense and good luck studying next semester!",

I did well enough to go to a competitive school and get into a great program. \n\nOne semester of failed grades is okay. You\u2019ll be fine!

I just took 6 and I was drowning, yet in four I can\u2019t get A\u2019s across the board. There need to be balance. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself, make a plane, recover, & execute!

It\u2019s not gonna be easy at all and lots of hard work but it can be done. You also have to give up using technology, social events, and any other unnecessary things if it means it could sacrifice your grades from here on out. \n\nAlso, get your health and body in shape and exercise everyday because studying is not only mental work but requires physical stamina. Make sure your body is completely healthy (take your vitamins, eat healthy, etc.) so you aren\u2019t feeling lazy and have lots of energy to study all day.",

      "text": "Dude...I feel like you're beating yourself up and carrying way too much on your plate. I work fulltime and do 3-4 classes a semester. With part-time work I can carry 5 classes max. Even my friends who don't work AT ALL and are provided for entirely by their parents only take 6 classes. I cannot *fucking* imagine 8, like that blows my mind.\n\nHow do you even have time to breathe?? Each class is, what? 3 hours? Plus you need to study at least 3-4 hours a week per class. That's minimum 48 hours a week of straight class and studying. Plus assignments. And then for midterms and finals you're literally studying 8 different subjects at the same time. Even if you have the time, your brain is overworking because you're trying to stuff 8 different topics in your brain each week. You'd also have no downtime between classes.\n\nIt's not you. It's your schedule.",
