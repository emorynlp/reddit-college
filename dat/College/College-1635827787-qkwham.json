If you're doing it at the end of a semester it should be a non - issue if you do not sign up for classes next semester, but make sure you're not in any classes or you may have surprise Fs on your transcript if you ever decide to go back to college in the future.\n\nAlso be prepared to have to start repaying your loans if you have any. If you're not enrolled they become due and you have to start paying towards them.",
