  "text": "Sorry in advance for shit formatting, I\u2019m on mobile rn. \n\nDuring the beginning of COVID-19, I dropped out of college twice because I have a mental impairment that really affected my ability to focus on school while living through a pandemic and working. My parents were paying for my classes back then, but since i decided I wanted to transfer to the school my girlfriend is at, they didn\u2019t want to pay for my out of state tuition, which is totally fine and understandable. I brought up the idea to my parents and they were totally on board with the idea that I would pay my share of the rent with student loans. Flash forward to early August, days before we are set to move into our apartment, my parents decided that they weren\u2019t going to let me take out student loans, specifically the PLUS loan, because they didn\u2019t trust me to complete the semester and they didn\u2019t want to have to be responsible \u201cwhen I dropped out again.\u201d I not only found this disrespectful to me, but also to my girlfriend, because we had already signed the lease. After lots of screaming by me and my parents, we eventually came to a deal; they would allow me to take out enough student loans to barely pay rent each month and nothing else. As part of the agreement, they would \u201chold on\u201d to the student loan money and transfer me $500 a month for my rent. A few days ago, I decided that I was tired of being stressed all day everyday about not being able to afford groceries and whatnot, so I called my dad and I asked if we could edit the plan and take out more so that I could have enough money to pay my share of groceries and utilities. He talked to my mom about it, and now they want us to drive down and see them to talk about it this weekend. Who is in the wrong here, if anyone? My grades are better than they ever have been, and I attribute that to my wonderful girlfriend and not having the stress of a job. What can I say to them to give me my student loans?\n\nTLDR: my parents don\u2019t trust me to finish the semester even though I\u2019m doing better than I ever have, and they are refusing to allow me to take out enough student loans to live on. Can\u2019t work a job without stressing myself into flunking. What do I do?",

      "text": "I mean if they\u2019re parent PLUS loans they have all the right in the world to say no to taking the loans out. The loans are entirely in their name. They\u2019re risking their credit for the loans and you don\u2019t seem to have the best track record with school thus far. Have you taken out the loans offered in your name already? As for your remaining bills couldn\u2019t you work and pay for those things out of pocket? You\u2019re already in a privileged position as your parents are giving you $500 a month towards rent. Work and pay for your rent, utilities, and groceries yourself. And you should be able to work and go to school. If you can\u2019t then go to school less hours and work. Your parents don\u2019t need to risk their credit and take on debt for you. They\u2019re already doing you a favor. Start to take some of your life decisions into your own hands",

      "text": "If theyre entirely student loans, you don't need their permission to take them out at all. If the loans are ones that will fall on them if you drop out again (the Federal Parent Plus Loans), there's nothing you can really do towards that. \n\nYes, universities take into consideration your parents income if youre still a dependent but they are not required to pay or take out loans to help you pay\n\nIf you've already taken the loans that do not require them to cosign, then unfortunately your next step would be private loans",
