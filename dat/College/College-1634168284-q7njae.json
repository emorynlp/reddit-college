  "text": "Question for those who have applied for BDR I attended 2009-2011 The Art Institute MN. It states loans disbursed before July 1, 2017, use 1994 BDR regulations. Should I reference these regulations in the BDR app? Specifically, what should I reference in regards to these regulations? I also have old emails between advisors, financial aid, etc. I have utilized the Wayback machine for information on the school website when I attended\u2014looking for guidance on completing my BDR application against the Art Institutes. Any info is appreciated.",
