  "text": "I just have a lot of C's and few B's on my degree. One or 2 F's too. It's a program in biology. I'm also an international student so I'm held to a higher standard in the job market as well. Am I basically screwed at this point? I still have about 30 credits to complete but they can't undo this damage.",

      "text": "It would\u2019ve been better if you had avoided the Fs. Cs and Bs are relatively fine as the general goal in uni/college is to pass. If you want to continue on with graduate school you\u2019ll probably have to retake the courses that are bringing down your GPA so that you can get in to graduate school. \n\nIt\u2019s okay if you take longer to get to your goal. Sometimes the straightforward path isn\u2019t the one that we end up taking. It\u2019s okay. Just do the best that you can now. Worry about retaking classes later on.",
