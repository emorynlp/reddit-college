  "text": "So guys this is the most important question I will ever ask you guys on reddit, I need you guys to tell me straight forward because I'm really confused about this. So here's the thing in your opinion what should I go to, A community College or a 4 year collge/uni ? I have the requirements to join a 4 year but sadly I don't have the money. I hear from many people that It's way better to go to a community College first then transfer go a 4 year to finish. But I'm really worried that if I go go community College my degree would be ruined or I won't get a good education since community College always gets a bad reputation. Community College would be a very big help since It's only 10 miles away from my house. what's my smartest move here",
