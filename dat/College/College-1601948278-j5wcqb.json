  "text": "I\u2019m a senior at a private, Jesuit college in California. Every year, I take out $10K in student loans to help my parents with the burden of paying tuition. \n\nI am (was) also a National Merit Finalist. I just learned today that the University of Alabama provides full ride + dorm + stipend for up to 5 years of college for NMF. \n\nDon\u2019t know what to say. Angry at myself for not doing proper research during college application time. That UoA scholarship would\u2019ve helped my parents so much.",

      "text": "Normally I'm not a Redditor but I felt the need to reply to this post because I'm exactly the same way, except I'm a freshman. I was also a national merit finalist and instead of researching my options better, I just ignored them because I had this misconception that all the schools that offered full rides for national merit scholars were bad. instead, I just focused on my dream elite school and I applied there ED. when I got in ED, I didn't even consider other options anymore. in the summer this year, I started freaking out about how much my elite college costs, and I even reached out to UT Dallas, which is another school with an extremely generous full-tuition-plus-study-abroad-stipend. however, it was too late to be a part of their national merit scholar program.\n\nI was really angry and frustrated for a long time, but now I haven't thought about that problem for a while. I think it's important to remember that all of us take different paths in life and the imperfect ones can end up being the best because it means that you're trying to see the light and live in the best way that you can. The system is the system and if it can't forgive our mistakes, then we don't need it.",

Eventually they run out of topics, and you learn all the content.\n\nWhen I took the PSAT, there was still a dedicated grammar section which is probably my easiest subject. It was the only section where I could be 100% confident about every answer, because there are only so many grammar rules they can test. Once I took 5 or so practice grammar sections, I already learned what rules they tested for.\n\nI probably wouldn't get as high of a score on the current tests, since they significantly reduced the number of grammar questions.",
