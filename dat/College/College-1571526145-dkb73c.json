  "title:": "My roommate rarely leaves the room",
  "text": "So this is one of those complaints that really does get the response \"Suck it up, everyone gets bad roommates,\" but I'm about to lose my mind. I can generally handle roommates from hell. I'm a sophomore, I went to boarding school for 3 years and had roommates lock me out of the room for tinder hookups, hide drugs in my fridge, and was once roomed with someone who hated my guts, but I can't handle this. As it stands, I'm living in an 8x12 room with someone who hardly leaves. All of our classes are at the same times, so I can't even rely on time to myself while she's in class. She always eats in the room, either microwaving her food in her microwave, or only leaving for roughly 15 minutes to go pick it up and come back. I know the typical response is to just tune her out, but I also have ptsd and am hypervigilant and literally can't do that.\n\nHonestly, if it was just her not leaving, I'd likely be fine, but she's also very controlling of the environment in the room. She always wants the lights off and the heat on. If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within 5 minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.\n\nI'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for 6 hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.\n\nRight now, I need some advice on just getting through this semester, since I can't get a room change until after winter break.",

I get it\u2019s not your responsibility to worry about other people like that, but try to be more understanding, because it doesn\u2019t seem like her habits are anything more than petty, she might have more going on than you know, probably doesn\u2019t have any friends either; hence never leaving the room.",

      "text": "This is going to sound extremely petty, but the way I\u2019ve learned to deal with people like this is to just play the same game as them. If she wants to be a controlling shut-in bitch, then you have every single right to continue your habits as well. Keep turning the lights on. The moment she turns them off, wait a little while and turn them right back off again. Keep combatting her habits with your own and just slowly drive her insane. Eventually she\u2019s gonna explode, and that\u2019s when you suggest a compromise or ultimatum. If you\u2019re really lucky she\u2019ll get a room switch.",

Don't waste any time, put in a room change request as soon as possible. Everyone needs alone time and privacy. Just thought I would suggest this since it worked out for me. Good luck, and if anything you can always use the situation to train on your ability to handle difficult people or as an excuse to get out and do something new.",

And especially since you're a sophomore and probably already know the lay of the land, it wont be hard to get around campus and figure out where you need to go. My rent (3 bed 3 1/2 bath in student housing) is approximately $150-200 less than I would be paying for room and board at school and the place is nice as fuck!!! Unless your endgame is to become an RA, definitely consider making the switch.",

I felt like my space wasn\u2019t my own. I think the best thing is just trying to talk to your roommate. Those conversations can be difficult but I also think they\u2019re important to have no to help you on later in life. If those don\u2019t help, try getting your RA to help mediate a conversation. Even if they don\u2019t offer help in terms of fixing the situation, letting them know will help get the situation documented and might help your case if you feel like you need to move out later down the road.
