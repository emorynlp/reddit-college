  "text": "Okay so basically, I want to go into nursing, but I\u2019m failing one class first period because I can never get in on time, and i have mostly B\u2019s but that one grade brings my gpa down to like a 76, and my guidance counselor said I should go to community college for two years to get my gpa higher, and transfer.  But for some reason I just feel like shit about it because community college gets such a bad reputation and it makes me feel like a failure.  I feel like I won\u2019t even be good enough to transfer.",

      "text": "This is exactly what I\u2019m doing and it\u2019s the best option there is without a Full-Ride or just in general good scholarships. It\u2019s also less stressful i\u2019m taking 4 classes to go into nursing right now and it\u2019s breezy. Please don\u2019t put yourself in debt for an experience that isn\u2019t necessary \ud83e\udd0d. You\u2019ll be able to transfer as long as your grades are above Cs I believe. The nursing program is competitive from what I have been told so try to find yourself some new study methods in the mean time! I took this breeze semester to find methods of studying that worked for me so next year can fly by. We will be nurses. GOOD LUCK \u2661.",

Look at your uni requirements list for transfer. Read the whole thing top to bottom and once you tell those advisors you would like to transfer in 2 years they will help you pick the classes your desired school requires for a nursing transfer! I wish you best of luck and I'm so glad I could help. I felt the same way you did, but I'm managing, and you will too! Happy Friday",

      "text": "Community colleges are not for failures. They\u2019re for people who want to improve their lives by getting a good education (so everyone and anyone who wants to!). I had over a 4.0 GPA in high school, but decided to go to a cc for financial reasons. There is no shame in doing so, and in fact, it saves you a lot of money and time (time in the sense that you know what you want to major in for sure by that point; maybe you won\u2019t like nursing, so it\u2019s good to try out some classes before hand without wasting thousands of dollars). Just be sure to maintain good grades once you transfer to a 4 year university, proving that your education at the cc was comparable to what you would have gotten at a 4 year.",

Cue all of them being ready for the work force straight out of high school with good paying jobs.\n\nI\u2019m currently enrolled in community college after a poor attempt at university several years ago. Best decision I ever made. Boosted my confidence in my ability tremendously without the high price tag. Super affordable and you get credits that apply toward your bachelors for waaaaay cheaper. \n\nI am planning to transfer to university after I finish my associates and I was informed that since I put in the effort at community college I was potentially eligible for up to 30% off my tuition!! \n\nI\u2019m almost compelled to think that community college gets a bad reputation because it\u2019s cheaper which people attribute with lesser value, but really it\u2019s an excellent choice especially for general education courses which are going to tend to be pretty standard.",
