  "text": "Premeds and former Premeds of reddit. How do you guys cope with the stress of being a premed. I've been in University for 2 years now and I had to take time off due to stress and Covid, prior to that my grades were absolute shit and I hat tons of anxiety. This was my first semester of coming back and Up until the finals my grades were really good, but getting my results back I realised my grades give me max 3.6 and is really shitty since my first year was about 2.3. I studied hours upon hours and sacrificed a lot of things this semester but achieved nothing. How do you guys cope with getting shit grades and shit results even though you try really hard? TBH I just wanna kill myself cuz I feel like I've gotten nowhere and wasted 2 years of my life not getting results. Any advice is appreciated.",
