  "text": "Anyone ever walked across the stage and got their degree while technically missing a requirement? I have well over 120 credits, the requirement to graduate, but a specific class in my field I cannot pass (taken 3x so far, awaiting results of 3rd attempt) and as a result, I do not know what to do. I am in a position where I need to begin to accept and continue to look for jobs in my field not only for experience, but because I actually need to earn at this moment. I have been through a lot this semester, with a near fatal car crash (not my fault) being what essentially shut me down and has me begging for mercy.",

      "text": "Former academic advisor here \u2014\n\nI had students every single term who crossed the stage and we knew they had failed something they needed, or grades were still out and we didn\u2019t know yet.  I felt strongly that pulling the ceremonial rug out from under them was unfair and we let them walk regardless as long as they applied in good faith.  Some departments were stricter \n\nSome walked again when they finished that lost class, most had moved on with adult lives and didn\u2019t walk again even if they finished the degree.\n\nBut we never waived degree requirements and actually awarded the diploma.  I did get creative sometimes on how a requirement might be filled \u2026 it\u2019s worth a chat with your advisor or the coordinator",
