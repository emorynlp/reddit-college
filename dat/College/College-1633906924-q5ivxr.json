  "text": "So I\u2019ve been falling behind in schoolwork. Mainly because of forgetfulness, which has become a serious problem for me in the last year or so (getting tested for ADHD soon). The chem lab is a lot of work and I\u2019m behind by 2 labs. It\u2019s quite literally impossible to recover. I would take this again maybe next semester or during summer. Also, I feel as though I understand nothing in calculus. I was thinking of withdrawing and re-taking pre-calculus next semester.",
