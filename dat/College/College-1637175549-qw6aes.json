  "text": "Hey,\n\nI am currently going to university and am attempting to get out of a contract that carries over into the Spring. In order to do so, I am being told that I will lose my deposit (which I don't care as much about) but also that I am going to be charged 85% of the cost that it would take for me to live there because \"I am breaking the contract in the middle\" despite the next semester having never started. \n\nIs there anything that can be done about this or am I stuck in a dorm wanting to actively off myself because of how much I genuinely dislike being here?",

      "text": "Housing Contracts are for the entire academic year - meaning the contract is for both fall and spring semesters. So leaving between the semesters is actually halfway through the contract. If you want to know why they\u2019re written like this with such severe penalties, I can explain, but I don\u2019t think you care.\n\nReasons students are usually released from housing contracts with little to no financial penalties:\n- No longer a student in spring (ex. early graduation, withdrawing, transferring)\n- Major change in personal circumstances. For example, if a family member is sick and you need to move home to take care of them.\n- Major change in financial situation. For example, a parent lost a job and you can no longer afford on campus housing\n- Major/significant issue with your housing that cannot be fixed. This would usually be related to accommodations. For example, if you broke your leg and there\u2019s no accessible rooms available for spring. \n- New medical issues\n- internship far from campus \n\nPretty much it needs to be something that has changed in your life since you signed the contract. Something that you couldn\u2019t have predicted when you signed the contract.",
