  "text": "So I'm pretty sure I failed my class. Let me first say I 100% know its all my fault. \n\nAside from that I was recently diagnosed bipolar and went through horrible episodes that interfered with my school work. The medication I was prescribed for this has to go up in TINY increments to avoid a deadly rash called Steven Johnsons. Because of that, I'm on 50 mg; the starting therapeutic dose is 100mg. \n\nI also live in a household that I do not feel safe in (violence occurred here 2 years ago, with choking and stuff), \n\nso really my plan altogether is to put school on pause until I move out and get stabilized through medications (will take another few months to reach 100mg, though they want me at 250). Realistically the moving out will take a year - a year and a half so school will go on a signification pause.  \n\n\nBeing that I failed this semester, which I know is totally my fault, have you ever heard of someone eusccessfuly withdrawing after a deadline? Like what if I contact my psychiatrist and get a letter sent to disability services or something?",

At my school, you just have your provider fill out a medical supplement and briefly explain your circumstances and they get approved most of the time with no issues. Disability services can also do the medical supplement.",
