  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in high school now and I think it\u2019s time for me to apply for scholarships. Is there a certain place or website I need to go to so I can get one? Do they come from the college, like do I have to get a scholarship that the school is offering or can it be from anything? Also do scholarships work in community college?",

Typically the ones from the college require you to be a student there.\nI think the \u201ccollege board\u201d website should link you to some scholarships. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve looked at it.",

      "text": "Your best chance for scholarships will be from the school you are applying to. They will have a deadline for academic scholarships that all incoming first year students are considered for and you should be able to find the requirements on the college website. \n\nAdditionally, some colleges will have scholarships that incoming and attending students can apply for separately. Again, look on the college website for more info on what scholarships they offer. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest looking into local scholarships. I received a scholarship from the local electric company and my sister won a state essay contest through 4H (I think). See if local businesses, local government, or other services nearby have scholarships specifically for students from that area. They probably won\u2019t be a lot but even $500-$1000 can make a difference. \n\nPersonally, I never had any luck with the different websites. I applied to a lot of random scholarships but never got anywhere. I also did not have significant demonstrated financial need which many of them required.",
