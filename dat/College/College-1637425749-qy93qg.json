Junior and Senior year I pulled myself together and managed to string As together somehow.\n\nI graduated this year and was admitted into a really good master's program.

      "text": "Everyone is different but it isn't uncommon for freshman to have a lower GPA than their other years like sophomore and so on. Some people are like that and others are able to get higher grades all throughout. I got really good grades freshman and sophomore year but I'm toning it back for my last (technically 3 years) years of college because I'm doing other stuff that makes me happy. But many people improve with time!",
