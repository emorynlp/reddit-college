  "text": "i got a message from one of my old professors asking if i would be interested in being a teaching assistant for their class. i think it would be cool to do and of course it would look good on a resume/cv, but what are all the responsibilities that come with being a teaching assistant? (and yes, i messaged the professor and asked them the same thing)",

      "text": "I have office hours once a week, answer questions in class, assist with academics in general and acclimation to college, help with lesson planning, and grading tests. All in all I like it and hate it. I've had students ask, and even hunt me down, to ask questions outside of my allotted hours. Some students just complain to me about their grade and want me to change it not understanding I don't have the power to do that. Along with emails everyday and having them expect me to answer within minutes. It has upsides like being able to solidify my knowledge in the basics helping me in my upper level classes and experience teaching others. I also enjoy seeing students improve and understand the concepts.",

      "text": "So I\u2019ve never been a TA but I have utilized them SO MUCH. My TAs (saviors) sat through class and helped answer questions/help with in class assignments, have office hours to help students outside of class, and host review sessions for exams! \n\nSome of my TAs help the professor grade assignments also",
