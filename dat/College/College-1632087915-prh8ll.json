How do so many students juggle a full course load and part-time, let alone full-time work? I genuinely don't know how y'all do it-- this feels impossible :(",

It sucks you can\u2019t fully focus on school, so at least for me that means lower grades than I would like but they\u2019re still A\u2019s/B\u2019s. Also don\u2019t be afraid to call into work every now and again so you can catch up. Another big tip is nail down your time management so you get at least 1 day off a week from school/work, and please don\u2019t forget to hang out with friends. Socializing is so important for your mental health! Good luck you got this! It may not be fun or easy, but it\u2019s doable.",

      "text": "Hey, Im a pharmacy technician at a hospital and I work an average of 16-24 hours a week. The trick is to either work an early morning shift and study afterwards, or work evenings and wake up early to study. When I worked 6-2:30 or 7-3:30 I work study afterwards or when I had evenings 1:30-10:00 or 2:30-11 I would wake up early to study for a few hours before going to work then I come home and sleep.\n\nI have at least three days I do not go to work, Monday tuesday, and thursday. It is important to have a day you don't do school or work, which for me is monday. Monday is my mega study day.\n\nIm a biomajor and prepharmacy, I need to get off this damn reddit every 20 mins because I have an exam tomorow",

I just hope that I don't bomb any exams. I totally feel more motivated now but I hope my first exams don't bring down my grades so much that its hard to bring it back up again;",

When I was a freshman and didn't have a job yet I got a C on an exam and my relationship with my mom was just downhill from there. One time she even threatened to not pay for tuition which lead to me paying for everything myself so I would never experience something like that again. Its not a bad idea for me to take a gap year but not because my mom is grounding me from school pretty much",
