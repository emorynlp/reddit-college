      "text": "Definitely plan on handling a lighter workload after an exam. Your mind is going to obviously be exhausted so theres no point trying to push it because you'll only damage your psych.\n\nI generally do any easy assignments, readings, or just chillax a few hours at least before moving to the next major task; sometimes resting the rest of the day depending on the exam. This let's me refresh my mind without going crazy. Working out, playing video games, or doing any hobbies is a good way to cool down. Sleep is also important in this regard because it will constantly keep you fresh to tackle on anything that comes your way. \n\nI also find it helpful to sometimes spend a day or two to not even think about school. Yeah, this might come off as procrastination, but when dealing with 16 weeks of this constant barrage of college it will make a difference in the long run. There's nothing wrong with always focusing on school, however, this is a marathon and not a sprint. I'm guilty of breaking this rule since I constantly have something to do and I find myself tiring out by week 7 or 8 if I dont take time to relax like I should.\n\nIt's normal to get stressed out, sometimes you can get stumped, sometimes you might take an L on an assignment or test, etc. Just figure out the best way that works for you so you can bounce back.

      "text": "Source: Undergrad currently in his third year w/ an internship.\n\nFirst, pat yourself on the back, you're halfway there! Second, take a breather; most classes I've seen (with a few exceptions) usually take it easy for 1 day or two. Find a day to just recover: stay in bed for most of the day, order takeout, watch some funny shit, take a nice hot shower, etc. I wouldn't recommend going out or partying, just try to be as immobile as possible. Don't be afraid to tell yourself that its okay to take a break, the alternative is burning out and that's harder to recover from.\n\nA call to family can also be a good energizer; I have a cousin and my mother that I talk with when I can. Not every week but once in a while. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also found that compartmentalizing my life just made it more bearable; especially regarding time.\n\nDon't look at the syllabus and try to plan everything for the next month, focus on the immediate so you don't get lost or feel swamped. You can keep certain dates in mind but don't fret over them until you get closer to them. The reality is, you will have some bumps in the road - and also some shortcuts as well!\n\nWith college, the \"immediate\" most likely translates to a week by week basis (with some exceptions).\n\nDon't be afraid to space things out or set small goals. I just got out of midterm week and had a 10 page paper due the beginning of this week and a 1 page proposal as well. So I divided up my paper telling myself to do 2 pages a night. I started Sunday night of last week and so I gave myself \\~8 days to accomplish this. One day I made great progress and got 4 pages done and one day I ended up not doing anything while another day I only managed 1 page. \n\nAnd that's another thing, be sure to give yourself some leeway. Referring to the previous example, I could've started 5 days before the deadline but instead I gave myself 3 days extra in-case of anything unexpected. Its much easier to tell yourself you have to write 2 pages today, instead of 5. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I don't endorse this, it can be helpful: sometimes its okay to skip out on smaller readings assigned from other classes (unless you got one of those professors that make you answer questions from daily readings). Just be sure to be be really attentive when taking notes that day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, you have a lot more time than you think. It is doable, don't think it isn't. \n\nBest of luck and I hope all goes well.",

It wasn't easy, but after multiple tries of not wanting to study, something clicked in my mind, and I eventually got the hang of it. \n\nObviously, scores are important, and if I think my scores are not up to what I expected, I would plan it out by writing down how many points I require to meet the goal. For some reason, doing this makes me calm myself down before the next test.",

I follow a routine though, I workout twice a week (for 1 hr each session), and the night before exams I study up until about 30 minutes before bed, at which time I do something else for 30 mins to relax my brain. I make sure I get at least 6-7 hours of sleep the night before a test and I wake up early the day of the test to eat a good bfast and review notes up until the professor says it's time to take the test. After the test, if I don't have any other assignments to work on, I'll go home and do whatever I want for the rest of the day.\n\nI go to school every day (M-F) so rest is on my agenda every Friday afternoon.",

Waking up just an hour earlier and just relaxing since you arent late gives you time to gather your thoughts and it definitely helped me.
