  "title:": "College Students can apply for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and get weekly checks (I did this as a dependant)",
  "text": "Applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) because my mom found an article saying there's a box to check for people who had a job lined up but was canceled due to the pandemic. I count as a dependent under my parents, didn't lie on any of the questions, and am now set to get $189 a week! I have a friend whose working part time and also will be getting free money, which lasts until December 31st. \n\nIf you file soon enough, you may be able to catch the last week of FEUC checks ($600) which end on the 25th. If you fill out the PUA application you are automatically considered for it. \n\nWish I applied for this sooner but hey, college students can get financial assistance as well!\n\nEdit: Smart people are pointing out a bunch of important notes in the comments\n\n1. States will soon be requiring proof of a cancelled job and may investigate those who can't provide proof.\n\n2. This income is taxed, so keep that in mind\n\n3. States will soon require proof of actively looking for jobs (I'm waiting to start an internship so I will be going off pua eventually)\n\n4. You need to apply for regular unemployment and get denied before applying for PUA\n\n5. Don't commit unemployment fraud",

I also think it's rare though that normal broke college students are getting the opportunity to receive government aid at this level. The rest of the time you hear about churches, Wall Street, and labor unions screwing the taxpayers over on a huge scale. Think 2008 financial crisis. I guess I don't feel the same amount of outrage when it's the taxpayers getting a break instead of the 1 percent of the 1 percent. \n\nPersonally, I have documentation of an internship that was going to pay me a total of 8k after taxes for the summer that was cancelled because of the pandemic. I'm also going to hopefully start a job in a month that pays 11/hour that will stop my PUA from coming in.",

It is unfortunate that your internship was canceled because of things out of your control, I too have had an important opportunity canceled as a direct result of the pandemic. I would like to acknowledge the point you made when you said that people are not feeling outrage this time around because the tax payers are getting a break as well. On the surface level this is a valid point. But if you unpack this idea, you may see my point of view. Handouts of any kind are coming directly from the taxpayer, we are getting nothing for free here.\n\nThe idea that the tax payer is getting a \"bailout\" from the government is flawed. Government spending of any kind is future taxation, they are loaning us money that will have to be paid back in the future.",

I legit have to take out a 3K student loan now that I didn\u2019t need before. I had 4K saved aside for college now I only have 1K.  I actually loved the company and worked at a previous chain before so it just sucks to take a genuinely enjoyable job away from me because I was doing the right thing, and since I was fired I don\u2019t think I can even get hired at a different store he doesn\u2019t manage.",

The summer jobs are where i build my savings, but i guess i\u2019m just gonna live on the edge until next summer since financial aid is my main income lol.",

The PEUC extension provides an additional 13 weeks of UI benefits. If the EDD determines that you are not eligible for a subsequent valid UI claim, then the EDD will automatically file a PEUC extension on your last valid regular UI claim. You should receive a notice by mail within the next 10-14 business days.
