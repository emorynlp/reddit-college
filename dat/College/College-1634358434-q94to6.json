  "text": "So I decided that I was going to switch over to CIS since Computer Science was a major I was not interested nor understood the topic. Because of this, I dropped my Coding class since it wouldn\u2019t count for anything. I then had two classes which was calculus 1 and BUS 102. The BUS class was my free elective for the CS major and unfortunately wouldn\u2019t count for the CIS Major. \nMy counselor advisor told me to send an email to the chairman for the CIS Major and asked if possible, that I could waived the BUS class as a Gen Ed class. Just tonight, I got a response. He told me that they\u2019re not allowed to do that. I was quite disappointed since I spent my effort for nothing. However I realize I would have to drop this course. I already have one W for the coding class and I don\u2019t know if another W would look bad on my record.",

      "text": "I dont think you should have withdrawn from the first class and definitely shouldn't for this one, unless they are going to result in you failing the course. Just because you changed directions mid semester doesn't mean you should just drop the course, especially since you can't add another course in place of it.",
