  "text": "I'm majoring in psych at a cc. I was planning transferring to a 4yr to then study Rec Therapy. I'm kinda stuck though. I'm interested in SW too. My cc has a pre-social work program and I'm tempted to change majors. \n\ni really dont know what i want to do now. Can you give me some insight on why you want to go into either?",

      "text": "This can be kind of a loaded answer, what is your end game for a career?\n\nFor me I chose psychology because it pairs extremely well with my other major and allows me to go into a large amount of different fields. I can go to law school, be a therapist, work in probation, become a LEO etc. \n\nIn my area, the majority of open social work positions have now extended their qualifications to sociology & psychology. With this I would be able to work with just a BA in psych, if I wanted to. \n\nIf you want to go the therapist route I would do social work and then get a MSW. It allows you to practice as a therapist with less schooling, but with that the pay is also lower for the same amount of work someone with a PsyD would have.",
