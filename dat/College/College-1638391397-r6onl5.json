  "text": "I'm working on a research paper in my English 101 class and I'm struggling to get to the required word count on my first draft. My sister has advised me that you don't necessarily have to have the required word count on the draft, but you do on the final. I didn't know if this was like a \\~thing\\~? This is my first year of college and my English class is pretty different from my High School English classes.\n\nAlso, on the first draft assignment, there is nothing stating a required word count-- however, on the final assignment, it says the paper has to be 2000 words.",
