  "text": "So I'm relatively new to drinking at parties and some of my friends say that I shouldn't drink from already opened bottles of liquor because they might be spiked. I mean I totally understand the importance of pouring your own drinks and not leaving them unattended, but to not even drink the provided alcohol seems a little paranoid.\n\nI mean I do pregame but I metabolize alcohol fast so I often want more shots later on in the night\n\nLike if I was a rapist trying to roofie someone, it doesn't make sense to drug an entire bottle of Smirnoff. I wouldn't know who's drinking it (no target), and it would take much more of the drug to reach a concentration that would affect someone.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you drink the alcohol provided at parties?",

      "text": "I never heard of that but it\u2019s not impossible? I do think it\u2019s much more likely for a drink to be spiked on an individual basis (you leaving in unattended or not paying attention). I always drank from provided liquors and didn\u2019t have issues, but I don\u2019t know about everyone else\u2019s experience in the partying world. If you\u2019re worried about it just byob or drink beer.",

      "text": "Yes, but I am a dude who is tall and large enough that I am not really too worried about being taken advantage of. Not to say that it won't affect me, as I have definitely gotten my ass kicked by a roofie before (it was not intended for me though so I like to think I saved someone that night). With that said,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) The buddy system never hurt. Always make sure you are bringing a friend along that is looking out for you, and vice versa. Ideally it should be more, but at the very least 1 friend. And if you lose track of them at any point, that mfer should be on speed dial unless you know they are with someone you trust to be in their company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) I would not worry about anyone spiking the hard liquor too much. WITH THAT SAID, I would also like to recommend what a previous commenter said about using common sense. There is definitely such a thing as reading the room. Trust your instincts, if something seems fucked there, its not worth it. There have definitely been parties where I was out in less than 10 minutes because I could tell something funky was going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Don't accept mixed drinks from someone you just met, especially if it does not taste like alcohol. That stuff is DANGEROUS in more than 1 way.",
