      "text": "If you're having horrible grades due to medical issues you might be able to get an excused withdrawal from your classes, which is like withdrawing but looks infinitely better on your transcript (it basically says you're not at fault for withdrawing from the classes, something external was going on that made you drop). As far as I know it won't affect your GPA either. I would go ask the front desk at your uni what you need to do to get an excused withdrawal from your classes due to a medical reason and then go to the appropriate department for that.",
