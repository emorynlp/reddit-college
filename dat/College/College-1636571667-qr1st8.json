  "text": "This is my 3rd year in college and I was excited to get back after COVID and online school. That excitement wore off and I realized I was just ready to leave my parents' house. I've been online since halfway through freshman year and I hadn't declared a major by then and I didn't feel any strong attachment to the classes I waa taking online. So I'm still \"undecided\" and taking gen eds. I failed all of them last semester, because mentally, things got pretty bad for me. Once I got back on campus, this semester, I started off really well. I was going to class daily (on time), completing all of my assignments, and even had pretty good relationships with my professors. \n\nOne day, I just stopped showing up and it's been about a month and a half since I've been to class. I stopped talking to my professors and even begin lying to my parents saying I was going to class/doing assignments regularly. \n\nI had a visit from the Residence Director, who was checking on me to ensure I was okay. I have anxiety that he's going to come back and something bad will happen or I'll get in trouble for skipping class.\n\nIf I drop out, I'll live with a friend until I can find a job and can afford an apartment. I want to save up for a car and some recording equipment so I can persue music full time. \n\nWhat do I do?",

      "text": "I\u2019ve gone through something similar two years in a row. The first year I just withdrew and took a medical leave of absence. That\u2019s what I would recommend doing first. Just a leave of absence. It gives you some time to figure out what you really want to do. It\u2019s easier to come back from a leave of absence than it is from just dropping out.",
