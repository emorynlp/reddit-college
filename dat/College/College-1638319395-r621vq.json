  "text": "Its my first year and I didn't want to see a counselor for classes bc I was too nervous, so my first semester i chose my classes based on a list of requirements for my major but now I cant find any classes so I have to see a counselor. I'm rlly dreading it bc even in highschool I ddnt rlly see one,, if anyone can share just the basics of what happens when you go to get an education plan or when you go to see a counselor, itd be a real help.",

They look on whatever system the school has and see your requirements and what you need to do next and then make class recommendations or find substitutes on campus or off campus if there are no available classes.
