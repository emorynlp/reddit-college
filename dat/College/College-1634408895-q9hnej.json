  "text": "Hi everyone! If you're a newer psychology student then you may have heard about Research Assistant (RA) positions but may not know exactly what is involved. I recently finished my psychology degree and started grad school in counselling psychology, and I think the RA positions that I did were really beneficial for me.\n\nAn RA position can be one way of gaining valuable experience and skills in the psychology field that will transfer to other careers in the future. If you're thinking of graduate school, some research experience is generally required and an RA position can be a great way to get that experience.\n\nIf you're thinking of an academic path in psychology, then I recommend getting involved in research as soon as you can! Being an RA will allow you to see exactly how research is done in a specific field of psychology (depending on the psychology lab that you get involved with) and help you figure out what you might want to research if you decide to pursue grad school.\n\nIf you're looking for more information on Research Assistant positions, I created a short video where I talk more about my experiences and advice on what you can expect, how to get involved, and how to make the most of your experience!
