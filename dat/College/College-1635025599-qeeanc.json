  "text": "So my mother lost my records and the ones we received showed I'm missing many vaccines. Last time I got any was six years ago and I'm stressed as I need the records for my next semester. Does anyone know I way I can communicate this to my school? I don't even have a doctor and that's required to, I haven't had one in ten years.",

Individuals can opt out of this database, but you would probably remember doing that unless your parents opted you out. \n\n\nAlso the state recommendations for college students varies greatly from K 12 requirements. Check state Dept of Health.  Most college students 18 and older only need five vaccinations, not 72.\n\nDoctor/Primary Care Physician is not required. \n\n~Another AV parent\n\nAdded: READ Section 7.0.0\n\n[Delaware statutes ](https://regulations.delaware.gov/AdminCode/title16/Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Social%20Services/Division%20of%20Public%20Health/Health%20Promotion%20and%20Disease%20Prevention/4202.shtml)\n\nYou only need to upload evidence of measles mumps and rubella vaccination or immunity. No other vaccinations are required for post secondary college students, in Delaware.",
