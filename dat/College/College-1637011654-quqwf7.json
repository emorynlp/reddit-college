  "text": "I\u2019ve switched Colleges and I have to retake a class because the credit doesn\u2019t transfer. I\u2019ve looked over the syllabus and it seems to be the same material. I have had some previous classes offer the final at the beginning of the semester and that be your grade for the semester. Would it be inappropriate to study up over winter break and asking the professor if this is an option?",
