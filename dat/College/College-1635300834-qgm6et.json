  "text": "When I think about it, to transfer to a lot of these top universities, you only need a 3.5+ GPA from any community college; no extracurriculars.",

      "text": "Because when youre transferring from a college youve demonstrated that you can handle college work. High school students are a gamble. I had perfect grades in high school and took like 7 AP classes, I still failed out (Im back in now). A shocking number of freshmen end up dropping out, transfer students dont drop out at anywhere near the same rate. It looks bad on colleges when people dont finish their degree",

      "text": "Accepting freshman is a risk for colleges, because it is not really known if they will complete the 4+ years to graduate. Transfer students are a better investment given that they already have proven they can succeed in a college environment, thus are more likely to finish and keep up the retention and graduation rates.\n\nCompetitive programs are still competitive however.",
