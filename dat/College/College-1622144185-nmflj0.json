  "text": "The title pretty much says it all. My friend group has pretty much crumbled away over the course of the pandemic and this past school year of exclusively online STEM classes at community College has left me feeling emotionally exhausted still. Now with about 2.5 months until I start university I'm scared I no longer know how to talk to people and won't get near the experience I've been craving since high school. I just want to know that I'm not alone in these feelings and that there will be others like me after the events that have taken place over the pandemic.",

      "text": "Super late comment but here goes: I was in high-school until 10th grade. After that for the next two years I switched to home-schooling (for a bunch of external, valid reasons). I loved school before that, had friends and a social life etc etc. But those two years, 11th and 12th? Completely isolated, lost most of my friends, spent all my time alone, etc. (This was all pre-pandemic). I was worried of the exact same thing (although of course my isolation was brought on by different circumstances), but then I went to college and although there was the initial rough adjustment, slight homesickness etc, I adjusted to the high level of socialization with a speed that surprised even myself, and by like week two I was insanely happy and making so many great friends. I'm a rising junior now and have the most fulfilling social life in college I could possibly want, and I don't think those two years in isolation ended up affecting me after all, long term. :)",

The way I talk to people is through seeing them in the same class as me, and even then it takes a while for that to happen.  Just take it slow and be yourself. It'll work out.",

Everyone has been isolated for a long time, and they are in the immediate rush into making up for lost time. I see it completely opposite. It will NEVER be easier to mingle and create social groups.   \n\n\nFirst thing you should do is join a student organization either related to your major or maybe one of those student orgs where the whole purpose is to build a network. Do that ASAP.  \n\n\nThe experience hasn't gone anywhere. It all boils down to what you can make of it.",

I'd advise (and this applies to me too) to give yourself a long break from the internet, maybe even run a petition to have a \"internet-less day\" with some or any of your buddies. It can really destroy you as a person, I feel. The thing is is that it's extremely difficult to do this when your entire life revolves around the internet. I certainly have not been able to do it. It's very tough going. You're hardly alone, a lot of people I've met feel this way. I think it would actually be good to talk to some of your contacts about it and set some goals to meet. If you think of it like a fitness project, you should get better.",

We had been having online classes for months prior so that made it even more awkward because we knew each other but we didn't at the same time. It takes practice to recognise people in masks too but it's all a matter of time. I only started hanging out a little more with people about a week or so ago and I feel my speech flowing better than before. It seems like everyone misses social contact so we're all happy to gather and simply chat a bit even if the circumstances don't allow further events.",
