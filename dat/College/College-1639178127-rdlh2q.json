If it does, I wouldn't worry (medically). Get some rest. You wont be able to study effectively if y9u push yourself too hard while sick.\n\nRight now though, email your professors and your school probably has some kind of covid helpline? Talk to them. And get tested for covid. They wont want you on campus with covid and should have some grace, may be able to delay your exams for you.",
