          "text": "What classes are you taking other than those courses. A&P is most memorization and at first it didn't seem to difficult but once I hit the bones section, muscle section and nervous system things wen tfrom 0-100 real quick. Make sure you study for that classes almost everyday because this is a really hard class to cram for.\n\nFor biochem, make sure you also study the information everyday because if your professor is like mine he/she/they may ask application based questions and not the ones that regurgitate the lecture. Even if its open note if you already don't have a solid understanding of the information you won't be able to answer the questions. Another professor at my school was actually just memorize the powerpoint and then answer the questions but students complained they didn't learn anything. Biochemistry is generaly easier than organic chemistry but your professor can make or break the class.\n\nJust make sure you use rate my professors so you don't sign up for anybody insane. And try not to work too many hours if you can afford it. Also, try and find a good study group or  in those classes because you will learn the information faster going over it with other people rather than just going at it alone. I wish I did this more for my biochem class or else maybe I would have done better.\n\nAlso, try and plan ahead what hw is due and exams because I had a few nightmare weeks where I had 4-5 exams within the same week or 2 exams the same day and there is no way you can cram for those. If you study ahead of time it will lessen the blow and lower your chances of burnout",

I\u2019ve been sleeping in and staying inside. Bought a book everyone\u2019s been telling me to read lately. Life is good again.",
