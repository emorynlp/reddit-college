  "text": "I\u2019ve struggled a lot in one of my classes and have a D in the course. I prepared so hard for this final because the professor said it would cumulative but it turns out it only covered the most recent 3/13 chapters covered in the class, which I didn\u2019t prioritize since they were recent. \n\nI know I bombed the exam and now I\u2019m worried it could drop me below a D. I\u2019m supposed to walk at graduation next week and I have a job lined up with my dream company starting next month that\u2019s contingent upon graduating. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do I\u2019ve tried emailed my professor and he never responds to any of them. I\u2019m panicking because I have family coming in from out of state too.",

      "text": "u/PersephoneIsNotHere may have a better perspective on this as a professor, but I suspect the fact that the professor told you the exam was cumulative means you have a strong case for some sort of appeal. Therefore, I advise the following:\n\nIf you can, maybe go to the professor's office hours. Tell them that you thought the exam would cover all 13 chapters and you studied under that assumption, and you are worried that your final grade will suffer as a result. If you have any evidence of what he said, present it. Ask them if there is anything you can do to boost your grade (for example, take a TRULY cumulative exam). If you can't do anything, maybe ask them if THEY can do something.\n\nIf the professor won't help, go to the department chair. As with the professor, tell the chair that the professor told you the exam was cumulative and you studied under that assumption. \n\nSometimes, part of being an adult is advocating for yourself. It's recognizing when someone gives you bad information that is harmful to you, and taking action where legal & possible to mitigate the harm.",

I\u2019ve sent him multiple emails and the only times I\u2019ve gotten a response was when it was concerning a death in my family, and when I followed up multiple times. \n\nHe\u2019s also cancelled multiple classes last minute this semester, has assigned additional research papers not covered in the syllabus, and has not uploaded a single grade the whole semester. The only indicators he\u2019s given us of our standing in the class is verbally telling us 2 of our exam grades. \n\nTo top it all off this professor is also the head of the department and would be handing me my diploma at graduation so he could know I won\u2019t pass his class and then still act like I\u2019m graduating. \n\nSorry for the wall of text I\u2019m just ranting it\u2019s been a long 4 years and it seems like it\u2019s ending in the worst way imaginable.",

I know for some places a D is considered satisfactory.  I had several friends at my university get a satisfactory instead of a D and they counted the credit. Another option might be walked at graduation and retaking the class in the summer. Some colleges will let you walk and participate in graduation as long as you complete the required class or classes in the summer. I would check with an advisor",

I'm in a somewhat similar boat because I'm supposed to graduate my CC in two days and I've been accepted as a transfer ready to start with my new school next spring, and my CC just informed me I need to register for another semester. I don't know if this is a fuck up by my advisor or what it is, but I'm freaking out too. I guess you should contact your professor and see if you can get a pass/no pass mark instead of a grade. I think your situation is extreme enough that maybe they'll take mercy and allow you to graduate, especially because it happened over misinformation. Good luck, man.",
