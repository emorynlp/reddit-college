  "text": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m becoming an RA mid year which will be a challenge. I have to plan 10 programs with a 40 dollar budget. I also have to collaborate with some on campus organizations. \nAs a resident, what events do you like the best? It\u2019ll be for not only my building but everyone who lives on campus. \nAs an RA do you have any program ideas and ways to collaborate with on campus organizations? \nAny advice welcome!\nThank you so much for any help!",

      "text": "This is my 3rd year as an RA at a fairly small school. As far as collaborating with on campus offices I have a few I like to work with that I'll list below. The nice thing is once you email them they'll do a lot of the work for you when it comes to setting up the program. \n\n1) Campus Police: They usually do the drunk goggles which gets a lot of people. I had a coworker who did an active shooter training that set the record for program attendance. \n\n2) Health Center: Therapy dogs are always a popular program. Free condoms to give out at the front desk.\n\n3) Tutoring Center: Have a study night with the tutors available to help students (this one is tricky to coordinate but if done right its good).\n\nAt my school if you email any department they'll have some sort of bulletin board materials they can send you to hang up too which is nice. When in doubt residents will show up to programs with good food.",
