  "title:": "Would it look really bad if I took the spring semester off given my record?",
  "text": "I go to school in Canada and all the big Ontario schools have announced that they're transitioning to remote school for January, with one of them (Queens) having announced that they're doing remote education until the end of February. Luckily I don't live in Ontario (I'm in BC) but things really aren't looking good and I'm really worried that this is going to happen here as much as I would hate it. I have one semester left and I'm supposed to graduate this April. I did all of school last year online and it broke me and I just can't do it again, especially for my last semester of undergrad. I just think it's cruel for me to have busted my ass to get into a good school that ranks high just for everything to be online. I want my last semester of undergrad to be in person and I just refuse to do it online. That's not what I wanted college to be.\n\nThe problem is, I want to go to either law or grad school (most likely law) after I finish undergrad (after a year of working, traveling, and studying for the admission test) and I'm worried that taking a semester off this late would look bad on my transcript. I've been in undergrad since September 2015 (switched uni's and programs) and I took a semester off before transferring to my current school to go traveling so I've already taken time off. Even if they did find it kind of unattractive to take another semester off I doubt they'd care if my grades were good enough, and for the most part they're quite good (I was dean's listed last year and will likely get high grades again this year barring any surprises) but my grades in my earlier years do bring down my TGPA (my overall grade % from both schools is somewhere around 77% or so?). I know most schools tend to look at later years but just the cumulation of some shotty terms, taking a semester off twice, and taking a long time to graduate makes me worried that I'll have a harder time getting into law or grad school.",

If you were a mentally well person I'm very, very doubtful you would be acting this way, because it's straight up not normal even for the internet.\n\nI could continue this back and forth with you but honestly I'm more just curious. Why exactly did you even make these attributions? Is a person not allowed to like online school or want to wait until they can finish up school in-person and get the most out of their degree? Don't see how that makes them a \"bum\" that wants their \"mommy to wipe their ass\" lmao.",

                                  "text": "Ahhhh okay so there it is you had a family member die from covid. Well obviously I'm really sorry that that happened to you and I can't imagine what you're going through but that doesn't justify your unprompted hostility toward people that are just trying to ask a question. Me not liking online school doesn't mean that I'm comparing my situation to having immediate family die but on the same token you can both acknowledge that people had it worse than you while still not being happy with your own situation. I'm not trying to say that college should be in-person this next semester just to benefit me, I'm just trying to get more information so that I can make the best decision for myself. Online school was in fact easy but again that doesn't mean that I have to be okay with it.\n\nAgain I'm sorry that you had loved ones die but that doesn't mean that you're not a complete asshole with terrible coping mechanisms that CLEARLY needs professional help. Especially with the subtle basking in glory in your comments like you're trying to compensate lol (and no dude your attitude is not irrelevant just because of your degree, people burn out and fail all the time because they\u2019re unbearable to be around). Hope you're able to find peace but mourning doesn't mean you get to treat people like shit.\n\nOne last thing:\n\n\\> you bitch and moan because you throw up in the middle of a physical classroom after drinking all weekend.\n\nI'm so confused by this. If anything it's an indication that you're not thinking straight and just spewing shit. What does this have to do with online school? If I'm throwing up in classrooms wouldn't that make me want online school so it would be less public? I also don't show up to class hungover because I'm not in a frat or a first-year dorm lol. I have no clue what you're even getting at here.",
