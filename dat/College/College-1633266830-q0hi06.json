  "text": " Hello,\u00a0\n\nI am currently undertaking a project looking at two popular methods of explaining AI decisions in machine learning - SHAP and LIME. I am conducting a 5-10 minute survey on how people in the data science community view both SHAP and LIME, and which they prefer.\u00a0 No prior knowledge of SHAP or LIME is required, and a quick introduction will be provided in the survey.\u00a0\n\nI would very much appreciate it if you could take the time to complete the survey linked below - again this should take no more than 5**-10 minutes.**\u00a0\n\n[**https://forms.office.com/r/XNBtPNqVan**](https://forms.office.com/r/XNBtPNqVan)\n\nAll responses will be completely anonymous, and responses will be deleted following the completion of the dissertation. Analysis of results will be available in a github area (linked at the top of the questionnaire)\u00a0 following the completion of the project.\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\nThanks very much for the help and kind regards,\n\nfrozenneon",
