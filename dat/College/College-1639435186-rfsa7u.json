  "text": "It's finals week and I need to write a 7 page persuasive essay with 10 sources by Wednesday. (Yeah, I know pushing it but I got 3 weeks behind due to sickness) My biggest problem right now is coming up with a topic that I can write that much information on. I am leaning towards should we restrict gun laws but not sure it'll have enough. Any ideas?",

      "text": "Grad student here, I've got some advice. \n\nPicking a topic:\nLook for something that interests you, gun control is a good start. There will be a lot of sources on it. You could also look for something similar, like violent video games and gun control or self defense laws. \nYou could also go on Google News and see what is being talked about recently, or another favorite website to help pick topics is CQ researcher - it's used by politicians to help catch them up on debated topics. I have my students use it all the time. \n\nStart by looking for a single good source. I recommend Google scholar. It's a pretty easy search tool and once you find a good source check the sources they use (their references page) and also check the sources that cite them (on the Google scholar page there is a link that says \"cited by\" and clicking that will link you to source that cite that original source). \nYou'll have over ten sources in no time. \n\nHope that helps!",

How do you feel about this?\r  \nShould teachers/professors be unbiased in the classroom?\r  \nShould you still learn cursive in elementary school? What are the disadvantages/ advantages?\r  \nMany college campuses have speakers come in occasionally. These speakers can range in political opinion and some can be controversial. Should you let speakers come to schools that have controversial rhetoric or ideas to uphold free speech?",
