  "text": "For context, he told me that Canvas automatically rounds things up. Is this true? He didn\u2019t really give me a yes or no when I asked. He just told me that whatever Canvas normally does, is what will be my grade. I\u2019m a bit confused on what the normal rounding system for Canvas is. I\u2019m at exactly a 92.5% right now after my final and I\u2019m really hoping it gets rounded to a 93 but I\u2019m not so sure\u2026 Any thoughts?",
