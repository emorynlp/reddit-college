  "text": "I want to introduce each paragraph so that it's clear what points I'm referring to.  I have an introduction, a body of 3 points and a conclusion. My problem is that my 3 paragraphs are too long but if I break them apart it will be confusing and hard to pinpoint my 3 points. So I'm thinking of using 1st, 2nd and 3rd to distinguish the points. I heard this is a bad look. Is it really too amateurish?",

      "text": "Usually it seems kinda simple to me so I prefer doing something like this\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say I was talking about about what makes people happy. And the first point was about candy. \n\nSo for my first paragraph it would be **Candy makes people happy because blablabla**\n\nThe second paragraph would be **While candy is necessary in living a happy and fulfilling life, such and such is equally just as important. For example, such and such does such and such**\n\nThat\u2019s how you can make it flow. You can always try to do something like that, and in my opinion I think it helps it to flow a bit better while reinforcing your points.",

      "text": "Happy to help, but if your paragraphs are too long to break up then the ideas aren\u2019t fully thought out.\n\nIn general, your intro paragraph should contain the intro sentences to each section of the paper. The subsections should be ordered in a way that builds one to the next. If you need to use first, second, third, then your points are too disjointed to flow into one another and your thesis statement is probably not supported.",

Now, I know a long paragraph is an eyesore so if I simply break it into 2 smaller paragraphs, that\u2019s fine right? What I\u2019m trying to say is: I can have multiple paragraphs that support ONE point right?",
