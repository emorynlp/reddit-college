I really hate this, I feel like I'm getting robbed (especially since I am paying international tuition).

I commuted 33 mins everyday to and back (1 hour total a day), and once covid started I didn't have to drive for 3 semesters until I graduated. It was so blissful and the amount of miles and gas money I saved was immaculate. A shame because it goes to show how much of college is a scam and how much more resources it consumes to be in a particular class 1 hour a day everyday...\n\nThe main problem is honestly the degree someone is taking. Business, tech, some art, and many other things you don't actually need to be on campus for. Of course science majors or whoever else ARE going to have a worse experience though because, well, that is pretty much the point of going to college- having access to those resources, 3 hour labs, and in person lessons for harder concepts and in person questions. But the other half of college students should honestly have the option of being on campus or not. My school has small class sizes of like 10 people and we did half in-person half online, so you could be online or in person and it worked not too bad. It was pretty nice. They just had the zoom on while they taught the class and you could interrupt if you wanted. \n\nTo the person who mentioned about getting a girlfriend.... yeah that actually is a shit spot. College is def one of the main ways of finding your SO. Met mine in 1st year of college 1st ever class and sat next to them ironically lol. Had that out of the way the second I stepped on campus basically. I feel bad for others who graduate without meeting anyone. After that you have to go to bars to meet people or whatever other shit events you can find (and most people won't be single...) tinder and stuff never fails though (lol)",
