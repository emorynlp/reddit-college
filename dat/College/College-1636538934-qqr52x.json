  "title:": "Should I drop to part time and lose my scholarship?",
  "text": "To start off, I\u2019m a senior at an expensive private university. I hate the school and they department hates me being there because I don\u2019t fit their perfect idea of what a student should look like. I\u2019ve had terrible migraines from having an allergic reaction to the vaccine and they\u2019re horrible at accommodating me, so I\u2019m filling complaints with ADA &amp; discrimination. It\u2019s a mess. But my parents pay for the college and my scholarship requires me to be full time. But I can\u2019t keep up with the work load, have a job, move in on my own, and still be in school full time with professors who are trying to fail me. Idk what to do and so I\u2019m thinking about lying about a promotion at my job so my parents will let me drop to part time. I only have one day left to decide at this point and I\u2019m on the brink of having an absolute meltdown because I\u2019m flunking all of my classes. Instead of just giving me an extension to get it done, I have to waste extra time explaining to them that I\u2019m just running out of time. I can\u2019t plan my week when an unexpected migraine forces me to lose half of the week.",
