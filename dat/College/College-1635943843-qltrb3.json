  "text": "My boyfriend is being transported to the hospital right now, and it\u2019s suspected he\u2019s having a really bad reaction to a vaccine. I really care about him and he has nobody else with him in our new city, so im going with him as he\u2019s also really scared. However, that means I\u2019ll have to miss my classes for at least the morning. I know my professors all say that a medical emergency counts as an excused absence, but I don\u2019t know if that would apply to me attending to someone else\u2019s medical emergency",
