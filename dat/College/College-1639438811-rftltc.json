  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am conducting an online study if being an athlete in college makes a difference in coping to stress and how resilient one is compared to college students who aren\u2019t athletes.\n\nI am comparing two groups: \n1) college students that are athletes \n2) college students that aren\u2019t athletes.\n\nParticipation in this study is voluntary. This study will last approximately 15 minutes and is anonymous. \n\nThis study would do the following:\n\u2022 Consider the unique and different experience of college students and college student athletes, and this will help recognize\nthem as specific populations to study for future researchers.\n\n\u2022 This study will highlight if psychological differences exist with being an athlete the same way that there has been seen with physical differences such as higher pain tolerance, lower rates of physical health declines, and lower body fat, amongst other research findings.\n\n**Only qualifiers to participation is being a college student and at least 18 years old. \n\nSee below for the link to access this study.\n\nLink: https://alliant.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8cSS8wdED3WFDbo\n\nThank you for any and all of your time!",
