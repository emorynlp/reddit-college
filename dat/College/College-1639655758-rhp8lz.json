  "title:": "Why are math professor\u2019s expectations so damn high",
  "text": "A lot professors seem to make things easy: Very clear, directed project instructions, plenty of time to submit things, easier exams, generally assuming the class knows very little or nothing about their question. \n\nAnd then I walk into math classes, and they think I am a prodigy who can fill in the gaps and generalize equations perfectly to other problems. The professor asks questions that would take a long time to calculate or super-intuition and expect an immediate answer. Even my written grammar must be exactly precise. \n\nThis is true for almost every math professor I\u2019ve had. Why are your expectations so damn high? I feel physically exhausted after one lecture. \n\n(I don\u2019t know about all stem)",

      "text": "I don\u2019t have to go any higher than alg & stats for math but I asked a prof about it. He said that the uni math requirement isn\u2019t really teaching you about math at all, it\u2019s about developing critical thinking skills in a non typical format. Which is why the tests are harder than the homework, to see if you can apply what you learned to a different set of problems. \n\nthough, I do get what you mean and it can be frustrating for non math/stem students. In my intermediate Alg class we weren\u2019t allowed to use any form of a calculator so things took 10x as long.",

      "text": "I am a mathematics instructor. I think there are several phenomena at play here: \n\n1. Many professors did not struggle with the material that they're teaching and/or are many years removed from when they learned it, so to them the patterns are \"obvious\" and they may really just not know how to explain how to develop that intuition. If you've spent ten or fifteen years using something, it becomes so familiar that it's hard to explain. You might feel the same about trying to explain some pieces of English grammar to a non-native speaker - it's so intuitive to you that it just \"feels right\" to phrase something one way instead of another.\n2. Precision does matter a *lot* in mathematics. Slight differences in phrasing can substantially alter the meaning of a question. So \"nitpicking\" about writing is often not really nitpicking. Students may not understand that a small nuance in their writing has the potential to create a substantial misunderstanding and so a comment about phrasing may come across as superfluous.\n3. There are competing priorities. If you're trying to get tenured, research often matters far more than teaching. So if you are someone who didn't have much trouble learning the material you're teaching, you're perversely disincentivized to take the time to think about what someone else might find difficult and how to overcome that difficulty and/or present explanations and examples that minimize it. Every hour that you spend on teaching is an hour that's not helping you get a permanent job and most professors, like anyone else, want to be employed.\n4. Mathematics is exhausting! Thinking deeply about something challenging *should* make you feel drained, like the mental equivalent of a vigorous workout. \n5. Lectures are not a good mode for learning mathematics for many reasons, one of which you highlighted - it doesn't allow sufficient time for students to think about and process material. You will learn much more during your attempts to solve homework problems than you will in that literal hour that you spend in lecture. You can help yourself by reading relevant textbook chapters before class so you're not seeing the material for the first time.\n\nI could probably say more, but, ironically, I need to get back to my research...",

          "text": "Maybe one follow-up comment is that sometimes an answer can seem \"pretty close\" to correct but actually reveal a fundamental misunderstanding. As an instructor, I want to correct that misunderstanding even if it didn't cause *huge* problems in this particular solution because I want my students to (1) not make the same mistake in the future when it might cause more significant problems and (2) not be trying to build on an already faulty understanding.\n\nSuppose you're in a calculus class and you're doing some type of integral in polar coordinates and set everything up mostly correctly but have the wrong bounds of integration. That might seem like a small mistake because 90% of what you've written down is correct. But when I read your solution, I worry that you (1) don't understand how to find the bounds, (2) fundamentally don't understand what the bounds of integration represent and are just pattern-matching from example problems, or (3) aren't comfortable with trig functions and so can't manipulate them correctly to solve for the bounds. All of those are going to make your life a lot worse in the future without intervention.\n\nSo when I take points off and/or try to talk to you about that solution, I'm not really trying to give you a hard time. I want to figure out what the problem is and make sure that you correct any misunderstandings.",
