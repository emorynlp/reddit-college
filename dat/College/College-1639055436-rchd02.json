  "text": "All I read is people nagging about assignments. To somebody who studies in Germany, those assignments are a godsend. Seriously. Imagine if your whole semester is dependent on one big exam instead of on stuff which you can do at home??\nLike wtf. Sit down, knock out those pages, be free.\nI'd kill for passing courses through assignments.\nLike... 90 points and only 10 of them were based on papers. The rest was exams. N I still got 60 to go. Again. 16 through papers. Rest by exams.",

      "text": "What makes you think our exams aren't as big?\nMajority of my classes are like this:\n\n- 50% of grade for homework\n- 15% for quizzes\n- 35% for exams( this varies by class and professor but finals are usually between 20-30% of your grade)\n\nNeed a C- to pass or I'll have to retake the class again. For my CS classes it's all project based. \n\nCS classes:\n\n- 60% homework and projects\n- 20% quizzes\n- 20 % final\n\nSo it's not homework only. There's just A LOT of it on a weekly basis. My CS class has a weekly assignment, project and quiz. My math class has about 6-10 assignments weekly(discrete math), digital systems class has two assignments and quiz weekly for lecture, and a fucking ridiculously tough lab. The same lab has a midterm project worth 15% of my grade and a final project worth 20%. On top of the weekly 3.5 hour labs that require 10+ pages lab reports. I have a 98% in my lecture and a 87% in my lab, my final project is due on Friday that I cant figure out. If I dont get this project working then I'll fail the lab and have to retake the lecture and lab next semester (2k for just that one class). And this is only three classes I'm taking and working a full time job. I ain't got much hair and each semester there's less of it....lol.",

          "text": "OP is absolutely right.\n\nIn most countries outside the US you aren\u2019t getting any graded formative or scaffolding things.  No practice problems, no quizzes to make sure you are up to date with the little things etc.\n\nYour final project and final exam (and sometimes a midterm) are the only grades you have.\n\nAlso in the past it was like this in the US.  \n\nNobody spent time making up HW or grading it.  You figured out how to assess if you know the stuff and practice it on your own.\n\nThe lab was also one final report so you had no chance of feedback either.\n\nWhat OP is saying is that this is work, but it is work you would be doing totally on your own elsewhere",

I get assignments, round about 4 per week.\nI complete them. Yet, somehow I am only graded by a final exam. I mean, isnt it more realistic if you were graded by papers, assignments and lab courses?\nLike you won't Google shit for a presentation or use overflow if you work anyway...",
