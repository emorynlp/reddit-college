  "text": "In 2020 is when this all really started. I think initially it had a lot to do with the pandemic. My first two years of college were great. I was focused and made excellent grades. The semester of fall 2020 went okay, but I started struggling with my mental health really bad. I was diagnosed with type 1 bipolar in December. Spring semester rolls around and I was taking harder classes. I want to go to medical school and I\u2019m a psychology major, so I was beginning to take pre-med prerequisites including college algebra and general chemistry, all while doing an internship and upper-level psychology classes that demanded a lot of attention. After the first week I withdrew from the algebra and chemistry classes. I never felt so low in my life. I didn\u2019t want to have a W on my transcript, let alone two. I managed to make it through the semester and I retook the algebra class in the summer. It was awful, I never got a break from school. Then this fall semester comes. My sister had an accident four days after classes began so I took the following week off to be with her in the hospital. Unfortunately she was pronounced brain dead during that week. I completely failed my first anatomy and physiology\u2019s first exam and I\u2019m struggling to catch up. We have our second exam in a few days but I feel like I know nothing. I\u2019m behind and frustrated with my statistics class. Trying to work on the take home exam for that class is what has inspired this post. I have learned nothing in all of my other classes. I feel like I\u2019m not able to retain any information. I am on adhd medication and it helps some but I can\u2019t stay focused. All I want to do is lay in bed all day. I feel drained. I want to be a doctor so bad but at the same time, I\u2019m so done with school. I feel like I can\u2019t handle anything anymore. If I withdraw it will look bad to med schools. If I stay I\u2019m only able to do enough to barely get by and that\u2019s not ideal for me considering how hard it is to get into med school. I\u2019m starting to lose hair from stress. I\u2019ve lost 14 pounds in the span of 3 weeks. I don\u2019t want to do anything anymore. The biggest stressor in my life right now is school. My university is a joke. We are known to have some pretty shitty professors and the president/various offices  are really shitty people. Everyone is transferring from the school because of how bad it\u2019s gotten in the past two years. I got a good scholarship and the tuition is the cheapest in my state and closer to my home. I\u2019ve been nominated as the new president for the psychology honor society but I hate school so bad. I used to not be this way. I\u2019m conflicted. What should I do? How can I get back on track?",

      "text": "I know you don't want to withdraw but that's what I would recommend so you can spend some time focusing on your health.  Having a W on your transcript with a very good explanation for it is better than getting a poor grade or possibly failing and continued damage to your health (both mental and physical).  Your health is more important than school in the long run.",
