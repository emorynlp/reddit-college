  "text": "I don't know if it's just me but I'm junior (still sophomore based on credits) now at my local state school. I've been thinking back to the SAT prep and all that stuff we had drilled into our heads during our junior and senior years at high school. The weird thing is that high school made getting accepted to college feel like this big thing but now it feels like almost nothing at all. Does anybody else have a similar thoughts about this?",

Like you cant build a new csu before every county has one, that way students can get a degree from the university, and not the extended campus, which tends to water down the classes. ",

      "text": "Well, how unsure of your getting in were you? Were any concerns you may or may not have had well placed? If they were (a) present and (b) well placed I suspect the issue is more or less that they're no longer relevant. If you didn't have these kinds of concerns then the question is whether or not your motives/intentions are the same as the societal messages you were picking up on.\n\nHere's an illustration. In NZ (my \"here\"), it's really not terribly difficult to get to university. If you can get University Entrance (a national qualification based on school results) then, in practice, you've almost certainly got the rank score for Auckland's BA or BSc programmes (and maybe some of the others) and if you've done that you're in. And that's for one university when there are seven (six?) others. So, if the goal is university, it's a breeze.^1\n\nThis is a complete contrast, for instance, to the main character in the movie The Perfect Score (standing in for America's societal messages) who has a very specific goal. As I remember, he needed at least X on the SAT in order to study a specific architecture programme at a specific university and by the nature of this admissions process was pretty much relying on a single exam. At least the characters in The History Boys who, again, have a more specific goal (i.e. Oxbridge) also had an interview on top of the exam. These goals are very specific enough that they're kind of binary... which immediately makes for higher stakes on top of being harder ambitions to start with than simply \"go to university\".^2\n\n^1 I say that because that's how I found getting UE. But even when I was at school when UE was much easier to get only 70.9% of my fellows got UE. The last few years it's been more like 63%. So, obviously, it does depend who's talking... not that I'd have thought of this without scanning this thread. For context, I actively thought I had a shot at getting the maximum possible rank score (I was very far from doing that in the end).\n\nThis is quite long so a tl;dr might be:\n\n1. Societal expectations are relevant only when they're relevant to you specifically.\n2. How much of a formality was getting in *at the time*?^3 \n\n^2 And to emphasise my initial point about the level of worry... compare a friend of mine who wanted to do medicine. I asked him to state his certainty in his getting in to the MBChB once. He said either 95% or 99%. He got in (and, indeed, has done very well). With that level of confidence there's no real need to feel like being accepted or not is a big deal... no matter how important the outcome is, the decision is reduced to essentially a formality.\n\n^3 Black Swans is a really weird expression here since 9/10 swans I've ever seen are black but I think the Wikipedia article on the probability idea is that people tend to decide that they should have seen something unexpected coming after the fact even though this truly wasn't the case based on before fact information. A concern to bear in mind when answering this question.",

They scare you into thinking you're not good enough so you try to prove it.

Got in easy... just for doing the classes in the transfer agreement. Didn\u2019t even need to do the essay apparently all the other students had to do to get in. Plus I didn\u2019t have to do the freshman courses, nor read the freshman book, nor was I required to live on campus the first year because I spent my first year in the community college. Plus I paid less for that first year. \n\nSo all in all, I came to the conclusion that the whole pushing high school kids strait into college asap is a money making scam because that is the #1 way to make it the most expensive way to go through school. If you just wait... take your time and get a job... get life experience... figure out what you *really* want as an adult... save some money, make a solid plan... you can find more opportunities for grants and scholarships... plus a lot of jobs will help pay for your education. Not to mention trades like journeyman electrician or lineman make damn good money and are far less competitive than engineer... \n\nAll in all... they never really care about your future... they just, want your money. Don\u2019t get me wrong... you totally should still get an education... but... don\u2019t be manipulated by the universities and college prep bullshit. Theres nothing to prep for. Its the same shit you did in high school. And if you play your cards right, you can totally afford an education even if you got nothing. Even just waiting until the federal government classifies you as independent makes a huge difference. That could mean waiting years but... its worth not putting yourself in massive debt. Every year the tuition and required health insurance plans rise by hundreds of dollars. They keep inching up... never stopping. One wonders how this will end... ",

Which is also why I was so annoyed whenever I was forced into AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) or something which was an elective course meant to help prepare students for college, which I didn't need to take and I felt like I was wasting my time in. Eventually I rebelled hard enough to the point where I got kicked out of the elective, thanked the teacher for being great and apologized for giving her shit because I just hated the subject of the class and took an elective that I felt would be better served to further my college career.\n\nBut yeah that middle school teachers message made me realize one thing, that the bar for achievement is always moving and in terms of education levels that bar was moving higher and if you wanted to hit that bar you had to keep pace. \n\nTLDR: I knew I was going to college back in Middle School, so college prep in High School was pointless since I had already been mentally/physically preparing myself to walk that path since then.",

      "text": "It *is* utterly overblown in the US. There are in fact only about three dozen schools in the country that have acceptance rates <15%. Out of nearly 4,500 colleges and universities. A similar number have acceptance rates between 95-100%, basically accepting anyone with a high school diploma or GED. In between the distribution is skewed *very* heavily toward accepting the vast majority of applicants. So the entire industry of admission consulting, coaching, strategy books, college counselors, etc. really isn't necessary for the vast majority of students who are applying to typical non-selective schools where most college students matriculate.  So yes, getting in to Central State U or Local Religious College or the University of Phoenix really *isn't* that big a deal.  Harvard, MIT, Yale, et al sure-- their acceptance rates are in the single digits. But most schools are well above 70%, so most people get in to places where they are realistic candidates for admission.  And *everyone* who finishes high school can get in somewhere, since there are schools with automatic admission for anyone with a diploma.\n\nSure, it's a stretch for some people for a host of reasons. And getting in to a highly selective school (of which there are literally just a few dozen in the US) is something to be quite proud of. But high schools make a big deal out of any acceptance because it's their job-- when I graduated my school not only feted those who got into four-year colleges, but community college, the military, trade apprenticeships, you name it. That's appropriate because different people have different paths and interests. But it seems like we're misleading high school students by creating unnecessary stress over college admissions...for most students who apply to schools that are realistic for them (i.e. not MIT) the admission decisions are all but automatic.",

Sure as shit feels like an accomplishment to me. \n\nI get it, though. In my classes I'm surrounded by kids who got into university right out of high school. These are kids who've always done well in classes, whose parents helped them with homework or applications or whatever else, who had access to SAT prep materials, who actually had people telling them they needed to study, maybe someone even took the time to show them *how* to study. If you've got all that stuff, I can see how it might not feel like you personally accomplished anything. It's more like you've just been following the path the adults set out for you.\n\nBut think about how things might have been if you didn't have any of that. What if your parents never helped you with anything school-related, never looked at applications with you, never cared what your grades were like? What if your family didn't have money for prep materials, or even food? What if your school didn't bother with college talk because they didn't think any of you would have a chance to go? What if, despite having no help whatsoever, you still managed to get accepted to a good school? Would it feel like an accomplishment then?\n\nSo, if you're feeling like getting into university wasn't that big a deal for you, well, maybe it wasn't. Maybe you were helped along so well by the adults in your life that university just feels like the next step in the boring slog you've been railroaded into since childhood. That's ok, it's fine to feel that way.\n\nBut, before you start talking to folks about how easy it was to get in and how being there feels like nothing, think about who's nearby. There's a good chance the person right next to you had to fight tooth and nail through an endless mire of bullshit just to get accepted anywhere, let alone this amazing school, and overhearing you talk about how getting accepted was no big deal might crush whatever glimmer of pride they were starting to feel about themselves. I've overheard that conversation far too many times, and while I'm usually good at remembering that the kids talking like that don't understand how lucky they were, it still hurts. I still end up feeling like all the work I put in was only necessary because I'm an idiot. Don't be the person who makes someone feel that way.",

I cared in my first year because it was the biggest thing I'd achieved by that time, but I did more important stuff in my second year that completely overshadowed getting into university.\n\nIf you're beyond your first year and it's still this monumental achievement that has a special place in your heart, then that's probably a sign that you're not doing enough now. \n\nEndlessly congratulating yourself on something you've already achieved doesn't net you any reward, it just stops you from doing more. Nobody ever did anything meaningful because they were perfectly content which what they had achieved and where they were in life. If you haven't moved on yet, okay, but let others do it. Their saying \"wow, this really important thing seems less important as it becomes more distant\" is not a comment on the achievement or what it meant at the time, just that your life changes and your current priorities change too.

They were/are more hyperneurotic than you might believe a human being can be. \n\n*And yet*, once they submit all of their applications and it's all done, they come to the conclusion that it's all quite underwhelming. They expect to feel elated. Then if they get accepted or rejected from somewhere, they expect to be overjoyed/dejected for the rest of their life.

Even new parents can quite quickly have bad days again, even though the light of their life was just born and the best day in their life has recently occurred. It doesn't detract from that experience, it's just how human beings are. \n\nIt's not physiologically realistic to expect to be overjoyed with an achievement for the rest of your life, nor for you to be depressed over a failure for the rest of your life.

Got a good grade on an exam 4 semesters ago? Got invited to a party in your first week? Whatever you can think of, if it happened more than maybe a month ago, I can almost guarantee that you don't really care about it anymore. Sure, you can still be proud of it, but you're not going to lie awake at night smiling over that assignment you did well in 3 years ago because it isn't a part of your current life. \n\nSame thing applies to SAT/ACT and university applications. The moment you submit them, you may as well burn them. You'll never need them again, literally no one gives a shit about what you did in HS, and you'll soon forget even what *classes* you did in your final year. \n\nThe fact that you no longer care is a good sign. It means that you've moved on and found more important things to think about. The only people happily reminiscing on their HS stats and the application process are the people who peaked there and have since been a failure in whatever sense. If someone is failing university but did well in HS, you can be certain that they'll tell you all about their old GPA.",

I never had dreams of getting into some Ivy League so when I decided to go to college, I just went to the college closest to me at that has a 96% acceptance rate. Got in at 19 years old. I wasn't surprised and didnt really feel any feeling of acomplishment, but I am the first person in my entire family to go to college so thats cool.\n\nI do remember senior year of highschool, all the seniors got a form to fill out during homeroom during the last weeks of school. It said\n\n \"What college do you plan on applying to and what will you study?\"\n\nBack then I put my name on the form and left the questions blank because I had no intention of going.\n\n2 hours later I got called to the principles. They asked me why I didnt fill out the form. I told them I wasnt going to college. The principle said just write down our state college name.\n\nThe only reason I can think why they would need me to fill out that form so bad was so that the highschool could say,\n\n\"98% of our students go to college!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He went directly to the army then to hard labor. \n\nMy parents didnt care much about school, they never made me to do homework or study or anything like that. They always said \"just try to do your best.\" \n\nThrough all of high school I would just go hang out with friends, do my work, go home and chill. I never really even thought about the future until I was 18, 5 months after I had graduated.\n\nAfter graduation I worked in a kitchen for two years and thought \"I dont want to do this.\" Suddenly I was super motivated to learn.\n\nThe look on my moms face was priceless when I told her I wanted to go to college. \n\nIm in my junior year right now studying wildlife management.\n\n It took me till sophmore year to figure out what I wanted to do, youll get there too, just gotta hang in there!\n",

Because whether or not you can manage the bare minimum- people will notice. All of a sudden, it's not about whether you can hit deadline X, it's about whether you're really trying or not. \n\nIf you are half-assing it in a job, people will notice, and clock it as not pulling your weight, for good reason. All of the \"warnings\" are to prepare you for that. \n\nTrust me, I half-assed my way through internships and every part of education, then found it really disconcerting when people weren't okay with pulling the bare minimum in the real job environment.\n",

The school is small, so it has no interesting companies coming to career fairs. The career office has no idea how to advise students in my major, I had to figure out a lot of things myself. And by the time I did, it was too late for a lot of opportunities. Also my major can't offer all the standard upper level classes every year, let alone every semester because of lack of professors. So I have to take filler classes I'm not even that interested in, and miss out on what other schools consider core classes for my major. People who know of the school do consider it prestigious, but it's so unknown it doesn't even matter.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are lots of benefits too, but I think one of the top state schools would have been better off in actually preparing me for life after graduation.",
