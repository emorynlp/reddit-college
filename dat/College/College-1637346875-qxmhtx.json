  "text": "Not that anyone cares, but I\u2019m letting myself fail a class because it\u2019s too late to withdraw from it. It\u2019s too hard, and every single thing you could think of to help me succeed has already been done but nothing has worked, every single thing. I want to kill my self but I won\u2019t, because I\u2019ve been going through so much mentally and this class is a very big reason for it. I just give up, I have nothing left to give. Im so disappointed in myself but what else am I supposed to do? Im stupid at this subject and nothing will ever change that. \n\nIm doing fine in my other classes, but I\u2019m still barely getting by. I had to leave my dorm so I could try to improve my mental health and be closer to my support system, but even that hasn\u2019t worked. Im even taking a break from school after this semester is over, but the only thing that can really help me right now is to prioritize myself over school. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I know someone will suggest therapy, but it\u2019s so expensive and every person I\u2019ve contacted for therapy has said they\u2019re not taking new clients. I just feel so lost and hopeless, this semester and this class broke me because I\u2019m not used to losing. Anyways thanks for reading, I know I\u2019m not the only one going through this, so feel free to share your story.",

I was too busy studying for my other courses that when I checked my final grade and saw an F, I just accepted it and moved on because I didn\u2019t have the capacity to deal with it at the time. \n\nIf you think prioritizing your other classes over the one that\u2019s too difficult is your best course of action trust your judgement. In reality, failing a class is not the end of the world I originally thought it would be, and I was still able to graduate on time. You\u2019ll be ok, college is rough, you still got this. Good luck with all your other courses!",

      "text": "Back in 2017 I was in my second year of university. I had barely scraped by in my sciences the previous year. I knew that wasn\u2019t for me, but I didn\u2019t know what was for me.  I was depressed to say the least. I felt the same way, I wanted to die. I went to school and sat in the back stacks of the library every day. I didn\u2019t actually go to my classes. I didn\u2019t pull out because I didn\u2019t want my parents to know that I was failing, and not even trying. I would cry all the time at school, feeling like scum, thinking all the worst things. I would come home and lay in bed and cry until I went to work. \n\nEventually I decided I needed to figure out how to fix this for my the sake of the rest of my academic career. I saw an academic advisor about the situation and she helped me. I had to go to each of my profs and ask them to sign a letter allowing me to withdraw from the class. This was in December (so right before exams). I had to go to my doctor and ask her to sign a note stating my diagnosis of anxiety and depression. Each prof was very nice about it and 3/4 said they didn\u2019t even recognize me, which attested to the fact that I was not present in 90% of classes. It was hell. I was close to death. \n\nI was put on medication and required to go to therapy. I took the next school year off and went to Europe to work. I came back for the 2019-2020 school year to restart a new degree. I still have anxiety, I still have depression, but I know how to handle myself better, and I\u2019m still medicated. School increased all those negative feelings, I\u2019m just a stronger person now. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are dealing with this now. You will be okay. After the rain comes a rainbow.",

I knew my parents would be disappointed and I didn\u2019t like it myself but I knew I was doing it for the right reasons, it was not me \u201cgiving up\u201d I just had to retreat a little bit. It paid off and I was able to keep it together and ace the other 3 classes. I still went to the final of the class I wrote off, but ofc I bombed it. I knew I would. I think I just went to make myself feel better and prove that I wasn\u2019t giving up, holding the L so to speak motivated me bc I knew it was a class I\u2019d have to take again since I needed it to graduate. \n\nI\u2019m graduated now \u263a\ufe0f it seemed so dramatic at the time but at the end I was able to go back and get my grade replaced in that class.

I fucked up for multiple years resulting in about 10 F\u2019s and 5 withdrawals and I ended up turning myself around after a gap semester for reflection. I put myself around people who believed in me, reaffirmed my passions, and helped me achieve my learning goals. Sometimes it takes a lot of failures to make a success.",

      "text": "Something I wish someone had told me when I first started in college is that an F  at most schools gets replaced in your GPA with new grade when you retake a class. So in a lot of cases, it can be better to take the F than to end up with a D or even a C- in some cases. Obviously, if you are aiming to go onto post-secondary education and will need to show people your transcripts to earn admittance into programs, it isn't ideal to have F's on them. But for most people, it will work out okay if you take the failing grade and retake the class another semester.",

      "text": "No worries man, I'm in the same boat. My prof removed my access to blackboard because I was missing assignments and tests. I also have no idea what's going on in my other courses and I'll probably fail those as well. I changed my major because I learned that I don't give a fuck about business and some of the online business assignments make me lose my mind (if anyone has done those learn smart assignments then you know how annoying it is). I'm taking it one day at a time and as a learning experience. I tried the class and tried to learn and ended up hating it, its okay, I'll try something else. So for now I've changed to a general studies major (I know, probably the worst major) just so I don't have to be so restricted on the classes I can take. I'm also in a fortunate circumstance where I get VA funding so my tuition is basically free. I'm gonna take courses that look interesting to me and see where it takes me.\n\nTake your time, we're all lost in what to do. And hey, maybe college just isn't for you and that's okay! Take a semester off and do things that you want to do and relax for a while. I'm gonna try to do another semester and if things don't go so well I'll probably take a semester off or flat out drop out at this point, because to be honest, I don't know where I'm going in life either haha! I just wanna do something that makes me happy so I hope the both of us can find that!",

Embrace that. It\u2019s hard motivating yourself to do schoolwork that you can\u2019t grasp, no matter how hard you try, and it\u2019s hard feeling so inadequate so many hours of the day, and it\u2019s hard not being able to pay for therapy or interface with tutors or pick a direction for your life that you think will be satisfying. It\u2019s all just a whole lot, all the time. If you want any advice at all, I would say you should take this time to find out what else you want out of life that isn\u2019t school or a job. The little moments in between sleep and obligations and taking shits that make life worth living. It\u2019s not therapy, but if you want to just talk to somebody, you\u2019re welcome to reach out. Like you said yourself, it\u2019s not just you, and misery loves company :)",
