  "text": "I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI\u2019m in my first year of college at an academically rigorous university. I\u2019ve been here for a month now. I\u2019m on the Pre-Medicine pathway with a major in psych. My major is very rigorous and demanding, but I\u2019m really into medicine and psychology so it\u2019s fine.\n\nThe problem is when it\u2019s time for me to do my assignments, papers, study or take an exam, I become very depleted. I get depressed, demotivated, feel like crying, and honestly I feel paralysed by fear/anxiety. I don\u2019t want to do anything at all. Even easy schoolwork overwhelms me and I don\u2019t do anything but sit in my bed. \n\nThis is not like me at all. I\u2019m someone who really enjoys learning, so I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. I feel really lost. Even the classes that interest me don\u2019t please me anymore. And overall, I just feel really depressed and upset. \n\nAll I want to do is be in my dorm room all day and not move. Sometimes I don\u2019t even feel like eating. \n\nMy first midterm is in two (really one) days and I have papers due this week. But I can\u2019t find it in me to get the ball running.\n\nAny advice would really help. Thank you",
