  "text": "I graduated high school in 2020 and that's when covid hit, so when I took classes for the first year, I withdrew all of them. Everything was online and I hated every part of it. I was just taking random classes trying to find something interesting. I was super unmotivated so by the end of the first year I didn't have any classes completed. That's when I realized I was completely wasting money so I decided to take a semester off to work and find out what I truly want to study. and now here we are, a semester passed and I still don't know!! I'm already 19 and I'm scared I'm wasting my time away. I know in the grand scheme of things I still have lots of time but if I don't take a class next semester I won't be a student anymore at my university and I don't want to go through the trouble of reapplying. My plan was just to take a couple of random classes and be a part-time student and take them in person so I actually have a good chance of doing well unlike how I did online during covid. Does anyone have advice for me? Did anyone go through anything similar and how did you find out want you want to study in university?",

Where are you working?\n\nSecond, I would maybe try and pick a college to go towards, like \"Engineering\", \"Physical Sciences\", \"Humanities\" or \"Fine Arts\", that way you could pick one or two classes that should be generally applicable toward any of those majors.",

              "text": "I was curious where you were working because if you're just working retail or customer service that's probably not going to tell you a lot about what you want to do for the future, so I was wondering if there's a chance you were doing something more related to a specific career path.\n\nAsk for classes, there are intro classes that are more representative of a major. Both universities I went to have a one to two credit intro course for each engineering major, so you could pick one like mechanical and give that a shot, and have a much better idea then taking physics or calculus because those are tools for engineers, not their focus. Psych is a really popular major, and would probably fulfill a general education requirement no matter what your major is. You could also sign up for a business / accounting/finance introductory course to see if you've got any interest in business, or go ahead and take a course like chemistry biology or physics to see if a straight science is more up your alley.",

                      "text": "If you feel like you have absolutely zero idea what to do, it might not be a bad idea but the other commenter is right but it's not the most financially efficient method, so if you're paying for school entirely with student loans I might not take that risk that will affect you for 10 years down the road.\n\nOne thing you could try and do is focus more on what future lifestyle you want then career. A lot of people get hung up on what's my passion, what's my calling in life, what should my dream job be. In reality, hopefully you have a fulfilling life outside of your job and so it might be more important to you to have a job where you're treated fairly, and it can support the lifestyle you want so that you can enjoy your passions on your own free time. For example, if you want to travel a lot or have other really expensive tastes like you really want to drive a nice car, or eat out at my restaurants all the time, or if you want to retire early, then it might be very too prioritize a field that will make you good money. On the other hand, if you have to be entertained or fulfilled by something to enjoy it, then maybe it's more important to find a job you're passionate about rather than just a solid career.",
