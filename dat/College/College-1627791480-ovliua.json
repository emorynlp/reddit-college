I'd consider myself pretty cautious and safe when it comes to my behavior the past two years. But I couldn't give two shits about a couple COVID cases at my university with a vaccine mandate in a highly vaxxed area. If I was going to school in the rural south where most students won't be vaccinated, it'd be a different story, but I don't see any reason to have mostly online classes when vaccines are widely available.",
