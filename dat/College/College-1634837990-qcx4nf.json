  "text": "I work as an accountant for a CPA firm. I got a masters in accounting. I wanted to try life sciences(like P.T or PA) during college, but I always thought that it would be too difficult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've decided to take a couple online science classes while working full time, and if I can get As, I may quit my job and go into life science instead.  I was surprised at the class averages tho. The average on the last 2 tests is about a 67  or a 68. The first test was about a 80. I've talked to ppl in anatomy and the averages there was about a 60-69 on most tests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn acct. under grad, the class averages range from about a 75-82, with the average being around 78. In my general business classes they were around 80 or so. Psy. classes also have a much higher average(like 80ish)\n\nThoughts?",

But I'm not sure it is fair or true to say those things.\n\nOne interesting thought that occurred to me, is that these majors tend to be more overstuffed with people who feel \"obligated\" to be there. Parental pressures, people chasing a high salary, prestigious job titles, high profile companies, job security or \"practical\" skills etc. No offense, but most people that major in history, or art, or education, or English aren't chasing dollars, and may not even know exactly where they hope to end up for a career, just that they are interested in learning more about that topic at a high level. Or some of them may know exactly where they want to end up as a career, like museum curator or freelance illustrator, they are just careers that people may find more enjoyable, fulfilling, or passionate about, rather than a desk job.\n\nAnd just to be clear, there's nothing wrong with that, it takes all types to have a well rounded and high functioning society, neighborhood, country, or even family. It's why GEs are important, even though they felt really obnoxious sometimes.",

              "text": ">if you let the wrong person become a doctor, people will die\n\nI would like to contest that. This argument is overblown. You do not need to have a high level of intelligence to perform a doctor's duties. One of the main problems with health systems is the undersupply of doctors so we should be allowing more people to become doctors. This helps prevent overwork, lowers salaries to a reasonable amount (say $100k for the average MD specialty) and makes health systems significantly cheaper and better. If people can become successful artists, scientists or accountants, why shouldn't they be given the opportunity to become a doctor?",

I think that a lot of doctors duties should be handed off to lesser trained people. Kind of like how a single dentist can have hundreds or even thousands of patients, because for the most part the hygienist cleans the teeth, the dentist spends 5 minutes checking it over, looking at your x-ray and then moves on.\n\nIf we gave nurses the same leeway, and doctors only had to handle the \"hard\" problems, then we wouldn't need more doctors. I think these are two ways to skin a cat, but the idea of more doctors with lower salaries doesn't work with the current timeline and cost of medical school. People shouldn't have to take 8 years and $200k in debt to get paid only 100k. So I would prefer a network of highly trained nurses, maybe with some option of additional 1 year on the job certificates to certify them for slightly more complex disciplines, rather than having twice as many doctors.",

Grad school, careers, they just care more about your GPA. But hey, typically people who graduate as (example) a CS major are basically guaranteed a job of some kind. Might not be a great one and success in school sure increases your options, but IMO it *really* doesn\u2019t work that way as a creative major. \n\nWe have a thing called a portfolio. It really doesn\u2019t matter if joe-blow professor gave me an A or a C on that magazine spread. Is it objectively good? Would someone actually publish it? Is it creative with vision and not just a copy-pasta of a million things we\u2019ve all seen before? How many stories did I actually have published by real media outlets while in school? What did those editors think of me? How many different skills does my photography portfolio illustrate? Do I have a cohesive style? Can you market yourself? \n\n*ALL* of those criteria and many more influence your career prospects as a \u201ccreative.\u201d IDGAF what my GPA is, really. But I could also ask a bunch of STEM majors to come write a 2000 word article with 4+ interviews and I somehow don\u2019t think it would go too well. \n\nDifferent skills, it\u2019s just different.

The difference in education levels and high school and college is laughable.

Now, if you take up humanities and business then that\u2019s not largely a problem since you will start from scratch. However, for science subjects a level of proficiency is required prior to entering the stream. So, how does someone with a rocky foundation of 10th grade trigo now perform? I mean there isn\u2019t any time to catch up and the college pace is pretty fast. It\u2019s like running on a plane surface as compared to running downhill. If you fall then you can get up if it\u2019s a plane surface. However, if you are running downhill and stumble then well.. you\u2019re fucked! Rocky foundations now become rockier structures and before you know you\u2019re in 4th year and don\u2019t have a basic level competency!",

An English professor cannot (or rather, would not) give a 55% to an awful explication of a poem in the same way a chemistry teacher could give that grade on a quiz. This is not because not as much could be done with the poem, usually the opposite. Some people get away with murder in this respect but still end up with a B in the class because of timed exams. \n\nI would also add that intelligent men tend to skew Quant on intelligence tests, and as reddit is mostly male, don't be surprised when people pat themselves on the back on this.",
