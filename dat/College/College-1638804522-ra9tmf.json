  "text": "Last night was the second time they lit the bathroom on fire. This time he used butane to make sure the toilet paper would stay lit. The building caught fire. The alarms didn\u2019t go off. My room was full of smoke. It is two floors directly above. The hallways still smell like smoke.\n\nThe Dean of Students Staff is trying to cover it up. They\u2019ve told their RA\u2019s to tell people it was another accident, just like the first time. But do they think we\u2019re stupid? This is the second time in a month. Same bathroom. \n\nWhile doing some investigating to catch the staff in their lie, I ran into the Campus Safety officer on duty. He confirmed that it was an arsonist. He told us about the accelerant. He told us that the building did actually catch fire.\n\nI\u2019m terrified to be on this campus now. This is the second time that there has been a fire in a month and no alarms went off. People rarely use that hallway when the fires were set as well. I don\u2019t feel safe with the staff trying to cover things up, because I know this isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve done that.\n\nI want to bring my evidence to student assembly, but I\u2019m not sure how to approach it. I don\u2019t want to cause a mass panic, but I believe people need to know.",

Instead of cutting them off they just let them go off a few times a week (normally in the middle of the night) and make everyone evacuate. Their lucky its a small town because the fire trucks are getting to the building slower every time since they know it's most likely a false alarm. You'd think it'd be more efficient to just replace the system, but I guess annoying all the firefighters in town and a few hundred students every other night is less important than the money that could be spent to keep students safe.",

In fact, in many states, it\u2019s against fire code to install smoke alarms in bathrooms at all (Maybe those were CO2 alarms you saw?).  Furthermore, most fire codes require bathrooms, especially for high-occupancy living facilities to be built with non-flammable materials instead.  This is why sometimes after a fire, you\u2019ll see an entire building burned down except for the bathroom (In other words, even if a fire did start in a dorm bathroom, residents would still be pretty safe). \n\n2.\tIt\u2019s entirely possible that there is no cover-up at hand and that this is all just the result of miscommunication.  Universities are not well-known for endangering the lives of their students like this - Frankly, most people working in student affairs don\u2019t get into this line of work unless they genuinely love working with students (they\u2019re certainly not doing it for the money). They would be far more likely to overreact if they discovered this was a confirmed case of arson, and I can\u2019t possibly imagine a scenario where the entire staff would agree unanimously to turn a blind eye to it to cover it up.\n\n3.\tI would far sooner guess that the Safety Officer you spoke to was exaggerating, or perhaps just straight-up lying to see if he could coax information from someone.  I say this because there are far more effective accelerants than butane accessible to college students (gasoline, motor oil, etc.), so if butane *was* used, my first assumption wouldn\u2019t be \u201cThis must be arson\u201d it would be \u201cSomeone was getting high in the bathroom and accidentally set a fire using the butane torch they brought\u201d",

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible but it\u2019s highly unlikely, what kind of motive would staff have to do this? Having an arsonist student get expelled is minor news that goes away in a week, covering it up could legit ruin the reputation of the school for years, especially with how insanely difficult it would be to cover up. No dean in their right mind would do that, let alone all the staff members that had to have been involved before the dean even knew about it. \n\nOP is very likely paranoid and spreading rumors.",

              "text": "I know, right? Like, we have two likely scenarios here:\n\n**Scenario A**:  A would-be arsonist decided to try and set a dorm on fire.  His plan?  Ignite a blaze in one of the only rooms in the entire  building that\u2019s (probably) wall-to-wall ceramic and surrounded by water pipes on 3 sides.  For some unexplainable reason, the entire student affairs staff decides to endanger the lives of the dorm residents by helping him cover it up *except* for a rogue Safety Officer who decides, despite the fact that he is (almost definitely) also a member of the Dean\u2019s staff, to go against the department and trust OP, an unassuming undergrad, with the TRUTH.  It\u2019s now up to the two of them to let the world know - Roll credits.\n\n**Scenario B**:  A kid decided to bring a glass pipe and a butane torch into the dorm bathroom to get high.  He accidentally started a small fire, but got away before anyone caught him.  He did it again (maybe because he\u2019s an addict?  A college student?  Addicted to drugs?  Making bad decisions?  I never!).  This time though, he\u2019s so high he accidentally sets his butane torch down on the toilet paper roll while it\u2019s still lit, the thing goes up in an instant, and it sets the stall on fire.  The student affairs staff tells the RA\u2019s to tell everyone that it was accident because\u2026 it was an accident\u2026. And some Safety Officer with 50% of the information tells a story to some unassuming undergrad who creates a panic.\n\nWhich of these two scenarios is really the more likely one?",
