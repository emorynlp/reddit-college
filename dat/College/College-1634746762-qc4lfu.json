  "title:": "Why is it so hard for me to make friends?",
  "text": "I came to college because I realized that I never went out much as a kid and spent too much time on studies. So I wanted to put more effort into creating a social life. But things have been really hard in that regard.\n\nI'm currently a junior and an entire semester and a half was taken from me because of Covid, and in the time that I have had on campus, I've only made 3 friends, that I barely have time to hang out with and I don't really feel all that close to. I've been struggling with my classes and it's been taking up almost all my time including weekends. I go out as much as I can= (despite not having a car) and try to go to clubs at every opportunity, but the same people don't always show up. Not to mention, the fact that my only real interests include games and anime doesn't help either\n\nAnd to top it all off, my campus is two states away from where I live. Which means once I graduate, I might end up losing the friends that I have. Even the smallest progress that I've already made will fade because I'm on Twitter and they're on Snapchat (yes, apparently everyone on campus here uses Snapchat)\n\nIs there something wrong with me? Why is my social life just trickling away like this? Why can't I get a second chance at having friends, hanging out and being happy?",

      "text": "Hi. It\u2019s OK that you\u2019re not making any friends. No one is really that friendly. No one is trying to make friends -and if they\u2019re that\u2019s a weird way of showing it. Just let it go. I know that it\u2019s not easy to be alone, even though I was never really alone physically -like my parents would never leave me alone. i\u2019d either have my friends or my parents around- but I know how it feels to be alone in a crowded room. It\u2019s being alone *mentally*. It sucks and it\u2019s hard to go through. I\u2019d advise you to binge watch some show that doesn\u2019t make you cry at the end -though I usually cry bc it ends, not bc it ended badly/in a sad way- This is probably not that helpful but nothing really would be helpful in this situation. I hope that you\u2019re OK!",

          "text": "So I have to just suck it up and deal with it. Great. I want to expand my horizons and become a bit more of a social butterfly, gain more opportunities to find girls and dates, and I can't do a thing about it\n\nI wasted my entire childhood and I can't get it back and now I'm going to be punished for the rest of my life by being forced to a lonely loser. Just fantastic\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to get all salty. I just feel like I wasted the last 18 years of my life being an \"All A\" student and I want to make up for lost time. It kind of destroys me knowing that I can't do a thing about it and I have to awkwardly force my way into other people's lives just to feel like I'm making any sense of progress\n\nLast night, I offered to hang out with a group of people in three different events that were brought up. I managed to get one person's number but I can't help but feel I made myself look desperate",

Also, I\u2019m sorry that you took me too seriously. I\u2019ve been experiencing the same thing ever since I moved away for college. I am also 18 and I have no real life experience sooo.. I guess.. you do you? Have fun fella.",

Idk I guess I can't change. It was hard for me then and it's hard for me now, I don't even know why I expected me to magically become social outgoing just because I moved to college. I just miss the days where I didn't care about this shit, I hate how I feel pain just from seeing people hanging out with their friends. I'd like to think it's not jealousy... more like disappointment in myself? Who knows. Every passing day I feel like nothing matters more and more",
