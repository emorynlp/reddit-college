  "text": "Hello, I'm a junior at my college going for a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. I've never really struggled with any of my classes up until this semester. Life and other issues got in the way which made this semester extremely difficult for me. Simply finding time to get stuff done was difficult and I had plenty of late nights finishing homework last minute to have them ready for the next day. My grades are acceptable, could be better, but also could have been much worse. Although a particular class is creating a lot more stress for me than it probably needs to. \n\nLong story short. This semester I thought it would be fun to take a graduate level course as a technical elective, I met the requirements, plus I still needed some prerequisites taken care of to take some lower level electives. I didn't even need to take the course, I just took it to bump up my credit hours to keep busy as my previous semesters left me with way too much free time, and to ease the load during my senior year. Plus at the time I thought it would be nice to have a grad level class on my transcript. Big mistake, this class took up a ton of time and was extremely difficult. Although I did enjoy the class. I failed hard on the midterm, even though I left the midterm thinking I aced it. Now I pretty much have to ace all the remaining homework and final to get by with a C. If I had gotten back my midterm before my universities drop deadline I would have dropped the course. \n\nI have pretty much accepted that odds are I'm either going to get a D or an F in the course. I'm not too worried about it just because my other grades are going to counteract it quite a bit and my high cumulative GPA isn't going to take much of a hit because of this since I already have four other semesters completed. I have never come close to failing a course or even done remotely this poorly, I have gotten one C in the entirety of me being in college. Keeping that in mind when I try to do the coursework for this class and I just panic, stress out, and then can't get anything done. All I want from this course at this point is to at least pass with a D. I sure am going to try to get a C, but that is extremely unlikely. The stress from this has started to effect my performance in other classes which are way more important than this random engineering elective since they are my core curriculum and do effect my eligibility to take future courses. \n\nQuestion is, how would you all react to a situation like this, manage the stress, and just power through it? I am really struggling with this.",
