  "text": "Okay so my mother is going to be on her way to pick me up in about 15 minutes and I have a last chance to take a test before final exams next week. My professor has given me several chances to make up this test but the problem is that i know nothing! Lately, I\u2019ve been going through depression and dissociation and struggle to even do my work causing me to miss school. Today was my first day back after missing her class twice last week.  My professor said I could take the test at 3:00pm (currently 1:35pm), so should I\u2026.\nA.) Stay and Just take the test even though I\u2019ll fail\nB.) Let her know now that I\u2019m going through something and I haven\u2019t studied and that I\u2019m just not going to do the test and leave with mom\n\nHonestly, there feels like no point in taking the test. I\u2019m at my wits end or however you use that phrase. I literally cried the whole morning getting ready for school",

Should I just leave the school without saying anything to my professor (possibly email her later) or should I just give her a quick visit to let her know I can\u2019t stay? PS thank you so much for the kind words, really needed it!",

I've had tests I've gone into without doing any studying or reading for due to lack of motivation from depression and was shocked at how well I ended up doing (even though I thought for sure I'd failed), I didn't get great grades but I barely passed which is better than nothing.",
