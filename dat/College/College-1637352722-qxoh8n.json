      "text": "For loans, the amount doesn't change based on anything except your dependent status (fafsa dependent not tax dependent, it's different) and your year in college. For Pell it depends. Pell is based on your EFC which is the amount your family makes in most cases but it does also take your savings and income into account. If you're independent on the fafsa (which is very rare, you have to be married, have a kid, or be emancipated pretty much) then it will depend on how much you make. So basically, it's unlikely that your income will affect your fafsa unless your income and savings grow substantially. https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/how-calculated",

      "text": "The FAFSA is an application for financial assistance. It is similar to others programs that provide assistance to low-income individuals who require help paying for food, housing, and/or other living expenses. If you earn a substantial income and/or have substantial savings, you do not qualify for assistance from these programs. Similarly, there are guidelines and expectations for the FAFSA. The government expects students to use certain portion of their income and assets to cover their education expenses. They also expect parents to use a portion of their income and assets to pay for the education expenses of dependent children.\n\nSocioeconomic information is collected in the FAFSA form and a score is calculated to represent your financial need. That score is shared with school officials who use it to determine how much (if any) aid you are eligible for.\n\nTLDR  -  The higher your income, the less aid you can expect to receive.",
