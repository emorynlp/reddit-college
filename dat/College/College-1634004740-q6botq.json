  "text": "What the hell am I supposed to be looking for in a college if I'm going in undecided with quite literally no idea what I want to do other than go abroad. \n\nI am currently a senior and the college process has got me wanting to rip my own hair out. I have no idea what I want to study in school let alone what I want my career to look like afterwards I just know that I want to go to college. I really don't have anything that I'm passionate enough about to want to pursue for the rest of my life, or study. The only thing I want to do is go abroad. So what am I supposed to be looking for? It feels like that is not really the most helpful thing in narrowing down schools. I live in New England which is a very college dense area so that honestly makes this whole thing worse. \n\nI have an extensive list of suggestions for schools but nothing I've visited or done info sessions for really grab my attention and no one is really helping me find any sort of serious contenders and with the fafsa out its starting to cause me serious stress and its making me kind of mean everytime I try to figure it out. I keep going back to this idea of why am I about to take on a crap load of debt when I don't even know what the debt is for. But at the same time I know that I want to go to school. \n\nI just need some sort of advice or suggestions on what to do here, please and thank you \ud83d\ude23",

      "text": "You can use your first year in college to explore some options and navigate careers paths. I didn't exactly know what I was going into when I first started. I knew i was interested in bio but then switched my major to health science as I got to know more people. I also have a minor in bio now. I would not stress about choosing a major now because you can always change in the future. If there is a specific college you want to go, search up the majors/minors they have and see what future careers you can do with that degree.",

      "text": "Couple things:\n1) you could go to a community college. That way, you get some time to experiment with classes and see what you like. Then transfer to a school when ready\n2) attend a school with a program to study abroad: some schools can go to more places than others. If theres a specific country, make sure that school has it.\n3) take a career quiz. Honestly, these are kind of just for fun, but there are some really good ones out there. It\u2019ll help you see what you\u2019re good at and at least what you\u2019re like doing.\nBut I mainly recommend options 1 and 2\n\nBut hey don\u2019t stress so much! You\u2019ll find the right major for you once you\u2019re in school :)",

      "text": "Start at a community college first, and take classes that you found interesting or did well in previously. If you can't find any of these, try taking a class that piques your interest and is something you'd be willing to try. Talk to upperclassmen at the schools you're looking into and ask how/why they chose their major. Go to career and academic fairs. If possible, volunteer in an area you think you could potentially be interested in to try out that job. \n\nIf all else fails, career tests are a great place to start. \n\nBest of luck and don't stress. You'll do great.",
