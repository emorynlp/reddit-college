  "title:": "As a student, how does it make you feel when a past professor doesn't seem to remember you?",
  "text": "So with big classes, I don't expect to be remembered. I took many classes though with about 30 or so students though.  Semesters afterwards, some seem to remember me, but when it gets to the year mark (since I last took their course) they don't seem to anymore. None of these are the professors from my major. Those teachers remember me well.  I took them multiple times, but some I also took this French teacher for two semesters (three classes). I would smile and she would smile back or  say \"hey\" for two years afterwards, but I'm a GA now (five years later). I was in her office helping her move things and she was asking me questions like she didn't know who I was lol.   I was a little shocked because she talked to each of us often.  I was shy back then, but she had us speak every day and got to know us. So, I'm wondering if this happens and surprises you sometimes?  If so, how do you feel?",
