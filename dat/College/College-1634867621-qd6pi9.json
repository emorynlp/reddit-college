  "text": "I graduated from a virtual high school earlier this year and things happened that just led to me not taking college under consideration which is why i am now taking a gap year. ever since i was little i wanted to be a vet and until about my sophomore year the plan i had to peruse that fell apart and it left me with not knowing what to do. i just started working about a month ago and that\u2019s all i\u2019ve been doing i don\u2019t really have a plan for what\u2019s next and i know that things come with time but just knowing myself this will go on for so long if i don\u2019t think about something. i don\u2019t think about college often because i don\u2019t know what id study but for a while a major i think id do is journalism. i just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something i actually want to do or if i\u2019m convincing myself that it\u2019s what i want to do so i can say i have a plan. i just feel like i like the idea of it but i\u2019m not smart enough to be able to do it idk i still feel like a kid and it\u2019s just annoying",
