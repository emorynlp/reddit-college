  "text": "I study study some engineering degree in a European country, \n\nWe had to take Chemistry, Biology, Math, Physics, and Mechanics this year, we started having mid term tests starting from mid September to this day. It usually goes like, each subject has at least 2 midterm tests, if you manage to reach 60% on both of the test, you get D as your final grade, and if you don't want D, then you can go to final exams which worth 100% of the grade. Oh, also, in order to be able to go to the exams, you need to reach at least 50% on the mid terms, which means if you don't do well in one of your mid term you fail that class.\n\n\nSome of these mid term tests were ridiculously difficult, more than half of the class fails everytime, and they go the retake, they fail again. Is this how university is? Professors reading their 70 page ppts in hour and a half and take test every 3 week or so? These 3 months passed so fast, but I feel like I don't even understand or learn anything. \n\nIs this totally normal uni grading system? Am I just dumb and lazy? What are your thoughts?",

      "text": "Studying economics in Switzerland. \n\nThe \"test every 3 weeks\" really depends on the prof. I guess. Some management classes take that approach, but most of my classes just give you one final exam at the end of the semester. This approach doesn't surprise me.\n\nThe part where more than half the class fails everytime is accurate, especially at the beginning (first 2-3 semesters). Some argue at unofficial quotas since the grading scheme is adaptive to have a Bell curve.\n\n|Is this how university is?

The part about understanding and learning something really depends on the course (and on you), but that's been my experience during my whole bachelor's degree.",

      "text": "German here, in most of our classes you just have one final exam that determines your grade to 100%. It's been really interesting lurking in this sub and seeing the other systems! \n\n(We have some classes that give regular homework and you need to get 50% to get permission to take the final exam. The final grade however is still just about the exam.)\n\nAdding to this, I've also never heard of \"grading on a curve\" before. For us there are clear rules for the whole university about how many % you need for a which grade and this doesn't change no matter how well your classmates do.",

That paper can be your full grade or a part of it. The finals are twice a year, in january and june  you get a second chance in august. There are some exceptions. \n\nThe interns just require you to do your intern and write a paper about it.",

This means you understand the concepts, but you just need to learn to go faster. You should keep practicing, practicing, practicing those same types of problems, until solving them becomes second nature. Best of luck. You'll do great",
