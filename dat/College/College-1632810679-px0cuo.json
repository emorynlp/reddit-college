      "text": "I\u2019m a junior and I have struggled with my mental health all before and during all of my college experience. My professors have always been super understanding when I shoot them an email about my situation. You don\u2019t have to be super specific with details if you don\u2019t want to; just let them know that you\u2019re struggling and might need some extra help (short extensions, for example). If you feel comfortable, a great option is also dropping by their office hours. Your profs are there to help you - they don\u2019t want you to fail. I\u2019m also registered with my uni\u2019s Student Disability Services which provides guaranteed accommodations that your professors must abide by, so check and see if your school has that as well! Sending you love and support \u2764\ufe0f",

              "text": "I typically just email them and tell them that I\u2019m going through some intense personal issues which are inhibiting my ability to focus on schoolwork. Sometimes, if I feel a good vibe from the prof, I\u2019ll tell them that I have been struggling with my mental health for a long time, and I have support at home, but it still impacts my schoolwork from time to time. Each prof I\u2019ve told has been super supportive. A couple haven\u2019t budged on due dates but the majority are very accommodating. They teach so many kids, and they know that a lot of us are struggling in some way. I\u2019m sure some professors struggle with their mental health too! So don\u2019t worry about being shamed - reach out for help. It\u2019s worth it.",
