  "title:": "Is it possible to raise GPA from sophomore year?",
  "text": "I am a sophomore at a new university, and I finished this semester with a 2.8 GPA. I am planning on going to law school, but now I am worried that I won't be able to with a low GPA - I hope to attend a top 50 school. I transferred to this university with a GPA of 3.3 from my freshman year. Credit wise I am a junior, as I did dual credit, so I have 64 hours but I don't plan on graduating early. Is it possible to raise my current GPA of 2.8 to around a 3.6 to get into law school?",

You\u2019ll need 8 more semesters of straight As (120 credits) to bring your gpa up to a 3.6 overall.\n\nIf the 2.8 is just this semester and you have a 3.3 from prior semesters, the math gets easier. I\u2019m also assuming some of your credits are from AP classes rather than coursework.",
