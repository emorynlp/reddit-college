  "title:": "Am I wrong for not wanting my roommate to have his boyfriend over the room during finals week?",
  "text": "Just for background, my roommate went through a rough breakup over the summer, and it truly brought out the worst in him. He skipped class in order to sleep in all day. He self-harmed. He became desperate for companionship and tried to pursue relationships not only with borderline strangers, but also members of our close-knit friend group. All in all, it was a very uncomfortable thing to witness all year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, he's met a guy on Tinder from the next state over, and things have been moving fast for them. They're planning on meeting up, barring the difficulties that come from the fact that neither of them have cars never mind their licenses. Overall, I'm happy for him, if not for one thing; numerous times when they call, my roommate has repeatedly said that they're guaranteed to have the room to themselves whenever they want, and that he has no issue kicking me out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it were at any other point in the semester, I really wouldn't mind and I would happily give them their privacy. But this upcoming Monday marks the first day of finals week. I don't so much mind giving them a couple of hours to themselves as I could just go to the library, but I'm not keen on sleeping at a friend's room the night before a final.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice on how to talk to my roommate about it? I basically want to affirm that I am genuinely happy that he found someone new, but I'm not about to place his relationship before my final grades.",

(You live in a form, right?)\n\nEvery college/university that I know (for over 20 years I've worked in the student affairs division which includes residence life) has very strict rules in the dorms during finals week. The main two are: addition of quiet hours and no overnight visitors are allowed.\n\nIt this is the case at your school, then you won't look like the bad guy. I'm hoping that you live in the dorms.",

All these can be used to keep someone from interrupting your privacy especially around finals, but in general as well.",

But he made it very clear that it\u2019s my room too and I shouldn\u2019t have to feel like I need to leave. \n\nEven when it\u2019s not finals week, I think it\u2019s inappropriate to ask your roommate to sleep somewhere else for the night, unless you\u2019re very close and it\u2019s a very good reason. It\u2019s your room, you pay for it, and you deserve your own space.",
