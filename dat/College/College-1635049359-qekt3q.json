  "text": "My college tuition last year was completely covered by financial aid, so before filling out my 1040 I called the college's financial office and asked if I had a 1098-T form on file and they told me I wasn't getting one. Couple weeks ago they sent me a 1098-T for 2020 and turns out I had a $400 refund from my FAFSA pell grant, which I didn't report in my 2020 income. Should I file an amended adding this income?",

      "text": "You only have to report it as income if you don't spend that $400 on qualified educational expenses.\n\nAnd it's fungible meaning the dollars are identical and you can use any $400 to pay for educational expenses if you don't want to report it as income. $400 came in from the grant so you either need to report $400 or spend $400 on education. Which source or account the spending comes from doesn't matter.\n\nIf you make under the standard deduction, it makes more sense to just take it as income if aid normally covers all educational expenses. \n\nAlternatively you can use it to purchase a new laptop, meals at school, gas for commuting, etc. These are institutional expenses. There's a big chance you have more than $400 of them. Technically if you have receipts for enough of that stuff you can just treat the $400 is a reimbursement for that stuff and not report it.",
