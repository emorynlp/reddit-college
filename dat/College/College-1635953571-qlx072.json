  "text": "I'm currently a college freshman at a UConn regional campus (commuting from my parent\u2019s house) studying Finance, on track to living on the main campus (Storrs) next semester. \n\nCurrently, I'm having my good days & bad days. I work 25-30 hours per week at my job & go to class 15 hours a week. Add in studying, homework, etc. and it's closer to 60 hours per week, sometimes 70 hours if I'm prepping for an exam. It's pretty grindy, and I'm mostly ok with that. I've worked these kinds of hours before. However going into college this summer, I had aspirations of getting into a top MBA graduate school after undergrad, so a 3.7+ GPA was my goal. & I\u2019ve done somewhat well academically. Granted I have 3 very easy classes with no exams that will be guaranteed A's, but my Stat class & Mircoecon class I've struggled through tremendously. Between these two classes, I've had 4 exams so far and the score has been: 70%, 64%, 60%, & 83%. I feel like I'm very good at doing more grindy assignments, like bs homework and essays, but prepping for exams & the actual test taking is what is killing me. Now granted this winter, work will end and I'll be able to focus on school full time come next semester. But as of now, my whole life feels like misery. I wake up and immediately have a knot in my stomach about the anxiety I have for the day. College just seems so much harder than HS & it's overwhelming. I could end up with a 3.6 at the end of the semester, but I could end up also with more like a 3.2 if the exam scores continue in the direction they're going. & if classes get harder next semester as I predict they may, my MBA aspirations may soon dry up. \n\nLast night I began studying for the 3rd Mircoecon exam and I didn't get too far. This exam covers around 100 textbook pages (4 chapters), and I sat there for 90 minutes at my desk only getting to the 3rd page, really struggling to understand basic concepts. I had the worst mental breakdown I had all semester, cried for about an hour, and gave up for the night, and just laid in bed texting my mom & dad venting on how frustrated I felt. At that rate, it would take me 100 hours to solely read the textbook, not even properly study for the exam. \n\nEveryone at the main campus I know just seems to be partying all the time, and genuinely having a fun time. But for me, I feel like it's a race for me to get all my homework and other assignments completed, so I can free up some time to study for exams. I feel like school is consuming my whole life, and it certainly is something I think about almost constantly even when I'm not working on school work (at my job). I don\u2019t have a gf, and I almost feel guilty trying to hang out with the few friends I have, because I feel like I should be studying. So there are very few things to look forward to at the moment, definitely playing this semester on hard mode. \n\nI'm wondering if I should take next semester off through a leave of absence, which allows my current 14 credits to stay. & I have 7 credits from HS, and taking a couple of summer classes in the future years can still allow me to graduate in 4 years despite taking the semester off. This will technically give me time off from December 17-August 30. Throughout this period would I like to pursue entrepreneurship to see if I can maybe not need college altogether if I can do well with my business. I\u2019ve bought 3 courses, and around 50 books this summer. A mentor I know used the same courses I have when he was 19 and was able to reach $10k per month with his amazon ad agency within 3 months working 10 hour days, 6 days a week. I'm tired of school. I\u2019m not naturally good at it, and my passion for entrepreneurship makes me wonder if the bachelor's degree qualification will even matter for my success in the end. I don't want to play the school game, where I'm at UConn till I'm 23, work for a few years, get a top MBA (if I can even get it) at 29, and then work some mindless high paying job that in all honestly would never fulfill me. College is god awful, I technically feel like I can persevere. But it sure is a challenge for me and I feel incredibly miserable and unfulfilled. I hate taking classes that don't interest me, spending all my parent\u2019s money on my tuition, and even though I study hard and learn, my exams test me more on my memorization & I do poorly no matter how much prep is done. (wrote this fast, so don't judge for grammar) What do you guys think I should do?",
