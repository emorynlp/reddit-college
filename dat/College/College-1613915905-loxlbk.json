  "title:": "Professor won\u2019t change my grade",
  "text": "Sorry this is long but I felt I needed to put it all down. Last fall I took a course and had an A in it the entire way through. A week after I had turned in my final exam and a recording of my presentation (which I had also given live) to blackboard my professor gave me a 0% for both. This was strange since the exam was through blackboard and I got a 94% on it already. He then gave me an incomplete for the semester. I contacted him immediately and it worked out that he didn\u2019t see my final exam and presentation submissions and thought I never turned them in. I sent him the screenshot of the submission date and exam grade and he said he would contact the registrar and have my grade fixed again. This was December. In January I contacted the registrar and no one had received any form from him, so I contacted him. I emailed him twice over the course of 2 weeks and he never responded. I contacted the chair of the department and asked her to step in. He responded to her and sent an email saying \u201chere is the form\u201d but did not attach anything to the email. The chair tried again, and this time he sent another students confidential disability information whose name is close to mine (btw I\u2019m attached to all these emails). After that I didn\u2019t hear from either of them for 2 weeks. I emailed the chair again to try again. It\u2019s been a week and now the professor won\u2019t even respond to her. By now, the registrar had changed my grade to an F since supposedly I never completed the course. I don\u2019t know what to do. Can someone give me advice on how to fix this? I graduate soon and the graduation office is telling me I won\u2019t graduate if I don\u2019t fix it.\n\nUpdate 2/23: I waited just a few more days to see if the professor would reply since I knew he would have class today and maybe he would respond. But he didn\u2019t, so I compiled all my emails to him and to the chair and put them in a word document. I then explained the situation in an email to the Dean and attached the word document to that. She responded literally seconds later and said she\u2019ll get this resolved. Hopefully we\u2019ll get it done soon :D\n\nSecond update: it\u2019s the same day as the first update and the Dean already took care of my grade. I appreciate everyone\u2019s comments telling me to reach out to them.",

That's some serious shit. Don't be worried about causing a scene because you didn't cause the scene - they did. They need to be held accountable for being disrespectful to you (and your time and effort) and irresponsible to the point of breaking the law.

It actually causes more delays and confusion that going through the proper channels to the person who has the authority and mandate to address the issue.\n\nBecause now , instead of dealing directly with the issue, they also have answer a million email chains with 70 people cc-ed (not that you cc-ed i the first, place but all the ones that they also have to keep in the loop) , and that bumps your actual problem to the bottom of my to do list, because I have to respond to those people.  And since this is not their job, directly, now instead of just doing the job and fixing the problem, I also have to explain to everyone what I am doing as I am doing it , .  So instead of going, hey chump, get the grade change form in asap I am not kidding about this or I am doing the override myself, I now have to explain to Sandy in the ombudsman\u2019s office that I am going to do that and to someone in  some other office who says, why am I on the email chain why they are on the email chain.  And more to the point, it falls through he cracks, because then I say to Sandy, you smooth it over with professor chump and I will have X do the override, let me know when that is done, but in the meantime Sandy has gotten 50 other emails and they think someone else is handling it.\n\nYou don\u2019t really know how university\u2019s work.\n\nIt is really best to go through the channels as I said and approach it as I said, more or less, because I am on the receiving end of such complaints, I know how the people I work with view them and deal with them and I know what gets the best and fastest response.  And it its not CC-ing everyone.\n\nIn fact, Sandy in the advocates office is just as likely to say, WTF is this doing in my inbox with the other 200 BS emails I have today, they didn\u2019t even give the dean a chance to respond.  And then IF proper channels do fail, and you really do have to go back to Sandy, the first response is ugh, I already told that person to do X, and it sits around until they have time to read it more carefully, if ever.\n\nAnd the people receiving these emails are human,  And after the 200th time that day you got a full Karen email with everyone cc-ed on it from someone who is being histrionic at best, it makes you look bad, and it makes you eyerolll,  Because usually the people with legit complaints do this in a different way.  maybe it shouldn\u2019t be like that, but it is.\n\nBut sure, with your experience of not being on that side of things, and your one thing where proper channels actually worked anyway, stick with your advice to the death. Better that you dont say, ok I was wrong on reddit , and maybe learn something - better that someone else gets bad advice from someone who is going to stick to their guns no matter what.",

From my (albeit limited) experience in industry, ignoring a problem like this would get somebody fired quickly.   \n\n\nI'm not above admitting when I am wrong on Reddit, admitting to being wrong is a critical skill to have as an engineer. But so is understanding how a system works for everyone involved. You're seeing this from one side of the inputs, I'm seeing it from the other. I'd argue neither of us is \"wrong\" in this case.",

Professor replied that they would do Y \nJune 23 F appears\n\nGet all the emails regarding this matter together and forward them to your personal email, including the ones in your sent box (in case you no longer have access to your school email)\n\nAlso Keep all your submissions and anything you did for the course.\n\nPersonally I would forward all course emails to my personal email also.\n\nIf the course is still available to you, take screen shots or print to PDFs any assignment uploads, all grade book outcomes and other relevant work in case the course closes.\n\nGet the emails regarding this in date order, print them to PDF and concatenate the docs.  You want to make it super fast and easy for the person reading this (who is getting 99 BS emails for every one legit one) to see that this case has merit and is time sensitive.\n\n\nAttach that to your email.\n\nPersonally, I would make the list and your narrative requests not only in the body of the email but also ina word doc.  For one thing it give you a chance to properly proof this, and second, again, you want to make it super clear and easy to the person to take action.\n\nIf you gave me , or my dean, what I just told you (and this is all true) they would be able to act on this fairly quickly.\n\n\nAnd do not wait.  Do this asap,\n\n\nSomething like this actually happened to me as an undergrad, and i don\u2019t want to tell you the nightmares I had because I didn\u2019t follow up faster.\n\nCC the registrar if I did not already say that\n\n\nEdit\n\nFor everyone upvoting, this is specific advice for OP, in their particular circumstances \n\nI just want to make very clear, that this will not work for the majority of people posting complaints, grade issue and asking for advice in this sub.",
