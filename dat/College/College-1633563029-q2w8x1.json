Be it a teaching lesson for him and maybe if he sees how serious the issue is he might be willing to apologize in order for me to withdraw the report",

Honestly it just seems like most people don't take jokes well and haven't learned not to take life too seriously - in the end no one makes it out alive. But it could also be a cultural thing; the college I go to is heavily populated by first/second generation middle eastern people",
