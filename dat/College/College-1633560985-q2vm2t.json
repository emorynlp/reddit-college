  "text": "Med student here, I have fairly good knowledge about biostatistics and how to conduct a meta analysis study. I've published a good amount of papers and currently working on several projects. \n\nIs there any good platforms where I can advertise myself and earn some money on the side teaching those things? Just need to alleviate some of my expenses.\n\nAlso, apologies if this breaks rule 3. I really don't know where to start I need someone to guide me.\n\nThanks in advance",
