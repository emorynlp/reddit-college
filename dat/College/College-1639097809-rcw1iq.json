  "text": "So, I took an ACS exam for analytical chemistry (worth 25% OF MY GRADE) and I feel horrible. I honestly felt like I bombed that thing so hard, but I can only blame myself because I did not study hard enough. Partially it is also due to the professor not teaching us anything the entire semester due to us not understanding him or the information was not relevant to the exam. I only have my final left (30%)...and I am not sure if I can keep going on. I did well on my lab reports though (30% of my grade), but bombed the midterm (15%). The only good thing is that he curves quite generously, but I am primarily scared for this ACS exam since he curves in terms of the national average.",
