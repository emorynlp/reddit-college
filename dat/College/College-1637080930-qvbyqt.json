  "text": "I've been very confused about what I want to do. I'm currently a neuroscience major but I don't really enjoy the material and lots of people have been telling me I won't be able to get a real job -- in business, journalism, etc. with a neuroscience degree. I'm not sure how true this is, especially since I would truly like to be a news reporter.\n\nI chose neuroscience because I was initially planning on attending medical school, but I've recently decided against it because of the insane costs of medical school in the US. I also don't enjoy doing research, which I have only recently discovered. Although I could attend medical school in another country for probably a lower cost, I feel like it would be better for me to just switch my major.\n\nI also don't like the atmosphere at my university and have been wanting to leave here for quite some time -- I only came here because it was my safety school and my parents forced me to attend college right out of high school. I've been yearning to go west for some time (California, Arizona, etc.) but since California schools are insanely competitive for non-residents (I'm PA) I've been considering Arizona.\n\nShould I finish my neuroscience major at a school I hate and try to get a job in broadcast journalism? Or should I just transfer to a school in Arizona?",

      "text": "My understanding is that journalism companies prefer applicants who didn't major in journalism. A stronger applicant would have majored in the subject they want to write about (government, environmental science, even neuroscience) in addition to having experience writing for a paper (ex: college newspaper, internships). Would you want to do science journalism?\n\nThat being said, the best major is the one you most enjoy. I changed majors from biology to government my junior year and it's working out great. You might want to figure out whether it's the school or the major that you aren't happy with.",
