  "text": "Since it didn\u2019t seem like I could petition for a record adjustment, I opted for a petition for refund due to mental health reasons. I posted about failing a class and someone encouraged me to try to petition, so that what I did. I got some new mental health diagnoses and my psychiatrist filled out the form. They said it\u2019d take two weeks to approve but they did it in like 3 days. It\u2019s been great! Still struggling a lot and now I\u2019m failing another class but life isn\u2019t so bad as it was before. Thank you to the person who suggested i do this!",
