  "text": "My college postponed our in-person graduation ceremony to homecoming weekend (which is this weekend) and I wanted to ask if it\u2019s socially acceptable to wear another color other than white? I see a lot of pictures online of girls wearing white dresses but I didn\u2019t know if white was an unspoken rule that girls wear? \n\nI do have a dark grey dress I\u2019d like to wear but I could find a white dress to wear.\n\nMy gown is black if that makes a difference. Thanks I\u2019m advance!",

If so, then the dress color won't matter.\n\nI'm guessing that you're seeing a lot of photos of women in white because those pictures were probably taken during ceremonies held in the spring.  If you're following fashion \"rules,\" then you wouldn't wear white this week as it's after Labor Day.  Not everyone follows that rule, however, so if you'd prefer to wear white, then go for it.\n\nAnd congratulations!",
