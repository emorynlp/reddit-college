  "text": "I recently completed my Associates degree in foreign language through a military school I attended, and I am seriously considering starting an online associate/bachelors program focused on Paralegal studies. For the Associates I just finished, I was able to complete all of the required Gen Ed classes online through Sophia, and all of my main credit hours came in the form of graduating from military language school, so I haven't really experienced juggling a real online college with military duties.  Anyone have any experience trying college while being active duty?",

My unit had a rotation to Korea so I thought what better time to take classes. \n\nIt\u2019s certainly plausible but it is challenging if you aren\u2019t self motivated. Stay on top of stuff. Communicate with professors, especially if an assignment has a deadline that coincides with a military obligation. I was only able to juggle two classes at max, but depending on the courses I\u2019m sure it will be plausible for you. It wasn\u2019t the absolute worst experience, but if my classes were anything more difficult it might have ended worse",
