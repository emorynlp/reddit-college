  "text": "Just venting a bit\n\nI\u2019m a freshman living in the dorms, there\u2019s about 25 people on the floor. I\u2019m cool with most, people are alright and I\u2019m  really good friends with a few people in the hall, we hang out, drink, get food, etc\n\nMy roommates on the other hand not so much. I randomized so it\u2019s kind of my fault but they are two high school besties. Which is cool! I don\u2019t expect to be included, it\u2019s their friendship and I\u2019m cool just chilling in the room \n\nBut what\u2019s recently been making me feel down is that they (well more specifically one of them likes to do this more) bully me. Not directly, which is why it hurts more. I don\u2019t even feel welcome in my room at all. \n\nJust yesterday for example one of my roommates and her floor friends made a floor superlative poll which is fun n all. Results were posted, I took a glance. I got top 3 for \u201cmost awkward\u201d. Only 3 people chose me so like not the whole floor, but i felt so down. I think it\u2019s my roommate and her two friends that put me down, but it\u2019s anonymous so I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nI try to be friendly and I don\u2019t expect to always get along, but it just hurt so much to know people would put my name down for that. \n\nI feel like I give them lots of space; even though it\u2019s my room, I wake up nearly every day and leave 9 AM, and don\u2019t come back till 8 PM. And every time I walk in, their 1-2 friends have their things sprawled on my desk. I don\u2019t say a peep because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll annoy them. I try to be quite and not intrude\n\nI know not everyone will like you in college, but I\u2019m so sick of hating my room. I want to be able to work in there, chill in there, but every time I come they give me glares like I don\u2019t belong.\n\nAgh, anyways, thanks for hearing me out, I just needed to tell someone",

      "text": "I\u2019m guessing the floor superlative poll was in groupme or discord or something. If I was you I would leave the group chat where they\u2019re bullying you and that way they can\u2019t bully you in it anymore. It\u2019s harder if they\u2019re bullying you to your face when you\u2019re in the room because you live there though. But just stand up to them and tell them to stop acting like children.",

You totally deserve to feel at home in your room, and it\u2019s fucked up that they\u2019d make you feel unwelcome like that. Take comfort in the fact that the year is already half over and you\u2019ll get to, presumably, live with different people next year who you actually vibe with and who actually respect you. I hope things get better for you! :/",
