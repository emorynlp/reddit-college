  "text": "So basically I'm a college freshmen trying to get as many gen-ed credits as fast as possible, so I decide to take general chemistry 1 to fulfill part of my science requirement. I currently have a little under a 70 in it, and I want to bring that up as much as possible. (gonna convert to pass/no pass so I can get the credit so long as I pass.) \n\nI know what needs to be done and how to go about it. But the problem I have is actually doing the tasks. I'm not exactly good at studying, and I'd like to change that, seeing as finals are closing in fast.\n\n If anyone can share their tips on doing what needs to get done in order to improve one's grade, I would sincerely appreciate it.",
