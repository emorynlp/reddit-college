  "text": "I\u2019m a high school student in dual enrollment and plan on going to community college and transfer to university to save money. Problem is, i\u2019m not doing the best in this specific DE class. I wanted to know if universities looked at DE credit as much as the actual classes I\u2019ll take as a college student.",

      "text": "Speak with an academic coach about academic renewal. At my college, I have the option to retake a course to get rid of a D I made when I was doing dual enrollment. If you go this route, I might suggest taking the course with a different professor, as they might teach the subject in a way more suited to your understanding. There is also the option to wait (3 terms at my college) and have the grade taken off your record after maintaining a good GPA (>3.0 at my college) in the meantime.\n\nThe university will look at your whole record and consider your cumulative GPA, regardless of when/how you completed your courses. Everyone makes a bad grade here and there, so if it's not a pattern of poor academic performance, you should be alright. But definitely look into academic renewal.",
