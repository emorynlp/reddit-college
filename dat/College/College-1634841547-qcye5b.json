  "text": "I'm an education major and work at a retail pharmacy which is known for not treating workers well or keeping them on long. I maxed out on loans and scholarships but still have about 3000 left to cover both semesters. I can't get a private loan because I dont have a cosigner. I need to find a higher paying (more than 12/hr) but flexible job. What would my options be? I do have my AA and AS if that helps.",

If you go with the first place that will hire you, you might not make as much as you want, but for substitute teaching you should research the highest paying district and try to get in there and for tutoring if you go private you can set your own rate and make a bit extra that way. Both are very flexible.",
