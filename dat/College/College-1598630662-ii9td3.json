  "text": "I was just emailed the syllabus and saw that it\u2019s on a point system where discussion posts are basically the entire grade. There\u2019s a final essay at the end but that\u2019s all. \n\nIn the discussion posts, we have to write a 2/3 page paper and a 2 page response to a student. We also have to cite from the textbook and outside sources. We also aren\u2019t allowed to say the usual \u201cI agree, I disagree,\u201d etc. \n\nI know this doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, but there is nothing I dread more than a discussion post. Anything this is that I\u2019m used to only ever really writing 1/2 paragraphs when doing discussion posts. \n\nI just wanted to know if this was you, would you drop the class or stay in it?",

From my experience it\u2019s not so bad, the student response part sucks the most but generally you can give some recycled bs of a response. Tedious but easy. \n\nIt basically boils down to how you learn best. Do you think writing these posts will have you overly stressed out because it\u2019s boring/tedious? Are you a poor writer?

If it's not teaching or reinforcing any skills, introducing you to new topics, actively engaging your mind, or challenging you to be a better student, then it's a total waste. With how much you're paying for college, there's no point in just paying for an easy A, unless your GPA is really struggling that badly.",

Lol I was taking anatomy over the summer and I needed a couple GE's to have enough hours to qualify for financial aide, so I tacked on an online philosophy class to get the hours and also get the dreaded humanities GE requirement done.\n\nThe prof opened up the Canvas page and I saw that it was almost entirely made up of long daily discussion posts. I noped the hell out of there within like 3 hours of the course being open. Switched to a music appreciation class that I had equally little interest in, but required significantly less busywork. I don't regret it. I didn't care at all about either subject, so the one that took the least amount of effort was the way to go.",

While it was incredibly challenging at the time, I look back at it with fondness as it greatly elevated my abilities to communicate.\n\nActually, your description sounds like the K Series. Is it?",

It sounds like mini papers.\n\nSo instead of looking at this like a \u201cdiscussion\u201d look at it as writing a short paper every week.\n\nIt seems like the teacher is pretty much just having you read the material, then forcing you to actually do it by requiring you to write about it. I know it seems overwhelming, but this is actually pretty easy if you can get into a rhythm.\n\nMy suggestion is to pick two days a week for this class and do all of the work for it then. So on Sunday afternoon, sit down around 3:00 and get the material together. Read through the discussion prompts and decide what you want to write about. Then go through the material and familiarize yourself with it. Craft an outline that is an Introduction that includes the discussion prompt and your overall response to it, then a paragraph for each point you are trying to make and then a conclusion. Submit the work. \n\nThen check back in on Wednesday to respond to another post and use a similar method. \n\nNo reason for anxiety, no one is actually going to read your long post. They will skim it and then respond. Just like you will be doing",

I work full time and spend 20ish hours a week on school. \n\nLast session I took accounting1 and principles in marketing. Accounting had 2 chapters per week. Watch videos on accounting.  Pick a problem from this list for the discussion question and comment on 2 students problem. Per chapter. Then do the assignment and take a test. \nMarketing also had 2 chapters per week and a discussion question per chapter. Videos and power points.  Also weekly assignments. And we had to write a marketing plan for an existing company. \n\nYou know what they don't have? Lectures or printed books. It's all online. I have no idea what's important to remember, so my notes are lengthy. \n\nPlease don't mistake the lack of an in person class as an easy A. If i have a question, i email the professor and wait for a response. No raising my hand and asking a question.",

Everybody was pretty understanding that responses were mandatory so nobody took any disagreements or stuff like that personally.

I stopped caring about crafting intelligent, engaging posts and just wrote up to the lower limit with no editing. \n\nI had another online class a couple years prior that was absolutely fantastic. The professor didn\u2019t care how short or how long our posts were, just that they added something to the conversation. \n\nI only loathe doing discussion posts when the professor is being a dick about docking points (which if I managed to leave something out or fail to answer the entire prompt it totally on me and I accept that, just don\u2019t expect me to also accept being docked points for writing a 315 word post and being under the acceptable word count of 300-500 words...), otherwise I find online discussion based classes to be a great way to pack in extra units.",
