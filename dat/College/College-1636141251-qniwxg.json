  "title:": "Can i ever get into a good master's program in the future??",
  "text": "I am about to be a junior next semester and currently have a 2.7 GPA right now. I also don't go to a very popular college and it's located in the city. I have low grades and I am thinking about either getting into a masters program for applied statistics, economics, or data science. I want to be a data scientist. However, I might have no chance because I got a few C grades in my early math classes and I had to withdraw from Calculus 1 twice. I am also interested in economics and I have a B and B- in the first two economics classes so far. I understand that I screwed up bad but I am thinking about changing my life around. I have a total of 5 w grades and I am thinking about trying to at least get into a masters program for higher education as that I am thinking about pursuing a career in data science or possibly a consulting/financial field like quantitative analysis. I have a total of 5 w grades on my transcript so far and I don't want to end up a failure. I just need brutal honesty. I am currently about to be a junior this Fall and if it's not possible for me to get into a master's program, what are some possible career choices for me? What else can I do? I don't have internships yet but I am looking for some experience in the field so that I can get accepted later possibly. Are online master's a good choice because I was just thinking about that. I also graduate in two years so does anyone have some advice for me?\n\nHow can I overcome 5 w grades and still get somewhere into a good master's program?? I withdrew from Calculus 1 twice due to unfortunate circumstances but what can I do to overcome my mistakes in the past?",

      "text": "I personally don't think the W's are your main problem, it's the GPA. Most everywhere wants it to be 3.0 or higher. 3.5 is competitive in general and higher is expected for top tier schools. Having said that, I HAVE heard of people below 3.0 getting in masters programs from my school, so I know it happens whether people admit or or not. I think it's pretty uncommon though. Work on getting experience in internships. I'm unsure how research works in your major, so I don't know if it applies, but many majors expect you to have research experience. Perhaps you could volunteer/intern/work in a university lab doing data analysis for their projects? Try to build connections and get  excellent letters of recommendation.",

You have 2 years to intern, work, and build your grades up.\n\n I don't know by what you consider \" good \". If you meant something like an ivy they're just hard to get in for anyone, and they usually take from schools that are high end like the other poster was saying.",

Im in the same boat even if I get a 4.0 at my college it is not renound enough to get me into the good business schools. It sucks but the system is just structured how it is. By good I mean Chicago, Madison, etc (I'm from the midwest as you can probably tell). I know Madison has a minimum of 3.0 for graduate school.",
