  "text": "Someone might have posted this before, but I would appreciate any thoughts/advice you can give me.\n\nI graduated my Bachelors in Naval Engineering on 2014, with honors. Since then I have been working in the Shipbuilding industry. I like my job, but I cant help thinking about my what ifs\n\nI enrolled on the program because I just dont know what to study once I graduated high school. But on my sophomore year I discovered i like my civil engineering subjects more than my major ones, to the point that i put more effort on the former than the latter.\n\nBut I couldnt shift to another program during that time because I was running for honors (if I shifted I will be an irregular student, school policy). \n\nThing is we are not rich. I am not rich. I came from a third world country with wages so low other countries would laugh. If I pursue a second degree I will never ask my parents to pay for me. \n\nMy brain is telling me that I should just give up because i need to work, need the money. I am also worried about being behind, of starting again. But I kept on thinking about this for years, always had this what ifs in my head. And I feel like down the road I will regret not pursuing it.\n\nIve told my family and friends about this, and they are very supportive. But even now, as i scroll thru google searching my options, I am still in doubt.",
