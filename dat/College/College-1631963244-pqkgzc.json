  "text": "At first, when I saw his Instagram and photos I thought he was a normal guy like anyone else and in fact I saw that we were born on the same day and month. At no point did I think I was going to have a problem with him. But the first day started badly ... First, he asked me if I was gay or atheist. I answered him no (although I am an atheist) and he said \"We are going to get along well then.\" \n\nOf course I didn't pay much attention to this; but he literally never buys food and eats what I buy, he wears my clothes and my cologne (he asks my permission but I don't say no). \n\nThis in itself had begun to fill me up but the end came when he invited his girlfriend and they had sexual intercourse in the kitchen (or so I think because I did not want to look). The worst thing is that later he came and told me that I should get used to it and when I answered him badly for the first time and I said \"Go to the room next time\" he told me that \"he is free and that I am an envious virgin\". (Lol I'm not a virgin but I don't understand why he uses it as an insult and I'm also asexual). \n\nWth do I do now? I am shy and I don't know how to act and be more decisive.",

If you're going to continue complaining about how you're too shy or how afraid you are that other people won't believe you, go elsewhere. We're here to offer you advice, not to let you wallow in self-pity. \nAbout nobody believing you: You posted this, and we all believed you without question. You are the only one who has this fear, so don't worry about people not taking your word for it.",
