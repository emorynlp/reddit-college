  "text": "After graduating high school, my parents asked me what I wanted to study in college, I had no idea at the time about what I want to do with my life, so I said I\u2019d study commerce\u2026 I have no background in business, I\u2019ve been a science student my whole life. I\u2019m so fucking stupid and I don\u2019t know how to get through this.\n\nI can\u2019t switch majors because it\u2019s expensive and we\u2019re already on a tight budget, I don\u2019t like my subjects which makes focusing on studies so hard when I\u2019m distracted with trying to find alternatives to college\u2026 I want to start working at McDonald\u2019s because then I\u2019ll at least be making back the money my parents have wasted on me\u2026 \n\nI\u2019ve been considering going to University of the People and studying computer science, but I switched to business because of how bad I was at compsci in the first place. \n\nPlease help I don\u2019t know what to do, I don\u2019t want to kill myself but at the same time all I feel lately is hatred and self-loathing. I can\u2019t take another 2 years of this shit.",

Are your parents at least willing to listen to your feelings? You need to express to them the agony this is putting you in cause this is absolutely no way to live. If they aren\u2019t willing to, then go to your schools counselor (if you have one) or to a professor and express to them how you are feeling about the major. I have gone to my professors in the past about having different interests and they pushed me to change majors. If your school has the major you are interested in, go speak with the professors that teach for that major. They will encourage you and get you motivated to switch. Hell I even had one calculate how much less it was gonna cost me to change mine. I\u2019m not sure why your parents are making this a big deal cause it\u2019s really not. People change majors all the time. If it\u2019s a big enough problem, take out some loans or drop out. This is YOUR life. Yes money may be a pain in the ass but you can\u2019t waste your life over it. I can assure you, you will feel 10x better if you go talk to someone and not let this stay in your head. Believe me.

In the meantime, does your school have any clubs involving film/tv production? Or even jobs involving media for the school? You could ask about that as well. Show your parents how passionate you are about it and that might make it easier for them to understand. \n\nAlso, the expectations on high school kids to know exactly what they want to do is ridiculous. Especially when they are just starting to be more independent. This is the point in your life where you are finally finding out who you are and what you want to be. It\u2019s better that you do this now rather than realize 3 years down the road that you aren\u2019t happy with what you\u2019ve become. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this.",

I had done nothing of the sort and felt behind even though I just got there. The content I was learning was crazy rigorous and boring. I didn\u2019t care about the work I was doing, I just wanted to do well. Then came the toss and turn of the major change. I kept mulling it over but didn\u2019t do it right away. \n\nDuring my sophomore year, I realized I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I was MISERABLE. I decided to change my  major to communications. I couldn\u2019t be happier and my mom was super supportive. Please don\u2019t do something you hate. This is YOUR life and YOUR time to shine. I absolutely get the tight budget thing. College is so expensive when it shouldn\u2019t be. Maybe you can find some scholarships or apply for the FAFSA if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nTo end this long message you didn\u2019t ask for, I\u2019m so sorry that you feel this way. You deserve happiness in everything you do. I hope things work out for you! Sending all my luck and good vibes.\u2728\u2728\u2728",

It could be possible that you change your major to information systems (if you're passionate about compsci?) And cross credit your current major points as electives. You may also be able to make your current major a minor, meaning you have less courses to do over all but have not wasted your current progress. \n\nHowever, if you are suffering severe mental health consequences, dropping out is a good alternative until you are in a better head space. \nIf you have any further questions or need some help navigating your options I'd be more than happy to help.\n\n Cheers.",
