  "text": "Hello, I\u2019ve been a General Manager at Dairy Queen for two years and I have a bachelors Degree in business management. I was wondering if anyone had any job ideas. I don\u2019t want to manage restaurants my entire life. I started at Dairy Queen because I thought it would be great to have General Management experience for a resume but now I am ready to move on. Does anyone know some good jobs I can switch to with my experience and degree that is at least $52,000 a year salary? Or 25$ an hour? Please help me I don\u2019t want to be in the restaurant industry anymore.",
