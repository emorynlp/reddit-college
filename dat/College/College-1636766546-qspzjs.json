  "text": "I\u2019m a first year college student in the US and I\u2019ve noticed a huge influx of spam emails that I get on my school email (outlook). We used outlook at my school in Canada too and I didn\u2019t get any spam emails ever. I don\u2019t give out my school email or use it on any sites. It is strictly for school. I\u2019m not even sure how some of these places I\u2019m getting emails from even got my email. Like I\u2019ve had emails from the US army trying to recruit students and I\u2019m an international student. Is getting a bunch of random spam mail on your school email the norm here in the US?",

      "text": "There's likely a public facing student directory listing your email. You should be able to opt out; contact your school.\n\nUnfortunately, spam on US university emails is common, especially phishing trying to get your credentials and fake jobs from fake professors. It works too well; my university on many occasions has been blocked by Microsoft's firewalls because an account was compromised and spamming, meaning we couldn't send mail to anyone using an Outlook or Office 365 email.",
