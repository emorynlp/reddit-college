  "title:": "Question about APA formatting for Tweets",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nSo I am writing a paper about defense strategies utilized by individuals associated with 2017's Fyre Festival. I have been citing a bunch of different tweets from Ja Rule that were all written on the same day -- January 20, 2019. I have been citing each one in-text as (Ja Rule, 2019) and citing them appropriately in the reference page. However at this point I have 6 in-text citations of (Ja Rule, 2019) each referencing different tweets. Is there a better way to indicate which citation is which in the text?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "You are citing it correctly. so thats really all you can do. when you are referencing a tweet just make sure you do it in a way that makes it clear what tweet you are talking about. like don't quote multiple tweets and then later say \"Ja Rule's tweet received a lot of pushback (Ja Rule, 2019)...say \"Ja Rule's tweet about the food at the festival received a lot of pushback (Ja Rule, 2019). His other tweet about influencers was retweeted 2 million times (Ja Rule, 2019).\"..",
