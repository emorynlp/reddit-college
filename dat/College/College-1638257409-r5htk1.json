  "text": "Tomorrow is the last day for submitting a college application. I am struggling with selecting my major. My goal after college is to run a small business. I currently flip items I find through OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace. Mainly electronics for the most part because that is the market I know best. I am not 100% sure what type of business I would like but I had the idea of a pawn shop in my mind. As well as a boba shop. Which degree would be best? If neither then what other degree in business would be the better option?",
