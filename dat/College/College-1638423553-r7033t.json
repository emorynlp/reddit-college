  "text": "Some people might hate this question. \n\nI\u2019ve put in 2.5 years of college at a 4 year university away from home. Of course, I\u2019ve studied hard and made sure to keep my grades at around a B+, A-.\n\nI\u2019ve also joined Greek life, partied a ton, the whole deal. I just feel like 99 % of the people I\u2019ve met are super fake, and some of them really being genuinely messed up people. More drama, cheating, and games than in high school. (Not EVERYONE I\u2019ve met is bad. I\u2019ve met 1-2 genuinely cool people).\n\nI\u2019m grateful for the good and bad experiences that college has given me but it gets to a point where I question if this ExPeRiEnCehas been worth it or just a waste of time.",
