  "text": "Some people might hate this question. \n\nI\u2019ve put in 2.5 years of college at a 4 year university away from home. Of course, I\u2019ve studied hard and made sure to keep my grades at around a B+, A-.\n\nI\u2019ve also joined Greek life, partied a ton, the whole deal. I just feel like 99 % of the people I\u2019ve met are super fake, and some of them really being genuinely messed up people. More drama, cheating, and games than in high school. (Not EVERYONE I\u2019ve met is bad. I\u2019ve met 1-2 genuinely cool people).\n\nI\u2019m grateful for the good and bad experiences that college has given me but it gets to a point where I question if this ExPeRiEnCehas been worth it or just a waste of time.",

Most of my college has been online (which i prefer). The last 2 years of my bachelors is at uni commuting and ive joined 2 clubs so i get like half of the experience. I never wanted the full college expetience because id rather be alone than be surrounded by crowds of fake people. You dont have to continue doing that for the rest of your college time. Leave Greek life, join a regular club or 2. Meet some normal people and make the most out of plague college while you can.",

Maybe you thought that is what you wanted but you were just forcing yourself to hang around people you actually don't even like? It's ok to do different things. What are your hobbies, like if you read, join a book club? Maybe find a college group around a certain interest and you may find better suited for you.",
