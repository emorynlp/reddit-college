  "title:": "I'm 26, and college is too hard. I feel like giving up.",
  "text": "I just registered for my fall 2020 classes, and am already overwhelmed.\n\nI'm still considered a SOPHOMORE at my age, and it's extremely frustrating when everyone else is graduating with their masters at 24!\n\nMy biggest issue is that I used to take two courses per semester because I have ADHD, and get side-tracked so easily. I go from studying to thinking about what I should eat for lunch, and my mind goes on an adventure. Next thing you know, two hours have passed, and I didn't get anything done.\n\nFull-time semesters are HELL for me, and I recently changed majors from nursing to software engineering. The only way I can get out of college on time is if I tackle full-time semesters instead of just two courses, but how on earth are people surviving 12+ credits when they're dealing with calculus and upper level programming/engineering classes?? How do you manage to not fail taking these overwhelming classes all at once?\n\n**EDIT: Seriously, I thank every one of you for your comments. Your thoughts and advice alone make me feel encouraged.\nI should add that I am not getting any professional help for my ADHD. For some reason, I feel shameful in asking for drugs like Adderall because I don\u2019t want people thinking I\u2019m just trying to boost my way through college with the help of stimulants. Another HUGE issue of mine is insomnia. It\u2019s currently 4:18 AM, and I can\u2019t sleep (this is the norm). I have constant racing thoughts, and it leads to day time drowsiness. Not sure if I\u2019ll ever get a college degree. I guess it\u2019s time I get some professional help for my health issues. But aside from that, THANK YOU FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT. It\u2019s so genuinely kind of you all.**",

But when the time came and I had to do full-time, I did. In fact, my final semester, I took 16 credits (6 classes) and graduated this spring. If I did it, so can you! Believe in yourself! Enjoy it!

      "text": "Stick with it. There is no ''Time-line\". You'll pass your classes, you'll graduate, and you're going to get the job you want. You just have to be patient and not worry so much about the future or any external factors. I'm 26 right now and a Sophomore in college as well. My major is in Finance with a minor in Computer Science. When I'm done with this, I'm going to get my Masters in Accounting. I was just like you, comparing myself to others and letting things distract me. I have a wife, a 2 year old son, and we are all living in one bedroom at my wife's parent's house. My wife and I were both in the Air Force, but we got out and now we are full time students. I have plenty of distractions and worries, but what helped me is to really think about what it is that you want to do. What is it that you ACTUALLY want to do, not something that sounds cool or that makes you look smart, or that will make you the most money. When you focus your thinking inward and decide what YOU want for YOU, it makes focusing on whatever you need to do to achieve that much easier (i.e. studying). I'm currently carrying 16 hours per semester and I'm not taking breaks. I finished this past Spring semester with a 3.5 GPA, then went right into a Summer semester carrying 16 hours, got a 4.0, and next week I start the second module of the summer semester, carrying another 16 hours. After that, I'm going right into the Fall semester, and I plan on doing this until I'm finished with my college career. YOU can do this as well, just focus your thoughts, figure out the path that is really right for you, put it in your mind that you CAN and WILL do it, and the rest will fall in line. If you don't work out or exert yourself physically, start doing that, it'll help with sleep. I suffer from severe anxiety and would wake up 2-4 times a night, but I started running and now I sleep like a baby, it also helps with my thoughts. Build some mental toughness and focus. You can do it!",

      "text": "Hey, 39 yr old undergrad with ADHD.  You changed from a really difficult major to a really difficult major. I burned out trying to do software engineering during my Jumore year back around the turn of the century. Went back after almost exactly 20 years, because manufacturing is ...well, manufacturing.  I'm taking business classes and I have to say it's quite a bit easier even with a full time load. You might want to try out accounting or economics. They both have enough complications at the higher levels to remain interesting. And the math is scaled way back. It feels like sandbagging a little, but it's kind of nice stressing over whether it's an A or A minus versus doing the same math problem 10 times because your brain decides to randomly check out. But, either way don't give up, in the current system you'll work your ass off making somebody else rich(unless your lucky or etc).",

      "text": "I have ADHD and anxiety, I\u2019m also doing a double major in chemical engineering and chemistry, here my tips.\n\n\n1. Take advantage of your schools disability resources, they\u2019re they\u2019re for a reason and did wonder for me. My school didn\u2019t give any extra time but gave me a private space to test so I didn\u2019t get distracted. \n\n2.  Take more classes. This one sounds counterintuitive, but you want to graduate on time with minimal debt. Don\u2019t jump from a part-time to full-time schedule right away, but work your way up. First, add a libed, then each semester add a few more classes. Keep in mind your liberal arts classes are *much* easier than your STEM classes, so they can be nice to add at first to ease into the idea of taking more credits. Just make sure not to anger the prof, since even though those subjects have really high grade inflation the professors impression of you affects your grade. \n\n3. Try to get a full 8 hours of sleep. I took sleep medication to help with this, but now I can do it most nights. It works *wonders.*\n\n4. Try to get habits. Go to the library to study at a set time, even if you\u2019re not studying the whole time at first and get distracted. 15 minutes of studying out of 45 of being at the library is better than nothing! \n\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s some of what I did. Lmk what you think. You can always take medication as well, but I tried to stay away from that, only using it the week leading up to finals season and during finals.",

Now, I'm sure my life differs from yours quite a bit, I focus on my health before I focus on anything else throughout my day to day, which includes my meal plan for the day, supplements, hygiene and set time to be in the gym in the evenings which work around my work schedule as well as a set time to run in the mornings. I believe that my overall physical health determines my mental health and keeps me in line throughout the semester. Again, this works for me, may not work for you.

      "text": "Here's some advice: \n\n* **Never go to class without studying ahead on that day's lesson.** You will understand a lot more when your professor talks about it and it will keep your interest when you're able to follow along. Otherwise, you're just wasting time going to class getting lost and not understand a thing. \n* **Review your notes and re-study after class.** This is to reinforce the information you gain so you won't forget it as easily. This way, you won't have to study nearly as much later on.\n* **Studying some everyday > cramming last minute.** The subject area you're pursuing is not something you can cram last minute and still do well. It requires constant and consistent practice over time to understand. Resting period in between is very important because it allows the information you absorb to settle down and become knowledge.\n* **Warm up to your activities.** There will be times where just don't feel like studying or practicing. But start with some easy stuff that you know you can solve just to give yourself a small confidence boost just to get things going. Then work your way up to the main stuff.\n* **Practice coding on your own.** This isn't something that you can read about and wing it when the time comes to get tested on it. Practice makes perfect. Practice also generates confidence.\n* **Practice math problems on your own.** Same thing as coding. Practice, practice, practice. \n* **Don't be ashamed about meds when you actually need them.** It's not an advantage when you're taking them to cancel out the disadvantage. Make sure to consult a medical profession first. Taking meds designated for somebody else is not a wise idea.",

      "text": "First of all, you need to recognize that, regardless of your ADHD, math classes are going to be harder for you because of your age.  I am a college administrator who has done extensive analysis on student success, and I can tell you that students who take calculus 1 right after taking some kind of pre-calculus course in high school understand the material 2X - 3X better than those who didn\u2019t, and of those students who take calculus 2 immediately after calculus 1 do 3X - 5X better.  \n\nMath is not like other subjects.  Think of it almost as a \u201cworkout\u201d for your brain.  If you go years without working out, and then you pop on some 200lbs weights onto the bench press, you\u2019re going to struggle, and the reps that you do put in aren\u2019t going to be as effective as they would have been had you started with something more reasonable.  Also, just like the guy who spent years away from the gym, you might feel like giving up, but now is the worst time to do so.  The other guys at the gym aren\u2019t \u201cstronger\u201d than him, and they aren\u2019t \u201cgenetically superior\u201d to him, they\u2019ve simply been at it longer and more consistently.\n\nIt gets easier, trust me.  You have to put in effort every day though, and you can\u2019t give up or take a break.  THAT\u2019s the hard part.  Once you\u2019ve gotten used to it, trust me, you\u2019ll wonder how you ever managed to struggle.\n\nPS:  Have you ever looked into programming boot camps?  As someone with ADHD myself, that seems like the direction I\u2019d go if I were you.  It\u2019s super intensive, fast-paced, and no \u201cBS\u201d.  At the very least, I think it would be a great way to catch up quickly, and get yourself into a position where you could hop back into a traditional college program much better prepared.",

Tons of hours with a therapist, family therapist ect, with the help of Adderall.. at the age of 41, I've finally found my groove.  \n\nDaytime sleeplyness/drowsiness is common among us.  I'm the one person in my family hopping out of bed at 4 am (think Stan Smith, American Dad style) of a morning....and I'm needing a nap by 3, and crashed for the night around 8.\n\nAsk for help.  Ask.  Demand it.  Ask about medication.  Be willing to try different kinds/doses until you find the right combo.  Some ADHD folks swear by Ritalin, and for some (like me) Ritalin turns me into a hot mess.  Others swear by Adderall.  Figure out what kind of accommodations you need.\n\nThe only people who should know what drugs you are taking for your ADHD is you, your dr and any mental health professional you choose to work with. In other words, unless there is a reason someone needs to know what meds you are taking and why-there is no reason to tell them and let them think whatever the fuckity fuck they want to think.\n\nYou might want to have a frank talk with each professor at the start of each term and say I have ADHD, so I may need you to explain something to me again during office hours or a wee bit slower.  do you know of any study groups or tutors that can help sort of conversation.\n\nMake the tutoring dept your best friend.\n\nDon't take a major (like nursing or software whatever) just because \\*you should\\*  find the major that grabs your attention, and sustains your attention naturally, and yet challenges you.  If it's music, history or even art history.  Take that.  Calculus class?  Haha.  very funny.  I can't do that kind of math.  I can't.  My brain....no.  And thats okay (by the way, speaking of math, get tested for  Dyscalculia - a math based learning disorder that a ton of ADHD people have.  Not everyone is cut out for that kind of math, but then again, where one person struggles with history of art, they have a great talent for calculus.",

But I do believe we all have our own time. You can't compare yourself to someone who was able to go to college and be successful straight out of high school. We all have our timeline. All that said, I will be 30 in a few months, and I just graduated last week. It took me a long time to recognize that the age thing didn't matter. Also, I think I was better prepared for college just being older. I have another friend who is 36, is almost done with her degree and plans to head into a master's program next. She gives herself so much grief for being older, but I think there is a lot of value in being an older student. \n\nYou might also try to take classes part-time. Check-in with disability student services, check-in with financial aid. There was one quarter I only took two classes. Several quarters I could only manage three. Four was hard as heck and I felt like I just completed assignments, but didn't really learn much. \n\nMost importantly, just take it one step at a time. You can do this. <3",

But just keep reminding yourself about why you want to do it. \n\nI attempted college 3 times, eventually gave up and joined the army, got medically discharged, waited a few years to try college again and got back into it. It's sticking this time. What changed is that I found a career that I can feel passionate about. So at 30 I started all over... None of my previous credits transferred to what my major was. Chemistry made me want to quit... I failed it, but I knew I couldn't get to do what I wanted if I didn't just get through it... 2nd attempt I got an A. I made the dean's list 2 semesters. \n\nDuring this time I learned about ADD/ADHD (when I was a kid I was diagnosed, but my parents thought it was BS and hated the way the meds made me). So I got professional help, went to counseling every week for a year, got a proper prescription, and it turned my life around. Don't worry about what people think about it... If they want to think less of you for something you can't help they're not worth your time. \n\nTake challenges one step at a time. Even a little progress is still progress. Don't quit!",

      "text": "I\u2019m 52m, my career added up to nothing before starting on meds in my mid-forties (I finally took the plunge because my second marriage was on the rocks). Here\u2019s my take on the meds:\n\nIf a diabetic told you they were ashamed to take insulin because they \u201cshould\u201d be able to manage their symptoms without it, and taking the insulin demonstrated a shameful lapse in character, what would your reaction be? Or if someone with a thyroid condition did the same?\n\nBefore I started on the meds, I felt it would be admitting failure \u2014 when I was already a failure \u2014 and I was worried that I \u201cwouldn\u2019t be me any more\u201d if I took them. \n\nI guess it\u2019s been about seven years since then. In that time, I have started a second career, and despite having no college degree (I couldn\u2019t focus enough to fill out applications), I am now a pretty sought-after management consultant. I\u2019ve created a ton of content for my firm and am working in a book and a side hustle that was profitable after a few weeks. I have an idea for a startup and am talking to engineers to begin validating my business plan.\n\nI\u2019m still married. Partly that\u2019s because I am *more* myself than pre-meds. I always had integrity at a deeper level, but would forget to go on appointments, not follow up with brilliant people who wanted to work with me, forget birthdays, anniversaries, etc. When we live from a place of integrity, we are more whole, and the potential we sense inside us can begin to connect to the world, provide value for others, and garner rewards for ourselves.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is: I\u2019ve walked the rocky road you\u2019re on, and it sucked for decades on end, it\u2019s a dark and dead-end street. I know I\u2019m a stranger on the internet, but I get what you\u2019re going through, I can feel the shame and confusion, the sense that you are somehow really smart and deeply broken at one and the same time. Step onto a different path, admit you have something like diabetes, a chronic neurotransmitter issue. Step up, be strong enough to admit that you haven\u2019t \u201cgot this\u201d, and become who you were always meant to be.",

I was a junior salesforce admin for a few years and i got in and hired via internship, no degree. While many of the people from India I worked with were extremely accredited and carried one or more degrees, I also worked with many Americans who had never gone to college for software engineering and were mostly self-taught. \n\nIf you could teach yourself, build a portfolio of all of your work, submit applications/resumes and attatch a portfolio of your work to the resume. Engineers are in extremely high demand right now (and probably always) so you should just spam all the applications you can and something is bound to stick. \n\nGood luck!!",

If you want to go to college, then go and keep working at it until you finish - however long it takes. Too many stimulants isn't helpful either but a cup of coffee in the morning has been known to help people focus. It's amazing what Adderal can do for you and it's worth trying for a couple of weeks under the care of a doctor. More than 11% of teens and young adults have ADHD in the US so you're part of a big group that is known to benefit from Adderal. \n\nImagine what you could do if you knocked out the ADHD obstacle?! Knock out each obstacle - one at a time - and you will be on your way!",

Everyone goes through college at their own pace. What's important to remember is you are working towards your goals and the people who care about you are so proud of you for doing that. Hell, I can't tell you how many times I wanted to quit because college was so hard for me. I had been in college since fall 2014 and graduated with my bachelor's this May. I attended four different colleges in that time, retaken quite a few classes, and struggled with anxiety. But I did it. And you will too. Be proud of how far you've come so far.

I had friends in college with ADHD and getting help with it was a key factor in their success.\n\nSecond, do what's best for you. If you think that's continuing and making it through the rest of your classes \"on time\", then do that. If you need to take time off, do it. Even if you feel quitting is what's best, do it. My wife spent 6 years getting a degree she hates and doesn't know how she'll use. She always says she wishes she took a short photography program instead of going to uni, but her mom pressured her that she HAD to go to college. Don't make snap decisions, but take some time, assess your options (continuing, going to a trade school or other college, staying but taking longer), consult people you trust, and do what is best for you.\n\nA final note on \"how do people take full time engineering courses and not fail?\" I graduated with mechanical engineering, and I failed at least 3 of my classes and had to retake them. It happens, look at what went wrong, and what you need to change to do better and succeed next time.\n\nSorry this post ran so long, but I wanted to get this out there since all the other posts I saw were just \"I did it, why can't you?\" And \"never give up, no matter the cost\".

The best thing to do is contact your school's admin and see what kind of support they can offer you. I started college in 2009 at 28 and through one tumultuous marriage and 3 schools I still didn't complete my degree. Now 8 years after my last school I plan on going back and this time I'll be taking advantage of the support that i can because I now know what will happen if I don't. For me personally I need to do hands on stuff so I've gotta find classes that are either abstract in thought or allow me to physically do things so it keeps me focused. That's why I've thought about going back for my psychology/criminal justice degree or getting into computers but I can marry computers to criminal justice as well... Either way though i know I'm going to take a more proactive role in my education if I don't want a repeat of last time....",

I feel like I have to do my best because I\u2019m the youngest in the program and won\u2019t be taken seriously by the others. \n\nThere is a plus and a minus to every situation. I think it is best to focus on what is the best for you. You feel overwhelmed and that is okay. There isn\u2019t like a competition to the suffering Olympics and it\u2019s okay to need help. Have you sought out accommodations with the office of disabilities/special needs for your condition? They should have resources and guidance for you. There is also counseling from the counseling centers or look for help in finding healthy ways to cope. Unfortunately I knew many classmates that would drink to ease their stress and I wonder how many turned into alcoholics. That isn\u2019t healthy. I hope you get help and I\u2019m wishing you the best.\n\nPersonal advice. I took 6 classes my last semester of my undergrad, commuted over a hour, worked 15-25 hours a week, and applied to grad school while making the presidents list with a 4.0 GPA. How I managed? I asked for help. When I had questions for exams I would email or ask specific questions regarding the material. I make my own person study guides for each subject. I thankfully have my own study and would listen to music. If I got frustrated I hit the gym and loved Zumba for fun. I also had to study for the GRE and MAT at this time. I went to the library to get *free* prep books and practice questions. At work when I had free time I would look over questions and my personal study guides. Read your notes after each class. You can even ask to record your lectures? I commuted and listened to videos explaining topics so I used that time wisely. I knew others that would listen to lectures on their commutes. It\u2019s challenging, but being creative helped a lot.",

I think this is because although our classes meet 4-5 days of the week rather than 2 (I think that's standard elsewhere?), we still typically only have 1 homework assignment per class per week, so the workload isn't technically higher than elsewhere (to my knowledge)",

This alone helped me to stop feeling stupid and validate why I have always had to work a little harder in school. Additionally, I was prescribed a prescription to help with my ADHD, while it is only 5mg, that is enough for me. Since I work with my school's Student Support Service, I am able to schedule my classes before other students which helps reduce the anxiety I have about deadlines such as that. I also get an updated letter to my profs every semester to give them a heads up of what supports I may need. An example of this might be that I need access to the material earlier than other students in my class so I have more processing time. Additionally, the letter also includes time and half on tests so I have more processing time which has honestly been the biggest help.\nLet me know if you have other questions!",

      "text": "Listen, college isn't that hard. I know that this is a controversial thing to say especially given your diagnosis but if you budget your time and focus, you can get through a lot.\n\nHere's what I recommend you do: create an hour by hour breakdown of each day. First, start with your needs. You need to sleep (and yes, you should schedule 8 hours of sleep each night) and eat. Carve these blocks out as you can't study when you are sleeping or focus very well when you're eating (I like to watch youtube when I eat so I would generally carve out 30 minute blocks for breakfast and dinner and then an hour for lunch).\n\nNext, put your classes in the schedule. Also put anything that you need to do (e.g. work if you have a job). You will also need to commute to school. Time walking/driving isn't time you can study, so also etch these out in your schedule.\n\nNow, determine when you are going to study. If you need breaks, figure out when to schedule your breaks in a way so that you can stay focused during your study hours. Remember, for every 1 hour in class you should schedule 2 hours out of class. As a sidenote, I know that they say for STEM the ratio is 1:3. I did not find this to be the case as some courses were closer to a 1:1 and others were a 1:3. It averages out to about 1:2 in my experience.\n\nAs some background, I dual degreed in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, minored in Physics, wrote two research publications, and still managed to play college Rugby and train 10 hours of MMA per week once I stopped playing Rugby. It **all** comes down to time management. You can be the most brilliant person in the world and you will still do poorly if you do not put in the work.\n\nI know I am probably going to get downvoted for this post, but I sincerely wish you luck and highly recommend that you create a timetable. College isn't that hard and I find my time in the Army to be much more draining emotionally and physically. Good luck!",

A lot of EC's that I did (e.g. IEEE) were related to my major. You will also function way better with 8 hours of sleep, I think that is why so many people do poorly in college. You will be much better off if you spread out your studying throughout the week/semester rather than lose out on sleep and try to pull an all nighter.\n\nAs a complete side note, I'm in the Infantry Basic Officers Leadership Course (IBOLC) for the Army right now. When we are out in the field we probably get 4 hours of sleep per night. I can definitely feel the decrease in performance and mental fog.\n\n>I major in computer engineering and struggled hard my first three semesters with weekly clubs being my biggest extracurricular.\n\nJust like with studying, you should also allocate time for the things you love. The 10-12 hours that I was training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai were dedicated just for that. It increased my mental health a lot. Now granted, that is where all of my free time went. I gave up a lot of my TV and youtube hours in order to make time for that hobby but I loved it. I can't wait until I get to start training again.",

I felt like my potential was wasted and that the intelligence my teachers raved about was false and that I was disappointing everyone. Started drinking, a fuck load, dropped down to 2-3 courses a semester while everyone else my age were going full load, graduating on time, and going to law school or med school.\n\nWhen I went to get treated for my alcoholism they decided to refer to me to a psychiatrist to see if there was an underlying psychological condition contributing to my addiction. Turns out I have moderate to severe ADHD, and the alcohol was both a way to self medicate my symptoms and deal with the pain of doing so poorly in life. I was prescribed Vyvanse at 30 mg a dose and it WORKS WONDERS. Your official diagnosis will also get presented to the University\u2019s accessibility services, who will provide accommodations such as deadline extensions, private rooms for writing exams, and technology grants for things such as Dragon Naturally Speaking. I thought I had no future man. I thought everyone who said I\u2019d make it in life was dead wrong and that I had no choice but to live a life of mediocrity. I have had ONE semester so far under treatment, and was able to do it at a full course load and didn\u2019t have a grade lower than a B.\n\nIf you have not been diagnosed or are not being treated for ADHD, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO GET TREATED. I can\u2019t stress this enough. I went from a 2.4 GPA to being accepted to my choice education program. Being medicated feels like someone untied the hands from behind my back. I\u2019m finally hitting my full potential at 24, but I\u2019ll always regret how many painful years I spent in pain wondering why I couldn\u2019t achieve success. If this sounds like you at all, please go get treated. If you need any advice please send me a PM. It would be my most sincerest pleasure.",

In select years of elementary and high school, I was actually placed in special education for a few years because I got assessed for ADHD. High school sucked for me. I never got ANY work done, and even my vice principle was shocked that I graduated. My mother rejected the idea of mental/learning disorders, so I never really got the treatment I needed while young.\n\nCame college, I did much better. I'm currently a 4.0 student, but because I'm going at my own pace (and who wouldn't be able to get good grades while taking only 2 classes some semesters?).

My attention span is that of a pea...\n\nI am so curious to know what kind of cognitive changes stimulants cause for each individual. Has your sleep pattern been affected at all?

                      "text": "Yeah like you and I are a lot alike, I did so poorly in my classes because I\u2019d start with 5, and slowly drop the ones I wasn\u2019t keeping up in, and then not doing as well I\u2019m the two or three I was keeping because I had already expended so much effort. It makes sense to do less because the ADHD makes focussing on tasks that require mental concentration near impossible for us.\n\nYou being diagnosed as a child is phenomenal. I tried getting in to see a psychiatrist and was frequently told my symptoms weren\u2019t severe enough to warrant it, so I went undiagnosed for years. It wasn\u2019t until my excessive drinking to the point of liver damage that the system deemed my case as severe enough to warrant a psychiatric assessment. That\u2019s when I was diagnosed and prescribed medication, Vyvanse at 30mg.\n\nTo answer your question on stimulants, I have found the following effects take place on myself, on the first day I started taking them:\n\nPositive:\n\n- A great deal more energy. As someone who was depressed because of my life situation, and tired all the time from self medicating with weed, the energy boost was a great help when it came to getting things done. The doctor specifically said not to focus on the energy boost, but it\u2019s kind of hard to ignore.\n\n- Less thinking. By that I mean when my ADHD was really bad, I\u2019d wake up thinking about how much I had to do that day, which would make me anxious and I\u2019d usually wind up getting almost nothing done as I procrastinated the shit out of everything. With the medication, the energy boost would kick in, and my mind would quiet down a bit and I wouldn\u2019t think about what I needed to get done - I would just do it. My first day I took the medication and hauled my ass into the bathroom for a shower, and when I got out I was suddenly motivated. My room is filthy? I cleaned it without hesitation. Then I did the bathroom. And the kitchen, and laundry. Then I went and started studying and catching up in my courses. Which brings me to\n\n- More motivation. I was able to not only make it through four weeks of course material, but it was like my brain was unlocked. Before I felt like I was spending most of my energy getting through the work. Now it was like I was spending all my energy processing all the information at full capacity instead of constantly getting distracted, the work was no longer fatiguing me, in fact it was giving me more energy. I was craving more knowledge on the subject, I wanted to read more chapters, take more notes, I was having imaginary debates with nobody on concepts I had just learned and having a blast with it. I\u2019m 3 courses shy of Polisci degree, and while I\u2019ve always enjoyed studying politics, I never ENJOYED studying politics until I started taking that medication.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-it is a stimulant, and vyvanse and adderall are from the same family as methamphetamine. It can be very easy to abuse if you don\u2019t follow your prescription exactly, and it is very susceptible to theft. The stimulants can make it so that you can\u2019t fall asleep but can also help make you tired at the end of the day. By this I mean you need to take it in the morning when you wake up, generally no later than 10am, preferably earlier. The later you take it the harder time you\u2019ll have falling asleep. But if you take it early enough, the effects will wear off by bedtime, and you\u2019ll have expended a great deal of your energy throughout the day as a result. This means you need to maintain a fairly strict sleeping schedule. Mine is extremely delicate and can be thrown off really easily.\n\n-it causes you to lose your thirst and appetite. You\u2019ll find you\u2019ll straight up forget that you haven\u2019t had any food or water all day at 3 in the afternoon. You can get dehydrated and underfed rather quickly. Your body still needs to eat and drink, but you won\u2019t get those natural queues from your body as strongly as before. It\u2019s best to eat and drink a lot at breakfast and take your medication with it, so you have a great deal of energy for the day.\n\n-it will increase your sex drive. Why is this in the negatives you say? Judging by your username, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a girl, so whether it\u2019s a positive or negative is up to you. But for any other guys out there reading this, I have found that erections are more difficult. This side effect has gone down a great deal, but the increased sex drive not as much. \n\nPlease remember that this is just my experience with taking stimulant medication, and that there are a large number of different dosages and medications that will each react differently to your specific physiology. If you find side effects too strong or that the medication isn\u2019t working as intended, talk to your doctor. It\u2019s best to try them a week at a time until you can settle on one that works for you.\n\nThanks for your kind words! I\u2019m starting a bachelor of education in the fall, I hope to be a teacher so I can help younger kids with similar difficulties manage them as early as they can so they can lead their most fulfilling lives.\n\nAnyway, take care, and do let me know how it goes if you take the medication route and find you respond positively.",

I can relate to your experience. \n\nThe first time, I wasn't medicated. I struggled to pay attention in class, constantly missed deadlines, forgot stuff for group projects, and was just demotivated overall. When I went back to finish my degree, two years ago, I had been taking medication for a couple of years (Vyvanse 30mg). And let me tell you... It was night and fucking day. My experience was a 180 degree difference from last time. I started with two classes (because I was scared to fail like last time), and gradually worked my way up to full-time, 5 classes semesters, on top of working 60-hour blocks as an emergency dispatcher. I'm convinced that had my ADHD not been under control, it would've been an absolute nightmare, and I would've dropped out after a semester or two. \n\nBasically, what I'm saying is, if your condition is severe enough (skipping meals to study and catch up on understanding concepts, attention span of a pea, etc), definitely talk to your doctor, and try again, but this time with medication.",

Knowing that the reason I am behaving the way I am due to ADHD and just having the skills to deal with it now has completely changed my life. \n\nThe Non stimulant drugs are not addictive and there are a few you can try. If you worry about dependency then talk to your doctor about it and you can form a plan with them to help hold you accountable with your meds.",
