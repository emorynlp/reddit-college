  "text": "I\u2019m about a month into my freshman year and so far I\u2019ve been friendly with a lot of people, but have really only connected and been close with one other person here, and now they\u2019ve dropped out and left. It fucking sucks. I\u2019m super lonely now, and I\u2019m not the type of person that likes being part of large friend groups. I like having 1-3 close friends. Now I\u2019ve got nobody. I guess I\u2019m just venting but if you have any advice I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "well first thing is that if they were that important to ya, keep in contact. I would say don't close yourself off to new opportunities and new friendships just because the one good one is gone now. You have at least 3.5+ more years to meet people at school. Try finding people in your major since you'll be seeing them a lot and maybe by being in the same major you automatically click on certain things.",
