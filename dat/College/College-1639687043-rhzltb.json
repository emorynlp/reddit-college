  "title:": "Regardless of the general consensus, how you start a semester matters",
  "text": "I always hear professors and other students say that how you start doesn\u2019t matter if you can end strong, and I just wanted to say I disagree with this, and how you start matters.\n\nI started this semester with a grind mentality, and started off super strong, by the time midterms came around I had a 4.0. Boy did the next few weeks really set me off course. Because of a mix of family implications and overloading myself with classes, work, and clubs, I went 2 weeks where the highest grade I got on anything was a 61. \n\nMy start this semester absolutely saved me, and walking into my math exam I felt better knowing I needed a 40% to pass, rather than some who were in an unfortunate situation and needed a 75%+ which isn\u2019t realistic. \n\nDespite what you may hear from people, it\u2019s easier to go down then it is to go up, start strong in your semester and don\u2019t trust that you can catch up later, you can\u2019t. Definitely my mentality  as a freshman and it hurt my grades first 2 years. Find motivation to start strong so when that end of semester wave hits you may be able to afford slack.",

      "text": "Although I generally agree with this, it definitely depends on the class. Some classes believe it or not give a lot of opportunities for better grades later in the semester or dump a lot of the heavy points towards the end (in my experience, esp with my ENGR class). \n\nAlso, needing a 40% to pass is great but needing a 75% isn\u2019t unrealistic at all either. I feel like actually most people end up needing a 75%+ to pass or maintain a good letter grade and a lot of people achieve that. Depends on the class again though and how hard it generally is",

Then both my grandparents ended up passing away in the span of a few weeks and my mental health got pretty bad. The second half of the semester I was just focused on surviving each day. Going into my finals knowing I maintained good grades was so helpful because I knew I was going to pass all my classes even if I did horribly.",

There was no chance to recoup those points; you either got them when they were offered (and they were basically handed out freely; no one I know who made all classes that first month got anything less than all the possible points) or you didn't.",

I was never good at either and I\u2019d usually do terrible at the beginning of the semester which made it much more difficult to bring up my grade towards the end. Doing well and starting strong in the beginning really cushions the blow in case the middle/end of the semester starts going downhill. College isn\u2019t like certain high school classes where you get a ton of assignments to help pad grades. College course grades are usually predicated on a few key projects and exams which makes it much harder to bring up the grade at the end of the semester.",
