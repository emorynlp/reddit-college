But I paid a lot of money to get all I could out of those classes, and what may have appeared to some as me just wanting to hear the sound of my own voice was really me filling in the gaps in my own knowledge and bouncing ideas off of an expert. Instead of worrying about what other students do and how other students look in class, try and get as much as you can out of class. If the outspoken student is ruining that, that is one thing and is worth addressing either to the student or prof. But generally in my experience this is not the case, and quieter students are odten either shy, unprepared, or not willing to put themselves out there, which isn't helpful anymore than it is helpful for someone to interrupt with trivial stuff all the time.

They weren't hard questions. Probably something she literally said the answer to not even 1 minute prior, but nobody ever answered.\n\nBack in school, they had those popsicle sticks with the names on them. Probably not practical in college with all the people who cut, but I'm sure someone has made an app somewhere where people can log in and the teacher can use it to randomly call on someone. They could even use it for attendance and participation points.\n\nEven pointing at someone and saying: \"Hey you! Yeah you, answer this question!\" Would be better than just putting it out to the group and hoping someone would answer.",

Imagine going to the trouble of attending office hours, hoping to catch just a few minutes to talk about your grades, and then finding out you'll have to organise a separate time because one kid just refuses to leave the room. \n\nI would never stay in my supervisor's office without having a question for them. There are other conversations he needs to have that I have no right to listen to. There is work he needs to mark that I have no right to see. Professors cannot (under regular circumstances) close the door of their office if a student is in there, so the door being open doesn't mean that discussions are public. ",

Some students just aren't going to want you there whilst they're asking about the course content. \n\nYou can say that you asked them if it was okay or that you were happy to leave if they'd told you to, but that's just paying lip service to the problem. There are so many students here anxious over what they'll wear to class, how they're supposed to say hello to someone, and how office hours are even supposed to work. You can't reasonably expect them to stand in front of you and the professor and directly ask you to leave. It's a very confronting experience for someone who is so private they don't want you there to begin with. \n\nYeah, they should probably organise a separate time, but if their question will only take 30 seconds then it'd be nice for them to be able to slip in and out without needing to go through that rigmarole. Office hours are also not usually just for your class and not just for your work. They are a promise that the professor will be in their office, for *anyone* to talk to.\n\nYou usually share that time with all years, all courses, all graduates, and also all faculty. If that time was truly like another class then it's a different case and can't really be discussed as \"office hours\". ",

There was a presentation where business attire was mandatory and he just showed up in a t-shirt because he thought it didn't matter.  He wasn't allowed to do his presentation.  I hope he got a zero but he probably turned in his work and got partial credit.",

I took a different Professor this semester specifically because I heard the one I would originally have taken has a class requirement of dressing up once a week and I heard this Professor specifies that women aren't dressed up unless they're in heals.\n\nI walk 30 minutes to class every day. That's not happening in heals. Even if I packed heals, the walk can still be pretty sweaty (especially on hot days with 30lbs of supplies strapped to my back) and I wouldn't want to lose out on points for not looking \"put together\" due to a sweaty walk.\n\nNow, once or twice is no big deal, and I agree this kid should've been docked for not meeting that requirement, but having to do that regularly often means more than the jacket blazer combo for half of the population.

I didn't even know it was such a big deal, because I figured \"if a job can require women to wear heals, a professor probably can too.\" So I just figured it was an extra inconvenience for commuters who walk, but if it's as serious as the responses are saying, it's absolutely something worth bringing to the attention of higher ups.",

But I'll most likely have much more flexibility for seasonable wear than my male counterparts.\n\nBut I agree shorts can look quite nice on men. I don't know why it's seen as unprofessional. I used to work at a very small men's designer boutique and in the summer, the guys would wear shorts and they always looked dressed up (ironically, I was always in a hoodie because my \"office\" had the a/c in it) the job didn't require dressing up, but I suppose the men felt that if they were wearing what we sell, they were like walking models for the product... But, anyway, they would wear loafers and white or khaki shorts with usually an Oxford collar, sometimes a sweater. They all looked like they were going to a yacht party or something. Definitely changed my perception of what \"dressed up\" can mean in the men's department.\n\nBut if we're bringing up pants inequality, let's talk pockets \ud83d\ude09 we need pants equality all around!",
