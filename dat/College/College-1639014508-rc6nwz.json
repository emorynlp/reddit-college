  "text": "I have a 1 Jan deadline for some of the schools I'm applying to. Thinking about writing a professional LoR myself and presenting it to my boss. Do you all think this would be in bad taste? My thought is it saves them time. If anyone has a good way to approach this, I would appreciate it.",

The guy told him to write it himself and he'd sign it. My family has always provided model recs since then anytime we need to ask for one. Do it.",
