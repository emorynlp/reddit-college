  "text": "I shit you not, these apartments look like something that came out of an apocalyptic movie. Paint chipping, metal rusting, window shades crooked and falling apart. The inside has molding carpet, appliances breaking down, multiple and unexplainable smells wafting within the hallways. Not to mention the online ratings talk about how awful management is and how they try to take every cent of you that they can. And yet, it all costs a fuck ton of money. \n\nWhat the hell is going on here? Are we supposed to live like pack rats and eat ramen while force fed information into our brains that will make us a \u201cuseful\u201d tool in society? No normal human being could live comfortably like this. It\u2019s just sad and dehumanizing.",

I tried to get out of my lease and they were going to evict me smh. They had several yelp reviews with pictures of the mold and in some apartments it was pretty bad. I never saw these I was just invited by a friend to be her roommate so I did it. \n\n\nI then moved out of that into non student living and it was a pretty big change. I got lucky cause the apartment was actually cheaper than student living but better, a lot better. So maybe if you can find something away from campus, the drive sucked but to me was worth it. No mold, no horrible neighbors I could hear screaming and partying at 2 am. No crap management.",

      "text": "I want to pitch in with a story from last year when I was living in a shit hole like what you've described.\n\nI lived in one of these college-outskirts-homes.  It was shit when I moved in.  Blown bulbs and old crappy dim CFLs, paint falling off the walls, shitty blinds on the windows, mold in the walls and ceiling of the bathroom, place hadn't had a deep clean in a long time, tub was cracking, sink was leaking, and many other little things like rusty rails and doorknobs and stuff.\n\nWhile I was living there for college, I was fortunate enough to have been working and I was financially stable.  I was also happy to have a hobby of fixing the place up in my free time because I didn't go to parties or anything.  My roommates didn't complain at all.\n\nSo, I started with the little things.  Bought some brighter and lower-power LED bulbs to replace every bulb in and around the condo, even the ones outside.  The place immediately felt way less dangerous at night with the new porch lights.  I then deep-cleaned EVERYTHING.  I went room to room starting with my bedroom.  I cleaned the walls (which I thought were beige...  They were white underneath.  Fucking EW YUCK GROSS.) and the crappy tile floor, taking special care in cleaning the ceiling as it was brittle plaster of paris.  Then I went to the kitchen, then the bathroom, then the living room.  My roommates' bedrooms were up to them to clean (which they did not).  Walls and floors and ceilings cleaned, behind and under and inside the fridge and behind and under the stove, cleaned the oven, literally threw out the fucking microwave and installed a new one (over-range microwave, which I was surprised the place had, but it was shitty and didn't work right, so I invested the $60 into a newer nicer one from eBay).  I spackled and repainted holes and chipped paint on the walls (luckily the walls were just plain white so color-matching was super easy and all I had to do was carefully blend the repairs into the existing paint).\n\nI cleaned the shower drain.  Like, REALLY cleaned it. That smelled bad and was slimy and horrible but I was happy that it was clean after. Used bathroom caulk (I forget exactly what stuff I used but it worked like a charm) to fix the cracks in the fiberglass tub.  I managed to match the color of the tub pretty well with the caulk but the tub was more or less a lost cause and had to be replaced (which I did not do lol).  The tub was leaking into the floor below, so luckily I solved that problem with the caulk.  The landlord refused to fix the problem himself.  I replaced the faucet in the bathroom sink.  It cost me about $50 I believe, again from eBay nice and cheap, and worked flawlessly after installing it.  Way better than what was rusting away there before.  Final step was de-molding the walls and installing an better exhaust fan.  The ducts were totally clogged so I concocted a wire brush cleaner thing out of some wire hangers and a toilet cleaner, and unclogged the blockage (it was a bunch of lint and dust and shit).  Yes, I wore a respirator and gloves and the whole nine yards to be safe.  Installed a cheap new exhaust fan, sanitized the whole bathroom at the end, and voila, a mold-free bathroom for years to come (hopefully).  At least, it was mold-free from then until we moved out.\n\nLast major thing I did was replace the fridge.  This was a big one and I asked the roommates to pitch in.  We bought a decent stainless steel Samsung fridge to match the stainless steel microwave.  It came out to $200 from Facebook Marketplace.  Not half bad!  Old fridge got us about $40 in scrap money, too, which went into the new one.  The reasons hat we replaced the fridge was because it was extremely noisy, sometimes didn't work at all and tripped the circuit breaker often.  (I isolated it to being the fridge by freezing a bunch of ice packs and using that to keep the food cold in the fridge for two days leaving it unplugged.  Breaker never tripped.  Plugged it in, two hours later the breaker tripped.)\n\nAnyway, the end result after about a month and a half of renovations thanks to me being way too ambitious for my own good ended up scoring us nothing other than a nicer living space than the other apartments around us.  Landlord didn't give two shits about my improvements, and while I was glad he didn't reprimand us for not asking permission first, I was also mildly upset at how indifferent he was when I had him take a look at our renovations.  He had a huge \"whatever\" mood about him.\n\nI was planning on living there again but COVID struck and my learning went remote, so it wasn't worth it to keep paying for a condo instead of living with my parents for free and with better perks like gigabit internet and free food etc.  But hey, the next folks will enjoy a very (relatively speaking) nice condo.  Our quality of life while living there was far better because of what we did and it took a lot of stress out of school.  Made us actually happy to come home to our condo after class because it was a comfortable, well-lit, clean living space.\n\nMoral of the story is that if you put in the effort to learn and act on having a nice living space, it is totally attainable.  It's not as easy when you don't have a source of income that's enough to both pay rent and pay for cleaning supplies (the new hardware was bonus in my eyes, wasn't *needed* but was definitely a quality of life improvement) but it's definitely worth it to put in the effort to at least clean the place top to bottom and keep it clean.  It may be a polished turd, but it's better than a shit-looking turd, I guess.",

We keep our apartments in good condition for numerous reasons, but I can tell you why these people don't.\n\nTheir market is heavily dominated by students. Students will typically put up with sub-optimal renting conditions and are largely unaware about what rights they have as tenants.\n\nIt sounds like you are describing class C apartments. Typically a few decades old and in need of repairs/renovation. I would assume that the landlord thinks the cost of those repairs is too expensive in comparison to how much they could increase the rent with them. A lot of this is dependent on the location and market. \n\nWhat state is this in? Landlord is typically responsible for mold and peeling paint. They are often not legally responsible for appliances since those are not part of the house (though nice ones will still take responsibility for it), but they are responsible for the related infrastructure (pipes, electric wiring, outlets, etc.).\n\nYou should give written notice to your landlord about the mold and paint. You will have the legal right to deduct rent to cover fixing it yourself if they do not fix it in a timely manner. I would highly suggest calling your local government for the right information based on location. If you don't know who to call you can probably get sent in the right direction by calling the general city hall or city administration number.",

Naturally they will pick something as close to campus as they can possibly afford.\n\nThe owners of these apartments know this and will charge as much as they possibly can for as little as they can legally get away with.\n\nI personally never understood the whole \"getting out of the dorms\" thing. There's plenty of opportunity to do what you're not suppose to under the RA's noses if you just exercise the smallest amount of caution. And in my experience a lot of RA's let a ton of stuff slide if you're being discrete.  Also if you're really in the market to cause THAT much of a ruckus then you have the actual police to deal with.  As long as what you do is not super insanely bad having only the school to deal with serves as somewhat as a buffer between you and serious trouble. In the dorms people were constantly getting stoned and drunk and doing dumb stuff. When I moved to a cheap apartment later in life some college students were lighting things on fire and throwing it off their balcony. I called the cops because it was a dry summer and things have caught on fire before. Cops came and instead of setting them straight they all got arrested because they apparently had drugs out in the open when the cops came. I'm thinking it was more than just weed because I didn't think they actually would haul you off to prison for just weed unless there was like a ton of it.",

Living on campus comes with having to spend $6000 on a mean plan each semester and the food here is so bad and unhealthy.

So even if I use my entire balance, I'm losing money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I share a bathroom with 10 or 15 people. It isn't cleaned nearly enough and smells or is visibly dirty. And I can't even replace a lightbulb on my own. I had to fill out a work order for a flickering light. The maintenance guy showed up at a random time while my roommate was in class (zoom) and made a ton of noise, didn't fix the problem, and made the entire suite reek of cigarettes. There's also the occasional annoyance of someone on your floor getting way too drunk, passing out, and being taken to the hospital by campus police at 3 am. Then yelling at them for 20 minutes. Then the RA calling their parents on speakerphone. My roommate somehow managed to sleep through that one, but I didn't get any sleep lol.
