  "text": "Hey, I've been looking for a roommate in the NYC area with my apartment off-campus, but so far I've been really unsuccessful in finding someone who is a student of the city and the same sex as me. Responses have been very minimal, only receiving responses from people in their mid 20s-30s (parents wouldn't allow that, obv). Considering I've posted in multiple FB groups, three different roommate websites, and Craigslist, is this b/c the semester already started?\n\nThe apartment is 1 bdr 1 bath, reasonable price, etc. Should I keep trying or wait until closer to Spring?\n\nI'm kinda frustrated.",

      "text": "What's wrong with having roommates of the opposite sex or older? I always lived off campus with older people and people of the opposite sex.  When I was 18 and a freshman I lived off campus wifu a 22 year old guy, 25 girl and a 3rd person(a guy) who was 27. It worked well! This was also in nyc btw and I'm a girl.",
