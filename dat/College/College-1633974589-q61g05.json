  "text": "I need to write an email to my professor regarding my current standing in his course and WHY i\u2019m not doing so great. I need to convey to him that i\u2019ve been very depressed and suicidal lately and it\u2019s caused me to fall behind on my work. The problem is, he makes it really difficult to want to talk to him about these things. The other day he sent an email about how disappointed he was in the people who were failing/are close to failing his class and how we should feel bad about it. In that same email he said for the 10 of us who\u2019s doing bad to reply immediately to his email about what we can do to pass his class and I never responded because I saw it so late. That email really made me feel awful because i\u2019m definitely one of the ones doing poorly in his course, as well as my other courses, so now I don\u2019t really know how to talk to him about what\u2019s going on. Any help or advice on how to go about talking to him about it would be greatly appreciated",

      "text": "First off, hugs \ud83e\udd17 friend. I am so proud of you for sticking through with even when your mind is telling you awful things. You are worth so much more than your grades and the hurtful thoughts in your head. Please seek out help if you haven\u2019t already, friends, family, on campus counseling, national help lines. I know it\u2019s easy to feel alone but you are not alone. \n\nIdea for the email:\n\n\u201cDear Professor X,\n\nI am disappointed in how I have performed in your class as well. I am currently going through something very personal and it has taken a toll on my ability to do well in all my classes, not just yours. I realize that something needs to change in order for me to do better. I know that there is still time for me to turn things around and do well in this class. Here is a plan I have made and intend to follow. If you have any suggestions on what has help previous students, I\u2019d be willing to hear those as well.\u201d\n\nYou do not need to go into details about your mental health unless you believe that confiding in him would be beneficial. If you are in counseling or seeking help, you could add something along the lines of \u201cI am seeking help with my situation and I expect it to improve\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m expecting my situation to improve soon\u201d.\n\nAs for the second part of the email, he wants you to write out a plan of improvement. So what are you going to do to catch up in class? Here are some ideas\n\n-complete all late work \n-go to the tutoring office \n-go to office hours \n-ask questions when you have them\n-complete your work early and have a TA/the prof look over it if they are willing\n-dedicate specific time to studying for this class\n-ask him for help/advice on what it takes to succeed in his class\n\nGood luck friend! You can do it and it will be okay! \ud83e\udd17",

      "text": "Hey first of all mental health always comes first before anything whatsoever in school, and your result in whatever class this buttplug is teaching is not the end all be all of things. There\u2019s always a way out. So I cannot emphasize this enough, mental health > anything regarding that class. Talk to someone about your current situation (friends,parents, school counselling) it can literally be anyone just to alleviate the stress and pressure a little. Now for that email, even if your prof may seem inconsiderate, I\u2019d be as honest as possible with him. Tell him why you\u2019re doing bad, ask how you can do better, strategies, advice etc\u2026 and if he discards this I\u2019d seriously complain to the school. \n\nMental health first tho!!",
