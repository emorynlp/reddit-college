  "text": "So I transferred some college credits to my university. I am currently planning to transfer to another university for spring. My question is will those credits I transferred appear in my official transcript with my grade? When I applied for another university I typed in my transcript now they\u2019re asking for my official I\u2019m scared I fucked up and should\u2019ve just entered both transcripts separately. I have been trying to get in contact with my university but won\u2019t have an answer for my until Thursday. I want to know ASAP, have any of you dealt with this?",

Often they can decide your admission status based on unofficial transcripts or you just inputting grades but you will not be able to matriculate unless you supply the originals.",

          "text": "Well the reason I didn\u2019t enter those transcripts is because the last semester I was at the community college I didn\u2019t do so well because I took a bunch of classes I didn\u2019t need so I didn\u2019t take them seriously(long story). I had already transferred the classes I needed to my university so I didn\u2019t care about my gpa at the community college. I go to a private university which is super expensive and now I\u2019m trying to transfer out to a less expensive university. I didn\u2019t want my shitty gpa at community college affecting my acceptance at the university I applied for, but yeah I fucked up",
