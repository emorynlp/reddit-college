  "text": "So one of my classes is a one credit class that usually meets on Wednesday. For Veterans Day, because we have Thursday off, Wednesday is suppose to be a Thursday schedule so Wednesdays classes will not meet. Well my professor is still making her Wednesday class required and people are expected to present a presentation worth 30% of our grade. \n\nAlso, on a day we had state wide power outages and school was canceled, she opened an online assignment that was due that night. Even though school was canceled and many people didn\u2019t have power. \n\nShould I report her? She hasn\u2019t been listening to anything the university has been saying.",

I am confused.\"\n\nIf you get advice from faculty, follow that advice. If you can attend both Thurs and Wed classes on Wed, do so. Otherwise follow the academic calendar.\n\nIf there's consequences from this, then you can report it.",

                  "text": "Yeah.. My advisor just told me to speak to the professor.. like my professor is gonna listen to me.. I\u2019m not sure if it actually goes against guidelines, but it\u2019s not fair that all my other Wednesday professors had to cancel their class and she didn\u2019t. Like you would think that professors would need to plan accordingly to obey the academic schedule. But I guess the students can just suffer the consequences of their professor not planning correctly. And why should I have to speak to her about this? Isn\u2019t it the professors job to know when they are suppose to be teaching or not?",
