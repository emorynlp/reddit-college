  "text": "I have \u201cfriends\u201d on campus but I never actually hang out with them. I see them around and we bullshit for awhile but that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve tried inviting them to things or getting involved in things and it just never works out. It is getting more and more difficult to sit in a lunch room all by myself surrounded by people. I\u2019m constantly talking to people I know when I go on campus but none of these relationships feel genuine. I\u2019m tired of reaching out and would just want somebody to think of inviting me for once. Does anyone have any suggestions??",

I've found out about all kinds of events going on from following them, and it'd a quick way to meet new people. Go to your school gym or join a casual sports. Don't hesitate to join school related Discords. We're in a weird transitional time, but keep trying!",

Most of the people I have met have felt not genuine. I tried joining an men\u2019s org and got denied so that\u2019s always a nice feeling. It feels like all I do is homework, work, class, workout, take care of myself. On weekends I have nothing to do and am just bored. One thing I realized is that you only need one or two genuine close friends to do ok in life. Too often we see ppl on Instagram with a bunch of friends and we compare our lives to them. That version we see most likely isn\u2019t their reality. I just keep hoping that maybe one day I will meet someone genuine and when I do I will be sure to hang on to them.",

Now that we're back in person, it feels as though people are reluctant to interact with each other. Maybe it's from the isolation and trauma from covid, but it's just so much harder to talk to people in my classes now.",
