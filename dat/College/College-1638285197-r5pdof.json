      "text": "Not a professor but I have some experience teaching, and I can only speak for myself. I don't think about how individual students do, but I do think about how the group as a whole does. If the group as a whole does much worse (or better) than I expect, I reflect on why that is and I consider if there is anything I could have done better as a teacher to help my students. \n\nI don't think about individuals at all, to be honest. Everyone has good days and bad days so I wouldn't think to judge a person based on their performance on one exam.",
