  "text": "Lol so we took a class last week and we come into class and he tells us that just bc you got a bad grade  doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t recover and this test is only 15% of your grade and says he waited to post the test grades so no one would just drop the class without him talking abt it. He\u2019s a pretty funny guy and I like him a lot but his test was really hard I just thought it was funny. I got a 38 on the test RIP luckily there was a curve and I did extra credit to make it a 63 but I think I\u2019m in for a sad ride after this :,)",
