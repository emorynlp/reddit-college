  "title:": "How do I get a girls social media without being weird",
  "text": "So for the past few weeks when I meet people including boys and girls. I try to get both their snap chat and Instagram (cuz I need more followers lol). Whenever I ask a dude(I'm a guy btw) they are chill with giving me both their ig and snapchat at the same time. But however with girls they seem more hesitant.  Idk if im being weird by asking for both socials or if im asking for it the wrong way. I use say 'can I get your Instagram?' After I get their snapchat, but I don't say that anymore cuz it makes me sound creepy and like a scary lil bish. So now I say 'lemme get your IG' after they give me their snapchat but that hasn't really been working that effectively cuz now the response I get is \"I dont use/have instagram\" (ik damn well their lying to, like boy aint nobody tryna stock you lol) or they give me their Instagram and never follow me back or accept my follow request. So now im wondering if it would be better to say \"Is it cool if I could add you on instagram too?\" after I get their snapchat. Ik its kinda weird asking for both social media at the same time, so I might just be better off asking only for IG (to boost up my followers), but nobody really uses instagram to text it mainly snapchat or imessage. Please help!!",

      "text": "Quick answer: it\u2019s gonna be weird. Ask for all the socials you want initially and specifically ask the to follow you back. Shoot your shot and be the creepy lil bitch you were made to be. Every person is different so the worse thing they can say is \u201cno.\u201d",
