  "title:": "I cannot adjust in my current college.",
  "text": "I recently moved to a university over 1000 kilometers from home. However, I cannot adjust to this place. I am lonely all the time and have barely any friends. Everyone made friends online while I did not. I cannot communicate well, I keep fumbling and mis-speaking all the time. There are few activities I am interested in that I can do here. Everyone else here seems to be having fun. I don't know what to do. I cannot afford to buy a ticket home, even if I could, there's little chance I would be able to. Please help.",
