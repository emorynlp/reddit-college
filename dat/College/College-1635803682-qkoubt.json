  "text": "I asked a professor if they could write a letter of recommendation for me for graduate college because I enjoy their class and how they teach, but because I have only done one class with them they said no. No interview or anything. Which is understandable I guess, but I had many professors write me a recommendation with just 1 class.I transferred so I can't really take many classes with the same professor, but I never missed class, I have a 3.8 GPA, I'm in honor societies and it just upset me that they didn't even want to get to know my educational background. I know it sounds spoiled, but idk, I just really wanted their approval I guess.",
