I always use the bibliography tool built into Microsoft Word. It makes it super easy. I wouldn\u2019t trust it if my professor was strict on proper formatting, but in general it is quite helpful and saves you a lot of time.",

However those tools will always turn out a crap product. You have to at least be willing to treat it as a rough draft, make revisions as necessary, and then turn it in.\n\nAre you typing the references from scratch? If so, don't do that! Use Google scholar or CrossRef.org to generate citations - they aren't perfect and will require some fine tuning, but they sure beat typing everything up yourself.",

But since a primary course objective is learning citation style I am super picky about the final product that you turn in (other classes might not be like that, if the focus is more on the content of the bibliography). I've yet to see an automated tool that's 100% accurate. One common problem is missing or excess capitalization on article & journal titles.",

And if there is a mistake its usually easy to fix. I get why you may be against it if students just use it solely for citations and not fixing it. Generally for noodle tools its correct 90% of the time and a mistake usually comes from spelling or some link. It works so well because my research tends to come from places where there is citation areas already made for said article, encyclopedia, book, and stuff of thats sorts.",

One of my professors earlier this year was telling us that incorrect citations could potentially make other professors on my campus accuse a student of plagiarism (you definitely dont want that on your record). I don't know if that's entirely true, but it does give some good motivation to try to be as thorough as possible. I'm sure you could use a citation machine as a base and then go over and double check so you can catch and fix any mistakes, and be sure you're checking to see if it's in the correct style (e.g. MLA, APA, etc).",
