  "text": "I just came back from a party and I think it was a great one. It was organized to celebrate the end of the semester and I felt so relieved, like I danced, I drank, I got dressed nicely, got compliments on my dress, I spoke to nice people so overall I felt great. But I think I might have drank a little bit too much, I poured 2 glasses of vodka, yes glasses not shots, on an empty stomach :) and I started talking to the first friend I made in college and cried a bit, because I was gettinf emotionnal, I wanted to tell her how happy I am to have her and that I really wanted to thank her because I feel like I didn't do it enough and that I don't deserve her. I really didn't wanted to cry But I wanted to express those feelings. And I didn't wanted anyone to see me either cause I feel like I am stupid and making a fool of myself. Next thing, I don't usually go to parties But when I go I am there to have fun, so I dance, drink, I talk to people and they tell me that I am not like this usually but they are supprised and happy to see that side of me.\n\nSo this makes me overthink, because I don't want to seem like a complete idiot who doesn't know how to behave, or a sl*t who doesn't have her life together. \n\nMy parents used to tell me that partying was \"bad\" and I usually control myself a lot, and I don't know if I cross the line or if I am just overthinking it too much. I am scared for my reputation.\nWhat do you think? What would you think if you saw someone like this at a party?",
