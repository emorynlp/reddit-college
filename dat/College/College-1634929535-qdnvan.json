  "text": "Context, I'm a freshman about a month or two in my first year. I have my friends from high school and talk to my roommates every so often but in terms of meeting people it's just rough. The first girl i met was actually in the dining room, just a case of \"can i sit and talk with you?\" And that went great for a couple of weeks. New friend and we had lunch of dinner every couple of days but then all of a sudden she tells me that \"we're going our separate ways\" and ghosts me. Ok maybe just not meant to be.\n\nChem lab partner shows up late first day and misses quiz, we talk pretty well and we get lunch and do the lab report after. Pretty good friendship and we'd talk/meet pretty often for chem. Just last week I realize that I'm the only one asking to work on chem stuff, especially since there hadn't been a conversation in a week. Whatever. \n\nAnother person in my chem lab talked to and asked for her snap, she seemed pretty receptive towards my conversations and everything. Then when the topic of the gym came up I asked her if she wanted to workout and she declined saying she goes with her girl friends. OK that's fair enough. I ask her if she wanted to work on the lab report since she was swamped with stats work and again a no thank you. \n\nAm I just stupid in expecting a 2 way friendship in people I meet or is there something I'm doing wrong?",
