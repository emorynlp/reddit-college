  "title:": "I feel sad almost every time I think about applying to college. Although I feel much better now, sometimes it still haunts me that I could not get scholarship to study at the top Universities(Harvard, MIT, etc.) in USA.",
  "text": "Before we begin, I want to point out that I'm not from USA.\n\nI'm from a country in South East Asia.\n\nSo to study in USA, I must go abroad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 21 now. Studying in a university in my country. And likely to graduate late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nabout 4-6 years ago, when I was in high school. I began developing a depression when I started comparing myself with other friends who are much smarter than me. Some of them later became  International Science Olympiads representatives of the country and got scholarships from the government to study in USA (and they went to ivy leagues, MIT, Stanford).\n\nSome of my friends start tech startup while in high school so they get accepted by Stanford.\n\nMeanwhile, I myself struggle with high stress and depression. I had been asking myself every day.\n\n\"Why are they so smart?\"\n\n\"Why am I so stupid?\"\n\n\"If I am so stupid and dull, how can I be successful? , how can I be a good member in the society?\"\n\nIn the second year of high school, I remember waking up and starting to question myself, \"How am I going to die today?\". And that is the beginning of the lowest point in my life.\n\nI began asking myself everyday. \"How am I going to commit suicide this day?\"\n\n\"Hanging myself?\"\n\n\"Jumping from some high buildings?\"\n\nAs I though to myself.\n\n\"My life is worthless for this society. My friends are all better than me and they will contribute to the society. They will become scientists, doctors, startup founders. I will probably become a trash. So I will sacrifice myself by committing suicide. My parents won't have to worry anymore. The society may live without me.\"\n\nBut I never succeed in committing suicide because I was taught about heaven and hell and I'm afraid the afterlife would be real.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was born in a Buddhist country so instead of committing  suicide. It's been 3 years now since I began meditating. It helps a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I meditate, I still wonder to myself.\n\n\"What is life after graduation?\" I did not get the scholarship to the US while my friends did and they will get a certificate from Harvard, MIT, Stanford.\n\n\"Will I succeed in my life?\"\n\n\"Can I achieve my goals without going to Harvard MIT Stanford?\"\n\n\"Can I start a great startup without going to Stanford?\"\n\nI know the answers to these questions myself. But sometimes I still feel sad thinking about it.\n\nSo could you please answer these questions for me?",

      "text": "Hey! I\u2019m from Taiwan and I\u2019m 17 and I am luckier than you I can go to the US to pursue for an education. I just want to remind you half of the people I know who goes to top schools are full of shit. People who don\u2019t really think for others. I don\u2019t think they will contribute that much to their community as much as you think they will first off. I know there\u2019s a reason you commented this, and I think it\u2019s because you know you have more potential, and I want to tell you you truly do. I struggled with suicide before and it\u2019s only when I realized we are all here for a reason, to help others, by first knowing how to seek that beauty in ourselves. For me it\u2019s faith, and having talks with insightful people. There\u2019s other ways to find beauty in you, and when I help at charities I see that. Not charities that are mundane, ofc they are helping people, but charities with a passion and purpose. As you get invested in them, they help you as you help them. I think you missed out on a lot of opportunities, that is true. A ton actually. Yet coming from a person who did too, I think it just makes us special. We have motivation to do something, but not now. Let\u2019s find our beauty within \u270c\ufe0f",
