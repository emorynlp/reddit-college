  "text": "Seriously. I just got off the phone with mine and I feel 10x better.\n\nThis semester has been hell for me. I'm taking 3 hard classes and marching band so I've never been more stressed. I'm not getting the grades I want and I've been rather hard on myself. I have 2 tests this week that really make or break my GPA and I'm sick with stress.\n\n I needed someone to vent to so I called my grandma.\nShe was so thrilled that I called and was so happy to talk to me. I let out all my frustrations and she gave me encouraging compliments. It made me feel so great when she told me that I would make her proud even if I did end the semester with bad grades. It was just 15 minutes of pure wholesome. \nShe prayed for me over the phone and asked when my tests were so she could pray during that time.\nNow she's telling all her friends to do the same for me. \n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one here who's stressed right now. If you have a grandma, call her. I'll make your day and hers. \n",
