  "text": "I (20F) am transferring my sophomore year of college to my dream college midyear. It is my first year dealing with FAFSA and I find it all so confusing. I'm the oldest child so my parents don't have experience with it either lol. I've looked up what to do with changing schools on FAFSA, but I have not gotten a clear step by step answer. I don't want to screw this up and guess especially since I only have a month until I start there.\n\nHow do I switch my college over on FAFSA so that my aid can be applied to my new school and my current aid and loans are not still applied to my current school? Also, how does this affect my current loan payments?\n\nThanks so much to anyone that can help! :)",

      "text": "If you are transferring for the spring semester (starting January 2022) you need to update your 2021-2022 FAFSA (assuming you\u2019ve already completed it). When you log on make sure you are on the 21-22 tab and not the 22-23 tab. You\u2019ll see that your FAFSA is successfully processed but if you scroll down a little you will see \u201cMake FAFSA corrections.\u201d  From there you can re-enter your FAFSA to add this new school code. Make sure you go to the end and resubmit it. Hitting \u201csave\u201d is not enough. You\u2019ll get a confirmation page at the end once you submit it. \nThe FAFSA can take a week to reach your new school but there may be additional delays due to staffing and the holidays. I advise students to check their college portal for confirmation that they received the FAFSA and see if you have any follow up steps. If you don\u2019t have access to the portal yet then don\u2019t be afraid to reach out directly to the FA office.",
