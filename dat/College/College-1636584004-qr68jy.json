  "text": "Hello all,\n\nLong story short- I owe my first university thousands of dollars over a very frustrating mix up with financial aide because of my SSN. It was sent to collections, but isn\u2019t on my credit report. I joined the National Guard so they are paying for any future education expenses. I\u2019m trying to go to another university to obtain my degree. Will them knowing I have a debt stop them from letting me apply?\n\nSecond question hopefully someone can answer. One of the colleges I applied to told since I don\u2019t have proof of college experience I\u2019d have to take a accuplacer test and send my high school transcript. So I sent them an unofficial copy of my transcript the 2 years I had at the first university because they were good grades and waive anything else I\u2019d have to do to get admitted. She\u2019s now asking for the official transcript. Will telling her I owe ban me from This school?",

      "text": "Call your first University and try to get those loans deferred, it won't show up on your credit now but who knows what will happen at the start of 2022 when there's no more freezes on student loan reporting.\n\nYour new school shouldn't ban you because you owe money to another University, but you should really clear up that situation first with your first one before it eventually gets worse.",
