  "text": "To sum it up, I\u2019m a finance and management double major, and I am graduating a full semester early. The problem is, my apartment is paid for an entire other semester, and I was wondering if picking up a major is worth it just to stay and end up graduating in the spring like I was originally going to do when I first started college.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t believe it would be worth it, especially given that you are a double major. Yes your apartment is rented for another semester, but apartments typically only hold you liable until they\u2019re able to rent it out to someone else. So as long as you\u2019re moved out and they\u2019re a respectable landlord, they\u2019ll be actively pursuing someone to take over the lease in my experience.",
