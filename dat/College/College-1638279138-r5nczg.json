  "text": "I asked for an override to get into a class only because I became close with that prof and could get a recommendation from her. But when I think about it more, her exams aren\u2019t for me at all and I don\u2019t want to have another semester of me struggling with her exams. But would she think less of me for switching out? Would she not like me?",

It does leave a not-so-great impression, and at best makes you seem indecisive and flustered. If the class is not for you and you would struggle to pass or get a good grade, you should prioritise your success over the LOR. Use the semester to join clubs or get close with other professors who could provide you with an LOR instead.",

Part of me thinks I can keep being in her class because I know how she teaches/structures the exams and hw, but at the same time I feel like going for the easier class with an easier exam should be better. Both are equally important I guess. You\u2019re right about how I might look to her, I was afraid of that happening",
