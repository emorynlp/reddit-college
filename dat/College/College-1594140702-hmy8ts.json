  "title:": "Should I take a COVID gap year?",
  "text": "I'm entering a very small, liberal arts college in the fall. As of right now, my school plans on reopening in early September for in-person classes, with two weeks of online classes after Thanksgiving. Social-distancing will be in effect, which means most social gatherings and clubs (ie. theatre) will not occur. I'm scared that our school is going to go virtual mid-semester, meaning I will be paying for sub-par online classes. I'm equally scared about my social life. I'm usually a pretty reserved person.  I was hoping the social events at college would give me a push into new friendships. My school isn't even giving us roommates. I don't want to be so secluded that my already crappy mental health takes another plunge. That being said, I'm not sure if staying at home will be better or worse. I know all I will do is spend time with my family and work- I've even been offered a position as a supervisor at my job, as long as I'm still at home. My parents think that, since so many people are taking a gap year this year, I will have an advantage in the job market after college. This is probably true, but I also think it would be a bad idea to pay for an education that is not the experience I would otherwise have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure what to do. There are pros and cons to both sides. Any advice?",

I just say go the cheaper route (my college only took 10 percent off my fall tuition when we are leaving early)",

      "text": "Bucking the trend and going to say no because compared to regular in-person classes the instructors have been lenient as hell. \n\nMy suggestion is to take the minimum number of credits you can take of the required non-degree classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say minimum number because for a lot of people keeping up with the coursework is actually really difficult when you don't go to the class in person. Also it's really hard to pay attention for more than an hour to online videos and lectures. I did 4 classes last term and had to drop one. It was easy but jesus christ it felt like I did nothing but sit infront of my computer 24/7. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I say to take your non-degree classes because the quality of these classes (in my experience) has been lower than in-person classes. You simply don't get as much out of them as you do as in-person classes. This is totally fine for the bullshit extra stuff the college makes you take that has nothing to do with your degree. But for degree related classes, you're really going to benefit in your upper division courses if you get everything you can out of your lower division courses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany of the classes has been borderline jokes. For an archaeology class we're suppose to do field work but because of the lockdown we just had to visit a website. For a communications class a classmate told me how instead of a speech they just had to record themselves giving the speech. For an architecture class we're suppose to go on field trips but because of the lockdown we just had to go out and drive by the building. And for the writing courses the instructor says 6 pages but when people turn in 4 they were like \"okay whatever that's fine\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese lockdown terms are almost freebies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mileage may vary though. Top tier schools might be hardasses about it.",

      "text": "Here\u2019s some advice that heeded me very well, from a very worldly professor, when I had nearly half of my college done in high school and wanted to take a gap year:\nNo one cares about how young you graduate. As a matter of fact, you might actually struggle, because no one wants to be the first to take a chance on a 19 year old grad. Thus, take advantage of any real opportunity you have TO move forward, but also use your advantage to be more thorough with your education. \n\nI took a year and a half gap period- I moved out, became financially independent, traveled a lot, learned a language, started a nonprofit in my field (that I discovered my love for in my gap year), got experience in other fields, and, at the end of it, was excited to go back to school - because I had an extremely clear vision of what it is I needed to learn, and went back to university with incredible force that had lasted me to my accelerated graduate degree. Now I read books and study my coursework and article citations like mad, so COVID was, as horrible as it is to say, fantastic timing for me to just focus on my studies.\n\nIs it possible for you to do a semester or two and then take a gap year, when there\u2019s more things open?\n\nI\u2019m curious - why are you already thinking about being an asset in the job market? If anything in the world was possible, and success was guaranteed, would this track your looking at be the one you take?\n\nOne thing if you take a gap year; make sure you are the type of person to actually go back. I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt I\u2019d be back, but a lot of people I know say they wouldn\u2019t trust themselves to - even though they are incredibly bright students.",

Right now, traveling (esp. internationally for Americans) is out of the question. Service, which for the most part also requires traveling, isn\u2019t really happening either. With COVID-19 also taking a toll of the economy, I don\u2019t think many companies are hiring interns or generally high school grads.",

I'm sure my first university semester won't be the same as it would have been pre-pandemic, but I am going to try to make the most of it. I for sure thought about taking a gap semester or only taking a few classes if we were all online because I've completed all of my gen-eds already.

While my school did lower tuition slightly, the cost is still far too much for what will be an incomplete freshman year. Since I will be taking out some student loans regardless, I\u2019d rather have a complete four-year college experience to show for it. I will also be working over the gap year and that money should more than make up the tuition reduction for the current year.\n\nAll in all, my reasoning points strongly in favor of a gap year for my circumstances. Of course, if you\u2019re on FA or a scholarship, you might have additional circumstances that impact your decision.",

      "text": "I'm a professor at a similar-sounding college. TBH despite all the big plans I expect *all* colleges will end up going virtual again if they are allowed to open residence halls and face-to-face classes at all. The US population has totally screwed the COVID response-- with no thanks to the feds --and it's not going to get better in six weeks.\n\nMy eldest is a sophomore at another liberal arts college. At this point we're electing for her to stay home and take classes online. That will reduce costs by about $8K/semester (room and board) if they open the campus; if they do *not* open the campus I anticipate a 15-20% tuition cut as well.  Students should note, however, two things: 1) faculty have been working hard this summer to make online classes better than they were this spring, and 2) teaching online costs *more* than teaching regular classes. Based on my own experience (I'm a department chair and am on the board of trustees of my school) the spring online mess took 2-3x the hours for each class, additional tech, additional support, etc. So if some schools do not cut tuition for online instruction that is why.\n\nIf one of my kids was scheduled to start college this fall I'd 100% tell them not to do it. College will be there in another year. Use the time \"off\" to earn some money and continue to improve yourself-- read, explore possible majors, maybe take a cheap, easily-transferrable online class somewhere. Don't just sit in the basement. But the cost, health risk, and odds of everyone ending up online again really tell me it's not worth starting as a freshman this fall unless you're getting a full ride (including room/board) somewhere. The calculus is different for older students, and especially juniors/seniors who cannot easily transfer in credits at the upper-division.",

Generally speaking though, *most* schools will allow you to literally defer for one year: that means you accept admission but wait until fall of the following year to enroll. Not all though, and how they handle financial aid can vary dramatically. If you have a spot in a highly selective school (there are <50 such in the entire US with admission rates <15%) that's quite different than someone who is looking to defer from a typical state flagship or a private liberal arts college.",

It stands to reason the competition for everything, from entry level jobs to graduate school seats, is going to be higher than usual.\n\nOnline school is definitely going to be cheaper once you factor in the opportunity cost. You are losing one year of your highest lifetime salary. For most college graudates that's at least as much as a year's worth of college tuition.",

What I think the pandemic has revealed to a lot of people is that paying for the on-campus \"college experience\", marketed by most institutions, is really paying for an environment that offers the opportunity for connections. Those connections can be personal, academic, and professional. In an online-only setting, it is much harder for these institutions to provide that same \"space.\" Is it possible for students to still develop relationships in that environment? Absolutely, but it will be much more difficult to start college in a school that is not already adapted to online learning *and* online living.",

There is a pretty laid back drinking culture here (as opposed to the big party schools in the area), and I think it\u2019s a pretty integral part of the college experience for a number of reasons, that I hope can maybe change your mind or broaden your view a little bit. \n\n\n1. If I\u2019m grinding away at school week in and week out, it\u2019s likely that without social time that I\u2019ll get burnt out and my work won\u2019t be up to par. School is hard and there is little added incentive such as pay raises or other immediate monetary gain from working hard, so taking breaks on the weekends can help with mental health and reinvigorating work ethic. \n\n\n2. In the US, it\u2019s a necessary life skill to know how to drink around others, whether it be colleagues at work or people in your social scene, the freedom of university lets people experience their wild party days without it effecting their jobs. Imagine your co-workers go out after work and you tag along and haven\u2019t ever gone out, end up not knowing your limits, and something bad or embarrassing happens. \n\n\n3. Few to no people are \u201cgoing JUST to go to bars and play drinking games\u201d, but humans, being social creatures, want fun stuff to do between the monotony of class work and maybe even real jobs on the side. \n\nI hope maybe this changes your worldview a little bit.",

My school limited us to only being able to CLEP 9 total hours, but that would still get you a decent number of hours for an off-year, and when things do hopefully someday return to normal that saves you the time, money, and effort that those classes would otherwise require. I wouldn't suggest clepping anything super relevant to your major though.\n\nWay back in the day I clepped English Comp 1, 2, and US History. If you were decent at English in high school then those tests are pretty easy credits. US history was tougher, but I hated that class in highschool and still managed to pass with a week or two of off-and-on studying.",
