I have been taking 5 courses per semester since Spring 2020 and would hate to slow down so close to the finish line.\n\nI know I need to talk to the head of my department for approval, just wondering how people's experiences have been trying to do this, and any etiquette tips would be helpful!\n\nThanks!",
