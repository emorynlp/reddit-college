  "text": "Im a sophomore that\u2019s doing a medical laboratory science major. I recently picked up bio as a minor which requires general bio 1 and 2 with labs. I already did a&p 1 and got a C. I\u2019m doing a&p 2 now and am doing better, I think I\u2019ll get a B. I have to choose next semesters classes soon. So I am wondering if any of you think that taking bio after a&p would be fairly easier for me?",

      "text": "Bio 1 and 2 from my experiences will just go over foundational concepts from a broad perspective not necessarily covered in a&p. Although you may get into some molecular biology (central dogma etc) in bio 1/2 which I\u2019m sure you would have seen in some capacity in a&p, I don\u2019t think the order in which you would take them matters so much in this case.\n\nI took bio 1/2 before a&p but that was a scheduling issue, which is a bit different, and it worked out fine for me as far as learning the content.",
