Having to prepay doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s illegitimate (although personally I feel like it\u2019s a bit predatory but I guess that\u2019s just my opinion). However it looks sketch because all I can see is that they self identify as \u201cHonor Society\u201d. Just like with scam phone calls, if they don\u2019t identify themselves and the company/organization they\u2019re with immediately, that\u2019s a bad sign. However, because you say you searched them and they do appear to be legitimate, I\u2019m assuming you have the full organization name yourself.",
