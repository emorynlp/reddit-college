  "text": "I am trying to pick a master's program, but don't know what to choose.\n\nI got a bachelor's in biology. But I do not want to go into medicine or science anymore. I hated it and I never want to go into it. I recently graduated with my bachelors. I was influenced by people to do medicine.\n\nNow I want to do something creative. I want to follow my path. I am so lost. I don't know if I should do a marketing/global management masters degree. What is a marketing job like? What do you do?",
