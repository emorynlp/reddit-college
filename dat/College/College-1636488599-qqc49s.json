      "text": "What country are you in? In the US you shouldn't have to go through being institutionalized unless you voluntary want to or are expressing explicit suicidal thoughts. To get medicine though you will have to talk to a doctor and be diagnosed. As long as you don't have an explicit plan they shouldn't have to institutionalize you. I'm always careful with how I word my suicidal thoughts to prevent this until I have a concrete relationship with my psychiatrist. At my college we have a health center where you can talk to a psychologist and if referred/needed a psychiatrist. Our hospital also has an intense out-patient clinic for college students for those that need intense help but do not want to be institutionalized. You may also be able to talk to your PCP too as long as it's nothing too complicated. I do highly suggest both therapy and medicine together until you are 100% stable and even then therapy here and there is good.",

              "text": "Honestly if it's that bad no, nothing I am aware of. I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and my mom depression and anxiety. Depending on your insurance, if you have any, medication shouldn't be much and therapy cost might be reduced. You can always just talk to a psychologist to start. Many will not prescribe medicine or you can talk to a psychiatrist and ease into medicine. I don't want to seem like I'm minimizing you problems, but sometimes, I think, it's good to just try to talk to someone first and then start medication if needed.\n\nedit: Many of the pitfalls in mental health is the cost unfortunately. Maybe talk to your uni as sometimes they have free sessions for an allotted number and can help you find someone outside the school even. If you have insurance you can also call them.\n\nedit2: you can try meditating, working out, etc. that have been proven to help depression, anxiety, etc., but they're definitely not a cure and are just coping mechanisms that can help.",

I would go to the colleges mental health office and see if you can book an appointment. These are free and included in your tuition. It sounds like you just need someone to talk to and to help develop good coping strategies.",
