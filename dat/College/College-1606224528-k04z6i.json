This means that every member is responsible for ALL of the content, not only the portion they wrote. So, if part of it is plagiarized everyone can be brought up on plagiarism charges. \n\nNow, this probably won't happen to you if you cooperate, but you might expect to find a reduced grade on the project anyway because, either (1) you are guilty of plagiarism, or (2) you didn't collaborate on the project as intended. Group projects are often included in courses with a teamwork/collaboration GE, so refusing to collaborate -- i.e. dividing up the work and only paying attention to one's own section -- is cause for a reduced grade.\n\nIn any case, the plagiarism charges are much more serious so try to document what you can and present what you have to the instructor of record.",

Some kids really do think it\u2019s still Highschool where standards don\u2019t matter. Given this, it\u2019s unlikely that the person will confess because being \u201ccharged\u201d will essentially stay will you throughout college and might get them kicked out. \n\nWhat you could do is go on turn it in or any other service and figure out which part is plagiarized. Once you find the part that is not original work, isolate who posted/did it. Submit your findings to your professor or the board (if it gets to that point).\n\nThat should leave you in the clear and you\u2019d make it out essentially unharmed. \n\nSome of the answers on here sound like they\u2019re freaking out for you or an over-reaction. If you really did nothing wrong, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it but, have a fallback incase it goes south. I wouldn\u2019t openly state who the cheater is in a public setting and I would do this rather fast. People who cheat or are in the process of being caught are good at covering their tracks. Also, don\u2019t announce you were the one who reported them. People are crazy.",

As sending the file right away won't prove/disprove innocence, only who did what. So having what your sources are is good too. Some people also cheat accidentally, by copying work without sourcing it. Be sure to talk to your group/prof and see if they simply forgot to source rather than blatant cheating. You dont necessarily have to stand by your group (unless you're friends with them) as this is college, it's all or none and if someone is cheating they are risking your grades, not just their own.",

Instead of making threats and abusing your power as a Professor (he literally humiliated us and yelled at us infront of the whole class as if we were children instead of stepping aside to privately talk to us) he should have acted more professional and understanding. I made sure he got his ass chewed out by his higher ups AND he even had to apologize. A lot of students forget that they\u2019re not helpless at all in these situations, you just gotta know how to move!",
