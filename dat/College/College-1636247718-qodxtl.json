  "text": "A little bit of background: I'm a last year student in computer engineering and this semester I'm taking a computer graphics course which I find difficult. I didnt know many people so I went in with a group of guys who are much faster programmers and managed to finish a part of the project and I did nothing (so far we had a first phase submission)\n\nNow I really feel bad and dumb and don't know how to deal with these guys since they literally just took my part and did it, I dont blame them i just dont get why they didnt text me to even just help me\n\nAny advise on how to deal with them?",

      "text": "Did you ask for help? Because that's what you have to do, you have to ask for help. \n\nIn my last programming class, I programmed all parts of a group assignment and only submitted my part to the repo, the rest I kept separate as a backup in case they didn't come through. If they didn't come through, I would do the same thing they did, but I also wait literally to the due date before doing that.\n\nI was also very happy to help my group mates, but I would not help unless they asked. Mainly because I am not a mind reader.",

      "text": "Honestly I feel the same way when I see other's program sometimes. I remember taking a intro to programming course and me (usually if not always) sitting at the computer for a long time and still not being able to figure anything out.  If it weren't for my dad (which is a natural at it in general), I would have flunked the class.\n\nI then realize that some people don't struggle as much as me in programming, and I know they're not gifted and are of average intelligence which make me suspect that I'm below average. I'm fine with not being smart, as long as other people of normal intelligence are equally as stupid. But I can't accept average people being smarter than me, it just doesn't make me feel good about myself.\n\nMy advice is to focus on yourself and try to better yourself. Eventually everything would get easier and it takes practice. Eventually you'll form schemas and heuristics on how to do things. I'll suggest you work with people that are smarter than you and try to learn from them and use them as study buddies. Try learning about how they think and how they are able to do it and how they solve problems.\n\nI think you're shocked and too focused on judging yourself rather then trying your best to think, this might be the reason why you aren't able to complete anything and seem slower then other people.",
