  "text": "I asked the chair and they said in most cases they will only accept (200-level) or (community college level) classes for transfer credits. \"300-level\" meaning Junior level or higher classes. I asked in what case they might accept 300 level classes and I have a feeling they will just respond and say, \"it depends.\" Does anyone have any experience transferring University level classes to anther university? Its a fully online program and Im dreading getting stone walled by gnarly professors.",

Always check with the admissions office and/or the school/department where your major is housed for the answers.  Good luck!",

I run a radio station owned by a university where I occasionally adjunct.  I can\u2019t make promises, but it may be worth a try if we have a parallel program.",

      "text": "Either the dean's office of the major at the school you're transferring to or the department office should be able to help you. Ours keeps a running list of course equivalencies at nearby CCs and other 4-year universities across the state that we get a lot of transfers from. If a student takes BIO 3XX Genetics at another university, it will transfer here as credit for our 3000-level genetics class. Etc. For course/institution combos we haven't transferred before, we may ask you for a syllabus for the course you took to make sure it's equivalent.\n\nBut that's just how things work at my university (regional 4-year public). Yours may be different. Seems weird they wouldn't accept all equivalent courses though for new transfer students.",

But if you already talked to the chair there, that's probably the best info.\n\nEdit: it's possible they'd make some exceptions for special cases, but it wouldn't really make sense in most cases for a junior-level course to be equivalent to a course in a 2-year program.",
