  "text": "I dont understand how people get actual interviews for internships. I have good grades, some work experience (not really related to degree but still),  I'll be a junior by summer and literally every internship I apply to, I get the typical, \"we've gone with another candidate.\" It's so depressing.",

      "text": "Literally just by applying left and right. Get used to rejection, it's going to happen again and again throughout your career. It's not unusual to send dozens and dozens of applications just to get one or two requests for interviews, and even then you may not get the offer. It's rough, but persistence is the key here, especially when you're still fairly early into your academic career. I didn't get an internship until I *was* a junior. In my city the majority of internships are looking for generally second semester Juniors to recent grads. I'd imagine a sophomore would have a bit more trouble if they weren't networked with someone who could get them in touch with an internship. Don't be discouraged, just keep touching up your resume and cover letters, keep sending applications. You'll get to shoot your shot",

      "text": "I\u2019ve had a similar experience. I applied for over 50 this summer and heard back from 10 total asking for an interview and less than half were offers. I\u2019d say just apply to as many as possible. Also at my school companies will either hold virtual or in person information sessions and if your school does that I\u2019d recommend it so companies see you are interested in theme. You mention work, do you have other extra curriculars like clubs at school?",
