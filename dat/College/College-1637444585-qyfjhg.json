  "text": "I am currently a junior in high school, but I already have my major and school picked out. I want to go for medical biology, and then during my first or second year of college go to study abroad. I want to do medical biology so I can get into medical school, as I want to be a gynecologist. My question is does will medical biology get me to where I need to be? Will it help me get a job after I get my degree? Should I consider changing my major?",

My point is don't worry about changing a major you don't even have yet. It's good to have a plan, but college is there to help you discover what you really want to do. If that's still your desired major/outcome after your freshman year, then advisors can help get you in the right direction. I do think that aiming to study abroad is an awesome idea, though, and one you should keep regardless! I get my first experience abroad in March!",

              "text": "That is honestly the experience opportunity of a lifetime and I encourage you to stick with that one regardless of your major. There are amazing opportunities abroad for nearly every major, and it's a rare chance to do something that becomes increasingly more difficult to do afterwards. I'm sure that wherever your interests take you that you will be amazing at it as it seems you have a natural zest for learning and life experiences. And just in case you do end up still wanting medical school, those experiences look fantastic to admissions boards ;-)",
