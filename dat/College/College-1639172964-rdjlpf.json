  "text": "I am almost finished writing a paper for one of my classes this semester. It's quite possibly the worst paper I have ever written and it'll probably be graded as such. But I'm just done caring with this class.\n\nThis particular class is an elective and I'll be honest, I only took it because I wanted an easy A (although I won't get an A and it hasn't been easy). I'm not interested in the material, I don't like the prof and unlike other electives I've taken, I just can't bring myself to pretend I care either. I'm just, done.\n\nI feel a little bad about it though. Usually I take my classes pretty seriously, even the electives. I hope I'm not becoming a bad student.\n\nRegardless, have you ever been so done with a class you just don't care anymore?",
