  "text": "I was an honor roll student my entire life and just got my first C ever in my first semester of college. I was always the \"gifted child\" and my parents would put all their hopes and dreams into me but as soon as college started I've been going through extreme burnout. I had an extremely difficult time my first semester regarding my mental health and family drama and my GPA is below 3.5 for the first time ever.",

      "text": "I'd say don't worry about it too much. I know a dozen or more people who would probably kill to finish with a C this semester, and this fall hasn't even been the worst of the pandemic. This might be a little long, but it's just some thoughts that I think more students need to hear.\n\nI graduated HS a year before the pandemic. I had one good year at community college before shit hit the fan. It hit me just as hard as I know it hit every other college student in the country. Ever since we 'went online' and integrated remote instruction, college has changed. Before you start to get down on yourself for a rough semester, keep in mind what's going on in the world. \n\n2021 isn't a normal year, neither was 2020, and neither will 2022 be. We might not have had massive lockdowns this semester, but that doesn't mean we aren't currently experiencing an unprecedented global event. The pandemic is more than just a public health emergency; The rapid changes to society we've seen is taxing on everyone mentally, financially and socially. \n\nIt's okay to not be okay. It's okay to get burnt out. That's okay. Your own mental health is important and it's not worth sacrificing for the grade, don't forget that. It's perfectly fine if you don't live up to others expectations all the time. At the end of the day, the only person you ever really have to answer to is yourself. \n\nDid you come out of the semester knowing more than you did going in? That's something to be proud of. Focus on the little victories like that. You can get through the rough times, and you'll be all that much better off for it. \n\nSo you got a C this semester, and you're below a 3.5. That's okay! Don't give up! The most important thing is that you got through it, and you're in one piece (hopefully!). Going through rough times is part of being human. Being able to get through those challenges and walk out the other side will set you up for the future better than single grade or GPA point ever can.",
