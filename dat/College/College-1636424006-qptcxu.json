  "text": "It may sound like a dumb question, but I\u2019m a high schooler who has just started thinking about college and I\u2019m seriously considering at least trying for Vanderbilt. The only issue is I plan to study in Psychology and Sociology rather than their more known Engineering, law, STEM based courses. Is that a bad idea?",

      "text": "It depends, most well ranked universities, like Vandy, will have reputations that extend beyond their best programs, but ultimately your decision shouldn\u2019t be based on this so called \u2018prestige\u2019. Consider cost as your primary factor, in addition to academic quality and other programs, if Vandy fits the bill in comparison to others, it works out fine.",

      "text": "I'm currently at a school for pre-med that is only well known for engineering. It hasn't gone well and they're cutting my major after my class graduates. Vanderbilt's prestige goes beyond what they are well known for, and if you say you went there, no matter what major, it'll look good. Just make sure you have other options and do research into the program you want to do there and I highly recommend talking to some current students to get the best feedback.  (ps. psych is stem)",
