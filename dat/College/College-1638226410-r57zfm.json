Were they challenging? I lost a few credits transferring and trying to get caught up a little. \n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I\u2019ve only taken one, the Introductory Psychology exam (and currently planning to study for another one over the Winter Break). It wasn\u2019t difficult, it was mostly about memorization of concepts and key figures than anything else. I\u2019d assume the other liberal arts focused exams are similar. I don\u2019t know your level of aptitude or anything like that so I couldn\u2019t definitively tell yes take it or no dont take it. But imo, it saved me a ton of time in not having to take the semester long course. So in that aspect, it\u2019s really worth it. If you\u2019re considering it, I\u2019d say pick one or AT MOST two to study for if you\u2019re attending school alongside. These require an hour or two of consistent studying and notetaking each day. Treat it as another class alongside the ones you\u2019re taking in school. It took me about a month of this to successfully pass the exam. I\u2019d recommend asking questions about specific exams in r/CLEP. Good luck!",
