  "title:": "Am I allowed to steal from my English paper to write my Sociology final?",
  "text": "So I just got done with a 7 page paper for my English class (double spaced of course, I'm not a maniac) and I found the topic to be incredibly interesting. I feel very comfortable with my knowledge of the research on it at this point.\n\n I just got instructions for my sociology final project and it allows me to write about the exact same topic. Can I just take the body paragraphs from my English essay and start modifying/adding to them to do my sociology paper? It would put me so far ahead of the deadlines and give me so much extra time that it feels like cheating. Is it?\n\nAnd just to be clear here, I'm not just trying to write about the same thing purely for the convenience. I still feel enough interest and hunger for this topic to write a lot more about it, especially since I was behind when I wrote my English essay and had to rush a bit.",

          "text": "Thanks for the help. Your comment prompted me to ask the library about the school's policy. They told me the policy and sent me to check up with my professor. Professor said I can reuse my own work as long as it's just a few body paragraphs about my sources. Library said it's only plagiarism if I use \"one paper for two classes\".   \nHope this helps anyone else wondering about this in the future.",
