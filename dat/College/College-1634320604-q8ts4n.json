  "title:": "I live at home and attend a local university. How do I soundproof my room (for a reasonable price)",
  "text": "Moving out is quite expensive, and living at home is pretty easy. I can't make any sort of noise at night because my parents get woken up so easily. Even in my own room, I have absolutely zero privacy. I want to be able to play video games late at night and not worry about talking at normal level without worrying about them hearing every one of my conversations and especially just not waking them up. Anyone here know any effective methods to soundproof a room to improve my quality of life?",

      "text": "Do they own the house? Soundproofing the walls is the best way, there's spray stuff. It's expensive.\n\nTapestries, curtains, rugs, all help muffle sound. As well as stuff like bookcases, anything not hard and flat really.\n\nA solid door (compared to hollow, like most inside doors) is an easy enough swap, but $150-$250. Door weather stripping or draft blockers can help, a bit. As can covering vents with magnetic covers. \n\nQuieter keyboard and headset over mic and speakers you've probably already done. Also consider your house layout, sometimes moving the desk to another wall or swapping rooms with siblings is worth it.\n\nWhite noise machine and earplugs for them will also help, if they'll go for that.",
