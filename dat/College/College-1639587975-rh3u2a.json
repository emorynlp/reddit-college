I was trying to game my procrastination by trying to write before meeting with my advisor about it. I\u2019m mostly still in outline mode. \n\nLately some meds I take have got me really spacey, so I wanted to see if I could hype myself up like I usually do before deadlines. Unfortunately doesn\u2019t really seem to come anymore. Idk where the adrenaline has gone.",

I get my title and format down on paper, then I just begin by introducing the subject of the matter. Begin far away from what you\u2019re trying to say, for example, if you\u2019re writing about climate change, start with something like \u201cHumans have drastically advanced in their daily lives by using technology and artificially made material that support their needs.\u201d From there, you can kind of make your way up to gas emissions and all. After the intro paragraph, you list the advantages and disadvantages of carbon usage. Next, you analyze the two sides and finally, the conclusion. Easier said, but that\u2019s my advice.

If you lay down to type or sit anywhere too comfortable you\u2019re going to clock out easily. Set up the structure of your paper first (double space, MLA or APA, title it and etc.). For every paragraph, not the intro or conclusion, reference something from your textbook and an academic article so it beefs up your paper. You don\u2019t even need to read the full article sometimes, the abstract can work just fine as long as it actually supports whatever you\u2019re writing about in the paper. \n\nGood luck!",
