  "text": "I\u2019m not really against string lights, but idk if they\u2019d be like the vibe I want. I know it\u2019s late in the semester, but rn I just have posters hanging around (like 4), an impromptu book shelf above my monitor, that sort of thing. I live alone, so something homey would be nice, but idk what to put in my room to make it feel like that. I have a plant (bamboo), but it\u2019s not doing too well, despite my best efforts to helping it. I honestly just don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAny advice?",

      "text": "I love radial lamps. Think cylindrical/rectangular and just sit on a desk/shelf. I have one sitting in my bookshelf, and another on a side/desk table. I pretty much never use my built in overhead light now. Between these two, while my room will still be dimmer, I have more than enough light to see comfortably. If I need to read/write something, I have an adjustable desk lamp I can turn on to bounce a bit more light around. Bouncing light around from a lower height instead of overhead makes such a difference on its own.\n\nI use warm white lighting for all of them. It helps the room feel cozy and comfortable, as opposed to neutral/cool lighting which makes it feel sterile and cold.\n\nI would say just don\u2019t worry about doing the bamboo and grab a plastic plant or two you like. Other than dusting them, there\u2019s no maintenance needed, and they\u2019ll always look as good as the day you bought them.\n\nDepending on your room, a rug could be a nice addition if you cared for one.\n\nAnyhow, I\u2019ve found it really isn\u2019t how many things you have for decoration but just how you\u2019ve used them, and generally less is more.",

Or just hang em around the edges. All kinds of fake plant vine designs, could just browse a Joanne's or Michael's.\n\nYou can get these rolls of stickable and peelable texture thingies that can make great accents. I think they're vinyl stickers? 'Backsplash' is a term I've heard used for a accent tile design you can see all the time in kitchens and bathrooms.\n\nVases of fake or dried flowers.\n\nFruit baskets (fake or real lol).\n\nCorkboards with cute/fun/memorable pics stuck on or anything small and cute or inspirational.\n\nBookshelves are good for the knick knacks and plushies.\n\nA sweet comfortable nook can be so underrated lol. A super comfortable reading/lounging chair, good/atmospheric lighting, a nice table with room for food or drinks or a laptop and maybe a cute potted plant or stuffie or knick knack etc., and a cute/warm/soft carpet or rug could be super nice too. Like make yourself comfortable!",
