  "title:": "How soon before a due date should an essay's length and prompt be posted by a professor?",
  "text": "Hi all, I've been having some problems with a professor and am at a loss. She isn't super skilled with technology, which has been a big issue in a largely online course. She has been posting assignments wrong in some cases,  and in all cases posting the prompts and lengths of the essays with less than a week to the due date. I went to speak to her about it last week and ask she post those aspects sooner to accommodate busy/working students, and she said she'd \"see about it\".\n\nOne week later, it's midterms, and she's done it again, except this time much, much worse. Sunday she posted TWO discussion assignments where there usually is one. For context, these are about a 4 page paper each between the main post and responses. The main body (400-500 wordsx2) is due Wednesday. The responses (200-300 wordsx4 responses) is due Friday.\n\nAdditionally, this is MIDTERMS WEEK. On Monday, she posted the midterm, consisting of 3 prompts, 2 pages each. This is due next Sunday. The class is a 300 level Sociological Theory course with a text almost exclusively comprised of dense primary sources like Marx, Engel, Weber, etc. (over half the students are Social Work majors w/only SOC 101 under their belt). So none of that really helps either.\n\nMy question is, when does it cross the line? At what point is it inappropriate for the professor to assign an essay prompt/length too close to the deadline? Specifically in this case, with everyone having midterms in other courses this week?\n\n[TL/DR] Receiving assignment details with what seems to be too little notice on a consistent basis. Midterms week is the same, w/ 2x usual homework plus essay exam. Is this ok?",

          "text": "The exam is in the syllabus, listed as part of \"week 8\" but with no due date. Same for A discussion post, singular. I don't really think the exam is unreasonable with 6 days to complete 6 pages (though I usually like to know the length ahead of time).\n\nIt's the double discussion posts, with no notice in the syllabus, only 3 days to complete, and being due midterms week for me. The reason I spoke to her the week prior requesting she post prompts sooner is that I work and have full class days Mon-Fri. \n\nThe majority of the class is at a 2-year extension of the main campus. These are usually nontraditional, poorer students who have work and family obligations beyond a usual student. We have 2 newer mothers plus one about to give birth in December. They've all expressed how tough this short notice at the start of the week is as well.",
