  "text": "Hey all, I\u2019m currently taking Calculus online and have a B. But I have really not learned much at all besides the steps to solve a problem. We learn through Knewton Alta and I cannot for the life of me understand any sort of theory through that program. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be as concerned if this was the only math class I\u2019m taking, but I\u2019m pursuing an mechanical engineering degree and don\u2019t want to be screwed in my next calculus class.\n\nIs it worth the W on the transcript to drop even if I have a B? I\u2019m trying to transfer to a UC/CSU from my CC.",

But also, sure I have a B but I don\u2019t know if I will be able to keep it up this semester, especially with tests I have coming up. I could go as far as poking into tutoring or something though",
