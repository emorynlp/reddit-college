  "text": "I\u2019m a first year computer science major and my English composition professor said that I was a really good writer. She said it would be a good opportunity to minor in English Literature but I\u2019m not sure if that would pair well with a CS degree. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m contemplating switching out CS with economics starting either next semester or possibly next year. So would English Literature pair well with either of those?",
