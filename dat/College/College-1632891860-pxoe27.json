  "text": "So I\u2019m a first year and it\u2019s kind of hard making real connections. I\u2019m cool with people and can talk to them but there\u2019s no connection. I see people already hanging out with people on a consistent basis 2 weeks in and it makes me feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me. All the people I like are upperclassmen and they already have their housing and groups set up so it\u2019s difficult to be a part of that. Does anyone have any tips?",
