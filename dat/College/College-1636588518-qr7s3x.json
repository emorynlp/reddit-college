  "text": "Upcoming College Students \n\nIs college affordable for you?\n\nAre you afraid of student loans and mountains of debt upon graduation?\n\nWell, as many of us graduate high school and take another step into our future, a good amount of us decide that community college is a better option than a big four-year school due to the significant price difference. What you may not know is community college used to be much cheaper and from the 60s to present day tuition prices have risen exponentially \\[SC1\\] \\[SC2\\] and the present-day courses cost around 2x more than most of our parents and teachers had to pay when they were in college [\\[1\\]](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_320.asp).\n\n**What is scaring away many of high school graduates from going to college?**\n\nThe cost of one semester in the college I currently attend is around\u00a0**$2,500 to $3,000 for 12-14 credits** \\[SC3\\] \\[SC4\\] [**\\[2\\].**\u00a0](https://www.muskegoncc.edu/financial-services/tuition-and-fees/)Community college is supposed to be a place where we can find out what we really want to do with our futures, without having to pay a high amount of money to do so, which is why we shouldn\u2019t have to be paying thousands of dollars a year when courses at a big 4-year school use to cost around the same or less up until the late 90s \\[SC5\\] [\\[3\\]](https://www.yahoo.com/now/average-cost-college-jumped-incredible-122000732.html)\\[KF6\\] \\[KF7\\] . \\[SC8\\]   \n\n**As a college student myself,**\n\nI believe community college needs to be cheaper than what it is, due to the cost of tuition rising and the education level staying the same\\[SC9\\] . \\[SC10\\] Unfortunately, the people who only want to go to community college for two years and get their Associates Degree still pay a high amount of money even though throughout the 60s-90s tuition was cheaper and more affordable while students were still getting close to the same education that we get today. I am personally still in that process of discovering myself, but if I want to change degrees then that\u2019s still a few hundred dollars thrown away and I am only in my first semester. \n\n**Why am I targeting community colleges specifically?**\n\nB\\[SC11\\] ecause schools are increasing the cost of tuition, but the buildings (at least at my college) are the same as they were years ago, and teachers are still barely getting paid more than they did years ago, even though we are paying more money for our education than students did in the past [\\[4\\]](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/tables/dt10_267.asp)\\[SC12\\] . \n\nI am writing this to make those who read it more aware of just how much our tuition has changed over the years. Because going into college with a blind eye to the changes that have been made over time is not good and it is nice to know more about what you are paying for before you make your decision.\\[SC13\\] \n\nSincerely,\n\nA college student",
