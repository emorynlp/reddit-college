  "title:": "Please Take My Survey for My Psychology Class",
  "text": "Hey guys, I'm looking for people (18+) to take my survey on the morality of sexual behaviors for my psychology class. I'm so stressed because I sent it to Amazon's MTurk, and I have gotten zero responses due to some error and the results are due Monday. Thank you to anyone who takes it! I truly appreciate it!\n\nEdit: Wow thank you guys so much!! I appreciate every one of your responses. I woke up today with a huge number of participants. Thanks again. You saved me from so much stress.",
