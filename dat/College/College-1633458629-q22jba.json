  "text": "i\u2019m a sophomore and have been taking majority online classes since fall 2020. i moved out of state, i have family here but i don\u2019t know anyone my age. my roommate is my only friend and even then we are so different. I feel like i have no time to get involved in anything because I have to work full time to pay for school. i just feel so alone and my depression/anxiety have spiraled out of control, and i\u2019m probably going to withdraw from 2 classes this semester. i just don\u2019t even know how to cope or what even to do. i don\u2019t know if i should move back home and take a year off or just push through. i\u2019m just so lonely and scared and i don\u2019t know what to do.",

Therapists, counselors, anyone that you can confide in. The worlds not gonna end if you withdraw a class. It doesn\u2019t make you any less deserving of being there.",
