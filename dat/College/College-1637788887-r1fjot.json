  "text": "I'm currently working on  my associates degree in STEM so I can transfer to a reputable University in my area. I have a 3.7 GPA, but I was lucky to get a 60 on any of my exams this semester. I recently chose to withdraw to save my GPA. I am burnt out, depressed, and realized I have no idea how to study bio and chem.  This wasn't my first class in either of these subjects, just the hardest iteration this far. I'm planning to relax, go to therapy, and reset for the next month, but I don't know how to prepare for next semester as far as habits, studying, creating my own schedule etc. \n\nSo far my classes have been really easy for me, but I'm worried I don't have the skills to continue progression into my upper level courses. Next semester will be my first one in-person since covid, so I'm optimistic that may be a big factor in my success. I know I'm capable of learning and doing well in college, I just don't know how to apply myself efficiently. I also think my confidence has been shaken, and I find myself being avoidant of anything school related. Any feedback and tips  on how to prepare myself fo success would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "The main difference I noticed between studying for my lower level bio/chem classes and upper ones was practice. In the lower levels, I could pass with simple memorization. This did not work with harder classes like Organic Chem. For chem, Try taking out an hour or two during the day to just do practice problems. In Cell Bio, you need to work on understanding the concepts rather than memorization. This means being able to talk about it if asked. Write down definitions, examples of those definitions, and draw pictures.",
