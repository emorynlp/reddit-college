So I\u2019m wondering in y\u2019all\u2019s experience, do you perform better when you studied before getting a terrible night of sleep, vs studying like crazy after a shitty sleep in the morning before an exam?  Or should I skip sleep completely?",

Skipping sleep with result in the same thing, even if you forcing study your brain will not retain any information due to lack of sleep, you're gonna blank out during exam.    \n  \nAside from a shitty sleep, for me, always study before sleep. Always. Your brain will convert information you've learned into a long-term memory after a good long sleep.",

      "text": "I\u2019m gonna say that the best option here is study and then get some sleep, unless you\u2019re already totally exhausted, in which case cramming in the morning would be a bit better. I usually perform best when I cover some material and then sleep on it. \n\nPersonally, I think pulling an all-nighter before an exam is a pretty bad idea\u2014it screws your retention of material and your ability to think critically the next day. They\u2019re best left for something like a paper that doesn\u2019t require you to be \u201con\u201d after you\u2019ve gone a night without sleep. Even if you cover less of the material, I\u2019d try to get some sleep in. Best of luck!",

I got 2-3 hours of sleep, and then gave up and continued studying.  My exam is in half an hour so hopefully I\u2019m not too screwed but I\u2019m not feeling very sharp lol",
