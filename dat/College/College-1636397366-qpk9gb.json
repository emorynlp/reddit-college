  "text": "Basically the title. I am currently a freshman at Santa Clara University, and I\u2019m really disliking it here. Originally, I wanted to go to a UC school, but I was denied by all I applied to, which is why I now go to SCU (my safety school). Does anyone know about the process of transferring from private school to community college? My goal UC is UC Irvine, so I was thinking of enrolling at Irvine Valley College. Do you all think that this is something I should seek out to do ASAP if I want to get into a UC, or should I spend some more time at Santa Clara? Also I am currently a computer science major, if that adds anything to the table that wasn\u2019t previously there.",
