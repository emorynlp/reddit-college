  "text": "Ik that many professors have a lot to do. Additionally, they prob don't even remember me bc they have to deal with so many students. My questions mostly pertain to classes i was pretty active in.\n\nEdit: they dont know what i look like bc it was a zoom class. I use chat/talk, but never had my camera on, so I'll be the one saying the first hi.",
