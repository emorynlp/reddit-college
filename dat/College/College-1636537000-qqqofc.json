  "text": "So, over this past weekend i developed a gross cough which has developed into very intense symptoms, leaving me up all night wheezing and coughing for the past 3 days. I\u2019ve also had constant migraines, and even a few bloody noses. I am almost positive I have bronchitis. I have been so tired and miserable that I have emailed my professors 3 days in a row to tell them I cannot make it. The policy for my school is you can only miss 4 days a semester. I have already missed 2 days before this but I was told I can make up my labs. This is genuinely the most sick I\u2019ve been in years, I always make sure to email my professors extremely early to let them know I am still sick and have been trying to get to my campus health office (they have very limited hours). Can I be potentially failed because of these absences even if I do the work? I get extremely anxious thinking about this and need some advice. Thanks.",
