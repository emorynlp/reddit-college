  "text": "So i\u2019m a freshman in college. I\u2019ve always been a straight A student. I graduated as salutatorian of my high school with a 5.3 GPA. I\u2019m very proud of my first semester of college. I\u2019ve maintained A\u2019s in every class\u2026 except chemistry. it\u2019s really just not my strong suit. i have studied my ass off for the class, and i\u2019ve really put forth all of my effort. My professor posted a final grade calculator spreadsheet where we enter all of our grades and it spits out our average along with a letter grade. I just got my lab grade back today, so i was playing around with the calculator. i was pretty sure all semester that i\u2019d end up getting a b in the class (89-80). when i put all of my grades in the spreadsheet, my final average is an 89.84, and the column next to it reads \u201cA.\u201d however, i know many professors aren\u2019t really fond of rounding\u2026 Do i assume it\u2019s a B and hope for an A? or do i expect that the spreadsheet is right? or should i just email my professor and ask him? i\u2019ve already checked the syllabus and there\u2019s nothing about rounding grades, but they get finalized tomorrow. any help would be appreciated.",

      "text": "check your syllabus. it's possible that a 89.84 really does count as an A\n\nlastly it's just a grade, i see the perfectionism but when you don't get what you want, you have to let it go and value more important things like good health, friends, personal interests, and family support. your alternative is being miserable over something that has little bearing over you as a person and not in your control.",
