  "text": "Hi everyone. I am a freshman in my community college and it's going horrible. I feel so tired and depressed and I stopped attending my classes and neglecting homework. My mom keeps getting angry because I am considering a major change. I love my major but the classes required are horrible. All my classes feel so miserable and I wish I enjoyed college and school like I used to. Should I take a gap year/semester? Sorry, I don't know how to use Reddit as I don't get on it much.",
