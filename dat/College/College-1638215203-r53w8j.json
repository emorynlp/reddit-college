  "text": "I've failed multiple tests in one of my classes this quarter despite having notes next to me and the study guide--its driven me to the point of not caring about the class and pretty much college in general. What really pissed me off was yesterday I had another test due at midnight and I didn't care how I did on it. So I just used some basic ass notes and I got an A.  I dont know what I'm doing wrong, but I'm either constantly behind or I struggle with learning the most basic shit. Also if something doesn't have a to the point description I literally just blank out and get confused. I dont know what's wrong with me.",

Whenever i put in all my effort i never get the results i want its so fustrating. I also grasp information alot slower and i'm always behind so i sorta get it. but i agree with the person below me. we just gotta firgure out what works and what doesn't and be consistent ig.",

      "text": "I would guess that you're using the wrong study techniques for certain things, but I'm assuming all of that. Look into other ways to study. \n\nHow do you study now? How long? \n\nNotes and study guides during exams can be such a pain in the ass. Searching through them takes time. They can be a detriment. \n\nCollege is about adaptation to needs. If you don't change how you do things for certain professors, you won't get good grades. Some professors want one thing while others want another. Pay attention and adjust accordingly to give them exactly what they want. \n\nAs for studying, study more. Study differently. What you're doing doesn't seem to working, so stop doing it. Also, being behind is really really easy to get ahead of. It takes zero extra work to do things beforehand.",
