      "text": "I have adhd so I struggle with both time management and studying, here\u2018s some things that help me: \n\n1) Get planning apps or physical planners, whatever you prefer. \"Things 3\" is my favorite to-do list app (iOS only, sorry android users). It\u2018s a bit pricey but in return it\u2018s not a subscription model, one time payment and you get to keep it. \n\nAnd there are a wealth of alternatives that vary in functions, from simple todo apps (e.g. Anydo, microsoft Todo) and notebooks up to project management software like Asana. And yes I\u2018m being serious about PM software. It might sound overkill but if it helps you keep track of your assignements and time, then it\u2018s not a stupid idea. I use Asana and it has the added benefit that you can invite others into projects. \n\n2) Learn to priorize. I generaly follow the 80-20 rule with all my classes: for 80% of my grade I will have to put in 20% effort, but for the last 20% of the grade I will have to put in 80%. A B is more than enough for me to pass and have a good average. I will gladly put in more effort if I have free time but in general time is the most important resource. I minimize the amount of work I put in and maximize the results. \n\nIn practice, this means I just accept that the essay I\u2018m going to hand in is not perfect and I\u2018m going to get a grade that does not reflect my actual abilities, but in return I get a lot of time to work on projects that are soon due. Or instead of spending 2x 1 hour commuting to uni and another 1.5 hours for one class, I read through the powerpoint in 30 min and miss some additional info. But in return I gain 3 hours of free time to study other subjects. \n\nSimilarly, I don\u2018t start studying for finals in subjects I know I\u2018ll get a passing grade even with minimal preparation and use that time to prepare for subjects I know I will struggle reaching a good grade. \n\nAnd 3) Look out for your physical and mental health. I don\u2018t have any \"hacks\" for studying as I will always struggle just sitting down and working on my things. But it is much easier to do that if you\u2018re getting enough sleep (for me that means no caffeine after 5pm, because even though I have no issue falling asleep, it severely fucks with the quality of my sleep) and just feel well in general. Set a goal to drink enough water by having a water bottle in a place you walk by or frequent a lot, take a sip everytime you pass it. Research healthy nutrition, doesn\u2018t have to be a lot, but just a little bit more vitamins even once or twice a week will help you. If you feel like shit because of your mental health, take time to rest up instead of going to class, stressing yourself more by attending and learning nothing because you can\u2018t focus anyways and feeling even worse afterwards.",

      "text": "First, go to every class and sit in the front row. Your professor will know you, and be more willing to help.\n\nSecond, print out all the closures material (syllabus, slide decks, etc) before the first class, and organize it all in a binder.\n\nThird, use google calendar and add events for all your tests and project dates.\n\nFourth, go to office hours ever week and ask a question about the material. Any question. Just forcing yourself to think up a question will keep you actively learning the material.\n\nFifth, don\u2019t overload yourself. Take only four classes, or sign up for five and withdraw from the one you\u2019re doing worst in after the first 3 weeks.",

Something ive noticed that works for me is I trick myself by telling myself \"ill only do one problem or write one sentence.\" Which usually gets the ball rolling. \n\nAlso 20/80 rule.
