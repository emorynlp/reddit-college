  "title:": "How do you get close to new people at college?",
  "text": "I started college in September, so I've only known people there for like 2 months. Which isn't much and I didn't think I was supposed to make close friends after such a short time. But it seems like everyone's getting into close friendships with each other. I feel left out. I really like them and I would love to be their friends, but I don't know how. It doesn't seem like I can invite them anywhere. I mean.. Why would they want to meet me? We aren't close enough to invite them out for a coffee or a drink. At first I was like okay this will change and I'll get used to this feeling. Well I'm not getting used to it, it's getting worse. I'm constantly worried that they're together somewhere, having fun, and leaving me out. I knew this shit is getting serious when I saw two of them together in an Instagram story and got close to a panic attack. Any ideas? How did you manage to make new friends?",

      "text": "I didn't meet any close friends until the ending if my first year. Now I have one friend that I can talk to. I didn't really do anything other than getting put into a group project where we were forced to work together. We started finding one thing in common and that is about a guy in our group that wouldn't do anything. I'm shy so it is hard to make friends for me. This semester I am sitting at a table with a group of people and we are all friendly with each other. You just gotta put yourself out there more. Talk to them and ask them to do something with you. You have to start somewhere. I just get into groups with people and we start to talk and I start to know them more as the semester goes on. They may bit be my friend by the end of the year, but at least I tried (somewhat).",

      "text": "FOMO is an actual medical diagnosis now. What you said about Instagram made me need to tell you. Ask for help with an assignment or offer help. But into a conversation nicely and say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but to hear...\u201d and go from there offer your number get their number and text them. No one is intentionally leaving you out. I tend to think the world is plotting against me too. But if you know deep down inside that you are a nice and fun person to be around and you\u2019re only jealous because you feel left out, make more of an effort. It seems so natural, people making friends and all, but it takes effort. Be critical with your choice of friends too. College can be very eye opening keep your morals and only hang out with people that will keep you on track to graduate. There is probably a counselor on campus that you can talk to about FOMO who will help you with some more friend making techniques. No one intentionally leaves out the quiet person, they are just engaged with the people who make an effort. Make an effort, you got this!",

      "text": "You\u2019re not alone. I was completely lonely my freshman year, and I\u2019ve been jealous of everyone for seemingly finding friend groups so quickly. As I met others, I learned that others went through this as well. So many people understand what you\u2019re going through.\n\nI highly recommend clubs and school jobs. Those are the two places where I was able to click well with people. I didn\u2019t rly find classes to be effective because a lot of people have the mentality of just being present and then going home. But there may be smaller classes / group project-oriented classes where you have a higher chance of making friends.\n\nStart off by just being present. Attend club meetings, sign up for a job, be there for classes. Be nice and friendly with people, make yourself known as a welcoming person. Ask people to study together, or ask people if they\u2019re interested in hanging out over the weekend. Chances are, there will be someone who wants to get to know you more who will be willing to make time for you.\n\nDon\u2019t get discouraged by rejections. I\u2019ve asked someone to hang out with me for an entire term and it never worked out - she always had an excuse. People like that aren\u2019t worth your time, don\u2019t fret about them. Stick with the people who make sure to make time for you. Likewise, make time for people you care about.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t have friends until later in college. People make friends at different paces. You will be okay - there is nothing wrong with you.",

Agree on someone\u2019s dorm/apartment/chill area to head back to after food (or with food if you prefer takeout). This is the point that created bonding for me. After like half an hour of munching and half assed discussion, we\u2019d usually end up shooting the shit til like 1 or 2 am then boom, friendship. It sounds easy writing it down, but before college, I never saw myself asking people to hang out and stuff just because. You gotta push yourself out of your comfort zone. Once you leave it, you\u2019ll find that it just gets bigger.",

So, odds are better if you ask. \n\nAlso if they say they're already busy, (which happens when friendships are already setup) just tell them to hit you up when they're free because you soooo need to get out before the weather gets ugly or some bullshit like that lol  \n\n\nAlso, maybe join a club, it's automatic similar interests and new people to befriend.",

After they split up I went to one of the guys and said, Hey! Umm I heard you guys were talking about modding skyrim and all that, are you a modder? He instantly started smiling gave his name, we sat together talked for hours and he introduced me to his group. So I would say find a group of people that you are interested in and try to find one of the members alone and just say a thing. Strike up a conservation, it won't hurt.",

Honestly about half of the groups you see were friend groups before college (most people go to a nearby university so people from the same high school are bound to stick together in college). You just have to be patient, hit it off with someone from class or a club, and in ny experience, people are more receptive to invitations than you think. I asked my lab partner if he wanted to grab a bite at a local restaurant before working on an assignment. stuff like that. \n\nI made most of my friends late in my freshman year, all through one person I knew from class. You'll get there, just be patient and learn to enjoy doing stuff by yourself for the time being.",

We seem to get along really good, and I think I'll ask them if they want to grab lunch with me.\n\nI've always had a hard time making friends, and right now I feel extremely lonely and hopeless. I really hope to make friends, but I don't want to rush anything either. (Did this before, and it doesn't work). So maybe I should give myself more time and good things will happen much later...",

It would have been weird for me to randomly sit right next to them. Right? Everyone usually spreads out in the classroom, like one person on the far left corner the next in the far right corner, so it would have been weird right?  \nSorry if this sounds like too much overthinking, I have awful social anxiety.

I never know what to talk about because honestly most friends I have walked up to ME and I have no idea how to start conversations without asking things that might be too personal or creepy.\n\nAnd for the other person, I thought it might be weird because there are about 50 seats and usually only ten or so people, everyone very much spread out across the classroom, so if I just sit right next to this stranger, wouldn't that be kind of creepy?\nI might need to think up excuses though. I'm great at finding excuses for not doing schoolwork, so I guess I can try this. And thanks for the tips!",

People go get food one on one without it being a date all of the time and no one is going to assume you are dating just cause they see 2 people at the same table at a restaurant. I\u2019ve asked people that and no one ever responded that they aren\u2019t gay or something like that to make me think that I was asking them out.",
