Nobody on my floor seems to really want to invite me to their group, I\u2019ve tried talking to almost everybody. I keep trying to talk to strangers in the dining halls etc but it\u2019s just a never ending loop of small talk and never seeing each other again. \n\nI\u2019m in some clubs and that hasn\u2019t helped either. \n\nI\u2019d say I have pretty decent social skills and am somewhat outgoing. I am kind of blown away I am in this situation right now. \n\nLiterally what do I do I went out every weekend in high school. This is rough. I\u2019m not used to this. It is just so lonely.",

However, I am an introvert with limited social skills. \n\nThat being said, one thing I think is overlooked about growing up in general is learning to be okay with being alone and doing it with confidence. I\u2019m not saying friends are bad or you shouldn\u2019t try, because you should! But you should also focus on yourself, focus on who you want to be and to become and take this time of loneliness to strengthen yourself. It\u2019s incredibly sad how many people in this generation are too afraid to do something by themselves- but do it. Be independent and be confident in being alone because it makes you that much more authentic and genuine of a person.",

I literally just started talking to people who looked like they were struggling to also get friends in my classes(they weren\u2019t talking to the people next to them or anyone), so I talked about how I didn\u2019t have anyone and we connected off that. I gave them my phone number and said if they ever were interested in studying together or anything like that, text me. That person then talked to a couple other people in that class who didn\u2019t have anyone, and they added them to a group chat. We ended up with 8 people. We literally just became friends off the fact that we had no friends lol. We\u2019d hang out almost every day, and there was almost always someone in the group that was available to do something. I can\u2019t say that would work for everyone, but we were introverts that could connect based off our experiences from that. So we were at least comfortable with each other in silence. \n\nYou could also just start off by saying something about an assignment or something relating to the class. Then try and continue the conversation and turn it into something else. Like \u201cugh I wanted to go to the gym but we have this assignment\u201d. Try and gauge them and see what they like.

It didn\u2019t help that I was 17 when I was thrown into the world alone, and I was still struggling with depression and slept for 22 hours a day for weeks at a time. I would strongly recommend taking time to find yourself without looking for validation from other people. I would take walks to parks near me and read, mediate, and work out. It changed me and made me a better person, it was also so much more fulfilling than seeing friends 24/7 and inevitably making their lives more important to me than my own.",

Some people are much less selective with friends and just need people around them to feel validated. Don\u2019t be intimidated by friend groups being formed immediately and not being a part of them as that\u2019s just how some people operate. I was in the same place you were my freshman year and if I had to give myself advice then it would be to just be patient. Give it some time until you really find some people you enjoy being around and you will be 100x happier in the long run than you would be trying to force \u201cfriends\u201d into your life.",

I\u2019m not trying to say that you shouldn\u2019t go out and try to make friends, what I\u2019m more so trying to get at is that you most likely will be disappointed with the quality of friends you will get if you try to force friendships just to have people to be around. But at the same time that\u2019s not always the case as you might find someone who is a great/genuine person with similar interests and become good friends. The reason why I\u2019m bringing up being cautious is that college students, especially freshman, use their newfound freedoms to put themselves first, sometimes at the expense of others (once again not always the case but happens very frequently). \n\nI was fortunate enough to find a martial arts club my first semester freshman year with a lot of genuinely nice, down to earth people and we all have been friends ever since (now a grad student). But that was about two months into my first semester before I actually built meaningful friendships with them. I tried the routine of making friends with people in classes/in the dining halls but it just ended up being awkward and short lived. I tried being friends with people in my dorm and they ended up just using me because I had a car and constantly excluded me from anything that didn\u2019t involve needing to drive somewhere.",

It really sucks because I always had friends in high school and making friends usually came easy to me, but I went halfway across the country for college and knew 0 people at my school- which was also in the South where Greek life is near essential but I couldnt afford it, and rush is before classes even start so everyone has a group by then. I also joined like 4 clubs freshman year but by luck I joined ones that never had socials/meetups outside of strict meetings and I didnt make friends from it. So the next year I tried to do some research about which clubs had lots of socials/fun people and I joined that including a club sport. I did make a couple friends freshman year but I barely had anything in common (I really wanted to party but they didn't at all).\n\nMy second year there I joined a sport and another club that assigned mentors and this helped me network really fast. Still, I hadn't been satisfied with my college experience since I didnt have a whole lot in common with my new friends, so I transferred to a college where I already had lots of friends.\n\nThe first year absolutely destroyed my self esteem because it made me think I was ugly and unlikeable. In reality, I had a culture shock and was dealt a bad hand. As soon as I transferred to my current school, everything fell into place and it's been 2 years (im a 5th year) but I am remembering that I am not antisocial and I am likeable. Just try to remember that sometimes on this site people really do come here being mad antisocial and others have to say \"well youre not making friends because youre doing something wrong\" and sometimes, if all of what you're saying is true, you're just having a rough time and its not your fault.\n\nas a side note- i kept in touch with some of my high school class when I would go home for summer and every year more and more people (who were popular and likeable) said they were transferring or dropping out because the social scene was difficult for them. So dont let this situation get you down",

Take advantage of the fact your roommate doesn\u2019t hang around every weekend I know that can seem like a drawback but just in general I would advise maybe think about have you looked into the Snapchat Instagram or Facebook party accounts for your university have you been going to events outside of school sanctioned stuff if you can find some of the parties thrown by like the theater majors or the house parties if you don\u2019t want to go to frat parties a lot of house parties will post an address where a party might be as kind of like an open Invitation you can meet people that way.   \n\n\nhang in there you will find your friends it can just take a little while just keep doing what you\u2019re doing maybe consider downloading tinder or some thing for your university I know it\u2019s primarily a hook up app but you can meet people on there and try discord most universities these days have a discord chat that people are involved in and you can talk to people on there decide if you want to meet them in person or not I would suggest a public meeting place like the library or something if you decide to go that route",

I actually have downloaded tinder lol, I\u2019ve had a few convos but nothing that\u2019s really lead to actual in person hanging out. I guess I should have looked more into the Snapchat group chats etc when I first moved in. I feel like it might be weird to join them now. As for parties, If I knew where they were, it would be weird but I would probably just go alone and try to meet people. Just don\u2019t hear much about that.",

I was pretty antisocial during a lot of college(global pandemic/commuter student). at the beginning of the summer I started going to open mics/shows as often as I could to meet people with the same interests as me. Sometimes I would go with friends and sometimes alone, but either way I would always try to meet new people every time I went. Going alone can be kind of daunting but there\u2019s no better feeling then leaving with more friends you came in with, especially ones that share your interests. And if it doesn\u2019t work out sometimes, you at least got to spend that time doing something you enjoy. Getting involved with that has cured alot of fomo I used to experience, I still get it sometimes but far less frequently and it\u2019s mainly caused by other areas in my life I\u2019m working on addressing.",

Go and do the fun stuff even if nobody wants to go/you don't know anybody to go with you. You're sitting and allowing yourself to be miserable thinking being in your own company alone isn't fullfilling enough. It *can* be fullfilling to do things by yourself, life *can* be fun even though you aren't out partying every Friday night. You're letting your life pass you by just because you haven't made any friends yet. It took me like 6 weeks or so to make any real friends in college and at least a year to make any long-term friends. Before I made those friends, I just did the things I wanted to do but I did them alone.\n\nAlso, ask people to go do things. \"Hey, there's a movie that starts in an hour. Wanna go?\" Often you are all (and by that I mean college freshmen) sitting around waiting for the other person to ask and it's easier if you just do it first.",
