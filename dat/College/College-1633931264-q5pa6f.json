  "text": "I need to know if my plan makes sense or is realistic with the job market/reality. I plan on finishing my generals at the community college I am at, transferring to a tritonal four year school, double majoring in social studies education and history. Once I graduate Id like to teach at a high school for some odd number of years, attend a masters program that will hopefully be paid for by the school I am working at. Then Id like to pursue my PHD to be a history professor at a 4 year school. Is this reasonable/realistic? I have a serious passion for teaching and I also really enjoy history. The main reason Id like to be a professor at some point is because from what I understand you are able to put together your curriculum  for the most part, and its more relaxed and you sorta get to decide what it is that you want to teach. (the way my history teacher explained it, college students pay for their professors knowledge and what the professor finds important about the certain subject). But yeah does this make sense? am i over optimistic? all insight is appreciated :)",

      "text": "If it's teaching you're interested in, I'd include keeping open to teaching at a 2-year community college. The market for history PhD's is over saturated, so it's tough to get into any position, especially something full time. \n\nWhatever you do, promise me that you'll have an alternate plan. And that you won't become a long term adjunct/ part time faculty. Those positions are not intended to earn a living - pay and work conditions tend to be poor. Doing a class or two as an adjunct is fine to get some experience, but you need to keep applying to multiple full time positions and don't get stuck in the adjunct rut. Have an alternate option (or two or three) outside of academia.",

          "text": "I just finished reading up a whole bunch after i posted this, and it seems that landing a job in history is kind of doomed and its a waste of a phd ://. Id be ok with teaching a community college but do you need a phd for that as well? Id love to teach but idk what to teach besides history, and more importantly id love to be a professor (not because of research stuff, but because of the teaching aspect) but from everything ive read it isnt possible. So im unsure of what to do now :(",

                  "text": "This is not true. Many community college professors teach 5 courses per semester at their institution. And though technically you only need an MA to teach at a CC, the market is oversaturated enough that people with a PhD are applying for these jobs, so you will not be competitive with just an MA. \n\nAdditionally, the PhD is a research degree, not a teaching degree. In order to successfully complete the 6 years of the program, you need to be quite interested in research, not teaching. \n\nu/A1089 you should check out private school teaching. Some schools pay horribly, but many will offer much more flexibility in curriculum than public schools. Do not do a PhD unless you absolutely love research. And as you note, the history market is a shit show, so it's really not a path I would advise anyone to take right now.",

      "text": "I had posted this earlier, but it got deleted for short links, so reposting now!\n\nHistory grad student here! Teaching K-12 is gonna be a much more viable plan. There's a *huge* glut of history PhDs being produced every year compared to positions being created, and few faculty retire after the 2007 market crash, so it can be insanely competitive to get a professorship, even if you've got a great resume. See [this fantastic thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/96yf9h/monday_methods_why_you_should_not_get_a_history/) on r/AskHistorians for some more info about that. It's several years old, but it matches what my faculty told me when applying for programs last year. Basically if you're applying for a PhD, you want several backup plans outside of academia.\n\n\nI will also say it's worth looking at what profs do versus what teachers do. If you're at a community college or primarily a teaching university, you would get to teach more. However, I know that at my university, being a research university, teaching is kind of a secondary thing, so it's expected that you pump out research even in fields like history or education. Most of the folks here have way more research and administrative stuff than teaching. A lot of what we have in terms of course offerings also get dictated by what student interests are perceived to be. For instance, Civil War is big at my university, so while the prof will decide how to approach it, they're pretty much guaranteed to offer that as a yearly thing, while something less appealing to students may only come around now and then.\n\n\nI'm not saying any of that to be discouraging, just as stuff we all need to know before jumping into graduate school with the plan of going to academia. It's certainly not impossible -- my program has several young faculty -- but it's a big risk and may or may not be what you're looking for.",

Unless you are recognized as the leader in your field (e.g. Einstein), absolutely no college will allow you to decided what to teach nor will students pay for your knowledge. The school will have defined curriculum which you may be able to provide input to (depending on seniority), however you will not be able to freely teach whatever you feel like. Students pay for courses to earn credits to obtain a degree. There are very few students who are willing to pay for a random history course simply out of interest for the topic and far fewer willing to do so simply out of respect for a professors expertise.",
