  "text": "Hello final grades are about to be published and I am worried about my one unexcused absence which is affecting my grade. On the syllabus it says, \u201cAfter two unexcused Discussion Section absences, each additional unexcused absence will result in a penalty of 1/3 grade letter on your final grade.\u201d Does this mean I have two free absences before they start docking attendance points or does this mean they still take off points for the 2 unexcused absences just not as many? \n\nI am currently standing at an 89.44% my attendance is graded as (93/100) because I missed one class. If i had 100% on my attendance this would bring my overall grade up to an 89.9% I hope this makes sense!",

      "text": "You\u2019re good. You get two free absences before it hursts your grade. The idea behind a policy like this is that life happens, and the professor would rather let you decide what necessitates an absence rather than make everyone explain every situation.\n\nEveryone gets sick, has family die, or goes through a breakup at some point, so the professor is giving you two days to deal with whatever it is you need without getting a note first.",
