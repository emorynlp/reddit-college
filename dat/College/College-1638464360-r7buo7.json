If not then I would just be sure to screen shot your grades every few days in case something gets changed and keep checking whatever system your school uses for notifications or announcements (I get notifications from Canvas whenever an assignment is posted or due date is changed). I've had professors change grades but they usually raise them if they see that there 2 answers that technically could have been correct on an assignment.",

A professor has to stick to the rubric in their syllabus. Their syllabus must be a consistent outline for the course. A student has a right to prompt communication. This information should be brought to the Chair of the department.",
