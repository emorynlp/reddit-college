  "text": "I feel like such a dolt. I've been through 4 majors in the last three years: math, biology, philosophy, and photography. I want to graduate and my parents are pressuring me to just get my current degree done. I'm a photography major and I've just found out that it's not the art for me. I'd much rather be doing sculpture.\n\nI'm pretty clear on that but it feels stupid and transgressive. My parents are like \"GRADUATE\" and I'm like \"I'd like to do something I like and aren't growing to dislike\". The thing is, with my track record, how do I know I won't get into the fine arts program and dislike it? I looked at all the courses and they seem like things I'd like to do. But how do I know? I thought I wanted to do math until I admittedly gave up on it on account of me being in the middle of a psychotic break (I have schizoaffective disorder). I also couldn't see myself being smart enough to hack it in the math jobs that require rigor. I was insecure.\n\nBio was cool until I had to do Chem. At the time (cognitive faculties recovering from psychotic break), I couldn't keep up with the math and concepts. I also had terrible organizational skills for doing homework and the professor taught in a very janky way. \n\nPhilosophy was a dub, I hated reading philosophy books (although I loved the readings for class--which were admittedly basic because Philo 101 was as far as I got). \n\nAnd now recently I've gotten into photography for reasons I can't recall. Just the pressure to go to school.\n\nSo I'm studying photography and I live on campus at a community college. There's nothing really to photograph that I haven't already. My professor commented on my photography saying it was \"photography of the banal\". This made me temporarily see the world as boring and trash if I couldn't see it appearing good in a camera. That being said, an art that relies on the representational world is not one that I want to pursue. I have an imagination and a desire to do things and make things and... well that's hard with photography. So I want to study sculpture. \n\nI just don't know. I guess I'm just afraid that I'm going to switch and then switch again, or drop out because nothing appeals to me as a craft. I'm scared. Anyone have any advice or things to think about?\n\nTl;dr I want to explore sculpture but it would be my fifth major change. My parents are pressuring me to stay in school for photography and finish. I\u2019m scared that if I change my major again, before long, I\u2019ll want to do something else.",

If you can do the \u201cphotography of the banal\u201d well, that\u2019s really marketable for bringing home a paycheck, but something else might get your creative juices flowing photography-wise for your own enjoyment.",
