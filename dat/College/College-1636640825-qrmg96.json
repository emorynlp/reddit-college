  "text": "I am a freshman computer science student. I initially enrolled since this is a practical choice. Now, I am always burned out. I don't like coding (not me disrespecting those who have passion for it), maybe I am just not cut out to be a programmer. I wanna shift to Agricultural Biotechnology. I am interested in Biology and Chemistry. Looking at the curriculum, it made me feel excited. No subject in my CS curriculum has me feeling like this. My problem is that I don't know how to tell my parents, I suppose they won't be approved of this. I seriously can't do CS anymore :(( Any advice?",

      "text": "If your a freshmen in the fall smester now is a great time to switch majors. CS builds on itself so if you hate it now you will absolutly hate it for the next 3 years. As for your parents - it will be hard to tell them but in the end they want you to be happy and successfull. Just be honest and try to be calm. Talk to your advisors and make a plan for the next year/2 in reguards to your new major. I always find it helpful to talk to my advisors when it comes to anything school related.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude01",
