  "text": "I got diagnosed last year, didn\u2019t really want meds, I was coping. I transferred to a 4 year college this year that\u2019s on a quarter system and I feel like it\u2019s affecting me more.\n\nI\u2019m debating on starting ADHD meds and I would love to hear your stories/experiences\n\nEDIT: To clarify I meant more of like specifically how did starting your meds while in the middle of college work out? Did it take time to adjust to them? Did it negatively effect your academic performance? How did you go about it? .. etc.\n\n(Thanks to everyone who already responded!)",

I\u2019ll look into CBT, I think what I\u2019m doing is just general therapy. \n\n\nDo you mind if I ask, did it take time to adjust to your meds? Did it negatively effect your school in the beginning? (If not no worries at all!)",

      "text": "Everyones experience with meds is different. The one thing I think you need to know though is that most of the stimulant medications only last a few hours. It doesn\u2019t help you 24/7. How long they last typically depends on the dosage and your metabolism. Therefore you have to plan your day around what time you take it. Plan things that need focus (like homework) during the time frame your meds are working. There is a couple of non-stimulant options that will help 24/7. Particularly Strattera. Those won\u2019t work immediately though. They have to build up in your system similar to an antidepressant. If you go over to r/ADHD people frequently talk about various medications and their experiences with them.",

      "text": "I was officially diagnosed right after finishing undergrad. I was already on non-stimulants, so we started Adderall in the summer, while I was in an internship. That wasn't helping much, so I started Vyvanse this fall, about a month into my first semester of grad school.\n\n\nAs far as school work, it's helped me a lot. I have 3-hour seminars and it was physically painful trying to sit through those before the Vyvanse. I couldn't read worth shit, and now I'm managing 3-4 books a week. Stimulants also help my anxiety, since my ADHD feeds into it.\n\n\nThe good thing about stimulants is that you'll know pretty quickly how your body responds, versus antidepressants where you need several weeks to really get them in your system. So in my case, when we've started or increased a dose, I start it on a weekend in case anything weird happens. You can also have days of not taking it. Some folks don't do that because it's harder to get things done. I'll skip if I have a less busy day, and that can help to reset your body if needed. But that's something you should discuss with your doctor if you pursue stimulants, to figure out what's best for you.\n\n\nAs another user mentioned, they each have a window of time when they're effective, depending on what you're prescribed. Usually that means taking it like an hour before whatever you need to do, often with food, so to get the most out of it, you need to plan. \n\n\nThe other thing I'll say is that where stimulants are a controlled substance with a stigma, it can sometimes be annoying to get. I had my diagnosis already, but I had to bring my test to my campus provider, despite already being prescribed a stimulant, before they'd prescribe me one. Folks I know have had issues with insurance, although I've never had that issue.",
