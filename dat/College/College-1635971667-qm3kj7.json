  "text": "Hi there!\n\nBit of back story:\n\nSo I'm an online college student and my classes tend to go 1 class for 5 weeks straight, no other classes. However, I am also an author and my story is centered around college students in a physical building. Like, normal college where you have multiple classes in a semester.\n\nOne of the lines in my story, the characters are talking about one of their professors parent has passed away. This is the dialogue I've got currently:\n\nCharacter 1: \"Do you know our math teacher, Mr. Connors?\"\n\nCharacter 2: \"Yes, I have him \\[involves question I'm gonna ask\\]\"\n\nCharacter 1: \"His Dad died during a break in at their house last night\"\n\nMy thought was that Character 2 has that teacher 2 times a week. But I'm not sure if that's how college works, so I want to ask:\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow do college classes work in in-person college? Can you have the same class twice a week or only one time a week?\n\nSorry if it's a bit long, I just wanted to make sure I explained why I needed to know!",
