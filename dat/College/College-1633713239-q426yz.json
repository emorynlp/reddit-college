  "text": "I (23F) am 10 credit hours away from my bachelors degree in biology as a 5th year. My plan was to attend med school afterwards. Since the pandemic started I\u2019ve realized that being in the medical field is not for me. I\u2019m very low on money, cost of med school is too high for the starting wages. Also my grades have dropped significantly since the pandemic that I wouldn\u2019t get into med school. I\u2019ve been extremely burnt out on school & just want to get the degree and be done. \n\nHowever, since med school is no longer an option I\u2019m stuck with a biology degree with no interest in being in the science field. I don\u2019t want to work in a lab or research my entire life. \n\nI\u2019m just kind of lost. I spent the last couple of years focusing on med school that I haven\u2019t explored other options for what I would be interested in. Has any one else experienced this? Graduating soon moving home with parents who expect me to work or get a masters. I have no idea what type of job or masters program to look for.\n\nSeeking advice, guidance and stories.",

      "text": "What are your thoughts on other areas of STEM? I'm in biostatistics (which is just applying statistics to biological problems-- you don't actually need to know any biology it just helps) and a lot of people seem to get into it from your situation. They thought they liked bio but burned out on it and jumped into something data related and found out they actually loved statistics.\n\nThere's also bioinformatics, too. Again, it's very different than being in medicine or healthcare or biology, but you still get to put the bio knowledge to good use. \n\nConsider looking into anything data related in healthcare. The actual day to day experience of what we do is different than what clinical or wet lab folks do so maybe you'll find it's a good fit for you.",

              "text": "It really depends on what sort of data job your looking for. The \"best\" jobs require higher education, and I'd say that most jobs require at least a master's, but I do believe that bachelor's level data jobs do exist, but they usually want evidence of experience. \n\nBeing very good at math will help a lot and tbh you should really take advantage of that. Many people who are interested in the field struggle with math and a grad degree is no walk in the park so getting a more math intensive grad degree (an MS in statistics or biostatistics are more marketable in my experience than and MPH in biostatistics or a master's in data analytics because the former are more math/theory heavy so you get more rigor). \n\nBut yeah, you'll probably need further education, BUT you do have a chance of not needing it if you play your cards right, find some way to get experience outside of a formal setting, and can get your foot in the door. Otherwise, a master's can go a long way, particularly a more rigorous one.",

If you decide to look in that direction, my guess would be to look at a medical research university, as they may be more likely to offer tuition help if you decide to pursue a MS. \n\nI only mention this as my university does medical research, and they are always advertising for the major. I know they have research positions as well. I'm a CS major, and I'm not entirely sure what each of my professors do, but from what my Algorithms Professor has mentioned in class, he is part of a team that works at optimizing algorithms to detect cancer from medical imaging. \n\nRegardless, I know next to nothing about it, just that they send out emails occasionally looking for CS majors that might be interested. Not sure if you like tech, but if you are good at math and have a biology degree but don't want medical school, it seems like the perfect fit on paper.",

Explain the situation to your parents and tell them you need a few months to think/plan a new career path, now that medical school isn\u2019t happening. \n\nIf they\u2019re disappointed that your not going to med school, approach the conversation from a business perspective; tell them you decided it wasn\u2019t worth it and it\u2019s not practical with the high costs of school, for low starting salaries. Focus on that aspect, not your GPA or it not being what you want when discussing it with them.\n\nA lot of parents mainly see dollar signs when talking about college or their children\u2019s careers, tailor the pitch to the audience. \n\nAfter you\u2019ve had some time to de-stress/cool off, I\u2019d say start looking into other school options: trade school, the military, police academy, or an office job that doesn\u2019t require a specific degree.",

      "text": "This might not be the best answer, but I'd really just suggest looking into what other classes you've already taken that you COULD POSSIBLY switch your major to. I know it's not always optimal, but changing majors is something people do all the time. It definitely sucks because of how close you already are to completing your current degree, but maybe you could find something that could also utilize the credits you've already earned that would also interest you more. \n\nAt the end of the day no one should ever hate what they do for a living, especially if you are able to pursue any path available at a given university. I'm sorry this isn't the greatest advice ever (I'm literally only a sophomore at my college \ud83d\ude16), but from those I've talked to and had the pleasure of getting to know, there's no shame in changing your path as long as you end up someplace satisfactory. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a",
