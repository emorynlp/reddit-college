  "text": "So it\u2019s close to the end of the year, and I think I want to switch majors. Currently majoring in Chemistry because I didn\u2019t know what major in and my poor grades despite really trying is making it clear it\u2019s not for me, I beginning to hate it and I don\u2019t want to do that for the rest of my life. Is it possible to switch majors at the end of the semester? It\u2019s the first semester of my 2nd year and I wanna know if that\u2019s possible and how a bad grade in a chem class would effect me if I were to major in something completely different like English or something. I know I\u2019m an idiot to let it come to this but that\u2019s just where I\u2019m at rn. \n\nI know it\u2019s lengthy but any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Just picking something random didn't work out so well the first, so what has been your thought process/research this time?",
