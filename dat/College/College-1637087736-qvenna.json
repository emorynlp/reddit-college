  "text": "Hello all, \n\nI've recently been thinking about going back to school and pursuing a degree in Computer Science but I'm not sure if that's really what I'm after. I love working with computers and find different programming languages very interesting to learn and use. I currently have a degree in Architecture but I'm thinking of switching fields and going something more along the programming route (although this is very broad and I'm not really sure what exactly I would like to do). \n\nBottom line is, my local community college offers a wide range language certificates. For example, they have C++ Language proficiency certificate, JAVA, LINUX, UNIX. and a lot more. They also have Computer science degree paths too, and as my community college is one of the biggest in IL, they have an extensive amount of paths I could take. But I essentially want to know if it's worth it to just go for these certificates and if that alone would be enough to get my foot in the door for a job. I'm of the mentality that you NEED a degree to really make it in an industry but I have no experience whatsoever in this sector so any help at all would be great. Would going for a computer science degree make more sense or no? I'm sorry if this is really broad and vague so feel free to ask any questions if it'll help clear anything up. Thanks!",
