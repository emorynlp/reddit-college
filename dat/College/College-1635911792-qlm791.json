  "text": "I\u2019m in my second semester and have done  great in every class except statistics. I\u2019m currently taking psychology and two stats classes. This class makes me want to quit altogether. I don\u2019t understand any of it and to make things worse, we have practice exams that we have to get to 80 percent before we can take the real exam.\n\nI was supposed to have taken an exam three weeks ago, but I can\u2019t get the practice exam to 80. I wish she would just let me take the grade I can get so I can move on.\n\nI\u2019m so sick of it and I don\u2019t know what to do. There\u2019s no way I will ever be able to understand statistics. I don\u2019t think financial aid would pay for me if I dropped it and only had one class.",

You don't need an A, heck you don't need a B... YOu need a fucking borderline C and just get done with it. We can't be perfect in everything, and it is this sick world that punishes us for not being perfect despite preaching that perfection is impossible.",
