A degree can facilitate your path to success, but it will also depend on your skills, knowledge, internships etc.",

      "text": "Business is a super common field as everyone thinks it will result in making more money. The issue is, that inherent selling-point means loads of people lacking any passion for business graduate with business degrees. I was told by a hiring manager of a company which does publicity, marketing, and designs for government and large institutions that they would rather hire someone with a BA in Art, Anthropology, or Political Science over a BA or BBA in Business. If you are excellent at Business and go to a decent (top-50 or maybe top-100) you can get an amazing well-paying job, but for those who are not outstanding, the chances of getting a great paying job are less. It's the same for any field, but Business's perception as a well-paying major deludes people to their actual chances of getting a great job.",
