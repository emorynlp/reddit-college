  "text": "\nI'm a sophomore in college and nobody really makes an effort to meet new people or communicate with others. When walking around campus everybody just stares at their phones and classes are online so you don't meet people in classes. In high school, I was very social and it feels like everybody here is just socially awkward and avoiding everybody. How TF am I supposed to meet girls besides going on stupid dating apps? I feel like in the past before phones and covid people actually talked to each other and made meeting girls way easier.",

The kinda girl you\u2019d be interested in will be keeping her head up too. \n\nPatience, my friend. Go ahead and scroll and swipe for a fuck buddy if you really wanna, but patience and observance will bring you the right person at the right moment. Don\u2019t be afraid to use awkward (non-creepy)ice breakers either!",

Remember  if you fear being single,  it's because of bullies. Let me explain.  Some people are socially unacceptable. And men with short hair didn't protect them. That's why bullying exists.\n\nSo,  girls think you would be the type to defend the bullied misfit.  So they reject you.",
