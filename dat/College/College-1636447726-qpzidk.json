  "text": "I can tell for my own sake and mental health I should probably take a semester off but I can't help but feel guilty if I do. I am a junior computer science major and I am burnt tf out.\n\nI am failing a class this semester, and the hopelessness of it all sucks. I could potentially lose scholarships over it and if I do, I need to find another way to cover the bill.\n\nI know I will be judged by my family members for taking a semester off but at the end of the day this is my life, and I have to prioritize myself because that's what will help me achieve my goal in the long run. I hope I am making the right decision. I just can't keep doing this anymore. ",

It\u2019s not abnormal to take a year off, especially with the abnormal year we have had with a pandemic. There are other factors affecting everyone that no one wants to talk about too. Be kind for yourself and do what you feel is best! Youre an adult, they can judge all they want but, as your said, your life! Best of luck to you!",

I'm just feeling so overwhelmed and tired of it all, so you're not alone. Every single day a class I don't care about and homework that doesn't get me anywhere. Alone. The hope is that the new setting will help me to refresh.",

I landed in a condo with a private pool for \\~$60 a night and that wasn't even the best option at that price range. Flying spirit air for \\~$200. I think that I may be able to pull the whole thing off while remaining under $1,000 of expenses!",

If you lose your scholarships you can look into loans. It sucks, but one year's worth should be relatively manageable.",
