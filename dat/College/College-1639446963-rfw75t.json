  "text": "I started thinking of possible majors I\u2019d want to study in and wanted to see if criminology-history is a practical double major or if it\u2019s even possible. I\u2019m currently in high school and I\u2019m not completely sure how double majors function, but my main question is if criminology-history is a practical double major.",

      "text": "Double majors usually work by ensuring many classes can double-count as well as taking up all your electives for one major with the requirements of the other. Even then, it may mean you cannot graduate in 4 years. Any combination is possible however.\n\nOverlap between criminology and history won't be much, but I could imagine something social history or something like an economic history class would overlap well with criminology. It might require an extra semester of classes, but it could work.",
