  "text": "I\u2019m a non-Black Mexican person and Humanities major, I wanted to take some courses related to Mexican American studies, Women\u2019s and Gender studies, and Black studies, however I am unsure if it\u2019s appropriate for me to take the Black studies courses as I am not Black and fear that by me being in the class, I\u2019m taking up space that could otherwise would have gone to another Black student. I\u2019m Mexican and Trans so I\u2019m comfortable taking up space in those other classes but I\u2019m not sure how right it would be for me to be in Black studies as someone who isn\u2019t Black. I don\u2019t plan on majoring or anything in it as I don\u2019t think that would be appropriate and definite then I could be taking away from Black scholars and students but I do want to take some classes to learn more about something I don\u2019t know much. What are you guys thoughts on this? and please I would appreciate the thoughts from Black people only on this issue.",

Black people know what it is like to be black, and they can be interested and study and take the class, but don't you think they'd be thrilled if someone like me, a white person from an upper middle class suburb wanted to learn more about the struggles that African Americans have? Would you as a trans person be disappointed if a cis person wanted to take a gender studies class to learn more about what you have gone through and what social and health policies are changing because of it?\n\nSeems like thinking only minorities should learn or be able to speak or advocate for minorities only creates division and prevents unity and understanding.\n\nFeel free to downvote my comment if you feel it's unproductive or not what you were looking for and I'll be happy to remove it.",

      "text": "These courses are designed to be for everyone. Black people probably already have a decent understanding of a lot of whatever the course contains. I think one of the main points is about educating people who are unaware of the culture and don't understand it.\n\nIt wouldn't really be good for any minority if they had a class about their culture and it was only full of that minority. How exactly is that spreading awareness? Wouldn't you be upset as the minority that no one wanted to learn about it?\n\nI'm not black. I would give you this same advice on a gender studies course though as a gay person. And I would tell you to let straight people give you that advice too. People who have taken these courses or study the topics will be able to give you great advice regardless of if they are in the group the course focuses on.",
