  "text": "I go to a pretty good business school, it's a top five for undergrad business, and it's what my school's known for. I thought I would love business, having taken a few business-related classes in high school, but now in my sophomore year I'm realizing I hate it. It's so much math and numbers I didn't realize it would have, and there are no degrees like HR or Management really, just Finance, Accounting, or MIS. I hate it. Sure, I can study all I want and end up with a business degree, but my GPA in the end would suck, and I really want to go to law school. It's been my life long dream. But if I don't go to law school, my business major would save my butt in terms of job prospects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I added a second major, International relations last year, and I love it. I love everything about it, what I'm studying, the work that goes into it, EVERYTHING. I'm involved in IR clubs and look forward to these classes more so than my business classes. But I'm scared that if I don't get into law school, I won't have any job opportunities and it would all be a waste. Im so scared and confused on what to do.",
