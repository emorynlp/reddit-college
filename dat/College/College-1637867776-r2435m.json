  "text": "doing this on mobile so sorry for formatting. im a 17 year old guy in my senior year of high school, i know i want to be some type of illustrator/graphic artist, i just have no fucking clue where to go. my only rule for myself is to stay out of the south (where im from) and stay away from my family. im thinking about going internationally to britain, going somewhere upstate,but its all so intimidating and expensive, i have no clue where to start. ive applied to a few and been accepted (full sail, scad) but i cant decide if i just want to take the shot and go there or if I should keep looking. whereever i wanna go though, I'm planning to go to community college in that state first. does anyone have any advice??",

      "text": "A few suggestions: find your guidance counselor and make an appointment. Ask about art schools locally and abroad.\n\nThe second is look for a person in the arts you can talk to; learn more about their path and how they got into the field. \n\nThird, get on the internet- look up some on who you\u2019d be interested in talking to about their art, their job, learn about them and how they got where they are, could just be the intern at a local print shop. Send a text, email, tweet- most people love to talk about themselves.\n\nLook into financing the last two years with university jobs, book stores and hotels- (hotel desk clerk is a great job  to do while studying). \n\nIt\u2019s all possible, but a heck of a lot of work. And it isn\u2019t failing if you do need a loan. You got this- I\u2019m rooting for you.",
