  "text": "I feel like college has been a 10x life improvement over highschool, which might be an unpopular opinion. I see a lot of people in my classes complain a lot.\n\nI feel like I have much more time, much more freedom, much more control over what I want to do and who I want to become/discipline, and for some reason not really depressed anymore.\n\nI enjoy my major classes (just one gen ed left), I have a friend or at least good acquaintances in most classes, and I just feel happier in general. I don't feel shit everyday like I did in HS\n\nalso, fuck waking up at 6am, when marching band kept you till like 10pm\n\nedit: seems pretty split even",

The biggest thing for me though is I pay attention in class now because my friends that I used to mess around with in class in hs are at different colleges so I only see them on weekends. Also my workload is not very hard right now because I am in prerequisites and an easy math class that is just a review of what I learned in highschool.",

      "text": "I'm doing more school work in college than I did in high school (that's me anyway, I took mostly k level class and only a few of them were AP/Dual Credit), but every other aspect of college is so much better than high school. Like you said, we decide on our schedule. We don't have to wake up at 6 or 5:30 in the morning, we don't have to eat at a specific time, AND we don't need to ask for permission to go to the bathroom during class. Plus it's so much easier to make new friends. Maybe that's just because we're older and therefore feel less awkward when it comes to making new friends, but also it's because we're meeting people outside of the school zoned district where we're stuck with almost the same kids for 13 years, so you get a chance to meet more people. Plus you're meeting people of different ages, whereas everyone in your high school classes is roughly around the same age as you. \n\nI just couldn't go back to high school. I don't understand why people say that high school is better than college. It's not like I had a terrible experience in high school either. I was bullied a little bit in my sophomore year, but apart from that, even that year wasn't so bad for me. I had a good amount of friends, I was a B average student, and I have some funny memories from my four years. Regardless, as a sophomore in college, I'd say that my time in college was a whole lot better. I have better friends than I did before, and I'm slightly less tired, but still stressed and tired.",

I didn't care about those classes in high school and I really wasn't motivated to take those in college but I did them.  The one 1 AP class I took in High school was harder than most of the Gen Eds but I just wasn't motivated for them.

I was honestly so lucky to even have friends. Now, I get to get food with my friends even when I'm super stressed or just study with them in the same room. I call my family on the way to and from classes. On top of all that, and I know this will change because half my schedule is gen eds right now, tonight is the first night I've been stressed and I've been in classes a month. Until tonight I've been a week ahead in all my coursework so I get to take tons of breaks to practice my instruments, watch Youtube, hang out with friends, etc. during the week. I also love the freedom of choosing where I go and when I go. There just isn't the same pressure to stay involved in the same activities every single year like there was in high school, so all I have right now is being on pit crew for the marching band (though I plan to add more). It's so much more relaxed and I'm a much healthier person overall. Though the one downside is my stress management is out of practice.

I liked the small class sizes of high school and my teachers really cared about us, so everything felt very tight-knit. I really liked the diversity of my high school too. I get that this is specific to just my experience, but these are the reasons I prefer high school over my college experience. In college, professors don't give a shit about us, massive class sizes, zero diversity, and classes aren't that interesting. Also no ECs that interest me like there were in high school, surprisingly. I know I'm in the minority, but this goes to show there are people that think hs is better lol. High school also gave me a lot more drive and determination- I was a much harder worker back then.",

I didn't even have the vocabulary to talk about how I was feeling or why big expectations/answering phone calls/answering doorbells/being spontaneous made me want to cry. On the other hand, I had a very large network of friends and a group where I felt I belonged (band). Also, the work was a cakewalk (except for calc). I'm not saying I'm smart or anything, it's just that public educators are neutered from asking anything of their students that challenges them. It fucks with graduation rates which fucks with grant money. \n\nCollege work is actually work. For me (history major) it's a fuck ton of reading and writing. I love it. I also really figured out a lot about myself, my relationship with my family, and anxiety. It took a couple of huge missteps in my senior year, but I'm glad it happened. I had to take a year off, but now I'm back at my last semester and feel really self-equipped. One downside is my friend group from HS didn't stay super close. I had a falling out with my longtime best friend, and coming in to university as a transfer student made being social a little harder. I have a really wonderful friend I met by chance, and a couple of nice acquaintances, but nothing like the network I had in high school. No biggie, but it's very different! \n\nAs far as personal enjoyment and satisfaction, I love college so much more. The work is so rewarding and genuinely interesting. I love the discussions I get to have with my professors and having the freedom to make my own schedule.",

We all lived around the same area because you had to live within a certain boundary line to go to certain schools. I also lived super close to my school so friends could just come over whenever they wanted since it was within walking distance. Now I\u2019m at a commuter campus where everyone lives in random places and since it\u2019s the only university in this part of my state, people can live up to like an hour or more away sometimes. You\u2019ll meet someone in class and kind of click but never get to chill on your own time because they live so far away. Each year I probably meet 1 person who lives close enough to actually be friends with. In high school you\u2019re all on the same schedule so once 2:30 hits you\u2019re all free. In college you could meet someone cool in your last class of the day and learn that it\u2019s their first class of the day. It\u2019s just hard to make things work socially in my college rather than high school. Also academia were way easier in high school. (I also didn\u2019t have the typical high school experience that a lot of other people did so that could definitely come into play)",

You have to initiate the conversation with a completely random stranger (classmate). Sometimes they become good friends, sometimes they just stay an acquaintance you'll forget after that semester. The first time is hard, but after a few times it should become easy to talk to strangers.",

I've had to get used to checking the syllabus every day to know exactly what's happening, but it's surprisingly calming because you're not being reminded of the same project every day like a countdown and like you're running out of time minute by minute. So even with those sort of \"cons,\" they've been pretty manageable and not too big of problems.\n\nMy professors, have been awesome people and doing all in their power to help, usually preferring their first names. They're also much more relaxed in conversation so it makes for some interesting days. I, by far, prefer my professors over most of my high school teachers; I have maybe about 2 or 3 that, to this day, I really talk to. \n\nSocially, I'm doing **so. much. better.** I was that awkward emo kid in high school that lost basically most of their friends to an abusive relationship in mid-Sophomore year to very early Senior year. I was also pretty consistently bullied in high school, and in high school, it sucks because more people are more likely to at least put the name to the face. Now, I'm somehow making friends left and right, in and outside of classes. Somehow, not sure how, but it feels like the whole bully problem I had went away once college hit, which is kind of funny, since one of my bullies goes to my college and I have no doubt she's seen me. Plus, goofing off on campus is fun af.\n\nOh, and not to mention that colleges are more willing to discuss more taboo subjects, and that openness is helpful for starting a conversation if, for example, someone is seeking support for being sexually assaulted, and for taking action against it. That alone is helpful since I was never able to bring up nearly being assaulted (by someone I thought I could trust) to my family.",

I guess I can attest this to the AP credits I got from high school so starting my freshman year, I was able to jump into my core classes which I found much more interesting than having to take calculus or history all over again. In terms of freedom, it's amazing. I go to school out of state and for my it was a smooth transition of \"leaving the nest\" I felt absolutely ready to leave home and I actually felt annoyed any time I had to go back home. It's good having people around you who are actually smart (if not smarter than you) and it's great to have conversations with them about politics or movies. So yes, i have definitely felt that way as well.",

High school puts you in an all-week 7-2 (maybe more) routine that you *have* to follow. College you don\u2019t *have* to do anything, except for maybe attending classes. But most people only have classes for 15-20 hours a week, a far cry from the 30 hour slog of high school. And yes, high school classes are easier, slower and less dense, and college classes can require a lot of work outside class, but again it\u2019s up to you if you do this work, how much of it you do, how often you do it, etc. The main difference is still freedom. \n\nWhether this freedom is a good thing or a bad thing depends on the person I think. A lot of people (me included) have been dying to have it since high school. But a lot of other people aren\u2019t ready for it because they\u2019re so used to the structure of high school where there\u2019s just fewer decisions to make.",

It's definitely possible but can be hard and draining at times",

For me, high school and first year or so of college was smooth sailing due to only having PT job for a few hrs for extra cash.\n\nNow however, I've moved from a CC to my state Uni, and due to my parents poor financial planning I've got to pay myself. So I have to work full-time, 5-6 days a week, have to get up around 5am to be at work by 7am. Usually work from 7am to 3pm, then get changed and clean up in my car, commute back to the school (about 30 mins one way) and have classes from around 4pm to 8pm. Back to my room around 830-9pm, quickly shower, grab a bite, clean up for the next day, watch an episode or two of Spongebob to lift my spirits, then bed around 10:00-11:00pm. Rinse, repeat. Yea, I'm extremely stressed tbh...\n\nBut because you aren't doesn't mean your doing anything wrong or that anyone is looking down on you (some may, but THEYRE the immature ones then). Try to utilize that extra free time (im assuming that you have) to put 110% effort into your work, projects, assignments, ect. Try to expand and network your social circle. Spend time doing things you enjoy, hobbies, if you like to game than game! If you like nature than go on some hikes or something. You do you man!",

I like the freedom in my college classes to study how I want and how there's a greater emphasis on doing practice to succeed rather than just doing graded work every night. \n\nHigh school on the other hand, constantly assigned us busywork and long tedious homework every night that never gave me time to study on my own terms. I was also always worried about getting good grades on the homework even when I hadn't fully grasped the material yet.\n\n\nI also liked the easy access to tutoring and extra resources for students in my university.
