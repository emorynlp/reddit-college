  "text": "This semester has been incredibly difficult for me, and in the last few weeks I was so overwhelmed and I just shut down, and I ended up not turning in my final project for a course I\u2019m in. This is not normal for me, I typically turn in everything on time and do good work, but by the end of the semester I was so panicked and I couldn\u2019t do anything. My professor has emailed me asking about the project and I don\u2019t know what to do. I really respect this professor and feel horrible for letting them down, but I don\u2019t know how to be honest with them without seeming like I\u2019m just trying to gain sympathy. Does anyone know how to approach this issue from the most professional and respectable angle possible?",

      "text": "\"Hello Dr. Smith,\n\nThanks for reaching out to me.  Unfortunately, I have nothing to submit.  I was overwhelmed by the last few weeks, and honestly, I am doing my best to hang on.  I am sorry that I didn't say anything earlier; I didn't realize how bad things were for me until it was too late.  I understand that this will impact my final grade, and I accept responsibility for that.  Despite appearances, I really did enjoy your class, and  I hope to one day retake the course when I'm in a better place.  Thank you again for your concern.\n\nSincerely,\"",

      "text": "You are not letting the professor down.  This is not personal.\n\nI may have all the sympathy in the world for you and not be able to make an extension for logistical reasons, because I already told other people no and that would be unfair.\n\nFor anyone who is likely to cut you some slack, this shorter and less sob-story the email the better. The more you try to emotionally manipulate, the less likely you are to get a break.\n\nIf you really do have a consistent record of doing things on time and well, you can mention you got overwhelmed and dropped the ball.\n\nIf this is something that you were supposed to be working on for a long time, you should be prepared to show what progress you have made.  \n\nIf you have made none on a 2 mos project, then a couple days extension is not going to help you anyway.",
