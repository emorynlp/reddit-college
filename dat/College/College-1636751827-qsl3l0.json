  "title:": "Tips on asking for more financial aid from college?",
  "text": "To clarify: I\u2019m already an undergrad students at a Public University. The bill is just too much for me and my family to handle. \n\n\nI\u2019m not getting any tuition assistance because the FAFSA this year looks at 2019 income tax form- this was before covid when my dad had a different job and made much more money. \n\nNow we\u2019re not as financially stable, and a lot of my college fund went into disaster relief after the hurricanes a few months ago. \n\nIs there any way I can get my university to give me more money? We called them several times and talked but the most they were able to do is turn my unsubsidized loans into subsidized ones (which is still less than 2,000$ in efforts, not nearly enough). \n\nWould actually going to the financial aid office help or is there anything we can say or do to decrease my bill?",

Financial aid will be looking at the letter of the guidelines so you should read into FAFSA and have an idea of what sort of exception/determination you are asking for.",
