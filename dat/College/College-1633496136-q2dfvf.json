  "text": "Here\u2019s my background. I\u2019m not a CS major or IS major. I\u2019m a Supply Chain major who is enrolled in a business analytics certificate and one of the electives is a Python course. I\u2019m way too behind and for goodness sakes can\u2019t grasp the concepts enough. How do I overcome this? Is there a ytber I can watch that will help me learn my topics like index, list, for loops, while, def, etc",
