  "text": "I technically graduated 2 days ago and just turned in my last assignment and I\u2019m still trying to get over that anxiousness that I\u2019m forgetting about something due tomorrow. My past two summer breaks have been spent in summer classes and winter was a month of me waiting for the spring semester. I\u2019m trying to relax a little after the past 4.5 years but I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m physically able to at this point",

      "text": "Not sure it will help you now but I alleviate that fear during the semester by having every single item due in one place. At the start of the semester I take a couple hours to write every due date from each syllabus into a single master list, which I constantly update and refer to to guide my studying. If it sounds daunting (my current one has almost 300 items), I\u2019ve found adding a line at the end of each week so I can focus on the pressing issues really helps.",

That would be the most effective way to just completely detox from the stress of finals and get some separation from your usual work environment.",
