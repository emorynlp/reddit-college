That\u2019s something that\u2019s really important to my parents and I.",

      "text": "My college has a major called industrial distribution and it\u2019s literately made for you. It combines a very little amount of engineering with a lot of business application. Most people who do it go into sales and work jobs that, from what I know of, they enjoy. A good friend of mine just graduated making 75k. I currently work in IT for the same university and one of my coworkers, senior software dev, said by far ID is the most sought after major.",

For instance, I'm an English major but am taking an architecture class and an archeology class (I want to write and thought these classes would teach me something about people and cultures. I was right). These classes are definitely not what I expected and would recommend anyone unsure of their majors to try a class or 3 in areas of interest.",

              "text": "It's a lot of history oriented material and analysis. There are the basic entry level courses that every student needs of course but the English major specific classes tend to revolve around analysis of either a genre, or a specific author or type of author (women, lgbt+, etc.), or classic works through history. \n\nI like it but I'm not getting this education as part of a better employment plan. If you want a job in your degree field, look into what English majors tend to work as after university.",

I don\u2019t live in the most stable country and finding jobs in my country is hard, which is why I also want to move to another country. \n\nI know degrees that are not STEM oriented don\u2019t have a lot of stability concerning jobs and stuff, which is why I\u2019m scared to take the leap and change to English even though I think it\u2019s my passion. \n\nAlso, is it a lot of memorization? You mentioned it\u2019s history oriented, so it must be right? How do you manage a lot of content? \n\nSorry I\u2019m asking a lot, but I\u2019m really curious about this major haha.",
