  "text": "Hey Reddit. So if you were in this situation what would you do - I\u2019m a freshman in college in a 4 year school currently working towards being a nurse - I am from the US. I have been in this set up for the first semester and I am struggling a lot with keeping up my grades and my mental health isn\u2019t that great either. They\u2019re very selective and competitive with who makes it into their program and I am not making the grades they want. So I had recently looked into transferring to another school. All of my ideas were up in the air but I began to look into another 4 year school that offered a free 4 year college tuition program and the nursing program was not nearly as selective as well as the required grades for the courses was something I could manage. Although the school I am at now is great and I would be sad to leave I know in the long run I wouldn\u2019t be happy with the major I have and waste a lot of money, and I didn\u2019t want to switch my major. \n\nI also want to mention I have pretty strict parents and here\u2019s why - they mentioned going to community college for my degree if this school didn\u2019t work out and the idea of it didn\u2019t sound good to me being as I want my full 4 year degree and some sort of college experience. But when I had mentioned that I was considering transferring to the other 4 year college they did not take it well and threatened to cut me off financially and not have my blessing, as well as embarrassing me in a couple of scenarios and getting other people involved when it was unnecessary. The reason they gave was that the school was unsafe - and although this school was near a public city that has had some issues in the past the campus itself is safe. And the school I\u2019m at now is also in a city but is claimed to be a safer area. So the overall issue I\u2019m having is I\u2019m not sure what to do from here because what I feel like would be best for me is not what I can do - I can stay here and change my major, come home and do community college, try to convince them if another school will work but it may not offer as much as this one could, or decide that I will do what\u2019s against their wishes and go to the school I had originally considered going to. Just need some different perspectives on the matter and I appreciate any feedback you all give.",

      "text": "When you apply to jobs and have your career, which school would employers prefer? The competitive school probably looks better on paper than this other school. \n\nRegarding the other school, what do you mean by unsafe? What is happening? Sometimes being in unsafe environment can impact your learning. \n\nMental health wise, are you taking care of yourself. You know, exercise, eating, self-care, etc. That will make a difference. \n\nYou\u2019re a freshman. I hated my school as a freshman, but my perspective completely changed as a senior. It can take time to enjoy your school. \n\nHowever, community college is valid too if you can transfer to a 4 year school. A way to save money.",

          "text": "Sadly the 2 year community and then transferring to a 4 year school was originally my idea senior year. But, when my parents forced us all to move to a different location in the same state they completely forbid me from going to the college I applied and got accepted to. Instead forcing me to go to the state school ( there dream school ) or a community college that is right next to home so they can keep an eye on me.",

      "text": "I\u2019d be careful with community college. It\u2019s generally difficult transferring to a 4 year after to finish your BSN from community college because those programs have core nursing classes already taken during the freshman year. \n\nI\u2019m currently a freshman in college. I have since switched, but I was on the pre-nursing track. Turns out though I would\u2019ve only been able to enroll at the nursing program at my community college, and that would\u2019ve only gotten me my RN license. I would\u2019ve had to transfer to a 4 year to enroll in a RN to BSN. So 6 years of school as opposed to the traditional 4 years if I had just gone to a 4 year institution in the beginning. \n\nI just wanted you to be aware of that. Unless you find a community college that has a nursing program with it, sticking with a 4 year school is your best bet. \n\nBut aside from that, have you considered visiting your college counselor or seeking tutoring for the classes you are struggling in? Those services may be helpful for you.",
