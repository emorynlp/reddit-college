  "text": "I don\u2019t like having to use my mic during zoom classes. I also don\u2019t like answering questions on zoom honestly. Presentations are so awkward on zoom, last semester I had to do one and I did not enjoy it. I usually like presenting and in real life classes I don\u2019t mind participating, especially if the professor is good. \n\nI feel like I get more anxious in zoom classes than real life! It\u2019s weird but does anyone else feel this way? Maybe it\u2019s because even in an irl class, everyone isn\u2019t looking directly at you like in a zoom class?",

      "text": "Anxiety yes. I'll  never get really used to it. We had to do a \"zoomcast\" thing where we were in small random groups and do a review. Ours went decently I watched others group discussions and there were moments that hurt to watch like the awkward silences and jokes that totally would work in real life but not on zoom.\n\nMakes you realize the importance of face to face contact, people being active listeners n being able to see reactions in real time. \n\nIt's hard to connect thru zoom it really is but for that grade I'll give it my best...even if it means taking a shot before the session starts to loosen the fuck up. I realize this might be a part of school for a good minute so gotta be water with it as much as you can. \n\nAlso I didnt realize my mic was on last week and I yelled super loud cuz someone was calling me in the other room and the professor goes, we all heard that.

Everyone always has their mic and camera off in that class so I have to just kind of talk into the void.

Knowing you\u2019ll be talking to the same people helps, but I hated it over the summer because a few people would leave their computer during the breakout rooms because they didn\u2019t find it useful, and sometimes we would be stuck trying to engage with people who weren\u2019t there.\n\nAlso, asking your professors to maybe call on one or two groups or go over material more after the breakout rooms helped my class over summer understand stuff more, since we could discuss it as a class, but even in my in person that would sometimes happen.",

It puts your picture on top for you which tricks your mind into thinking everyone sees you when no one is paying attention at all.  If you can't get the background eraser to work, people see a small part of your room which is the most intimate and private part of your house. Even when my friends come over, no one actually goes into MY room with my computer but in inviting my professors and all these other strangers in.\n\nIn truth, I think people notice you less on Zoom than in class because there are less one on one interactions. In break out groups I am still juggling reading my notes, thinking about the questions/answers, and my own video to really truly concentrate on someone else's video.\n\nMy point is your feelings are valid because the system is engineered to make you feel seen and noticed (even if you don't want to be) and you can address them because the truth might not match the story your brain is telling you.  And also there are 100% legitimate concerns with effectively inviting strangers into your house through the camera.",
