  "text": "Basically I\u2019ve got 3 majors and 3 minors and I\u2019ve been taking 24 credits per semester + summer classes so I have a LOT of credits. In my freshman year I had a 4.0 and finished with like years worth of credits, but this semester was really hard for me, so now my transcript is going to have two C\u2019s, a B, and ~potentially~ a D depending on how a final just went. (I will still have 5 As this semester on my transcript.) However I calculated and my GPA can only go down to like a 3.7, and if I make things right in the next 2.5 years and get all As, I can bring things up to the magma sum laude zone. I also have research and great people for recs and As in 500-level courses, (and 200-400) but the bad grades are in like 100-level courses which is really concerning and embarassing. Will this affect my ability to go to grad school? I\u2019m not aiming for Ivies, but rather a few schools with specific profs doing a very very specific type of niche research that i\u2019m deeply interested in that is at the intersection of most of my majors and minors, so think great state schools and international research universities and also Johns Hopkins but not for med school, just for a really neat masters program they have",
