  "text": "I am currently a third (junior) year at a top engineering school in India majoring in Chemical engineering. I\u2019ve slowly come to realize I\u2019m not cut out for engineering at all. Every single coursework goes over head and I\u2019m hating every moment of this semester. I am slowly losing confidence in myself due to not being able to give my best. Everyday I regret choosing an Engineering major and I feel stuck. So I was looking for a way out of this misery. If possible I would like to transfer to a foreign university to different major (finance/management). So I wanted to know if it\u2019s too late for me to do this since I\u2019m already in my third year, and if it is possible, how do I go about doing this ?",

IDP Education is really helpful. It's professional, they guide you every step of the way and it's reputable.",
