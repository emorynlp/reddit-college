  "text": "Maybe I bit off more than I could chew, but I\u2019m failing 1/4 of the classes I signed up for this semester. I plan to retake that one this summer. I love computer science and I\u2019ve enjoyed the classes I took. It\u2019s just I\u2019m not confident in my ability. I\u2019m passing all my other classes and that\u2019s really my main priority even though I\u2019d like a shiny GPA to throw around. The workload definitely threw me for a loop and I know I\u2019m gonna have to reassess after the semesters over to see just how much I believe I can handle in the spring. I\u2019m gonna miss a final project for programming and a lab and it\u2019s tearing me up because I\u2019ve had a perfect A all semester.\n\nI know I\u2019m one of those people who want to remove themselves from a situation entirely the second things go wrong because I do that terrible thing of attaching my self worth to numbers and performance. I don\u2019t know how to learn how to stop belittling myself like that and persevere.",

      "text": "Hey man, I\u2019m a senior in computer science who\u2019s graduating in the spring. What classes are you currently taking CS related?\n\nI just wanted to say that as far as projects go CS wise, that going into the project, you may not know how to do it to start. It was like that for at least half of the projects I\u2019ve done since I started. The important thing, as cliche as it sounds, is just starting it, knowing you\u2019re gonna make mistakes, and hella trial and error. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll survive CS. \n\nBut the biggest thing is understanding that you may not know how to do something, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all about trial and error and just messing around with your code and once you start you\u2019ll surprise yourself with what you can actually do and how much you learn just from doing it. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions if you have any.",

I\u2019ve had the most fun with IT and bits and pieces of the beginner Python labs. I know once I started some late labs I was like why did I take so long to even open this and look at it.",

              "text": "Cool! My only advice I can give is to just make sure you\u2019re enjoying what you\u2019re doing and messing with code outside of class and constantly learning. Cs is tough but nothing is more rewarding than when you finally get a tough piece of code working. \n\nLike I said, the hardest part of any class project I\u2019ve had is getting started. I almost never know what I\u2019m doing starting out and just figure it out along the way!",
