  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a College freshman right now, & unfortunately for me I was one of those kids in high school who just kinda coasted by with decent grades. Doing the bare minimum, ya know? Do to this my school work ethic is nearly nonexistent, & I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any tips on developing a good work ethic for College & making yourself do the work.",

      "text": "make a 9-5 or similar schedule. If you\u2019re pushing off your work til the last minute this will help you block out your time and stick to it. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have enough work to block out that many hours or it\u2019s too overwhelming, start dedicating days to work a couple times a week. \n\nI like the time block method cause it lets me refer to stuff throughout the week and then I have the whole weekend to do whatever I want since I finish all my homework during the week. \n\nEx: go to a coffee shop/library every tuesday & thursday from 4-7. I found that leaving my apartment/dorm and going to coffee shop worked super well cause once I was there, I would just grind through my work and turn my phone off.",

On Mondays I do my lab, Negaunee it's due on Wednesday, and I want alibi time for Tuesday in case I don't finish. On Tuesdays I finish the lab and start reading for X assignment.\n\nIn the Army we called this \"battle rhythm\". It was the most difficult part of any upheaval of your expectations. Once you have a battle rhythm set its easy to just practice it.",

Once I stopped working and cut a few classes, that became my normal and doing a decent amount of work or going to class seemed so hard.\n\nThen the two weeks before thanksgiving I had a ton of work and was kind of stressed out about it, and after working literally for most of the day, it felt super natural after that. Now that I\u2019m back from break it seems so hard again though",

      "text": "\nA #1 must IMO is to make a checklist - weekly or daily. Put all of deadlines and outside obligations (laundry, store trips, etc.) on there, and make it as detailed as you want. This has been the biggest and most easy-to-adopt habit for me so far.\n\nWhen it comes to working yourself up to actually doing the work, something that ought to help if you want something strong, but not too rigid - find a study buddy/group! You don't necessarily need to collaborate, but you could have a regular time everyday or few times a week where you both (or all, if you have a group) get together in one place, and actively study. Also, try not to chat too much if you can - just having other people there to hold you accountable is the main idea here.\n\nAlso, as painful as it might be, maybe try out deleting social media / your major time-sinks for a chunk of time to see what happens. Your bordome from this might make doing the work less painful. Then you can reintroduce the stuff once you have gotten the hang of things.\n\nAnyways, I'll stop rambling - best of luck, and I hope this helps!",
