I did try to do some research myself by going to some colleges website but I have no idea what I'm looking at when I go to some colleges websites.",

What actually helps your situation tremendously is your SAT score since it puts you at the 99th percentile.\n\nMay I ask why your GPA is lower when you have an insanely high SAT score? \n\nSpeak with your guidance counselor about some possible options and look at Common App for schools of interest. I\u2019m the meantime, try to do your best to bring that GPA up to at least a 3.0. You no doubt have the ability to do so given your testing scores.",

          "text": "The reason why my GPA is low is because of online school. I fail two core courses and it dropped my GPA. I'm usally a straight A student so ima get a 3.0 or even a 3.1 when I graduate. I tried asking my counselor but she said that she can't help me.\nAnd a teacher messed up the grading for two of my classes which was driver Ed and virtual psychology (there both worth half a credit). Instead of putting a 90 for both classes she put a 50 for both classes. I got it fixed but it still shows on my transcript that I failed both classes.",

      "text": "I\u2019m just curious how you got a 1490, but had that gpa\u2026I had a 4.0 and no where near that. In many cases, your SAT score can outweigh your gpa. In fact, mine wasn\u2019t even considered when I went to school. A 1490 is literally Harvard level scores. \nGo to your schools counselor and ask what you need to do. Mine was shit so I literally just went and shadowed people in the field I wanted to work in. They pointed me in the right direction. If there\u2019s a specific school you are interested in, go visit. I\u2019m currently looking for a grad school for my masters and going to college/career fairs helped me determine what I wanted to do.",
