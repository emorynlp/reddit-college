  "text": "I want to change my major to CS. I'm on my first semester of college, taking 4 regular classes and 1 remedial class. My advisor told me I was going to lose credit for HST 101 if I change my major. I don't know what to do since I am also receiving financial aid. My advisor is not helping a lot since I asked him a bunch of questions regarding this matter and he only answered one... I feel pretty much lost and overwhelmed.",
