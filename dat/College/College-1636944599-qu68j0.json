  "title:": "Full Time Students: Do You Work a Job? If So, How Many Hours Do You Work a Week?",
  "text": "I'm an adult learner finally going to college this January as a full time student. I am financially capable of cutting back to part time work, which is a lot more than many others my age and I'm very grateful to be so lucky. I'm just trying to get a realistic idea of how many hours working I can juggle while studying.\n\nFor those of you in college full time: How much do you work roughly a week to make ends meet/get by?\n\nAnd what are your tips for managing work and school without going insane?\n\nThank you for any input ahead of time!",

      "text": "I\u2019m a computer engineering student, taking 15 credit hours per semester (including summer) and working 15-20 hours per week was the perfect balance for me. \n\nI have worked 30 hours per week while taking 12 credit hours, and it worked out, but it was definitely much more stressful once exams and projects came around.\n\nThe research surrounding this topic is that full-time students generally perform worse in school when working more than 20 hours a week. I know some students like to brag that they work two jobs while taking 15+ credit hours, but seriously, assuming your goal is to finish school within the next 4-6 years, and assuming you like having free time and not suffering from hypertension, it\u2019s not worth the short-term gratification. Do what you can and only as work as much as you have to. You\u2019ll have the extra time and money after you graduate.",

It's so easy to get caught up in the now rather than remembering it'll be worth on the other side to not compromise school. \n\nIt's also difficult for me to plan because I don't personally know anyone who has graduated with a 4 year degree or higher. The only family and friends I know who have gone to school went to tech schools for careers they abandoned after graduation (if they graduated at all).",

I share a place with three others and I use up only 1/3 of my paycheck on bills. \n\nI was the first in my immediate family to go to school for a bachelor\u2019s degree, so I know the feeling. There are many different people nowadays that are the first in their families to go to a 4 year college, so you for sure won\u2019t be alone in that.\n\nIf you need any other advice, feel free to DM me! Transitioning into college is rough, especially for those who are not fresh out of high school. Make a few friends and talk to your professors, you\u2019ll get comfortable and fall into a routine in no time. Good luck!",

I wouldn't say you're lucky, I'd say you worked hard to save the money you have. \n\nMy class load is strange, I'm pretty much stuck doing 13 credits a semester until I graduate. I'm pursuing mechanical engineering. \n\nI have 2 days off per week and I think I'd be fine working 8 hours a day on each of those. I don't study on weekends, so I could pick up another 2 days if I needed. \n\nI think the biggest thing is the ROI. If a part time job is going to interfere with college, I don't think it's worth it. That little bit of money won't compare to the money lost on failing a course or the longer period it'll take to start making the money from a degree.",

If my major was easier and less work intensive then I'd probably be able to do full time school and work.\n\nPrioritize your schedule and keep track of it. Time management is key to working students. Do homework when assigned especially earlier in the week, so you have more free time on the weekends or can accommodate unexpected assignments and projects. Try to schedule a day where you don't have work and school, so you can have a breather or can be used as a day to catch up.",
