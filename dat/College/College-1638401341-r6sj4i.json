  "text": "\nI mean over the phone like when you\u2019re on speakers or through AirPods that sometimes can be heard out loud\n\nLike for example I\u2019m craving peanuts, and that\u2019s the sign. \n\nI need ideas that don\u2019t sound weird or obvious\n\nWhy am I asking? Because we barely talk even though I try. I\u2019m tired of trying. I don\u2019t want her to be close to me if she doesn\u2019t want me to be close to her either.",
