  "text": "I'm a senior in highschool who has always made high A's and a few high B's. I've always been on honor roll and this last year of highschool I decided to take dual enrollment classes. I made my first C grade and I'm worried. \nI previously took a college class in summer and made an A. So I'm just worried how this will effect my GPA and future I know it will go down. But it's made me go into this spiral of thinking if I don't get a super high GPA I want will I still be successful in college? Can I still be successful in a career? \nMaybe I'm overthinking. But when you get your first C in a college class after a whole school career of A's. It's a little concerning.",
