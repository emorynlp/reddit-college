OR they only offer some classes during the day that I need.  So I both sympathize with your plight but am annoyed by it at the same time.  lol  They just need to offer more evening and weekend classes at colleges.",

Do what makes you feel best and allows you the time you need to have. If you\u2019d rather have that extra hour of sleep and shower and eat breakfast before class in order to keep your mental health in check. then do it! \nAlso remember that it isn\u2019t forever and that it\u2019ll be winter break in 6-ish weeks. While that feels like a long time away, it\u2019ll come quickly, I promise. \n\nGood luck!",

Not saying that it's impossible to have an 8am class, but if you don't go to sleep early every night it's not ideal. I started at 10 for my second term, and that extra bit of sleep I could get helped me feel so much more energized through the day. Make the best choice for yourself, keep up your mental health!",

At least with morning classes you have the rest of the day to do shit. With night classes, it seems better in theory, but I'm tired in the evening, until I get a second wind of energy around 1am, when the reality of \"it's 2:45 now and i have to wake up for school at 7:30 and i have not studied\" hits.\n\nFor me, the best thing has been actually going to sleep and waking up at the same times every day (exceptions of course).

If you're taking an advanced class, it can be 6 credits, so you can max out at the 18 allotted through your paid tuition. Anything more, and you pay per credit. \n\nThe amount of credits sometimes directly constitutes how many hours are spent both inside and outside of the class.

If the professor is actually terrible, then more people will write reviews but the outcome is still the same as for a mediocre professor: bad reviews. So it\u2019s hard to tell the difference between an average professor and a bad professor on rate my professor. \n\nGeneral rule of thumb is that if the subject of the class is infamously difficult, reviews will be bad for most professors, unless the professor is truly exceptional.",

Honestly, I started to really appreciate the internet when I got into college because I don't know what I'd without it, pay attention for six hours I guess lol.

My earliest class this semester is an 11 am, with a 1 hour commute, so I wake up at 9 and leave at 10. Last semester, my earliest was 3:30 and I would go until 8:30-9:00. \n\nDefinitely felt a lot better than my freshman year, first semester. I had back to back classes from 8 am till 4:45 pm and I still didn't feel like I had enough time in the day. I thought mirroring my high school schedule would help me adjust to college, but I feel like I did worse.",

To me it really sounds like a sleep quality, eating quality, or physical medical issue. Have you considered trying anything like melatonin and always going to bed around the same time? Random bedtime could be throwing your system off.\n\nBasically it may be causing mental stress but I think the causation is more physical. I'm hesitant to tell you to move away from 8-3 because I think it is very possible to fix whatever is the root of the stress.",

It took two things:\n\n1) Opening all the windows in my apartment and keeping them open, so that the natural daylight re-synchronized my circadian rythmn\n\n2) Using the app Alarmy which forced me to actually wake up in the morning every single day\n\nNumber 1 is the biggest thing though. Your body wants to wake up with the sun, you just gotta make the conditions right. There's studies where they send people camping for a week or two and they universally get back on a normal sleep schedule just because of the absence of artificial lights",

I usually play video games and she\u2019ll either join me or watch tv, knit, sew, etc. until 10. \n\nPlenty of free time, especially when weekend hits.\n\nEdit: Completely forgot to mention that this is 2000% better than college as you don\u2019t bring work home with you. Being done with work when you leave is the greatest thing ever. No more stressing about doing hw, group projects, exams, etc.",
