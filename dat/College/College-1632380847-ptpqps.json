  "text": "A cold has been going around college (like always) and I naturally got infected. Rest is usually what helps me fight colds but I alwsys have so much homework and stuff to do that I stay up super late; my workload is ridiculous this semester. \n\nAre there any remedies to help me get back to 100% in these coming days even when I\u2019m getting 5-6ish hours of sleep each night? I\u2019ve been consistently drinking tea and soup. Have some over the counter stuff but it usually won\u2019t help me",
