  "text": "Hi guys, I feel extremely depressed to lose my 4.0 Gpa. I took calc 2 this semester and let's just say it was NOT GOOD at all. My final exam score fucked me up. I passed the class with an 83 percent. It sucks to know that this will make my GPA go down bad. I also have an 87 percent in This other 3 credit hour class. There is one more class that I am not expecting an A in either. I am just a sophomore in college. I've had a 4.0 gpa so far, but will lose it now due to my performance this sem. I really wanted to pass with a 4.0 Gpa but it sucks to know that I lost it. I feel like the dumbest person in the world. It's so demotivating  :( I would love any advice on coping up with this. Thanks!",
