  "text": "Hi guys, I feel extremely depressed to lose my 4.0 Gpa. I took calc 2 this semester and let's just say it was NOT GOOD at all. My final exam score fucked me up. I passed the class with an 83 percent. It sucks to know that this will make my GPA go down bad. I also have an 87 percent in This other 3 credit hour class. There is one more class that I am not expecting an A in either. I am just a sophomore in college. I've had a 4.0 gpa so far, but will lose it now due to my performance this sem. I really wanted to pass with a 4.0 Gpa but it sucks to know that I lost it. I feel like the dumbest person in the world. It's so demotivating  :( I would love any advice on coping up with this. Thanks!",

Try to think about what went wrong, maybe take less courses, maybe use another studying techniques, but don't start chaining thoughts in a catastrophic manner (bad grade in calc 2 - > I'm bad at math - > I'll be a drop out, etc).\n\nNobody died, you are still you, there's a lot of room for improvement and many chances to try again.",
