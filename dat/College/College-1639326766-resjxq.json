  "text": "Hello there hope everyone is doing well :)\n\nSo I was blessed to find a co op for 4 months with possible extra 4 month extension.  I only have 1 semester remaining if I want to take 5 courses.\n\nHowever, I haven't taken 5 EVER in my 3 years of college... and these classes have notoriously bad professors from what my friends told me since we took different classes this term.\n\nI asked my coordinator and she suggested I can also do 3 in the fall and 3 in the winter. This has the added benefit of helping me have more time to struggle through the material if I get a bad prof due to taking less courses. Also, a class I really want to take is only offered in winter so doing 3 and 3 would let me take it. It's a very useful course. \n\n\nSo my question is... how does this affect my chances upon graduating of landing a job? I was talking with my brothers girlfriend and she mentioned that graduating in the spring caused her to take longer to get a job due to competition. She recommends I do the 5 semesters.\n\nI don't think I would want to handle 5 professional level classes all at once especially if I DO happen to get a bad prof.\n\nWhat do you all think about the graduating in spring? Will the job market be way tougher. I am a computer programmer if that info helps.\n\nThanks everyone!",

      "text": "I dont think its different if you graduate one or the other. Ideally you'd be trying to line up jobs in the late summer/fall anyways, regardless of when you're graduating. The exception is if the job states a start date that still has you in school. You'd otherwise should be able to start in the summer, and they would know that recruiting college grads.",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply friend. Yes in my mind I wasn't seeing the issue with the actual start dates. I believe she was talking about just having more competition in general when applying. \n\nI also do not want to take 5 classes because they're pretty hard and 3 sounds so much better.",

              "text": "ah I see...yeah in theory there's more competition in spring, but companies are all over in when they do their hiring waves. The one I'm going with did their hiring in October, regardless if I was graduating now (which I am) or in the spring (which my friend did last year). It's pretty competitive in general so I didn't notice if there's more or less competition tbh.",
