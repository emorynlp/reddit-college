  "title:": "UNCOMMON college tips for continuing students and incoming freshman/transfer",
  "text": "So I know there are a lot of post that give tips about college, academically and socially. A decent amount of those post mention a lot of the same tips/advice. After almost getting done with my junior year of college I thought I shared some tips that I don\u2019t see on here often and just stuff to expect that most people wouldn\u2019t(applies mainly for incoming freshman or CC transfers to uni). If any of you have any tips that aren\u2019t super common, ex; joining clubs, studying, don\u2019t skip class, etc., definitely comment to help out others.\n\n1. Making a legit calendar or journal that you plan to follow saves so much stress in the long run. I see people with planners a lot but they mainly just use it to write down as a  \u201cwhat to do\u201d when ever they plan to do assignments, studying, etc., If you actually sit plan specific date and time for certain things college will go very smooth. This helps me mainly because I work and am a dj outside of college. My schedule gets crazy and I used to stress but immediately when I started doing the date and time process, things got so less stressful.\n\n2. It\u2019s okay to say \u201cfuck it\u201d a few weekends of the semester and just enjoy life rather than studying or doing college work. This may seem like bad advice but everything is good in moderation. Sometimes you just wanna say screw it and lounge around all weekend or go hang with your friends all weekend. As long as you don\u2019t have a midterm or a major exam early in the next week, I think it\u2019s okay and healthy to have this mentality here and there.\n\n3. Greek life is not what everyone thinks it is.... this one is pretty common and everyone really does have their own personal experiences with fraternities/sororities so I\u2019ll just say that Greek life for me personally was a drama oriented waste of my time. I\u2019m not gonna sit here and say their is no benefits of Greek life because there definitely is.\n\n4. This is the main reason I actually made this post but for all of us who didn\u2019t have the \u201cbest\u201d high school/past experiences, people end up talking about high school a lot more than you think they would. After being a looser, burnout, Loner type of kid, I was really excited about college because people make it seem like none of that stuff matters. Well when I got to my uni, it was not how I imagined. People talk about high school a lot but it\u2019s mainly because thats their past and they don\u2019t know what else to talk about and you can\u2019t really blame them. People used to tell me \u201cthis is just a early college thing\u201d, it\u2019s not I\u2019m friends with tons of upper level undergrad and even grad students that are always bringing up the good ole days. I am left out of many conversations because of this but at this point, I don\u2019t really care anymore because that\u2019s just life. It does suck but you have to get over it at some point.\n\nSo that\u2019s it but definitely comment if you have any other tips or experiences that aren\u2019t posted on this sub often. Also feed back would be great especially on 4",

It\u2019s such an underrated way to kill time between classes and you learn about stuff you didn\u2019t even know existed. \n\n2. If you commute bring food to school. Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get hungry, just bring a snack in case you *do* get hungry so you don\u2019t get into the habit of wasting your money on eating out all the time\n\n3. If you have a friendly/chill professor, get in the habit of making small talk with them (when appropriate).",

It just didn\u2019t work out for me but Having people to spend your college career with, doing actually fun events with those people rather than just sitting around, it\u2019s great to become close with them, volunteer hours look very good on resume and are just good ways to meet people/become close with friends, and they keep you really busy (this is a good thing trust me). Mainly what happened to me was that I had a medical issue and missed some meetings and events. Came back and found out there was a rumor that I was taking hard drugs and that I was forced to leave. I went to a party after all of this and pretty much got asked by everyone and one kid wouldn\u2019t even hit my blunt because it thought something might be in it. It\u2019s okay tho I\u2019m past it and have a lot of friends now and am even friends with some in it",

      "text": "-SAVE UP MONEY FOR LAUNDRY IF YOU DON'T GO HOME ON THE WEEKENDS\n-look at all the meal plans available, some schools offer multiple plans and one of them might be a betted fit for you than the one automatically assigned to you\n-DO YOUR FASFA ASAP IT OPENS IN OCTOBER\n-Read your syllabus. I know they didn't matter in high school but the syllabi in college do. You don't have to read them thoroughly but just make sure to mark down the due dates for assignments in your planner\n-if you can, keep your classes from starting before 10:00 a.m. if you're not a morning person\n-Online classes have more coursework than regular classes. Make sure you check in EVERY day to see what is due/has been assigned\n-It's fine to procrastinate, but know your limits. If you know you can't memorize all that material in one hour, then do it in two.\n-Professors give you study guides to revise for tests for a reason. USE THEM.\n-you know how people (teachers, etc) say you need to study for 3 hours for one hour of class? COMPLETE. HORSESHIT. You can study that much if you want, but I personally only study what I need to study in order to pass tests, not what is discussed in every single class. I save the rest of my time working on class projects and assignments, which technically are their own kind of revision. I have a 3.8 gpa and am a Junior, so this method WORKS. \n-If you hate your roommate MOVE. I spent an entire miserable semester with a legitimately insane roommate (multiple personalities, had to call the cops on her one time which ended with her being sent to a psychiatric ward for a week) before I realized that thing's weren't going to get better. Shame though, we got along pretty well, but she kept pulling shit. And she brought bed bugs into the dorm room.",

      "text": "I don't know a single person who talks about high school, so maybe it's just your experience (or maybe it's my school). \n\nEither way, I've posted this before, but here's my list (some of these may be more common, but others I'd say are more uncommon): \n\nGet internships. I wish I knew how important internships are, and networking events/making professional connections. Get them early. You have to start applying months in advance for the summers, for example, and you will likely have to apply to a lot. Stop by the career center early. Learn how to write a good resume and interview well. Learn how to network.  Go to career fairs. Get on LinkedIn.\n\nThink about the actual career prospects of your major. Do your research. Come up with a career plan. Do not wait until you\u2019re halfway done or almost done with your major to start asking, \u201cWhat can I do with this?\u201d or \u201cWhat do I want to do?\u201d\n\nGetting a credit card is so important, to build credit. If you\u2019re not working, get a joint credit card with a parent. Set yourself a budget or a specific purpose for your card and pay it off every month. \n\nGetting work done is a lot more about discipline than motivation. Just get it done. Doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t feel like doing it. Do the work. Put in the effort. Remember your long-term goals. \n\nApply for scholarships throughout college. \n\nDon\u2019t blindly follow/trust in whatever your advisor says. Know your program sheet, know what classes you have to take, and plan accordingly. You are responsible for your own schedule and making sure you are able to graduate.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to ask permission to go to the bathroom. You can do what you want now. \n\nGo to class. Establish a schedule/routine. No one is going to force you to go if you don\u2019t want to. You have to find the drive yourself. Pick classes that do not conflict with how you operate naturally. If you\u2019re not a morning person, don\u2019t take 8 AMs. It doesn\u2019t matter that you woke up at 6 AM for high school every day. It can be easy for some students to fall into a habit of skipping class frequently, and that's easy to do if you have to get out of bed earlier than you'd like. \n\nUse Rate My Professor to evaluate professors before registering for the next semester's courses, but take all opinions there with a grain of salt. While I've found the site to be generally accurate, there are times my experiences have differed from the general consensus. If that's the case for you too, I would encourage you to leave a review for your professors at the end of the semester.\n\nLearn to study. In high school you may not have learned how to study. Take advantage of all the resources (office hours, tutoring, writing center, Khan Academy, YouTube channels, books, r/GetStudying, etc.) available to you. Don\u2019t study in your room if it\u2019s too much of a distraction. Go to a quiet, distraction-free place like the library if you\u2019re having trouble focusing. Separate the places where you do work and relax and keep them separate. If you continuously struggle in your major classes though, or are finding yourself disinterested, realize maybe your major isn\u2019t the right one for you. Explore your options. You have a lot of them.\n\nKeep yourself organized, in whatever way that works for you. You may want to keep a physical planner, use a digital calendar, productivity app on your phone, etc.  \n\nGet to know someone in your courses and exchange your contact information. Do this as early in the semester as possible. They can help you get notes and caught up if you miss a class, and vice versa.\n\nGo to office hours and make connections with your professors. They may really come in handy if you ever need a strong letter of recommendation for grad school, internships, if you're looking for research opportunities, etc. \n\nKnow your syllabus. Check the syllabus. If you have a question, first refer to the syllabus. Keep all syllabi saved somewhere in case you ever need them. Know all deadlines and stick to them (not just dealing with your classes but deadlines related to registration, housing, etc.).\n\nIf you need help or are struggling, talk to your professor. Get documentation for any accommodations you need (ex: if you have severe depression, provide a doctor\u2019s note) and register with your school\u2019s accommodation/disability office at the start of the semester. Do this early. Use the school\u2019s counseling services if you need it. It\u2019s okay to ask for help. Your professors aren\u2019t obligated to help you if you\u2019re struggling if you don\u2019t have documentation with the school. \n\nIt\u2019s better to withdraw than take an F. But it\u2019s better to pass than take the W. If you can put in the effort and pass the first time, do it. Save yourself from summer classes, overloading, or taking an extra semester. If you have to take a summer class - do it at a community college. It\u2019s cheaper. (But make sure any courses you plan to take will have the credits transfer over to your current institution!) \n\nState schools are good options. You don\u2019t have to go to the best school. Especially if the state school will put you in the least amount of debt (or allow you to graduate debt-free). Debt can stick with you a lot longer than a couple years of college. \n\nDon\u2019t give in to peer pressure. College is diverse. Find the group of friends that work for you. They are out there. Join clubs that interest you. Talk to different people. Have fun. \n\nCollege is what you make of it.\n\nHonesty is the best policy: with your professors, your parents, and yourself. \n\nYou probably don\u2019t need everything you\u2019re planning on bringing to your college dorm. Or even half of it. Don\u2019t over-pack. College dorms are small, especially if you\u2019re sharing with another person. \n\nWait until the first day of class before getting your books. Rent used textbooks. Compare prices from your college bookstore, Chegg, Amazon, etc. See if there's a digital version - it may be cheaper. \n\nIf you're living in a dorm with a communal bathroom, having dedicated shower shoes such as flip flops is essential. \n\nIf you live with others, know how to be considerate. Coordinate with them to see who\u2019s bringing what, so you\u2019re not all bringing the same kitchen supplies. Establish rules/boundaries early on and follow them. You should ask questions like: What time do you go to sleep? When do you wake up? Do you expect to have a lot of people over? Are you planning on drinking, doing drugs? Who is going to buy cleaning supplies, toilet paper, etc.? Are there any foods you will buy that will be considered staples (milk, bread, butter, etc.)? How long can dirty dishes be left in the sink? Etc. Talk about your expectations and feelings if something\u2019s bothering you. If it gets worse, go to the RA. \n\nTry not to spend all your time in your room. Give your roommate (if you have one) some privacy. It's their room as much as yours, and it\u2019s good to get out too.\n\nDon't room with your friends from high school. You are going to be growing and changing a lot in college. Know you don\u2019t have to be best friends with your roommate either. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not. Sometimes friends don\u2019t make the best roommates anyway.\n\nDon't choose a college just because your significant other is going there. \n\nTake care of yourself and your area/belongings (maintaining a clean room, taking out the trash, showering regularly, etc.). You should know how to do your own laundry. Learning how to cook a few cheap meals, how to budget, etc., can also go a long way. Check out r/EatCheapAndHealthy and r/personalfinance. If you're a beginner, start with making food that you're familiar with and know you'll enjoy. \n\nIf something\u2019s not working out, talk to your RA and see if you can switch rooms. Let your roommate(s) know you won\u2019t be living with them the following year. Have this talk early so you can all make other arrangements. \n\nIf living away from home, have some food, water, and napkins at your place (even if you\u2019re dorming and don\u2019t have a kitchen unit). Dry snacks, fruit, popcorn, instant oatmeal, Easy Mac, other microwaveable meals, etc., are all good to have if you can\u2019t get to the dining hall one day. A small collection of generic 99 cent medicine is good to have too.\n\nIf living away from home, your parents miss you. Call and text them every now and then. You should have a balance - keep in contact but don\u2019t go home every weekend. Establish yourself at your school and with school events/your friends on the weekends. Don\u2019t isolate yourself. Go to clubs, make friends. Be involved. \n\nCollege is not for everyone. If you don't want to go to college, or if you aren't sure what you want to do, it's okay to not go right now. Don't be afraid to take a gap year, work for a few years, or explore other options. College is a commitment, and an expensive one for many people. If you don't want to go, or if you're not feeling ready, don't go.\n\nWhen reading advice, consider your own self and personality. Not every piece of advice is going to apply to you and your life. Don't feel like you have to follow what everyone says you should do just because they said it worked for them. You will develop your own tips and ways for managing once you get to college, and you will have your own advice one day to give to others.",

      "text": "1. Eat breakfast or brunch in your dorm room or on the go if you have early classes or breaks in between them. You can buy Styrofoam (throw away) bowls for cereal, mini cereal boxes, granola bars, or anything that you can heat up in the microwave by just adding some water (minute rice or mac n cheese). It'll really help you in the morning. You also won't have to waste a meal swipe at the dining hall. Also, you should add some food to your college list. Trust me, it helped me in the long run.\n\n2. To save space in your dorm room, only take seasonal clothes when you first come to college. Keep the winter jackets and sweat clothes at home. You can still bring long pants and a light jacket. I learned the hard way by keeping everything from winter until the end of the year. Go back home during the breaks to pick up your winter stuff and then go back home to drop it off whenever the weather gets warmer.\n\n3. At parties, if you don't want to drink, buy Gatorade, Powerade, non alcoholic glass soda bottles, or powdered mixers. You can also pour these drinks into an empty bottle and pretend that you're drinking. Just make sure that you always hold your bottle and don't place it down anywhere. For the glass soda bottles, tear off the labels and no one will know the wiser. I did this at parties with my old roommate and it worked out well for us. Most people will never get curious of you if they see any of these drinks in your hand.\n\nEven if someone does find out, then don't make a big deal about it. Just be honest with them and leave the party if they give you a hard time.\n\n4. Always go to parties with someone else or with a group of people. Never travel alone to parties if you have to walk quite a bit to a party. Even though that you might feel safe, you never know what can happen. Take a DD (designated driver) or the campus bus to a party if it's too far of a walk for you. Remember: DD's are Not only for drunk people. Bad weather, no bus services during that night, etc.\n\nEven if you're not a party person, just go to one for the experience. Apartment (off campus) parties and Frat parties usually have their differences. If you don't like it or feel uncomfortable, then do something else with your roommate(s) or friends. No one is forcing you to go. It's all by choice and personal opinion.\n\n5. To save space and time in the bathroom, buy a 2 in 1 shampoo and body wash bottle so you only have to carry one bottle. Also, bring your comb, tooth brush, shaving stuff, etc. all in your shower caddy. To keep all you stuff organized, buy a travel size bag or two to keep everything together. You can shower, shave, brush your teeth, and comb your hair all in one trip. On an extra note, make sure that you buy a big enough shower caddy to hold everything.\n\nP.S. Buying a tall mirror for your dorm room wouldn't be a bad idea as well.",

Basically all local companies and non profits who have internship programs would get together and set up tables and you can walk around and talk to them about their business/program. Really a lot to pick from.\n\nI also got credit for it (3 credits) so long as I completed the internship (15 hours a week for the entire semester, I forget how many weeks exactly) and completed some coursework outside of it like a few essays and did a presentation to the other students who also did internships that semester and the prof in charge of the overall credit/internship program.\n\nAs for finding out if they are legit, in this case I did not question the legitimacy because it was a school sanctioned event and a lot of the companies and orgs had been getting student interns for a long time.\n\nI don't know your major, but I would check to see if your school and dept./major does something similar? Also talking to your counselor is always a good way to go. If you find a company/program, you can ask them if they've heard about it OR you can ask them straight up where the best place to look to find a reliable internship in your field would be. Can also ask on here! You never know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!

Some people are so deliberately Lazy about it to. I\u2019m just gonna be honest and explain a shitty situation because it annoys me when people decide not to work out of laziness. I am a weed dealer and one of my best friends is a undeclared sophomore taking pre reqs. My best friend is always asking for fronts(giving him bud and trusting that he will pay me back eventually), even when I already fronted him like an eighth. He just has no ambition for anything besides laying around and playing video games. But he always tells me how he is struggling with money due to not working because his classes are difficult. It\u2019s very annoying  and he owes me like 150 right now. I love him to death like a brother but damn! It\u2019s not that hard to work 12-16 hours a week with pre reqs",
