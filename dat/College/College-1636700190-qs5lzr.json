  "text": "Its been about 3 months into college and i have about 8 decently close friends from hs who went to the same college as me. We all hung out in for a decent amount but people are slowly branching off. I feel like I feel behind as I made friends outside the hs group but its been a lot of shared friends. I can go hang out with some other people I know, but idk if they are the best option. I met a lot of new people and talk to them if I see them on the street or cafeteria but past that nothing happens. I dont know how to take it further the acquaintance stage and thats where a majority of the people I met are. How do I branch out from my hs group?",
