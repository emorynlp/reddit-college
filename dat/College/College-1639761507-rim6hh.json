  "text": "Never thought I\u2019d care enough to be this guy, but here I am. I\u2019m 1 single point away from having an A in my class after everything was calculated. I aced all exams, showed up to every class early, got all participation points, etc. The only points that I am missing which prevent me from receiving an A are single points taken off of individual assignments. To be clear\u2014 on each assignment (there are 4 total) , I got 19/20, and all positive feedback. Not a single suggestion for improvement. So, this is 4 points that were deducted without reasoning, and I only need 1 for an A grade. At the same time, this teacher is extremely strict and made it very clear that he does not do  grade negotiations. I understand of course because I\u2019d be annoyed if I were a professor having to deal with students begging for points, but this just seems petty on his part. Advice? It\u2019s my first semester of college. Thanks all, and good luck",
