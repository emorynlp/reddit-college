  "text": "I am a Junior\nGPA 3.52\nMajor: Finance \n\nPersonally feel like the college life was an over exaggeration, I am able to work my part time job , have enough time to hang out with friends and I will graduate with no debt . \n\nMoving to U.S. as a 12 year old , I was always told that it would be super hard to do good in college. \n\nThis post is not to brag , just wanted to share that some positivity",
