  "text": "(Xpost) My friend is severely depressed and has been basically incapacitated and unable to attend the work program at our school. We\u2019re trying to figure out options to get her an accommodation, but she hasn\u2019t had the option of going to a regular therapist due to financial reasons. We only have about a month to get this settled, and she\u2019ll likely lose her financial aid if we don\u2019t figure it out.\n\nDoes ANYONE have ideas as to how we can get a doctor\u2019s letter? Is there any online service that would be willing to write an accommodation letter for severe mental health conditions without prior diagnosis/treatment?\n\nShe\u2019s hoping to work with the school on free/discounted therapy and meds management next semester, but until then we\u2019re afraid she\u2019ll lose the ability to attend school. Please help. Thank you in advance \ud83d\udc95",

You cannot just try and get something off the internet.  Well you can try but I suspect the Disability Center will want more than some random diagnosis and letter from an internet site.\n\nYour first priority should be to help your friend get the mental health support they need.  Please contact the counseling services at your school.",
