  "text": "I love the hybrid model of class. Having in person labs and online lectures.Also, having in person lecture 2-3 days and asynchronous. They should also offer asynchronous online classes as well. I think it is good if they can offer a mix of classes in the future so we have options. It would be good to have 1 class fully in person, 1 hybrids, and 1 online. Going in to lecture every single day takes up so much time.",

There are few exceptions where the tenured professors have designed to advocated for the courses to stay fully remote or asynchronous. Those classes are the ones that web classes to start (before covid) and are pretty rare to get into as you need to be in degree-specific courses to take such professors. Professors have actually gotten in trouble with their department heads for trying to make them hybrid for extenuating circumstances other than students with COVID.",

However, for classes that test you on a statistic or small details from a textbook, it\u2019s so difficult to memorize everything. Some of my classes require reading textbooks and basically having to memorize the textbook front and back. For science classes it\u2019s more of memorizing a concept and terminology. Non stem classes require memorization of small details. I think I have a hard time with the classes that make you memorize the text front and back. So those are the classes Im specifically talking about. It\u2019s difficult because some professors don\u2019t have a study guide so if you missed it when studying or reading the piece of information then you get wrong on the exam.\nIt wrong on an exam. It\u2019s not the same as learning anatomy because you can expect what to study and what to learn.",

And all for free! \n\nAlso, there really isn't an active way to engage in lectures unless you ask questions, but sometimes I'm so lost I don't even know which questions to ask. And profs don't engage students often, at least for me, so it really is just like watching a video. I feel like these profs priority isn't to teach and I can't blame em. I'm a horrid teacher myself and they probably just want to focus on their research, not ensure we're learning the material well.",

      "text": "Like another person in the comments said, different universities do different things for offering classes. In my college, specifically the College of Business we have options such as Fully Online (may or not have class times which if they are it has label of a time when registering for the classes), Mixed Online & Person where attendance is optional, Live  Capture Lectures which means a professor records their lectures for up to 600 students online (uploads it to Canvas) in their classroom and up to 75 students can be in the classroom. Faces of those 75 is never show on camera but it's better than fully online imo. Then we have In Person which can either be 100% in the classroom or only In Person for Exams and have to show up to the Testing Center throughout the sem for finals, or quizzes.\n\nOverall, I say plan your classes ahead and pick which learning option best fit your needs. For me, I like in person for classes that is Major Courses or I need extra support in, LC or fully online for classes either with huge reviews over in person counterparts, for convenience and when I'm dealing with classes I just don't have energy to show up for in person beyond personal issues. The only bad part about online is that even before the Pandemic, that my college charges a Online fee of 180 on top of the class tuition for the class which is messed up and a money grab but anyways...\n\nJust remember to do your classes that is online, go to office hours or tutoring if you need help and you should be good to go to pass though. Do what is best for your needs as a student and fingers cross in your remaining time at college you get more flexibility in the teaching format of the class you need tho.",

Maybe make a category of Gen Ed class that fits a theme a student may be interested in. Like Medical Students having to take Stats, Calc, Biology, Chem, Psych & Sociology while being to easily test out of classes like Gov by taking a exam cheaper then the class itself. Or a business student like me only taking Stats, Business Calc, Macro, Micro, Business Writing & either Psych or Sociology (for studying ppl and their actions which go hand and hand for later classes such as Consumer Behavior) \n\nTaking basically 40 credits like a third of your degree for Gen Ed is un needed and just a money grab but yea... Totally for online options for Gen Ed and for those that want other options like in person, that should be options as well",

I applied and did my 1st year as a Health Admin Major then in Aug switch to International Business and now I'm a double major in Marketing and Hospitality & Tourism with 2 cert as well (Casino Management & Meetings and Event) I was lucky that my switches were in the College of Business and for the most part besides 2 classes (like taking College Alg instead of Calc or taking a foreign language that only International Bus needed) I didn't have to play catch up like other students have when they switch a major to a different subject and college. The reason I switch my major was bc my freshman seminar class and my prof he introduced like this boat load of info that the College of Business students can take (like majors, minors, cert) and discover potential career paths with it. I was really interested in Casino, Gaming, Marketing, Tourism and Human Resources while liking the Global Aspects of IB but not as a degree like I later found out. \n\nIt really inspired me to pick a career that I wanted, not what my family wanted which was medical and even a middle ground like Health Admin, they still wasn't happy in (think Business Admin but medical side essentially) Most of my Gen Ed class was bearable, but it wasn't life changing like my seminar class had done. It was essentially a repeat of HS info just more elaborate on and cut down on time instead of a full year its only a sem. But I think the most interesting Gen Ed I had to date was a Special Topics of Writing which counted as a writing class, we learn about fake news, and the effects of how our words matter along with watching movies, doing a group project and 3 papers throughout the semester. The way my professor had done the class it was the highlight of that sem (was Spring of 2021) and if I wasn't so blah about writing and known what my interest and strengths were, I may have consider doing a minor of something within the field of English & Communications since my prof teach a couple of upper class for that subject.\n\nBut like I said earlier, very rare from my experience (idk for other ppl) ppl switch majors just by takin a gen ed class",

The stuff you learn in psychology is very academic and geared towards people who really wanna do psychology and research not for people who are interested in learning about different career that they could do.

Such a damn ashamed bc it was only I think 2 credits since it was a 8 week 2nd week course from Oct to December 2020. Easily the most influential class of my freshman year in terms of realistic and content that is useful beyond grades for that class. \n\nMore students should have opportunities like this within their underclassmen years before being a upperclassmen since the class help me decide once and for all my interest and align that with majors that I can do all that I want and can graduate on time for. Also push for internships beyond simply research since not everyone is good at that and more hands on in working on stuff that they are gonna do as a career post grad. Focus on varieties of stuff beyond GPA. I'm a business major so gpa isn't as strict like STEM majors are, that doesn't mean I'm slacking since I'm that type of person to still put in the work (plus just want to graduate with Latin Honors of 3.5 or higher gpa) but work experience should be pushed if not more since degree isn't the whole factor in business. It may get you a interview but it isn't a selling point, the work experience you learn on the job + classroom experience from your degree is what gets you the degree. So that's my 2 cents on all of this",

      "text": "I'm from Uruguay. Our most popular university (and the only free one) is actually thinking about this because is a fucking big problem. The UdelaR (Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica AKA the free one) is mostly located in the capital city, Montevideo. If you want to study and you aren't from Montevideo, you need to move here. The thing is, moving to the city is frankly expensive. You need to rent an apartment, pay the bills, pay your food, pay the public transportation... is not cheap. And our education system tries its best to be open and accesible for everyone. \n\nObviously, it doesn't always work. And we, as a society (or at least the most leftist side of it) agree we need to change that. We need to find a way to be more accesible in whatever capacity we can.\n\nSince 1958 we, the students, have the opportunity to participate in the government of this particular University. We get to make decision alongside the Dean, the professors and the graduates. This is called co-government, and one of the better things about this is that the actual government of Uruguay can't influence the decisions of the UdelaR.  It's its own public entity.  \n\nThanks to these politics, we may actually be able to have a say in what will finally happen. Some Faculties (the Faculty of Law, for example) has already decided they are gonna have an hybrid education. Mine (the Faculty of Humanities) is still in discussion regarding this topic. Either way, if we are able to have an hybrid education, it will not only help us, the people who are currently studying.  It will help the future generations of students. The people who can't pay to live outside of their families houses yet, the mothers and fathers who can't leave a children from a long period of time, the people who needs to work in order to be able to sustain theirselfs or their families and doesn't have the time to travel.  So yeah, colleges NEEDS to keep their hybrid education. They SHOULD be try to be more accesible and stop closing doors. And they also SHOULD make their future profesionals educate themselves alongside the society they are in. In a really rough translation of the words of Pablo Carlevaro:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A University that generates professionals as a factory; professionals that are going to carry out a technical operation task in society, and even, that are going to benefit from the training to acquire a certain social position, it is not what we aspire or pretend to be the result of the university education process. One of its objectives is to make a professional with full awareness of their insertion into society; a professional who will not aspire to profit as the ultimate goal of their training, but rather aspire to something much deeper: their insertion as a servant of society. In this sense, the experiences of contact with society, of working with human groups, contribute to the formation of the student's personality, providing it with knowledge and direct experience of what society is and how its real problems occur, that cannot be generated by any other type of educational act.\n\nWe, the future professionals, need to pay back to society what they are currently giving us: the oportunity to study.",

Instead of holding the government accountable for not building enough sites for students in the countryside, they simply shut down the whole university and that's it. So now, instead of just a few students getting screwed, now we ALL are getting screwed. It's shocking to me how they can get away with the most absurd solutions now. If they suggested shutting down normal classes indefinitely before 2020, there would be several protests. But now it's acceptable.\n\nIf you want online classes, you should go to a college that offers online classes. But to demand an important University to shut down because it's difficult for you to go? That's incredibly selfish.",
