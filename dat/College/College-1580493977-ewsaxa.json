  "text": "At the university I go to, there is not much parking to use among the student population. However, I have seen almost physical fights, an actual small car accident, been almost hit twice, and more over a parking spot. People have followed me to my car, asked me to get in the car with them so I can take them to my spot, yelled at me asking if I\u2019m leaving, and so on. I\u2019m just wondering why college students are overly aggressive getting these spots?",

But WOW was it bad! \n\nIt never had enough spots, I arrived 20 minutes early for a class, and was 10 minutes late. I was circling for half an hour! Especially when they close of lots, I think people actually miss classes over that shit! \n\nThere\u2019s also way to many speed bumbs, potholes, and steep hills, which is bad if you drive stick. The speed limit was 25mph. But if you actually hit that speed your car\u2019s suspension parts will fall out underneath the car from the state of that lot!",

I've not had that issue (physical fights, accidents, etc.) but I'll show up to campus an hour before my class starts and sometimes I can still spend 30 mins trying to find a parking spot.\n\nI'm a commuter, always have been (lived close enough to campus that I didn't have to live in the dorms) so I never really had a choice but to get a permit.\n\nCan confirm that the earlier in the day you are (or if it's a Friday), there's always way more parking spaces open.",

And, your pass will only open the lot that you paid for -- so you cant buy a pass for the lot far away and then park in the close lot. Disabled students can buy a disabled pass that opens all the lots, though you're not guaranteed a spot with the passes. \n\nLast year they had to close the second biggest parking lot on campus, and to make up for this they offered free parking across campus: in any lot!! So of course, everyone drove. I paid $700 for a good lot since I have an 1+ hour commute and can't take the bus (area not serviced). The frustration and utter \\*rage\\* I and others felt when we had nowhere to park, no alternative way to get to school, and yet had students parking for free when they lived down the street. I nearly got in 2 accidents that week, trying to find parking. 5/10 days I had to park at the hospital, walk to school, walk back to the hospital, pay for day parking there (which is cheaper than at my school btw), then drive home. I could have taken the bus instead of walking but the bus was full so. Fun week.",

Its only $200 for Fall/Spring so of course almost anyone can buy one. If they made it more expensive, they would have more people using public transportation. Also, FCC has a new parking garage that was announced in 2019 to open in 2021 to accommodate students. They charge $30 a semester and like $20 for summer. Fresno State has not announced anything that I've seen. I saw rumors that they were going to repurpose the farm and add parking there, but it seems they are just struggling with the budget and needing to find revenue to keep the farm open. \n\nThis overall makes students pissed because parking feels expensive, but can take 1 hour to find. To be fair, the further lots aren't as bad, but everyone always bitches and moans about walking.\n\nAlso, people acting like idiots (walking or driving) in the lots can really irritate you. Sometimes its non stop j walking or walking in front/behind your car to the point where you are crawling to find a spot. Fresno State parking sucks, but obviously it sucks elsewhere too. They'd have to triple parking to get people to reconsider public transportation/buying a permit.",

          "text": "Yet the community college I went to prior to transferring to the major state Uni had entirely free parking, no bs permits, or loser uni rent-a-cops driving around issuing parking tickets to everyone (because of course, every fucking lot has different restrictions, times, permit types required, etc.) who already pays to park here.... Also as an on-campus resident, yet also employed full time and a full time class load, I'm extremely stressed and have little to no time to waste most days.\n\nThe last thing most of us need it to go to the lot, possibly already running late, circle it while noticing none are free, stress and road rage levels increase going thru more and more lots and still seeing 0 spots for us and our $300 parking permit.\n\nAfter 10-15 mins or so, and if im already late on an important day, ill say \"fuck it\" and park in grass near the lot, and accept the $25 parking ticket as a necessary sacrafice.\n\nBut I agree, getting into fist-fights and flooring it around the lots (with a lot of ppl around), is stupid and dangerous. \n\nTLDR: They need to provide enough fucking spots for their students, especially when we pay hundreds in the first place and they ticket almost everyone regularly for one thing or another.",

Tbh, $25 is the standard fine for simply parking in a space, but in an unauthorized lot (for the permit) or at unauthorized times or whatever. The time I parked in the grass they gave me a $50 ticket. But $600 is monumentally outrageous, I would contest that over and over again until they dropped or reduced it significantly.\n\nIm presuming they have similar policies at yours, but here if u dont pay within a week or two they put your account on \"financial hold\" meaning you cant register for or change classes, or make any other changes to your account. Basically they try to force you to pay up fast and not wait for an appeal or else youre screwed if you need to adjust schedule, add/change classes or sections, etc.",

Or just find a parking spot. Some people have to be at a class before that time so they're rushing maybe last minute to park in a spot or some cases they aren't much available so they been searching for a spot over period of time.\n\n It also gets aggravating for students who drive to campus than to see residential students cars ( if university has designated parking areas for faculty/ residential/ commuters) parked in commuter spots and to limit the room for commuters to park there when arriving to park and get to class on time. Some people are just short tempered or can't be patient so they start rushing others to be able to get a spot.\n\nAt my University my dorm building and others who live in them,  is right next to a parking lot ( for commuters only) so I complained why our University didn't make this spot for residential students.  I can get to my car quicker when needed if i could leave my car there. I try to get my car so i can drive over to my job on campus and sometimes it makes me late to get my vehicle.\n\n They put our lot to park almost a mile away and most students gotta wait for the shuttle to arrive ( as cold temp. drops) to get to their vehicle. Residential students have to wait till after 4:30pm on weekdays to park there car closer across from their dorm so they don't have a citation from campus police.",
