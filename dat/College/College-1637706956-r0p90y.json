  "title:": "How to create a CV with no experience?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m trying to enter a couple research labs in my university, but lack any research or applicable experience really. How can I make a cv without that cause I feel it would just look really dull and underwhelming. As a side note, would it be appropriate to send cv\u2019s and the other materials to these research labs over fall/thanksgiving break or should I wait until after? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
