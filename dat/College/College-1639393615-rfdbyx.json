  "text": "I don't know why, but I have been straight panicking all day and can't sleep after taking my last exam final of the semester. I needed a incredibly low grade in order to pass and even with being familiar with the content of every question on the exam, I still have this fear that I failed. I don't know why but I cannot shake this feeling even though when I research the questions it seems like I did fine. Any tips to just chill out after finals before grades are published?",

Something to take things off your mind. You need an outlet because this is not the only stressful thing that\u2019s going to happen in life.",
