  "title:": "Best Class to Take in 8 Week\u2019s Time?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a biology major at my local community college and was hoping on graduating within 2 years.  This means I have to take a lot of math/science heavy courses, I was hoping to split some of them into 8 weeks so I can take more at once in addition to summer classes.  I was wondering which would be the best to take in that regard, as in the least material and stress?  There is going to be calc of biology and medicine, physics, chem, organic chem, and botany/zoology.",

I don\u2019t have experience with taking chem/physics over winter but I\u2019d be careful before doing that. \nBtw I took my bio course online during the pandemic.",

              "text": "It was through my community college. They had a winter intercession that was normally 6 weeks, but for whatever reason, they shortened it to 5 weeks. My school no longer offers this intercession anymore, but you could still do the same thing over a summer session. I think it was a great course to do online. Best science one to do online.",
