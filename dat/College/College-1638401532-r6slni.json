  "text": "I started university at the start of this year and I was pursuing a Bachelor's in Political Science. I finished one semester and at the start of the second semester I switched to Business Administration and dropped out after 2 weeks because of personal issues and am planning to start school again in august/september 2022, and I don't know if I should continue studying Political Science or Business Administration. I like Business Administration more than Political Science because I'm interested how business works in general but I am **horrible** at math. I find Political Science interesting because of how government and countries communicate with each other and I like to work with data, but my main concern with Political Science is that whether I will be able to get a good paying job in the future that I have an interest in, because I have been looking at jobs in my city and pretty much every job I find interesting requires a degree in something, preferrably business, computer science etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I continue in Political Science or switch to Business Administration?",
