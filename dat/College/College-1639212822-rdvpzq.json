  "text": "So my dad caught the 'rona double vaxxed (his pcr came positive and he's got clear symptoms) me and my mom have been taking care of him because he is a high-risk individual (hypertension, multiple major back surgries) now my mom has lost her sense of smell/taste and is experiencing symptoms, and I am also starting to feel blue with a rough cough. We're all double vaxxed.\n\nSo how do I go about emailing my professors? do I cc all of them? bcc? do I send individual emails? do I get the department head involved? the dean? do I give them detailed accounts? I am not sure of the protocol to follow as I've never had to take medical leave before + my uni doesn't seem to have a well-defined way of going about this.\n\nPlease note that I got PCR tested today and the results take a day or two to come out (ehhh government testing) so I can't really attach my test results in the emails.",

      "text": "Check and see if your school has a policy for how to notify professors. \n\nIf not, I don\u2019t see a problem with a bcc so you only send one email. Or you can do individual for each class. Just keep it short and to the point. Here\u2019s an example or starting off point for an idea of what to send. Be concise and polite, provide more details if they ask. \n\n\u201cMembers of my household have recently tested positive for Covid-19. I interact with them daily and I am awaiting my test results. I believe I have minor symptoms, so I will be quarantined for xx days. I will follow the Covid-19 class policy in the syllabus./I do not know what the Covid-19 policy for missing class is, how would you like to proceed so I can keep up with class?\u201d \n\nOnce you get your results, your school might have a policy on reporting and tracking that.",

      "text": "You can send one email with your professors, department chair and whoever from rhe dean\u2019s office handles student issues (can be a counselor or asst Dean, depending on the school, and if you don\u2019t know who, the faculty will. You\u2019ll need all those people to sign off on any medical leave or incompletes. You\u2019ll also need that Covid test result/doctor\u2019s note saying you are too sick to work if that\u2019s the case. If you have those things they are pretty much obligated to offer reasonable accommodations. There\u2019s probably a form or set of forms, one for each class, that\u2019ll need to be filled out and signed by the prof, chair, and dean\u2019s office and then turned into the registrar. Obviously you can\u2019t be walking around getting signatures. So maybe a counselor or department chair can help. That\u2019s why it\u2019s G good to copy everyone in one email.  \n\nBest of luck! It\u2019s pretty scary to see your dad so sick and know you have it too. And this is terrible timing. But the school part should be ok.",
