  "text": "Second year at a pretty big public college. I don\u2019t have any friends, don\u2019t really interact w my roommates and am starting to fall behind grade wise. I spend all my time in my room and try to stay on top of everything but my lack of a social life is getting to my head. How do you guys make friends? And any tips for staying on top of everything? I just feel super stagnant, like i never have anything going on I just go to class, eat,  sleep and do homework (rarely) Any help is greatly appreciated \u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "If your courses have study sessions or places that offer tutoring that might be a good place to strike a conversation with students in your courses. Attending them will help you grasp the material better and potentially be a good place to find a study buddy. Make sure to bite the bullet and just introduce yourself to someone there.",
