I've never gotten above a 65 on an essay, yet you haven't bombed 1?? I think it's a bunch of horseshit...",

Now put me in a science class, and even if I enjoy it- I will bomb that shit instantly lol. I chose a major where I avoid science. My brain literally can\u2019t comprehend it.",

          "text": "I disagree with this tbh. I took a four year hiatus before after highschool and  in that time period I really invested in knowing more about myself and developing better studying techniques and systems that guided me to success even if I lacked the motivation. My efforts paid off and I have been able to achieve 4.0 in my first 2 years of college despite still heavily having a social life. But in all, I focused my efforts on working/studying  smarter and more efficiently and using techniques to retain information and increase my greater area of understanding. It is possible to excel in school and have a social life but it doing so requires an overhaul in ones typical/ traditional approach to school and studying. I recommend the book Atomic Habits! and looking at spaced repetition and active recall",
