  "title:": "Any suggestions on how to be a good tutor?",
  "text": "Hello, I recently became a tutor for high school biology students. I have never tutored nor been tutored before, so this is completely new to me. I start next week teaching a few students on the side. I want to know what I should do to be considered a good tutor and be successful in teaching over the material and have the students perform well after our meeting sessions.\n\nA little background about me, I am a second year dental student, and that is why i chose to tutor in biology specifically, because i have quite a decent understanding of this topic especially questions that are high yielding etc, bc i have taken over at least 100 biology exams in my academic career. So that is why i chose to tutor biology as opposed to chemistry/orgo, because i definitely understand biology a lot better.\n\nWhat should I do personally as a tutor. Should I have them bring a copy of the curriculum/syllabus?Past exams from professors? Do i just read over the textbook chapter with them and study with them, or do i only help them in a certain point that they are having a hard time comprehending?\n\nI really want to succeed in this pursuit because i really enjoy teaching and explaining things (love doing this when i study with others and help them out) and i would really like to be successful in helping other students overcome subjects that are difficult for them.\n\nThank you very much in advance!",

                              "text": "For one, you need to let them tell you what areas they\u2019re struggling with. If they\u2019re in class, they already have someone going over the chapter with them from beginning to end. They don\u2019t need you to repeat that. \n\nI agree with the first comment here that you should let them try to figure things out on their own. The point of a tutor is to facilitate understanding and learning, not to just tell them the answer. And biology is very much a class where you can truly gain an understanding. It\u2019s not a class that should rely on memorization. Obviously there are some things that need to be memorized, but it is a class based on concepts. \n\nAsk them to explain these concepts to you. If they can\u2019t explain it all the way through, you\u2019ve found areas of confusion or gaps in their knowledge that you can help them fill. Ask them questions as they explain things to you. If they can\u2019t answer them, again, there are gaps in their understanding. This should be an active process rather than an hour of them sitting silently listening to you read the textbook to them\n\nETA: also help them make use of their books and resources. If I say I don\u2019t know something and you tell me the answer, then I have an answer to one point of confusion. If you show me how to find answers in my book or how to efficiently research, then I can learn efficiently on my own much better. When they leave tutoring, they should be better students all around. They should not feel that they have to rely on tutoring to succeed because they\u2019re given all the answers at tutoring",
