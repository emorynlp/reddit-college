  "text": "For a final project in one of my classes, I have to write a business proposal. My Prof. has uploaded the PowerPoint on the proposal and there is an example of a formal proposal. Would It be plagiarism to use the format of the proposal in the PowerPoint?\n\nFor example, there is a requirement to have an Introduction. In the examples introduction, there are subheadings like \"overview\" \"background\" \"statement of the problem\". Could I use these headings and of course put my own original content under them?",
