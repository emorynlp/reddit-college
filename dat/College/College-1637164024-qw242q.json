  "text": "I got about an 81% on the midterm and, thus far, have gotten 100% for my homework that counts for 20% of the grade. Canvas is saying I sit at an 89 point something at the moment, so basically a fraction of a point away from an A-. If the final counts for 50%, do I still have a chance of getting an A, assuming there is no curve (A is from 95-100 at my school)? Or is it very unlikely?",
