  "text": "i'm a freshman whose pledging a decently top fraternity. i talk to girls at my frat's exchanges with sororities, but that's the problem: it always stops at talking. I don't really become friends with them, and if I'm lucky, I get the courage to ask them for their snap and sometimes snap them. How do I hook up with, date, or just find a girl to be with in general? What should i do?",
