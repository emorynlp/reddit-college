  "title:": "My (own) favorite free task manager for students",
  "text": "I'm a computer sciences student. When i began my degree, I was looking for a simple task manager made for students and could not find one that matches my needs. I have adhd and i wanted something that is super simple and has not 1001 features, something \"straight to the point\". So i programmed one myself. I used it for the past year of so and really love it. Since my friends were using it too, I decided to put it online.\n\nIt's 100% free, there is not even a way to have a paid subscription. Of course, since i'm a student and really poor, it's hosted on a free host, so not the fastest haha! But feel free to use it :)\n\nit's Schoolbud, and you can find it at [schoolbud.academy](https://schoolbud.academy/) !\n\nPlease dont take this down, it's not an ad, i dont make any money from this, i only want people to be able to use my work :)\n\nFeel free to leave comments, it there is something wrong or something that you want me to add, i'll do it !\n\nHave a nice day, and success !",
