  "title:": "Love college more than anything, yet failing it repeatedly\u2026",
  "text": "The most pathetic part of all this, like I alluded to in my title, is that I actually really love my classes, my professors, my degree (English) and my college. As embarrassing as this is to admit, I always wanted to go grad school, get a PhD ideally, be an academic, or a museum curator, or critic, or librarian or something like that. Ironically, I have proven again and again that I can\u2019t even finish my undergrad degree so this is absolutely ridiculous. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. \n\nHere\u2019s how it goes: every semester I am incredibly excited, tell myself this semester is going to be different, I\u2019m not going to be lazy, or avoid, I\u2019m going to get the work done, I\u2019m ready to redeem myself, I can do this. I always fall in love with my classes, my professors, my reading assignments. I feel personally connected to the subject and all my classes seem to connect to one another in exciting ways. During the first few weeks or months of the semester, I am totally absorbed and succeeding. My professors have noticed me and I go to office hours and ask great questions in class. I spend hours for fun in the library reading extra sources, constructing theories, reading my professor\u2019s research, daydreaming about how it connects to that honors thesis which I\u2019ll eventually get write. I check our fifteen books and get so excited just looking at the spines that I feel my heart rate increase. I brainstorm ideas for my first paper and feel good about starting so early. I might even write the first paper and get glowing feedback. I can\u2019t wait to finally turn things around. Parties, romance, drinking\u2026 all of that pales in comparison to the euphoria of learning and being a college student. \n\nAt some point, the first major assignment deadline rolls around and despite beginning the paper weeks ago I\u2019ve barely made any progress. I\u2019m paralyzed, avoiding it altogether as the deadline approaches. I don\u2019t turn anything in or say anything. More days pass and each day I am less and less motivated. I dread the assignment, dread seeing my professor, begin giving up on everything in all of my classes until eventually it\u2019s two weeks before the semester is over and I have not done any real work for any of my classes, the ones I supposedly fell in love with. I\u2019ve spent yet another semester paralyzed in bed, avoiding everything, making excuses like \u201cmental health issues,\u201d crying and hating myself and doing nothing to fix anything. Why ask for help when nothing can help me, except myself. I\u2019ve lost all motivation and live my days in denial or avoiding my problems listening to music and smoking cigarettes and thinking about that upsetting stuff that happened to me as a child, or reading Dylan Thomas poems that make me forget reality altogether like some kind of poetry addict in denial. It\u2019s pathetic the excuses I make for myself but I know it\u2019s entirely my own fault. And I say nothing to my prof as I have no excuse, how could they help? I have simply done it again. It\u2019s all damage control from here. I accept failure and do nothing, wasting thousands of dollars of my own money, I have no idea why my own impending financial doom isn\u2019t motivation enough to put in minimal effort but it I sent. \n\nObviously all my fault and I don\u2019t know why but I can\u2019t do anything. It makes me sick to my stomach to even think about my schoolwork. Only a miracle could save me. I might as well just enjoy the last few moments before all hell breaks loose. \n\nThen it happens again. And again. Every time I think I\u2019m so much more mature and hardworking than before, that I know what I want and how to work hard and stick with it, and every time I fail just a little bit worse than the last time. \n\nI should also I\u2019ve been given chance after chance, and gotten more help than I could hope for, including 2 leaves of absence and a medical withdrawal for two years to sort my mental health out, disability accommodations, a reduced course load, many different therapists, psychiatrists, modalities, medications, an outpatient intensive program, sectioned by the state as an inpatient, ADHD diagnosis and meds, SSRIs, abilify, CBT, DBT, EMDR. I\u2019m as bad as ever, or worse. Now they can\u2019t give me anything more. No more leave of absence time. If I can\u2019t do a full course load and get above Cs I\u2019m out and I don\u2019t blame them. \n\nIt is time to just stop trying to do college even though I \u201clove\u201d it right? I don\u2019t know what else to do though. I have no skills. No one wants me to work for them. Im not even good at easy jobs even when I try so hard! My memory is so bad and my nerves get on everyone\u2019s nerves. I know I can work on this stuff. Im just trying to get by. Honestly I feel like I was probably meant to be a sex worker. Maybe the one thing I\u2019m moderately good at is sex. Seriously I think that\u2019s the only success I\u2019ve had lately\u2026",

      "text": "The last part, about not being good at even easy jobs... I think this is a big problem. You need to develop grit/determination. Quitting college I don't think will do that. Perhaps move somewhere away from all context for the bad patterns you find yourself in, and apply yourself to *only* school.",

Sometimes I don\u2019t even do anything and let the deadlines pass. \n\nI should be failing one of my classes right now but the only reason why I\u2019m going to pass is because my professor still took my assignments in and gave me partial credit for them.",
