  "text": "hi, im 17 and i messed up pretty bad so my grades have just been awful and so i\u2019m heading to a community college to do my generals. said community college is notorious for being lonely, and i\u2019m really, really scared. right now i\u2019m really lucky to have been introduced to a really cool group of kids but they\u2019re all heading somewhere else, and i\u2019m gonna be alone again. i won\u2019t survive alone, i really can\u2019t. the only thing keeping me here sometimes is my friends. i have severe social anxiety and i\u2019m a pretty ~different person, and so i really only click with certain types of people. i was wondering for how someone like me could make friends, sorry if this is annoying cus i know there are lots of posts like this one",
