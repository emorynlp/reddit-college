  "text": "I'm taking calc 1 this semester and it's been a nightmare. The professor talks himself in circles and if you ask a question, he just answers something you didn't even ask. The whole class is at a lost and half of them don't even come to class anymore. They just show up for the tests and pray. Anyway, he has told us that he will be replacing out lowest test score grade with our homework grade. Most people in my class are skipping out on the next test (not the final, we have to be there for that) and just taking the zero. That's how much we don't understand this material. I unfortunately can't do that because my first test grade was a 46 and I really need that replaced. I have been to tutoring and even they don't know what he's trying to teach us. So, I'm wondering if you guys know of websites I could use to review the material that could be helpful in terms of understanding it?",
