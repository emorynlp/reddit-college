  "title:": "I want to get a single next year. Are there any reasons for me not to?",
  "text": "My roommate is nice, don't get me wrong, but when she goes home for the weekend I appreciate how freeing it is to do whatever I want. That's why I'm considering getting a single next year. Money or availability isn't a problem since I'll only be at college for one more year and I should have enough credits to get a single somewhere on campus. I have some friends from my floor, clubs, etc. so I'm not too worried about getting lonely. \n\nThe only potential issues are that singles are small and may be hard to get if I want a nice room and location, but I figure since I'll be alone the size won't be a big problem (I don't have a ton of stuff anyway) and I'm willing to compromise room quality/location if it means I don't have a roommate. \n\nIf anyone would like to offer another perspective or reassure me that I'm making the right decision, it's much appreciated!",

      "text": "I had a single for two semesters and both were mentally kinda rough, and I love silence and being away from people. Like you, I was motivated by the great weekend feeling and wanting the space to myself tbh. It\u2019s much easier to not leave the room, and you get depressed more easily (psychological fact). \n\nI recommend getting an apartment and having your individual room.",

      "text": "If you get an apartment instead, you don't have to move at the end. If your away from home that can help.\n\nThat being said, double check your money and math. If you have enough grants and scholarships, maybe. If it's all loans I might suck it up. \n\nThe main issue with single or studio is isolation and responsibly. You are the one getting everything, cleaning everything, going to be on time....",
