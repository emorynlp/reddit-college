  "title:": "Should I contact my suitemate ahead of time?",
  "text": "So I received my housing assignment this week. I move in next month to my dorm (I\u2019m transferring from a community college). I have a single room so I don\u2019t have a roommate. However I do have a suitemate who I\u2019m just sharing the bathroom with.\n\nMy question is obviously in the title lol but should I contact my suitemate ahead of time since I have their email? I\u2019m not expecting an immediate response since not everyone checks their email religiously Lol.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting to become like the very best friends with them or anything. I just wanted to be I guess welcoming or something? I don\u2019t know how to put it Lol. That and I am autistic so with us obviously going to be sharing bathroom cleaning duties (or well let me rephrase that\u2026I HOPE to be sharing bathroom cleaning duties Lol) and stuff I just wanted to let my suitemate know that in case there\u2019s any communication issues or anything like that.\n\nAlso one last question do suitemates (good suitemates Lol) usually take turns buying things like toilet paper? \n\nThanks for reading Lol",
