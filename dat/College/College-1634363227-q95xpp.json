      "text": "I've been in one for two years. The drinking is there, but its just a small part of it. Hell, a decent chunk of the guys in my house don't even drink. It is also much cheaper than living on campus typically. Its sort of like living in the dorms, just without an RA breathing down your neck. (as a reference I'm a dual major in Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering, and have a 3.7 GPA (the chapter average is a 3.35 and the non greek average is a 2.98)). I have lots of friends outside of the fraternity, and have gotten a lot of help with school both from those friends and the fraternity.",

      "text": "I had a friend who joined a frat and he  liked it. He went to parties but he didn\u2019t drink much or at all. He did get too involved though and did bad his first semester and had to leave sadly. So no they\u2019re not really about drinking it\u2019s just a way to meet people. \n\nI personally think if you join a frat you\u2019re kinda a loser because you really need to pay money just to have friends and alcohol when you can do all of that for free but that\u2019s my two cents.\n\nBut that comment does make me a hypocrite because I think I\u2019m going to join my  sophomore year -just to experience it-using my freshman year to just get used to college.",
