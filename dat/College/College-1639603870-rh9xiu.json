I honestly have seen a couple recent arts student be successful out of dozens I\u2019ve ever met. And the stats support that anecdote when you check out art median salaries.\n\nJust not a good call to do unless you\u2019re set up for life from your family already.",

Journalism and editing (copy-editing as well as acquisitions-editing and production-editing) are the two main ones I can think of off the bat. PR, graphic design, and teaching are also options. Depending on what you are interested in, legal writing, grant writing, policy writing, or many other government jobs at all levels require writing.",
