  "title:": "Art students, how do you balance work and school?",
  "text": "Title says it all basically. I'm in my third year of school, and am currently shoving all of my studios in together because I didn't know what I wanted to do for a while. I'm only taking 12 credit hours, but with my studios and dance rehearsals on top of working around 30 hours a week this shits killing me. \n\nI can't take less classes or else I lose my health insurance, and I can only work around 24 hours minimum a week to be able to scrape by and pay rent. I feel like i'm just so fucking exhausted all the time, and other \"how do you balance life\" posts I've seen aren't really from art students, so I thought i'd ask here how y'all balance things.",

      "text": "To be honest.. you don\u2019t. Closest thing I\u2019ve come to work life balance isn\u2019t figuring out how to get everything done\u2026it\u2019s figuring out what DOESN\u2019T need to get done (really small point tedious assignments) I also try to bundle my free time up as much as I can (watch my shows while I eat) I\u2019ve also gotten into podcasts even though I kind of hate podcasts just because it\u2019s a way I can feasibly get in entertainment while actually getting work done. I\u2019m in my last semester and I\u2019m super burnt out. Last but not least.. If you feel like you\u2019re going to absolutely lose it and need a day to yourself.. take it. Just make sure you\u2019ll have enough discipline to make things up later (including office hours, your profs will give you a lot more slack if you consistently show them you\u2019re trying just falling apart a bit in the process). \n\nI must say us art kids get such a bad rep. Everybody acts like it\u2019s a joke major but art school is a crazy amount of work and time.",
