  "title:": "Graduating college in a few weeks, I have two job interviews for the same location next week and i Don't honestly know how to move forward",
  "text": "Basically it's this big really well renowned institution in my field and next week I have interviews with two different people in different departments of the institution. If both of them offer me the job I honestly don't know which one I would take. The Second Job I'm interviewing for pays an extra 25c an hour, but the first one is technically higher paying, since it has overtime at double pay and call-in hours at triple pay.\n\nHowever the First Job is also more demanding, with mandatory overtime every week, mandatory call-ins, no weekends free, and not to mention it is also a high risk of minor physical injury.\n\nI also don't know what to do if I get offered one job before I hear back from the other one, since they both ultimately are the same institution I don't want to mess up my chance to work there",

You will be miserable and exhausted all the time, you will dread coming in to work. Your boss knows that this job sucks and will eventually burn you to a cinder, and they will squeeze you for every ounce of labor they can before you wise up and leave.\n\nSo... personally I would aim for the Second Job.",
