  "title:": "How to get my roommate to blow his weed smoke out the window?",
  "text": "Look i have no problem with him smoking weed, but literally all i ask is that he blows his smoke out the window.  Personally idc if the room smells like weed, i just dont want the smell getting out in the hallway where people could narc on us for having weed. \n\nIf i\u2019m not actively watching him, he never blows it out the window.  How do i get him to do so?\n\nEdit: i should have been more clear, i ask him to do so all the time",

It's so not worth you getting in trouble because depending on the location schools take this type of thing pretty seriously (am a former RA)",

And trust me I get it, I had roommates doing the same thing and it made me so angry because in order to cover up the smell they then decided to purposely burn something on the stove which then gave me an asthma attack. Ugh. But at the time I was interviewing to become an RA and it could've seriously gotten me into trouble- if someone else reports you guys for having weed then he could easily say that it's yours. So he can either listen to you or get reported honestly. Or maybe you could just request a new roommate??",

Blow the smoke through the open end of the sploof.",
