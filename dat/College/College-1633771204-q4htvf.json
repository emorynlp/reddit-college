  "text": "This is my sixth year in university finishing up my bachelors in Business econ and and I definitely am getting senioritis. \n\nSome background: I just got terminated from my job but, I have enough savings to cover my housing, car, insurance, food, and still with a little extra to splurge; for virtually my entire time in school I was working 50+ hours. Currently, I am taking this opportunity to just be a student.    \n\n\nYet, I feel extremely overwhelmed with the course work, I am taking 4 upper division classes and getting more involved with my school.  Which feels extremely odd since, I have had more on my plate before yet never felt this mentally drained. While I am lowkey blaming the change in weather, I am not sure why I feel so overwhelmed.   \n \n\nAnyone else feel this way?",

      "text": "Weather changes are real and so are my headaches that come with them. I just got a watch with a barometer on it and holy god. I can explain 75% of my headaches with that thing. \n\nStart eating better! It was a huge step for me that improved my day to day. I'm not sure what will work for you but eliminating processed food and fast food will do wonders. Whole foods are absolutely the best for you. In the end it saves you money too. I somehow ended up being vegetarian and it's stuck for the better part of a decade now. \n\nMake sure you're getting sleep. At least 8 hours. None of this 7 hours is enough bull shit.",

              "text": "Go to bed at the same time and wake at the same time. Stick to it very strictly. If you end up staying late on the weekend, try to wake at the same time. If you wake up late one day, go to bed at the same time. Rinse and repeat. \n\nAfter a decade being institutionalized by the first shift work force, I'm stuck going to bed around 10 and waking at 6-7. It works for me. \n\nI don't give a shit what anybody says on here but the whole being productive at night is horse shit. Be productive during the day. That's how the world works. Convincing yourself to lose sleep because you seem more productive at night is silly as shit. If that's the case, you need to learn to be productive during the day. Otherwise, it'll catch up to you hard when you have to get a job out of college. Then it'll be a month or two of trying to catch up which will obviously show to your new employer in your performance because you're a zombie. Nothing like a good impression.",

Easier said than done I know.\n\nAnyway good luck",
