Even with professors I hate, I always try to ask them something after class. Don't do it every class tho cause you'll look like ur trying too hard, but at least once a week try to ask them something you found interesting from the class. It shows that you are determined and are interested in the topic, and professors might give you extra points at the end of the year. \n\nJust try to act enthusiastic inside the classroom even if you don't care about the topic. Even just participating once a day shows u care. \n\nI hope this helps!",

Lessening the dread is the goal, if you start there you can make real progress and see the happier aspects of life. But don't expect any of it to be sunshine and flowers. Coming to terms with that reality can be a lot more fruitful than any pill or breathing excersize. \nJust make sure you get a pet soon or a real responsibility. My pets have kept me around longer than I thought my will would let me. It might sound dumb, but some one needs to feed those damn cats and ill be damned if they suffer in the slightest.

I tried therapy a few times and spent a very long time with therapists who weren\u2019t the right for me and gave up. \n\nI waited way too long to try again, but I did and found someone who really helped me.

      "text": "Do school part time or take one hard class and then 2 easy classes. I\u2019m returning to school as an older student who went to school in LA for film, had a blast, my professors either were relevant working represented professionals or amazing, caring transplants. I\u2019m going back to school now for allied health and I was certainly in the pits last year. \n\nI notice the more \u201crealistic\u201d the major the worst the college experience. STEM students, med students, nursing students, some law students even are incredibly depressed. The English majors, theater majors, creative writing, history majors, film majors etc had great, life enriching experiences in college but they may not be employable! I worked 5-6 years in the industry because of proximity. I would never reccomend an artistic major of any kind in an area with no industry. I\u2019m really happy I did the \u201cBS\u201d major in my youth, and now doing the hard one when I don\u2019t care about \u201cstudent life\u201d. It\u2019s all strictly to feed me and pay bills. Not feed my soul. School is the most soul sucking aspect of my life right now. So I would NOT tell anyone to go to school full time for hard science majors, especially if you work. There\u2019s no joy or meaning in what is in the science curriculum so you MUST have that in your personal life. This is the same with the workforce. As much fun I had playing and working in Entertainment, there were certain aspects such as finances and politics that can majorly put a damper on your passions. Art and business are two different vibrations especially when you are working positions where you are in control of neither. Then it feels like just another corporate job. Infact most camera men told me their job was just another corporate job lol. So learn how to balance your life and where your personal work hour limits are at. Some people can graduate in 4 years with a BA, some need 6-8 years. Work on interesting things, build your resume, Build your social network with people who share your values and interests and go to school part time. Lower your expenses. Build a full life. College has never done that for people.",

If you do need to show a transcript for something, this past year was a global pandemic--that's a valid reason for any of us going off the rails / not finishing classes.\n\nAlso: your grades do not define you as a person or reflect anything about your worth in the world.\n\nMoving forward, look into whether your university has a grade replacement policy (for retaking the classes), or an emergency / hardship withdrawal policy (that allows retroactive withdrawals); these are admin/ paperwork type items you may be able to advantage of.\n\nYou can always take a term off, or just take less classes next term. Or, you could consider moving over to a community college to cut costs. \n\nJust remember: a linear path to a degree is not necessary, and, frankly, the idea that a linear path is \"normal\" is a myth.",

If you change your habits and strategies, you can move forward and do better.  Work the problems.\n\n\nOr drop out until you are in a better position to do the above.\n\nGet a job.  Asking if you want fries with that wonderfully concentrates the mind.  Or you might find a job you truly like and can support you and then you win, becasue you are happy.\n\nThe only option that WONT work and has never worked is to think that anything is going to be different is you do exactly the same things over again",
