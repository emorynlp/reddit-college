  "text": "Most of the times students lose marks or are depicted to have plagiarized their work because of poor referencing. How can a student overcome this? First, there is need to look up for quality sources and open them in different tabs before you start writing. Secondly look at the most suitable sources and ensure you reference as you progress in your writing; you can use word in-built referencing or other referencing sites. Finally review your references and create a reference list (bibliography). Happy writing fellas",
