  "text": "I want to know in short terms am I fucked. I was in a group home through freshman year high school but had good grades on online school. Came back to town, mostly bad grades and a lot of absences / some trouble for the rest of high school but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been suspended or expelled from any high school I went to. No felony\u2019s on my record. I am now in my senior year people around me are applying for colleges, should I even bother or does any of this disqualify me ?",

      "text": "Hard to determine without knowing your GPA. If you have a very low GPA with poor SAT/ACT scores (assuming you took them), and little to no extracurriculars, a four-year institute may be difficult to get into. \n\nHowever, you can always apply to community college. Many require a minimum GPA of 2.0. This will allow you to start with a clean slate so you can eventually transfer. I recommend community college too because it will ultimately be cheaper than a four-year.",
