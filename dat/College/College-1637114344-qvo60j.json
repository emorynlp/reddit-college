It's just a step forward and this along with other credentials as a whole is what makes a difference. \n\nMy suggestion is don't over analyze for the tiny difference in those two labels",

              "text": "In my university, many programs can be done as BA or BSc. I did BSc because all the students said it's better and more prestigious. Then when I started applying for jobs and mentioned BSc is more scientific, which makes me a better candidate, they literally laughed at me. \n\nIn some people's minds it might be different though! So if you meet someone with a different opinion, I think it's okay to let them be. \ud83d\ude02",
