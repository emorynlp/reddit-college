  "text": "I'm currently a first semester sophomore and ever since the start of college, I've been failing my classes ( Cs and Ds, no Bs, and definitely no As). I've gone through so many majors that I've lost count and I just feel pathetic. I wasn't a bad student in high school and I came to college with a plan, but that plan changed again and again and again and again. Even after taking classes I actually liked and put an effort into this semester, after calculating my scores for my classes I'll still end this semester with a 2.5 gpa AT MOST, which will tank my cumulative gpa even more. I'm changing my major to finance (people say it's easier and all the business majors I've met love it, and actually enjoy college more and still get good jobs so) just to pick something at this point and to try to finish college. I'm halfway through so I really don't want to leave but I really feel like I have no plan or purpose or worth here. I go to a shit public school so I know I won't work on Wall Street or anything but it'll at least get me a job out of college right? Does anyone know if a 3.5 will be good enough for most finance jobs at least? Any tips on how to improve? Should I just leave? Did anyone drop out of college, go to trade, and still make money/succeed? I'm a female (don't know if that really matters) and would really appreciate any advice and tips from anyone willing to respond.",

      "text": "Hi, a sophomore who\u00b4s becoming a junior here! My first year completely sucked. I was in the top 10 of my generation back in high school, but college still kicked my butt. I wasn\u00b4t used to failing, and it felt like the world was ending. I also thought about changing majors to something I was more passionate about. I talked about my tutor, I think I was expecting her to stop me or something, but she just told me to do whatever I wanted. That shocked me. I didn\u00b4t want to \"lose the battle\" and feel like I had given up, especially because I did like my major and I couldn't accept not being smart enough to pass my finals. I ended up having a hell of an awful summer working and studying for my finals (failed both and had to retake them). But honestly? I'm thankful to myself that I persevered. I might have hated some subjects, but I liked my career choice, so I said fu\\*k everything and tried harder. Good times do come back, as do bad times. The next semester I was tired as hell but I had matured a lot and was able to look at college in a different way. I was better at studying and found renewed motivation. I am smart, and if there's something I want to do, then I can work hard towards it. Now I\u00b4m doing pretty good, just ended my best semester yet. Sure, my accumulative GPA is not the best at all, but in college, that's not the most important thing ever, and little by little it can still be changed. \n\nDo you like what you\u00b4re studying? I think that's the only thing to consider. As long as you choose something that makes you feel comfortable, or even better, excited, then nothing is enough to make you quit. \n\nGood luck pal! I know you\u00b4ll make the best decision for yourself. Reflect on it and don\u00b4t rush, you\u00b4ll do great.",

      "text": "I have a very special message for a very special person. It's for you, OP. You completely failing at college to  the point where you consider dropping out is not a *bad* thing. It's a *good* thing. Why? Because you get to learn a valuable lesson about hard work, now you understand that things won't be given to you in life, and that you will have to apply yourself to achieve your dreams. When you watch your friends graduate, move into well paying jobs, build their lives, while you sit without a college degree, you're going to feel like a nobody! A nothing! A LOSER!!! But you're not a nobody! You're a somebody :) and people still like you even if you did fail at school! I hoped this message helped *you* like *you*.",

I see my old friends making good fucking money and having SO/house/kids/nice car etc and wow, does it absolutely make me feel like a fucking loser. I busted my ass at bullshit jobs with little pay for several years and I have nothing to show for. Don\u2019t drop out unless you have a GOOD plan bro. Getting sucked into jobs in the service and retail industries is soul crushing bro, it really is.",

Accounting is the only thing I anticipate being an issue, it\u2019s kind of difficult. And if a 2.5 will rank your GPA, you\u2019re doing more than fine. The average gpa is close to 3.0.",
