  "text": "I am an absolutely abysmal test taker. No matter what I do I just seem to absolutely bomb every test I take no matter how prepared I am. While I'm not a genius, I believe I understand the material in most classes pretty well. I've actually consistently helped many classmates who end up doing better than me because I can't write a test to save my life. In fact, I just bombed a final worth 40% of my grade whereas in the rest of the class I had a 94%. I feel completely hopeless. I really want to go to grad school but with my current grades that won't be possible.",
