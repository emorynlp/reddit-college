  "title:": "I don't want to feel this way but some students talk too much during classes. I understand this is a political science class so we need people giving their opinions but I'm so used to teachers teaching, discussing with students and leaving the class that I feel angry at my classmates for talking.",
  "text": "I'm just getting angry with so many of my classmates. Everything flies over my head. They speak so beautifully with big words and seem like they have no anxiety but I could never do that. I just want the teacher to follow the syllabus, conduct some debates and get done with it. The prof may ask a question and those particular 3 or 4 students will go on and on speaking and will deviate from the topic (everyone is literally repeating the same point) and literally nothing is covered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have always been a weak student but thought through participating in classes and studying on time I'll be able to improve but they are making me hate my subjects. I won't actually tell them hateful words but I just cannot stand them and it has been only 4 days of online classes. I am participating in on-campus stuff and enjoying things so I can take my mind off but I feel really dumb when I listen to them. I feel lesser than them and I hate it.",

      "text": "It seems that this is more of an insecurity issue with yourself than it has to do with you disliking student's participation. \n\nIt's a class that needs discussion, and it's wonderful that your professor opens it up for discussion. If you participate, you will learn more (maybe not regarding the content of the class, but you will certainly learn). \n\nYou are probably not the only student who feels this way. If you're at the same university as them and in the same class as them, you are not much different at all. The ones who speak are the ones who feel qualified to do so. Not everyone will participate in the discussions (just like you).",

      "text": "I'm terrible at participating too because of severe social anxiety. I always try to work up the nerve to talk and it almost never works.\n\n I know people say participation helps you learn more but it feels like the opposite. My brain is so hyper focused on being called on. Then if I get called on, my anxiety gets so severe that my mind only focuses on what I said or how stupid I look that i completely tune out the professor's answers or other students input. I always walk away from a discussion not remembering anything that was said and that never happens to me after a lecture! \n\nI also have extremely slow processing speed. Even when I want to participate, it takes me a while to think of something and then other students steal the answer. \n\nI feel you",
