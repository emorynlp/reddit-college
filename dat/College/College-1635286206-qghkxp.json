      "text": "As a ChemE undergrad, I was on campus from 8-6 almost every week day. I average 4-5 hours of class or work on those days, so I'd guess 5-6 hrs, but that was with a study group so there were breaks for chatting and eating lunch along the way. And I hardly had to do homework outside of these hours, or on the weekends.",

I had a core study group and we were usually in 9-12 credits of engineering together, so my one GE class I may have had to do at night or on weekends, but compared to the relentless pace of homework assignments and tests, an occasional reading or one page writing assignment for a history class felt like a breeze.",

In the evenings I probably can do about one to three hours of good studying. I take Friday evening off (unless I really have that much work, which is rare). On the weekend I probably do about 5 hours each day. I also probably procrastinate a bit to much (or at least this semester hahaha).",
