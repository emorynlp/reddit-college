  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently getting my associates in science at a community college. I am doing a full semester workload and working full time. One of my professors is extremely demanding; lots of busy work, requires we take a quiz and write a paragraph analyzing our performance on EVERY assignment we complete, we are assigned 55 assignments to complete over 2 weeks...at least 22 of them take an hour or more to complete. Anyways... the first week of class we were expected to pay $5 to rent a movie to watch for an assignment. Now, over a month later we have 4 assignments that ask for direct quotes and examples from this movie. I obviously barely remember anything other than the plot/ending but cannot afford another $5 for said movie nor do I have another 2 hours and 40 minutes to watch movie  in addition to coursework for this class and my others, work full time, and get even 6 hours of sleep a night. Is my professor asking too much of us? If so, how can I broach this with her? Everytime I've reached out she told me to meet with a tutor(my issue has been not having enough time to complete all her tedious work) or that using breathing techniques will allow me to do better in this class....",

Other than that I've got 15 days until finals so just going to push through and accept my first/only C in a class and take professor reviews more seriously in future. Will reach out to counselor but doubt that will do much of anything. Bummed that a simple humanities class is going to bring down my 4.0 but sacrificing sleep to give her ridiculous amount of tedious assignments enough time to complete to her standards just isn't worth it.",

I'd set a 30 minute clock to do a stream of consciousness reflection for each topic, and do multiple in a row. Then take the quizzes. Then edit and submit the reflections, adding words from the quiz. Is it 55 assignments in 2 weeks plus reflections plus quizzes? Or is it 55 assignments including essays and quizzes. If each is an hour, I'd say this is a lot, especially at a first or second year undergrad class. I doubt there's anything you can say that will matter. Professors get a ton of discretion. Maybe join a class group me and see if everyone is having same issue. If they're dropping 10 minute paragraphs for full points and passing quizzes by reading the power points, they may be discussing this and save you a ton of time.",

I do tend to overdo assignments in order to be thorough and notice I put more effort in than my classmates so perhaps I need to tone it down.

It does feel like a lot in comparison to other classes, even physical geology and environmental biology were less demanding than this humanities class. Unfortunately professor doesn't put out power points, just hour+ videos discussing the module. I've been watching them at 1.5x speed to save some time.

At this point I'm just going to throw whatever I can find in there regardless of how well it fits topic/answers question. \nAm curious of ways around renting fee, I didn't find it at my local library or at school library. Would welcome other ideas! But also have resigned to the fact that this class is a doozy and will give her the bare minimum just to finish the class.",

So a 3 unit class would have 3 x (2 or 3) = 6 - 9 hours of work per week. If they are assigning for more work than that you can 1. Bring it up to her department chair. 2. Give her a terrible review at the term end assessment and clearly give your reasoning.",
