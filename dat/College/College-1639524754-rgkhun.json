  "text": "Hi. I am a Junior in high school hopefully doing a foreign exchange year in Germany for my senior year since I am technically done high school this year. I have always wanted to and never thought it would be a possibility until now. \n\nAnyway, I have been looking into going to a business school overseas if I enjoy my exchange year. After doing some research I found this EU Business School - https://www.euruni.edu - has anyone else seen this school or possibly attended it? If so would you recommend going or do you have any input on this school?\n\nI have the same questions for Hult International Business School. Although I haven\u2019t looked into this school a lot. A classmate just recently told me about it. \n\nI would love to hear any input or advice. I really would like to study somewhere in Europe and to travel so if anyone has any advice or suggestions for other schools to look into would be greatly appreciate it!\n\nThanks so much:)",
