  "text": "I can't. I hate it. Every time I sit down to do it, I end up taking a nap or just doing something else, like write a reddit post. Does that mean I'm not passionate about my major/career path? Everytime someone asks me about nursing, I just feel dread because I know I'm not going to know things - so I try to avoid the topic of nursing altogether. I don't feel excited, just dread. But it's what I've wanted to do for so so long, I can't even see myself doing anything else. Am I just lazy, or is this not the major for me?",

      "text": "Like other commenters mentioned, nursing *may* just not be right for you. \n\nBut your issues around studying seem very similar to mine, and I almost have my degree, so I\u2019ll share what I\u2019ve learned so far:\n\nStep 1) It helps to understand exactly why you don\u2019t want to get work done, and then we use this understanding to develop techniques to stay productive. Is it because there\u2019s so much work ahead of you that you\u2019re dreading it? Are you not understanding the material? To be fair, the age of the internet has conditioned our brains to seek instant gratification. Do you just find it hard to complete work in general? A lot of people are able to coast by in high school putting in minimal work, but encounter trouble when they are hit with the workload of college. Do some internal searching to find out why you have trouble starting studying.\n\nStep 2) Set yourself up for success. This one is easier said than done, but you can do it. Make sure you\u2019re giving yourself enough time in the day to get done what needs to get done. And start at a reasonable hour; when you feel your most energetic and productive. Make sure there are no distractions around you too; turn on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d on your phone. \n\nStep 3) Get organized. Staying organized is how we visualize the work we need to get done. If you don\u2019t have one already, buy a planner and use it to jot down every date for things that are due. You can even use it to plan your days out; when you\u2019ll do what. \n\nStep 4) Know when to take breaks in your studying. There are tons of \u201cproductivity timers\u201d on the App Store. Set a timer for how long you can think you can concentrate, then take a short break to satisfy yourself. (But be mindful not to let a 10 minute break turn into an hour of watching YouTube) What works for me is a 10 minute break every 45 minutes.\n\nStep 5) place goals and reward yourself! What\u2019s something you want to buy for yourself? Set a specific and measurable goal, such as getting a good grade or finishing a large project. Bigger rewards are for bigger accomplishments, but it\u2019s important to still commend yourself for the small victories too. \n\nStep 6) learn how to motivate yourself. What inspires you about becoming a nurse? Why do you want it? Surely, it\u2019ll bring you happiness, right? We all want to feel good about doing our best, the problem is we aren\u2019t always willing to put the work in. Remember, it\u2019s not about passing your next class as much as it is about what you truly want in life. Think big picture. Formulate steps to get there. \n\nThat\u2019s all I got. One last thing \u2014 don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. We can\u2019t be at our best all the time. But, with practice, you\u2019ll find that your best will come more often. \n\nGood luck.",

In shirt, the urge to slack off. \n\nAgain, I'll make a better post on this in a few hours.",
