  "text": "Hello, I\u2019m towards the end of my 2nd year in college. I\u2019m an okay student but I have some classes I could\u2019ve done better in and barely passed. This term I\u2019m doing badly in because I thought I\u2019d be fine but pandemic has brought a lot of issues into my life. I\u2019m worried about my gpa and getting into master\u2019s in the future\u2026 I feel like giving up because I\u2019ve messed up on my grades. Am I being dramatic or is there still time for me to fix up? Is retaking classes worth it? Thanks.",
