  "text": "Before I talk about it, I'm James Charles Taylor. I'm a student in the Philippines, studying at Mapua University in a 3-year Bachelor's Degree (Science) program in Information Technology.\n\nI know I have to work hard, despite a notice on a four-day period cancelling meetings and exams in observation of my university's Christmas celebration. But, there is this lingering feeling that I would feel worthless if I fall behind.  I feel it might either be getting a bit too difficult or that I want to move to studying in the United States instead.\n\nI might be the sort of person who needs hope.",
