My boyfriend bought a bunch of books (to keep for himself) that he later looked up on amazon. $6 worth of books he bought are going for a combined price of over $1k online because they're out of print and rare. You just have to know what you're looking for, I guess.\n\nYou can also do amazon flex, in a similar way to doordash. From what I hear it pays well ($18/ hour, upwards of $25 during holidays). I'm pretty sure you can pick up shifts that range from 1-4 or 6 hours.\n\nThere are also apps like Wag or Rover that pay you to walk dogs. I did it a couple years ago and it was fun. It helps if you can do it in a wealthier area, but I still get emails from them saying that there is a dire need for dog walkers in my area haha. \n\nI know instacart is great in wealthier areas as well, a lady once tipped me $50 to bring her groceries to her mansion. The only issue is that you're not guaranteed any calls when you sign up for shifts at the beginning of each week, but  with people more reliant on having stuff delivered I'm not sure how often that happens nowadays. \n\nSomething else I did a couple years ago was I posted on nextdoor saying that I was looking for caretaking and odd jobs. I ended up working full time hours for a summer babysitting, housesitting, chilling with dogs, doing yard work, I even helped this lady organize her stuff.",

              "text": "As another user said, you can take a test at rev.com and get started pretty much right away if you pass it. Bear in mind, though, that they check every file and they're very strict, so if you're new to transcribing you might not last long. I work for transcribeme.com and they're much nicer, but it'll take you a while to start earning decent money with them because they have several levels of tests (unpaid) that you need to pass before you can start on the files with a higher audio hour rate.\n\nMy advice would be to start on Rev and make as much cash as you can there while trying to pass the tests at transcribeme. It is a longer process with transcribeme but once you're in, you're in. Of course, you might do well on Rev as well and then you've got two services you can use, which is always good because there's not always a lot of work available.\n\nGood luck. :)",

Don't market yourself like you are a sale person but like someone who wants to help others thrive.  Also, I get a lot work due to my bilingual skills (Spanish and English) which is pretty helpful.",

It\u2019s hard work, it\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s a choice that usually permeates into your relationships and career for the rest of your life. If you accept all that, then by all means go for it. But back when I\u2019d just turned 18, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to comprehend the gravity of those consequences. I doubt too many undergraduate students could either (though of course there are exceptions, which I 100% respect).",

The pay is usually pretty good for hourly work, the hours and company culture are usually manageable, and in my experience the co-workers are chill and happy to have extra help. And the physicallity of the job can help you get into shape if you need to.",

Heck, eat a good amount in general.\n\nThe water makes your veins bigger (easier to insert the needle). If your veins (specifically the ones near your elbow) are small (like mine), they'll have to do multiple tries to get the needle in, it can cause swelling/bruising, and if they're unsuccessful they'll have to move to the second arm, and *it's a big needle and it hurts*. \n\nFor the iron/red meat, they check your hematocrit (% of red blood cells in total blood volume) each time, because it needs to be above a certain % for them to legally draw blood. If it's too low, they turn you away after you've spent maybe 15 minutes already going through the regular test. So make sure you eat a big dinner the night before and a good breakfast the day of!",
