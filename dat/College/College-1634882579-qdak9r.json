  "text": "My grade in the class is 103% and a weighted total of 200 something percent on blackboard. I assume this is a glitch and I emailed my professor about it. While she did wish me luck and thanked me for bringing this to her attention, she didn't say anything about fixing it. \n\nDoes this sound like a genuine glitch or not to you? Because I did get a few bad grades on some quizzes but great grades in others. So it must be a glitch. But her reaction to my email and how she didn't say anything about fixing it is a little weird.",

Getting above 100% in a class happens in a few different ways\n-dropped quizzes\n-extra credit\n-etc.\n\nIt\u2019s cool you brought it up to your prof. Keep a copy of the email but I doubt you\u2019ll get in trouble",

I added 100 points to the available points section and assuming I get 0% on the final, I would complete the course with a 95%. I just used two different figures here so considering I'm bad at math, I don't know which one is correct. \n\nGood news is, if this glitch isn't fixed, I still pass the course no matter what.",
