  "title:": "Photoshop on a recommendation letter?",
  "text": "So... my recommender just told me that he made a minor mistake on the letter, he mistyped his email address by one letter, but he is traveling outside of the school and having a hard time having the paper with the school logo to print on. He had agreed to share a copy of the recommendation letter with me. However, I have a deadline approaching, I wonder if I can do a little photoshop on the letter(it really is just one letter on the email address). should I wait till he fixes the mistake and miss the first round deadline or should I just tell him to submit the version with the wrong email address or should I photoshop it off?  Pls help!",

If so, then ask his permission and then do it. (I recently had a prof forget to date his signature next to a form, so I asked him if it was okay for me to add that.)",
