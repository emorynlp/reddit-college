  "text": "I have four finals next week\u2014two math and two statistics finals. I'm not that stressed because my study plan is going smoothly.  The only thing is that I haven't been able to sleep well since Sunday, and it has been affecting my ability to function throughout the day. I'm so tired, and I'm just trying my best to study. I've been having tension headaches too because I can't sleep.",

Just make sure you don\u2019t make a chronic habit of it as you\u2019ll build a tolerance and worsen your sleep long term.",
