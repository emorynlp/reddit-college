      "text": "You're literally asking the *internet* for help. \n\nYou need to get your ass in gear. A single credit hour is like 600 dollars. You can do math but being at college isn't cheap. If you bomb 6 credit hours worth of classes, you've literally taken 3600 dollars and got NO value out of it. You know how far 3600 bucks goes?\n\nTake a semester off and either work or try to get a job. Nothing will cure your educational burn out more than endless work burnout. You don't graduate from those jobs. You work them until you're too broke to work them.",
