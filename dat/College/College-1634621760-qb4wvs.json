I'm terrible with math and accounting I think you only need calc 1?\n\nAccounting is my backup if CS doesn't work out. Plus you get certified while pursuing your degree and you get to work in an accounting firm. The downside is all the state and federal laws you'll have to learn and anything else the field requires. A buddy of mine got an accounting degree and became an auditor and is making 200k a year after working his way up in the company. And another one became a cpa and after a few years started his own firm and makes a good deal of money as well. \n\nMedicine, Food, Money and Tech are fields you'll have a guaranteed job in almost any country in the world. And since we can't live without them then that comes with job security and demand.",

      "text": "Both are able to land you a job, but however accounting would be easier to rather than CS.\n\nCS is a growing field, with tons of jobs and great pay. However, a CS degree doesn't ultimately by itself give you a job right out of college. You have to do self-made projects, internships, and pass the coding interviews. You gotta make yourself look like you do know what you are doing, since you'll be competing with other people. A CS degree teaches you the theoretical side of how computers work, but it's not as practical as Accounting\n\nAn Accounting degree on the other hand is different. Internships are a plus, but however you can get a job fairly quickly after graduation, as there are many, many jobs in the field. They don't pay as much as CS degrees do, but the pay is still really good. Now you can go the extra mile and be a CPA (Certified Public Accountant), but the exams will be very difficult. There are 4 in total, but you can get a pay increase if you even pass one of the tests. Passing all 4 will make you a CPA and you'll make like 200k+ a year. \n\nIf you still don't know, meet the middle ground and go for a Computer Information Systems degree. It's a combination of Business and CS, and it's known by some people as the \"Jack of all Trades\" because you can get a job in both fields (Business and Technology). Pay is good, job prospects are good because you can get a job in business or a job in Technology. However, there are different names for this degree (Management Information Systems, Computer Information Systems, Information Systems) but they all have the same focus.\n\nManagement Information Systems (MIS) is more focused on the business side of things\n\nComputer Information Systems (CIS) is more focused on the computer side of things\n\nInformation Systems (IS) same as CIS, or even a equal amount of the 2. \n\nHere's a video for Accounting:\nhttps://youtu.be/06DH-8QM6D0\n\nHere's a video for CS:\nhttps://youtu.be/c-41IY0bOGU\n\nHere's a video for MIS/CIS:\nhttps://youtu.be/EMGvP6hav_U\n\nHope this helps!

              "text": "Yes, it's does. However getting a job right after graduation isn't going to be enough. Cause a CS degree teaches you theoretical things, like how a computer works, but it doesn't actually prepare you. You actually have to find internships and do projects to make yourself look like you actually know what you're doing. Otherwise, it'll be a little difficult finding one. If you can handle math classes past Calc 1, physics classes, long class schedules and tons of stress, go for CS\n\nAccounting actually prepares you, because what you learn in accounting is applied towards the real world. However, I hear that it's somewhat tough finding a job too, but not as much as CS. Accounting is actually a hard degree to study believe it or not. It won't be too math based. You'd usually just do Calc 1 and Statistics I think. But however you'll have to go through Accounting's math, which although uses only the basics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), how it's applied is difficult\n\nSo yea, CS has the upper hand in terms of jobs, demand, and outlook, but Accounting's jobs, demand, and outlook is growing too, because business is literally everywhere lol. In the end, they're actually both one of the hardest degrees to study believe it or not.\n\nIf you have questions, don't be afraid to ask! :)",

Thank You. =)\n\nYes when I do job search and type in \"computer science\" \"software developer\" it gets quite more hit in (CAD/US) job market) than \"accountant\" or \"accounting\" \n\nIt seems you earn more money in computer science in begging at 5-10 year into a career. Accounting seems lower pay and pay only increases once you get your CPA. Otherwise without CPA the first 1-6 years is quite low pay and lot of hours and work-life balance in public accounting is quite bad. \n\nAnd with computer science yes you have to keep learning and up to date on the new things but looks like a job are increasing at a crazy rate and I don't know in future if this will continue with the automation wave and accounting (especially Non-CPA low-level accounting is on the hit list to be automated. I have an interest in both. Which of the two has empirically more jobs, more demand and options if you get the Cs or accounting degree?",

But for job security as in being able to keep your job in the long run, CS is the way to go. \n\nAccounting pay isn't as high as CS with a CPA, but however, it's better than the average, for Accounting majors make 60k to 70k a year without a CPA, which isn't bad, but if you want to work in a cubicle most of your time, then go for it.\n\nCS has more jobs and options than Accounting, but with accounting you'll be able to find a job with options too. Basically, they're both versatile and in demand, but between the two, CS is the winner. CS get paid 60k to 80k in the beginning, and will increase overtime. You do however, gotta show in the interview that you got what it takes. You have to get internships during your time in college, and you also have to make self projects to prove you know what you're doing.\n\nJust major in CIS/MIS/IS. Since you have an interest in both, a MIS/CIS major would be a good choice. With this degree you can learn business classes like accounting, finance, AND learn CS classes like software development, databases, programming, etc. With a CIS/MIS degree, you'll be able to actually get a job in the business field or the technology field.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for more questions! :)",
