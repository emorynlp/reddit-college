  "text": "Hi all! Is it a usual occurrence for RAs to go into your room during winter break? I'm sure this varies by college, but I'm curious to see how many people also have to deal with this.\n\nReally not in love with the idea of strangers going into my room while I'm gone to \"make sure things are unplugged\" .....",

Besides checking unplugged they make sure there isnt trash, food that can expire, and any weird smells. They aren't gonna dig through your underwear drawer or anything. Your college might be different though.",

We want to go home too and we can't do that until we make sure the building is empty. We aren't searching your room for tiny things. We just quickly look for those 3 things (in your case that everything is unplugged too) and then leaving.",

      "text": "FWIW, unplugging stuff is done because it is a serious fire hazard if not done. As others mentioned it is also to make sure windows are closed, but also to make sure your heater is not off (which can cause burst pipes), too high (fire risk again), or has anything on or too close to it (again, fire hazard).\n\nAt my university we did all of this proactively at the end of the semester, basically you had to check out before you could leave, and if you didn't it was something like a $250 fine.\n\nYou should also unplug, defrost, and clean your fridge out because no one will be there to clear it out if the power goes, and you could very realistically come back to a fridge full of rotting stuff or mold.",
