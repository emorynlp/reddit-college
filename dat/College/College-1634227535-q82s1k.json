      "text": "I can\u2019t speak to marketing but I can speak to accounting.\n\nIt\u2019s a great major in my opinion. Classes are challenging but they aren\u2019t too hard. Put in the work and PRACTICE you\u2019ll be golden. There are so many job prospects out of college. Accounting is never going away. A lot of it is changing to AI, but the need for accountants is still there. If you want to make decent money in accounting, you\u2019ll need to obtain 150 credits (so a Bach degree + 30 extra credits) and pass 4 sections of the CPA exam. The exam is hard and time consuming. 50% passing rate. Although depending on how many college credits you have and when you complete schooling, you might be taking a different CPA exam because it is changing in 2024. You can also get your CMA, still have to go through accounting curriculum but a different test. More for strategic management. I can\u2019t speak that much on CMA, bc I\u2019m going for my CPA. I can tell you that public accounting sucks, some firms have you pulling 17 hour days during busy season (around january to June APPROX). If you have any other specific questions about accounting PM me! I\u2019d be happy to see if I can answer anything more specific",
