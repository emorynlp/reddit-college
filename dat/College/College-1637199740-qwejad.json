  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in a an University of M\u2026\u2026\u2026. We were supposed to write an essay about a person who has been though Cuban missile crisis and I was supposed to interview a person and then write the essay. But instead I talked to a random person and I didn\u2019t have time so I told him that I\u2019d just write down some stuff and say I interviewed. I put down his name and age on the interview. Now, I turned in the grade and the professor said this sound made and he wants to talk to me next week. I\u2019m scared that professor gonna ask me about that person but I don\u2019t have that person and I don\u2019t even have his contact. Im afraid that the professor will refer me to the dean. I\u2019m planning to withdraw from that class tonight. Is it likely a referral to the dean. Anybody familiar with this? All I care about is the referral. I\u2019m happy to withdraw rn and take the WF grade as I really don\u2019t wanna deal with the dean.",

      "text": "Does your Professor have any reason to be suspicious? Did you copy paste anything? I don\u2019t think you will be referred to the dean, you didn\u2019t do any plagiarism or did any academic integrity violations. Maybe your Professor wants to know more what you did and the questions you asked. I was once told by a professor that he wanted to talk to me, it ended up being so I could give him permission to use my paper as an example for future classes. Relax, don\u2019t panic. A WF will hurt your GPA since it equals the same as an \u201cF\u201d. Wait to see what he wants to talk about and then decide. Also, if you were going to be referred to the dean, you would have already been contacted by the Deans office.",
