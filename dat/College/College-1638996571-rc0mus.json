  "title:": "I think my professor tampered with my grade",
  "text": "Cross posted in r/Advice. \n\nI am a senior in college currently. I will be graduating next Monday. I have a double major in English and Experimental Psychology. \n\nI\u2019m not too sure what to do about this issue. I\u2019ve been taking a Realism class for my English degree. Throughout the entire semester I have maintained an A in the class. \n\nYesterday, I opened my transcript to see a B as my final grade for the class. I immediately emailed my professor and let her know I was showing an A on the class website, but a B on my transcript. My school also offers a B+, so I was confused as to how my grade could drop so drastically on the last day of class. \n\nMy professor emailed me back to let me know she gave me a 70 on participation. I have only missed 3 classes (the allowed amount), and I have turned in all of my work. I also make it a point to speak in every class. I emailed her back asking to have a meeting about how my participation dropped so low. \n\nThe issue I\u2019m having in believing I earned this grade lies in the fact that I received great feedback on each assignment, and I constantly spoke in class. Also, the day before class ended she asked me what my name was when passing out assignments, which makes me believe she hasn\u2019t been writing credit next to my name for my participation throughout the semester. I believe she is trying to manipulate grades to represent a Bell curve (it is common at the college level). \n\nWhile this may seem insignificant, I am trying to graduate with the highest honors due to the fact that I will be applying to a very prestigious graduate program. This one B will pull my GPA down to where I only graduate with Magna Cum Laude. I also have a 4.0 in all of my classes for both majors (math classes are my only Bs, so my major GPAs are both 4.0).\n\nWhat should I do? She has ignored my request for a meeting, so I\u2019m unsure where to go from here. If we do finally meet and she still refuses to change my grade, who can I go to?",

The only thing that a professor ethically can grade on is the grade you earned and if you bring up why you want a high grade, you will look like you are weasling.\n\nSecond, dont mention how you missed the \"allowed\" number of classes, that's likely a max number before you are dropped, not a number to aim for.\n\nYour two strong points are how you advanced class discussions through participation (write down the best that you can remember what you added for each class if you can) AND the fact that your prof. couldnt remember your name so how do they verify parricipation?\n\nThis is the main reason I dont grade on participation anymore. It was such a hassle as a prof. But I hace heard from so many colleagues how they just do participation based on how they recall students participating.\n\nGood luck.",

Also, our policy at my university is that we must be allowed two absences that will not affect our grades. \n\nAlso, what I mean as far as the bell curve, professors curve grades on exams sure, but she is curving the entire semester grade based off of a participation grade, which is subjective.

                      "text": "I understand what you mean about the course grade being curved. Though it is somewhat rare these days some professors do that and most of the time curves are used to shift the grade minimums rather than truly map the grades to a normal distribution (which can hurt students who are performing at high levels). Typically a curve would be communicated to you. \n\nI'm really not sure if you are being curved though or just didn't get your participation grade until the very end. Sounds like the latter, especially if participation was a substantial part of your grade. It would not be weird to have an A in Canvas all semester then upon getting a 70% in participation for that grade to drop down if it is weighed enough. It is not good to provide no indication on participation until the actual grade, but if there were specific guidelines for participation then the prof may have felt that was sufficient. I'm guessing there were no such guidelines. \n\n24 hours is not a lot of time so unless they have a 24-hour response policy in the syllabus I would wait a bit longer. It's a crazy time in the semester for profs too. I would give it at least a couple days.\n\nBy the way, I am not saying you are wrong on any of this but accusing the prof of \"tampering\" with your grade is pretty serious, so I am trying to figure out if there is a more reasonable explanation (even if it may still not be a very fair or nice one). If your online grade is still reported as something and your actual submitted grade is something else then that is grounds for a grade appeal though and I would still think that's the next step for you. Others suggest contacting the chair but I don't think that's really the best strategy, and an appeal likely will pass through the chair anyway.",

I did attempt to file an appeal, but unfortunately could not find the instructions online, so I reached out to the chair.
