  "text": "I'm someone with many talents such as Music (Guitar),  Photography, Arts (portrait and paintings), Graphic Design, PC and tech stuff where I have earned some money doing art commissions / tech repairs.\n\nSo at the last year of Highschool, I've met the world of Finance by internet. There came a point where I mastered the skill of trading crypto where I am earning more than a regular employee in my country. and I am already having my own course! They call me a prodigy in the community. For the past year, there wasn't a single day where I didn't read books or watch videos about trading, I am happy learning more and more about it. \n\nBut I think lowly of myself without going to college, 5 years of my life I aimed to be an Architect / Programmer but a year of exploring the finance world, already happy with what I am doing, I am also happy that I help hundreds of people learn and I can't imagine myself anymore on the dream jobs I wanted.\n\nShould I go to college or should I spend 4 years to focus on what I'm doing?",
