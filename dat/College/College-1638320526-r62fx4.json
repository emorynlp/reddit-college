  "text": "I took my final exam today in Algebra. I made a 66 which isn\u2019t bad... but I figured I would keep The B I had in the Class. I decided to check my final grade not long after...and...and \n\nI had a 79.58 (a B is 80-89 where I live) I am disappointed I missed out on a B by just 0.42 points, not even 1/2 a point. I am now gonna be excluded from any As and Bs list..\n\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e",
