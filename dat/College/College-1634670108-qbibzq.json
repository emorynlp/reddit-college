  "text": "So, today was the first day of my honors philosophy class (a new 8 week block has begun) and the day was going so well too after finishing my first period. \n\nMy professor was giving examples of argument from incredulity (logical fallacy based on one's common sense) and asked the class \"What leads us to think the sun revolves around the earth?\" but what I heard was \"What leads us to think that the earth revolves around the sun?\" and so I respond with \"Because it is what we are taught.\" (How else would we individually learn that the earth revolves around the sun in casual circumstances?).\n\nMy professor pauses and turns towards me before saying \"I hope I did not hear what I just heard.\" A few laughs emerged. While he was repeating the question, I repeat my answer before he finishes but then after hearing it fully I quickly add something along the lines of \"it's because we see the sun set and rise rotating us\" after realizing my mistake.\n\nIt was so quiet after and my anxiety peaked. I'm so embarrassed and had remained stiff the rest of that class period. I need a god damn donut. \n\nPlease comfort me, my cat refuses to console me.",

I also twitch when I get really nervous, which I was at the time for fear of running late, because of my medication so it's 10x weirder in my head).\nThe last time I pass him he goes to sit down at the rounded study booths and watches me as I walk down a few stair steps near the buildings enterance, at the time I was wearing this free people slouchy wide sleeve thermal that had gotten caught on the slim metal pipe railing (it full on went inside of my sleeve like a second arm) which caused me to propel backwards. We didn't break eye contact this entire time. \n\nI appreciate hearing your story for I'm immensly clumsy, in fact I have encounters like this one almost daily and I wish I could at least have looked cute after falling on my ass and being cursed with poor coordination but that couldn't be farther from the truth haha",

I also get embarrassed easily, I told a girl I put my shoes in the washer and she had a weird reaction, and I just felt anxiety that entire week. I wanted to know why it ruined my day so much and I realized that some things are genetic such as me having pcos (getting sugar cravings and easily stressed) as well as being bipolar. Its always good to go to a professional to talk about your stress and anxiety so they can properly help you. I also try to ignore stress sugar cravings and do something else like play video games, excercise, or drawing. You know, something fun to take your mind off it temporarily.  Its important to watch your cortisol levels its a stress hormone that increases sugar levels, thus making you want a donut or a pint of ice cream. Cortisol also makes you gain abdominal fat, so yeah I personally hate cortisol for what it did to my body lol. But the more you read up on stress and anxiety the more you realize its importantance to maintain it, I wish you the best!!",

I have issues with processing audio, I'm pretty sure, and sometimes sentences and words can get blurblated about and I don't process it correctly. It's not fun to mishear, and it's super embarassing, but life goes on.   \n\n\n2) A mental-imagery technique that helps me hold onto memories but also keep them from haunting me until i'm ready to process them (which I suggest you use while in therapy, as I have used this mainly during EMDR when the session is over but hte memory is not processed) is as such: imagine the memory. Imagine the embarrassment you felt, the way it made your heart race, the specific sounds of your classmate's laughter, the incredulousness in your professor's voice, the intonation of his words, everything you possibly can. Now, imagine yourself grabbing that memory with anything you can think of. Encapsulate it in a magical bubble that is impossible to escape. Then SLING that fucker into a box of an appropriate size, seal that box shut. Use magic, rope, locks, chains, anything your imagination can use to lock it up. Seal that lil box shut. Next, imagine a room that you feel these memories would be safe and easy to retrieve. I use the closet in my room at my childhood home, with a mentally added  trapdoor with a ladder + cellar in it. Put that box in that room, shut the door to the room, and lock the door too.  Retrieve when ready to process.\n\nI've had this technique keep memories from bothering me randomly for up to a year so far.",

I am glad I could help. \n\nWhat I meant by that is that you can have an Earth-centered astronomy that aligns with observational data pretty well, but it is going to get mathematically complex really quickly. Our model of the solar system is a fairly straightforward one in which planets, including the earth, orbit the sun on elliptical orbits. \n\nTo have an observationally accurate earth-centered system, you would need something like the Tychonic model (I am on mobile, but here is a link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system?wprov=sfti1) adjusted to have elliptical orbits. You can probably tell, just by looking at it, that the Tychonic model is more complex than the Keplerian system accepted by contemporary astronomy. The math reflects that difference in complexity. To make observational predictions work, you get into some mathematical weeds. \n\nThe Tychonic system also doesn\u2019t fit well with modern physics because we think that we have a pretty good story about why the \u201csolar\u201d system is sun-centered. That story, from what I can tell, has a lot to do with general relativity and facts about how gravity, mass, and space interact. That story just doesn\u2019t really work if you try to use an earth-centered model. \n\nHowever, some folks (and I mean, like, a handful lol) are really committed to an earth-centered approach. Usually for some religious reasons. Regardless of why, they focus on how to make all the math and physics work out. I haven\u2019t cared enough to read those accounts, but they exist. \n\nAnyway, history/philosophy of science can be fun. Don\u2019t let philosophy instructors making jokes get in your head. We usually don\u2019t mean anything by the jokes lol",
