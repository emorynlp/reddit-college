But honestly, I don't know what degree I would do.  \nFilm sounds fun, and I love the history and techniques of film. I really favor animation as a medium.\n\nPeople suggest broadcasting and digital media, but that does not sound like something I'd enjoy.  \nI could do a general degree if that is better in some way? \n\nI mean, I receive aid to get my bachelors. My cost per semester is only a couple hundred. I think film is really interesting...but how useful is it and will it help lead me somewhere?\n\nI dunno; film degree, general degree, other...?",

      "text": "Honestly film, Unless you\u2019re going to a top ivy league school (which even then is questionable) Is one of the worst majors to pick from. If I were you I would think of any valuable skills you have that would be marketable. A general studies degree is another terrible option. That just gives employers that you are a jack of all trades and don\u2019t have one specific skill that would be valuable.",

      "text": "\"Major in something that'll get you a job, minor in something you love.\"\n- Some dude's comment from a YT video\n\nFilm and general studies aren't really good, as they don't have in demand jobs. But if it's something you really want to do, whereas you have a plan for it, then you can. Otherwise just minor in it, or get it as an associates after getting your bachelor's.\n\nHere's a link to a video that might help you find out what major you want. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/X05MTkeDCvo\n\nThis guy is great, cause he reviews majors, tells you which ones are good, which ones are bad. Helps you with personal finance, etc.",
