  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a sophomore in college, and I live on campus. My room comes with a small microwave, refrigerator, freezer, and a sink. These are shared with my roommate. Additionally, our floor has a decent kitchen that is shared by our floor.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been missing cooking my own food and having more of a say in what I eat (rather than using my meal plan, which can get repetitive and sometimes unhealthy). \n\nDoes anyone have any somewhat simple, easy meals/recipes to share? I can go grocery shopping and get additional ingredients if needed, so that isn\u2019t a worry, and I also plan to buy a few things to cook with + Tupperware to store leftovers in.",

      "text": "Soba noodles, miso, ginger, sodium free chicken broth, any leafy vegetable, soy sauce, and chili flakes. It\u2019s a lot easier than it sounds. It only takes me 10 minutes to make it.\n\nBasically you boil the water/chicken broth with the ginger. Then you take a ladle with some hot water and spoon a little bit of miso into it (miso is salty and soy sauce comes later, so don\u2019t be too generous) - mix the miso into the hot water in the ladle until most of the miso dissolves. If you\u2019re lazy, you could just plop the miso into the water and dissolve it that way; it still tastes the same, or at least similar. After the miso dissolves, turn down the stove and put your leafy greens into the pot until they wilt slightly or become tender. Add your noodles and cook until they\u2019re cooked. After the noodles have cooked, transfer everything into a bowl, and feel free to add soy sauce and chili flakes. \n\nAt least, that\u2019s how I\u2019d enjoy it. Sometimes I add fish sauce to the broth, though.",
