  "text": "Hey all, my college has an EMT program and theres 2 different programs. One being certificate and the other being certificate of achievement. I\u2019m confused what the difference is and I plan on asking my advisor but I wanna see if anyone here has an idea \n\nI wonder if there\u2019s any significant difference between the two or if they\u2019re both equally as good\n\nThanks!\n\nThe website says:\n\nThe Certificate course of study consists of 30-36 credits including six credits of General Education courses. Certificate programs are intended for students who wish to enter the workforce in a shorter time than a traditional degree program takes to finish.\n\nThe Certificate of Achievement is for students who want to enhance their career options and enter the workforce at a faster pace.",
