  "text": "Basically the title. Is anyone else having trouble just being healthy consistently? Ever since I came to college I have been constantly getting sick. Like for a few weeks I'm fine and than I'm knocked out with sickness for like another 7-10 days. Granted, its usually just a scratchy throat and my nose but still, it just comes and goes. I consider to take care of myself pretty well. Maybe it's cause one of my suitemates is always fricken sick which means its a roundabout cycle but its frustrating and annoying. Is it just the fact that we were shelter for a good year and a half and the body is just trying to adjust itself? (Will probably call my doctor to ask).  \n\nJust wanted to see if others have had problems with illness (no covid, tested negative).",
