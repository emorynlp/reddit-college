  "text": "I\u2019m a junior and I\u2019m debating on dropping my minor. I\u2019m a psychology major and my minor is human development. I don\u2019t really want to go to grad school, so I\u2019m going to add a second major in consumer affairs to open my career options to business fields. Since I\u2019m unsure exactly of what I\u2019m going to do after college, I\u2019m hesitant to drop the minor just in case it helps me in the future. I\u2019m also only 2 classes away from completing it so I feel like I should stick it out. However, dropping the minor will potentially make my GPA better and give me more time for work experience/ extracurricular activities.\n\nBasically, is a minor related to my major worth the extra stress if I\u2019m close to completing it? (Or should I be ok with the double major?)",
