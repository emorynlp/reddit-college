  "text": "I'm a Junior in a Mechanical Engineering Degree. I would say that I am a good student my GPA is a 3.65. I have taken summer classes to graduate in four years and I really enjoy studying. Unfortunately, this semester I experienced a concussion a couple days before my classes started for the Fall semester. I was experienced some bad symptoms. For the first 2-3 weeks I struggled concentrating and would even screw up basic daily tasks. On top of that I had severe pulsating headaches that made it impossible to concentrate and pain killers didn't help. Later the headaches kind eased out but then I had long lasting mild headaches until just now. They are no longer here leaving me with 4 weeks in the semester.  I started getting stressed as I could not keep up with the workload, the lack of concentration and pain I had made it difficult. I even had a ocular migraine on my first midterm and couldn't see for half the the exam, I failed obviously(I got this because my head injury). I tried getting help but the doctors who accepted our insurance where always booked months out. Now I stand 4 weeks before finals and I am extremely behind. I have been keeping up with assignments and doing my best to do the work but I am no where near mastering material. I just learn how to solve the problems and get by to pass. Before I would always spend time doing homework and mastering the material to the point where I didn't even need to review for finals. My parents and peers are pressuring me to just pass this semester while I want to drop out and retake all these classes again so I have a better understanding and will be a better engineering when I graduate. I don't know if 4 weeks is enough to get a good grasp. For the first time I am beginning to show depressive symptoms because of this situation, I am afraid I will just pass but struggle immensely in the next courses because I am rn taking my first upper division fundamental courses. Any advice would be great help - Thanks",
