  "text": "My roommate has been telling me that I snore, apparently so loudly and powerfully that I wake him up several times throughout the night.  \n\nLet me say, i have **absolutely no history of snoring**.  None at all.  I didn\u2019t snore at camp, i didn\u2019t snore at home, i didn\u2019t snore last year, and when i sleep over at my boyfriends or other friends, they told me after I asked that I don\u2019t snore.  \n\nToday he told me that my snoring woke him up a couple times last night, including at 3 o\u2019 clock, which I know is BS, because **i was still awake then** (and he was fast asleep).   He keeps telling me that he wants to record me while I sleep, which i\u2019m definitely not comfortable with.\n\nWhat the hell am I supposed to do?",

This is such a provable gaslight but just in case they aren\u2019t: turns out I could hear my NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR snoring through the wall to the extent it would keep me up or even wake me sometimes. So it might not be intentional. But yeah, do the app thing. I don\u2019t snore a bit but I use the app for lots of things. Sleep cycle.\n\nETA: if they want to record you from their room I would say go for it if you still haven\u2019t found that you\u2019re snoring, because they could be hearing something else. But no, you are not about to stand in my room and record me. No.",

However, if you\u2019ve never snored before it\u2019s unlikely. I recommend using a sleep sound app like others have suggested. Do NOT let this person record you as you sleep, not only is that creepy, but what does \u201crecording\u201d constitute? Just audio? Video?\n\nYou should tell him that you were awake when he claims you woke him up from your snoring. You should tell him you don\u2019t have a history with snoring and if he has a problem he can find a new dorm. All in the nicest way possible, as he sounds creepy. What kind of prerogative does someone have to lie that someone else is snoring?",

Run it while you sleep, at a high enough volume to drown out any potential snoring noises - because it's a constant sound, it won't wake people up like snoring will; in fact, they usually make it _easier_ to sleep. If he keeps complaining, offer to crank up the volume, or recommend that he similarly run a white noise app/generator (sometimes noise can somewhat selectively penetrate through walls, meaning that [assuming he's in another room] it usually works better to generate your white noise in the same room).\n\nAlso, don't let him record you while you sleep, that's fucking creepy as hell. Who the hell asks to do that?\n\nSource: Used something similar (a particularly loud fan) to help me sleep for over a decade. It definitely works.",

      "text": "Ask if he\u2019s absolutely certain he didn\u2019t just dream up train-tracks level snoring. Or if he woke himself up snoring. \n\nI read in the comments that he uses ear plugs and still hears snoring, somehow. If the snoring was so loud that ear plugs don\u2019t help it wouldn\u2019t just wake him, it would wake the neighbors as well. Trust me. I grew up with a father that snores so loud you could hear him from the next room over. Really sucked for us and the neighbors whenever we had to stay in a hotel.\n\nIf he insists on recording your snoring while you sleep, set down some rules:\n\n1. Absolutely NO cameras\u2014sound only recorders. If he resists tell him he\u2019s being extremely weird and it\u2019s making you uncomfortable. The goal is to capture the sound of snoring, so sound is all that should be required. If you can find an app for this and set your phone by your bed, that would be ideal. \n\n2. Fair\u2019s fair\u2014if you have to do it, he has to do it too. Justify it by saying that if it turns out that it\u2019s not you snoring, you could still find out what the noise is that is waking him up. A recorder next to him as well would be best for capturing whatever sound he claims to be hearing while he sleeps. Again, it could very well be him snoring that wakes himself up (I\u2019ve known loud snorers to do this sometimes), the neighbor\u2019s snoring, or some other sound. And if it is you that is snoring, having the recorder near his bed could help gauge how loud it actually is.\n\n3. Recorders are for nighttime ONLY. Make it clear that you\u2019re uncomfortable with being recorded while you sleep already, so you don\u2019t want to be permanently bugged on top of that.\n\nThat should cover everything. Unfortunately I think having a sound recorder at night is the best way to solve this issue. He\u2019s not going to give up unless he has proof, or finds out what is waking him up at night. If it turns out that either of you snore, try remedies such as sleeping on your side or taking cold medicine if allergies are the cause.",
