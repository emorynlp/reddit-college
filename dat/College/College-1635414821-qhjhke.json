  "text": "I am a third year in accountancy. I had been debarred in my pervious university and still chose accountancy in the next university I enrolled to. I liked the course because it is a challenge and I felt like I can do it and it is very practical since I can know about business, tax, and law. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I had been failing my classes and am having a hard time understanding everything. I am getting tired and I usually wonder if I should wait until everything falls into place or do I make a decision now and leave the course to pursue another course ( which is my passion, fashion design). I am really lost and I feel like I will fail everything by staying here since I already did fail some on my midterm subjects.",
