  "text": "I mean I have a 83% in one class after my first exam (in which I got a 86%). All of my quizzes so far are above 90%. However although I got above a 90% for the first two HW assignments I got a 79% for HW 3 and a 50% for HW 4.  I was wondering if it's still possible to get a A or close to a A.\n\nOverall I only had 2 quizzes and one exam and four HW assignments. According to the syllabus their are a total of 5 quizzes that are worth 20% in total. The first exam is worth 20% and so is the next exam. The final exam is worth 30% and the HW assignments in total are worth 10%. \n\nAs a result I probably have 3 more quizzes, 2 big tests, and a bunch of HW assignments left for this class.\n\nAnother class I have around a 79% and I know it's very possible to get a B, however I'm not sure if I can still bump it up to a A (I think it's unlikely but I'm not sure).",
