  "text": "Because that's where I am now. I have a final exam Friday morning I don't know why, I just can't study. The last 3 days I just didn't have the mental energy for it. I know most of the basics from the content, but I can only half-ass studying. It's almost 7 pm now and I haven't done anything today yet. I want to study but I'm just tired of exams.\n\nThese stupid exams are completely draining me out, I really feel like I'm a zombie.\n\nwhat should I do? send help.",

      "text": "Flash cards are good. Go through them once, pick out the ones you know immediately, pick them out, set aside. The harder ones, rotate more frequently. I am talking handwritten flash cards, not an app. You are far times more likely to remember your handmade flash cards and in your own handwriting. Keep 10 in your back pocket. Rotate them out. Go through them every single moment you have downtown. The subway, grocery line, etc. \n\nThen: topics on one side of the page, fold it over, develop that topic into short essay on the folded side. Flip those back and forth to quiz yourself. You can use the back of the paper up this way as well, without killing trees. \n\nIf it\u2019s a new language, try drawing a picture to represent that idea. Write \u201ctree\u201d (in the target language) on one side of the flash card, draw a tree on the next. Even better for names of family members. Draw a family tree and write in your own names with the titles in the new language.\n\nDefinitely go home and take a short break, then spend at least 1 or 2 hours re-reading and filling in your notes with more detail on the daily. Leave space in your notes day to day or line by line to do that. \n\nMath, make example problems and make yourself pretend to teach them out loud to yourself or a study group. Highlight where you typically get confused or stuck, make up rules or a formula to help you stay on track. Same for grammar. Math is like grammar- and they\u2019re both like following a recipe. Do it enough and it\u2019s second nature. \n\nBest of luck! Don\u2019t forget to sleep and drink plenty of water",

Because I am an online student both programs have been fast paced and have required me to alter the way I study for exams to be able to take weekly tests on 2 chapters per class (in addition to assignments that are due). \nI used to write all the bolded and italicized information in a notebook and then highlighted or added information from accompanying materials (live lectures, power points, assignments, self-assessment quiz etc). By the time I was done with all the weekly work I had a list of information that was likely to be on the exam. I did that for about the first year and got tired of writing that much, so I color-coded word documents with the same info for quick reads before exams. Brought my exam grades up from Bs to As for the most part (a few professors snuck random questions in there on occasion that you had to have memorized the entire chapter to remember). \nI came across quizlet while practicing for my dsst exams and that website has games for common chapters from textbooks that you can use to learn the info with as well.\n \nHang in there and figure out how you can best learn and retain info. The classes get better the higher up you go in course numbers. Early classes are all about memorization and then you get to apply it later.",

As far as studying specifically, take frequent breaks (I usually do 50 min of studying, 10 minute break, then a longer one every few hours, if you can walk away from your desk during these breaks even better), change up your study location, study with/around friends (you don\u2019t have to be collaborating, just being around someone you feel accountable to will keep you a little more focused), keep a variety of snacks/drinks nearby, when your brain starts getting worn out you can \u201cjump start\u201d it with a new sensation, a different flavor of gum, switching to a sports drink from water, some chips and/or nuts. along a similar vein, you can do the same thing with the music you are listening to; I\u2019ve had the most success switching between high energy songs that I know very well, gentle instrumentals and movie or video scores",

Look at them in the elevator, in line, or any time you have a couple of minutes. It's the most efficient study technique I know. Also, while this is probably not instantaneously helpful, a teacher/college grad said that the best thing to do is to read through all of your notes from time to time over the span of the whole semester. Not only does your brain absorb it over this time and you have a better understanding of it, but you won't have to cram at all during finals week. I have tried this, and the results are fantastic.",
