Work, school, family time, health, daily commute, etc. You may realize that you are trying to allocate more time than you actually have in a day. Seriously consider if the places you are spending the most time actually deserve the time you are giving them. Separate in class time, hw/quiz/assignment time, and study time. Make sure that you are dedicating some time to studying every day so you dont forget what you went over in class.\n2. If you are doing a bunch of extracurriculars, consider just focusing on the most important one until you can steady your academics.\n3. Get enough sleep, exercise, eat healthy, and stay hydrated. Sound body, sound mind. \n4. Explore different note taking and study methods. I realized that taking notes DURING class time was more distracting for me than helpful so I just listened, asked and answered questions during class and used outside class time (before the class) to skim over the slides or book and bullet point the most important concepts and equations. Try a study method for a week or two and see how well it works for you, if it doesnt, change it. \n5. Try to find an external source of information that works for you. You professors teaching style might not work for you. See if there is a blog or youtube channel that explains your coursework better than your professor does.",

      "text": "Tips: The first thing is to expect to spend three hours of work per credit hour every week. You might have already been told this, but if not I want to bring it up first because it is crucial for me. If one class is 3 credits, you should be spending around 9 hours every week during that class. Additionally, one of the things that\u2019s helped me is first taking notes from all of the lectures and readings, and then a few days later go back and annotate the notes so that you can ask questions about things you don\u2019t understand or things you want to know more about. After this, go find some sources that answer your questions and add those in to your original notes. One thing that helps me to retain information is to process it in a visual way. Every week I pick one small topic from each class and make the information into a mind map or chart. I save all of these in a binder and it has been LIFE CHANGING. Finally, if you\u2019re just starting your degree program it\u2019s okay to not know everything! I graduate this semester and am only now just realizing the sheer scope of what I have retained. \n\nOh! Save your notes from your degree-specific classes. I\u2019ve saved all of my notes from my classes and since I\u2019m going to grad school I\u2019ve been compiling all of my notes into a big book of foundational knowledge relevant to my field. It\u2019s absolutely surreal how much shit I\u2019ve learned. \n\nGood luck! I hoped that helped!",

      "text": "I am a professor and I sympathize. Things are going to feel fast and the other commenters are absolutely right that you need to put in time outside of class. There also may be university tutors (free!) who can help you figure out how to spend that time. I have many students in your situation, especially during the pandemic. Some of them spend no time at all outside of class working on the material--their only out of class time is on assignments. That's usually a mistake but I sympathize because many students are working part or even full-time jobs. When I went to university I had a library job that let me do homework in the slow moments (which was pretty much every moment), so I was pretty lucky, but I did put in lots and lots of out of class time. I think many of my classmates did as well and maybe that was more of an expectation in the 90s? I also may have had more challenging high school than what my students experience today--hard to tell. In any case it can feel that the deck is stacked against you, but there are steps you can take: 1) talk to professors 2) get a tutor 3) up your study time once you ask your profs and your tutors how to use that time.",

I was probably similar to you, breezed through high school and the first bit of college barely trying, but as topics got more complex, it got harder.\n\nThe other thing I will mention is use all of the resources provided.  If there are TA's, use them.  Go to their office hours, email them for assistance if you don't understand something, that is what they are there for.  When I was a TA, I was always surprised how few students would attend TA office hours (probably at most 10% on any given week, and there was at least 50-60% that I never saw, ever).  Most TA's I worked with in graduate school enjoyed interacting with students and helping, and for me, it was a nice break from the research I was doing and actually interacting with people (and feeling smart again).",

I didn't finish my bachelor degree, and several years later, I transferred to the university I currently attend. I chose the online program instead of in person for several reasons, namely saving on gas and mileage, and neurological conditions I have. What I didn't know is that it's an *accelerated* online program, and there's no condensing. A full 14 week semester every six weeks is way. Too. Much. I used to visit campus every few weeks to touch base with my counselor and use the library, and that helped a lot. It's still closed, but thankfully the coffee shop across the street from my apartment is open now, so that's great for a change of pace when I'm losing my mind.\n\n\nSo yeah...14 weeks' worth of reading, writing, Ted talks, Zoom meetings, lectures, and \"classroom interaction\" in six weeks is completely unrealistic. Honestly, it weren't for student loans and the fact that I'm so close to the end, I'd have dropped out at the start of the pandemic.",

It's just how the whole thing works. I can't give my final in week 3 because students have more time to study then! As a student, your hard weeks are midterm/final time. My hard weeks are the two before the semester starts, where I'm driving myself insane reading a whole semester's worth of material and making enough lesson plans to get myself five-ish weeks down the road. The difference between professors and students is that the profs have had time to get to know the university system and deal with its rhythm, including the unpleasant bits.

Nope, because it's a GenEd class and I have to cover exactly what my department tells me to cover, and my department is full of fossils who haven't taught the class in decades but feel compelled to insist it's the student's fault that they're not working 60 hours/week for a class that isn't relevant to their major which they're missing 2 layers of pre-reqs for and should never have even been allowed to take.\n\nThe best and most general advice: go to office hours and talk to your professor. Ask questions about the material, even \"I don't get it, do you know anything that might help?\". Do a reasonable amount of work outside of class, and try to be really critical about what \"reasonable\" is. \n\nBut if the class is too fast, don't be too hard on yourself. Think about what you could do better (again, be honest with yourself if you aren't working as hard as you should), but try not to feel inadequate about it because there are lots of reasons you might still come up short that have nothing to do with your work ethic or intelligence.",

Burnout is what happens when you have homework due Friday spanning content you've learned since Monday, and then you try to do all the learning and working on Thursday night.\n\nTrust me, spreading it out across the week is the correct method. Not only do you spend *less* time this way, but you learn way faster. Reviewing Monday's lecture on Monday night instead of next week (or worse, right before the test) will ensure that the content is still fresh in your head and will help solidify it.",

You can't use the internet thinking every voice in the room is equal.\n\n>Plenty of students these days have to work \n\nAnd the majority don't. Obviously the advice here isn't one-size-fits-all. Take good advice and mold it to fit your specific situation.\n\n>If college is a full-time job, why doesn't it pay its workers?\n\nAlright... \n\nIf you take college seriously, and I mean really seriously, the impact it will have on your life will be more significant than any wage it could pay you (which is an absurd premise, by the way). I'm a graduate and I would not have had a chance to enter into my industry without college. College not only enabled my career, it taught me how to be studious, how to retain information, how to dedicate myself to a single endeavor, how to allocate my time, how to problem solve, how to manage stress... I think you get the picture.\n\nIf people want to treat college like it's high school and then lament in threads about how college is too tough (no offense to OP), then that's fine. But please understand the man you're speaking to is right. What you get out of college is a direct result of what you put into it. If you're averse to putting in any more effort required than the bare minimum, then expect college to have a bare minimum impact on your life. And if you're going to listen to good advice but ignore it because it sounds elitist, then prepare for all the advice you take to lead you to mediocrity. You can't become anything better than average if you only listening to average people's opinions. I'm not saying that to be mean, I'm saying that because it's true.",

Try to highlight things that make a good short summary of the main topic and make annotations of any questions or things that were confusing. Try to also memorize any key vocab words that are bolded or the topic. This will promote active recall in class and is better in terms of memorizing things. I also like to pretend to teach lessons on the topic after the class or I start flashcards that minute and put them in piles of I know and I don't know. I also write all I know about a topic. So if I have to knoe about the kreb cycle I'll write down everything I know and compare it to my notes. Then I'll add anything I missed or cross out anything I got wrong. If it's a lot of things I'll try to even condense it then into a paragraph or a few sentences.",
