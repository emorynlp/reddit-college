      "text": "I just finished 19 and got all As except for one. I\u2019m doing 22 in the spring. If this your first semester, it\u2019s too many. If you have a handle on being a full time student and want to be taking this many credits, you\u2019ll be fine as long as you have good time management and school is your priority. Your social life will probably suffer, but it might be worth it. If you\u2019re able to, take different sessions so that all your classes aren\u2019t ending at the same time. That many finals and projects all at once would be killer. Try to get ahead by pretending every due date is a day or two before the actual due date.",

If you\u2019re still mostly taking GEs though, you should be fine. \n\nI\u2019ve had 12-credit hour semesters than were harder than 18-credit hour semesters. It totally depends on the classes. So keep that in mind.",

Don\u2019t do it if you have a bunch of other time commitments (e.g., a job, sports, childcare). I think one or two of the classes were fluff also, like chorus or gym, or an English teacher known to be easy.",
