  "text": "So. I\u2019m in my very last semester of college and I\u2019m doing worse than I have ever done, I\u2019ve been able to maintain a decent enough gpa but some things happened to me at the beginning of the summer that led me to a deep depression that I didn\u2019t even realize I was going through (the thing that happened also led to me not being able to receive a merit based stipend I was awarded, for reasons that were completely out of my control and not my fault which hurts even more). Then when school started I had to scramble to get some non academic graduation requirements done, and that was basically all I was doing for the first half of the semester. I would turn in half assed assignments or not turn in any at all, not study for quizzes, in addition I commute a total of 80miles round trip a day and started doing research at another university that\u2019s way better than mine, which just being there made me feel insecure which reflected in my work at that lab\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve started taking medication and am dealing with my anxiety and adhd better and my depression is a lot better now too. Now that my mental health is slowly getting sorted I\u2019m realizing how deep of shit I put myself in, with only 2months left in the semester I have to haul ass and get near perfect scores on everything else to make up for everything. It made me feel like complete shit and today I got my score back for an exam I took yesterday that I thought I did great on and it turns out I fucked it up so bad. But I still felt motivated and ready to push through and work hard and finish my undergrad strong! But the last straw on top of this work I have to now put into my classes, my commute, my research, and my mental fuckery was that I got rejected from this grant I really really fucking thought I was gonna get (and wanted soooo bad since I lost the last one I was awarded). And I am just broken now. I have 2 quizzes and 2 midterms back to back next week and I\u2026. I just can\u2019t get over this Grant that I got rejected for. I mean, I really needed it, not financially, but I needed it to give me the hope and belief that I am capable. And now I feel like I really can\u2019t do anything.\n\nTl;dr: I\u2019m fucking up my last semester because I started it off with depression and only realizing it now. I was motivated to just sit down and work but got this rejection that just sent me over and I can\u2019t get over it.",
