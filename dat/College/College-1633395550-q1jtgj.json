  "text": "Hello, I am not in university but I have some college textbooks that are in amazing condition, they are pretty new. I am not looking for buyers here (although that would be cool) I am looking where I can sell them on a dedicated platform (like Kijiji but more specific to textbooks) I found places such as textbookrush but they only want 1 of my textbooks but I have a box full of them. Where can I get rid of them? Do universities have buyback programs since some of these textbooks are custom made for specific universities (uoft, ryerson)",
