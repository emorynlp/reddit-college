  "text": "Hello reddit! Don\u2019t really know where else to go with this and I am in desperate need of help and advice. I\u2019ve been living in an apartment with two other roommates (for purposes of discussion, R1 and R2) for what\u2019s approaching a year now, and have not had many issues until the past couple of months.\n\nR1, R2, and I all share a small but expensive student housing apartment with three bedrooms and a conjoined living room and kitchen. R1 started having a lot of guests over about two months ago. I\u2019m a social person and do not mind having guests in my shared apartment and agreed to this when I signed the lease. This is a group of about seven or eight people with maybe four or five of them regularly starting to spend time and eventually all staying overnight at our apartment. I work overnight shifts and come back to work in alternating hours anywhere between 2-8AM. It has gotten to where I come home to find our front door unlocked and a stranger sleeping on my couch every night the past month. \n\nOut of the original group of people, it is two that have moved into our living room and sleep there every night. They eat the food that both I and R2 buy for ourselves with our small paychecks as working college students. All of our silverware has disappeared. Our bills have doubled in the past two months on electricity alone, and despite having access to R1\u2019s shower, do not choose to use it as they smell awful and the water bill remains unchanged. They only wear two sets of clothes. R1 and their group, including the two that are now living in our living room, spend all of their money on weed and alcohol. They go on benders and bang on the front door, spam call R2 and I (from several different phone numbers) and bang on our windows early in the morning when we\u2019re both trying to sleep for our jobs. \n\nR2 gave me more information before posting this. R1 had lied and told our apartment complex he was a student, which was a prerequisite to living here. R1 also shared with R2 that he was planning to sell from our apartment but was uncertain on whether this was an act or not. R2 and I are both on the same page and do not want these people around, especially the people eating our food and running our bills up. \n\nAny time we try to talk to R1 about what\u2019s going on, R1 gets defensive and denies any involvement. R2 and I have both contacted the apartment complex staff already; complex charged R1 for their trash and \u201cis working on\u201d the situation with the homeless people. They called R1 once, and the homeless people were gone for two days and have since moved back in. \n\nHow do R2 and I proceed with getting these people out of our apartment permanently? I would have more compassion for the two that have been sleeping in our living room every night if they practiced hygiene and did not run up our bills as much as they do. I do not have family members to fall back on financially and only cleared this month\u2019s rent and inflated bill by five dollars and am desperate for any suggestions.",

      "text": "Since you aren\u2019t living in campus, I don\u2019t know if you can talk to school staff about this. You could look into that. \n\nYou could try contacting the police so they evacuate the people living there. If R1 denies to know the homeless people to the police, and you and R2 also don\u2019t know them, and don\u2019t want them there, that would technically be home invasion. The homeless people would literally be trespassing. The police would have to remove them from your home. So, you can look into contacting the police. \n\nYou can also try the apartment complex\u2019s management, or front office, or whatever entity that takes care of leases. You can bring this up to them, I know you did already, but maybe do it again and make the argument that R1 is violating the lease. Try to find policies and/or rules of the lease itself and the apartment complex. Use those in your favor, support your argument with them. Talk to the people in charge constantly, if you pressure them, they will pressure R1. Make sure you get a solid timeframe in which they would resolve the problem. If they don\u2019t give you a timeframe, maybe check on them every week, or even every three days, let them know this is a serious problem that needs to be solved now. When I say pressure, I don\u2019t mean being rude or obnoxious, but rather make them see that the problem still persists and the situation is dire.\n\nYou can also try to get out of the lease without any penalty fees, and let R1 deal with the mess, the bills, and the whole apartment for them and the homeless people. \n\nAnother option is taking a legal approach. You could consult a lawyer about this. If you, or your family know one, that would be willing to advise you without billing, just do it as a favor, that would be great. Maybe you can find a way to pressure, either the apartment complex, or R1 through the lawyer. That way, they stop their practices. If you take this far enough (if even possible), you could make R1 repay you for the bills and lawyer fees (if any). Ultimately, the lawyer would tell you  how to navigate the situation and how to take effective action.",

      "text": "tbh just go straight to whoever you signed the lease with. I've had roommate problems (not this  bad) and went to the landlord for it to stop. Problems repeated, so I ended the lease.Your case is worse, and R1 clearly doesn't care. If the complex has done some things a few times and problems continue, you have the option to end the lease. If you do that, you'd need to find a place to rent first or stay with someone. Your second option is to get R1 kicked out by going with R2 and being more direct with the complex.  Both are uncomfortable at first, but you'll be fine after it's said and done.",
