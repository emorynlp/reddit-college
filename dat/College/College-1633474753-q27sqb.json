  "title:": "I am currently in the uncomfortable position of having to report my group partner to the professor.",
  "text": "We had a group assignment this past week with one other person. Right off the bat I did not get a good feeling from my partner. I had seen him and known of him weeks before this assignment. I remember the second week of the semester we were in a study group ready to turn in hw1 and he shows up all \"huh? what are we supposed to do for this assignment?\" never mind the fact that it was due in a few hours. \n\nHe also asked me multiple times when the hw was due. We have had a hw every single week and it has always been due Tuesday night. Every single time, it has never changed. Very concerning if he doesn't even know that. Furthermore, he has not been present for the last 3 class lectures. \n\nAnyways, I took initiative to set up a zoom meeting the next morning of the day it was assigned. He agreed to meet on zoom but the next morning he was nowhere to be found. I asked him what happened and he said he \u201cforgot\u201d. Never-mind that I told him about it not 12 hours ago the night before.\n \nWe met the next day and we agreed I would do half 1 and he would do half 2 and we would meet up at the end of the week. Well it\u2019s due tonight and he tells me he has nothing, not even a sorry or anything. Just 'oh well' *shoulder shrug*. The professor told us to report it if the other person did not contribute and they would receive a zero. On one hand I want to and think he is definitely deserving of this. On the other I am hesitant bc he seems to be friends with another classmate who has been helping me with this class. There is a possibility that the three of us will be put together in a group for the final project. This would probably make it very awkward and more difficult to work with down the line as I see him bad mouthing me and accusing me of getting him a zero on this hw.",

A similar thing happened to me and I had to go from carrying a group to carrying a different group, but at least the second group at least cared enough to show up",
