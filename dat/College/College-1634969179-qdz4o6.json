  "text": "To incoming freshman or anyone, I highly suggest staying away from college trips by 3rd party company\u2019s such as JusCollege. Impossible to get your money back if you ever want to cancel even with a valid reason. Not to mention you would pay way less planning your own trip with friends.",
