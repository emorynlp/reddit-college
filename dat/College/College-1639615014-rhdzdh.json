  "text": "Hi everyone! If this post isn\u2019t allowed, I\u2019ll take it down. I\u2019m an undergrad student and trying to find research positions (research assistant) since I\u2019ve been interested in them. I used to be a cancer patient in high school and some of the doctors that were treating me are also involved with research and academia. They asked me if I would be interested in donating samples to their lab and participating in the research. I agreed to it. \n\nIt\u2019s been 3 years since I\u2019ve recovered all thanks to them. I\u2019ve been so interested in this field of study and I found out that one of the physicians is still working on the research. They recently became a professor as well. I looked into the research more and it was super interesting. Just to reiterate, I\u2019m no longer a patient in this facility. I want to reach out to them but before I do, I wanted to know if this would be okay. There\u2019s definitely a high chance that this physician will recognize me so I\u2019m not sure if I should address that I was a former patient now in undergrad. Any advice on this is greatly appreciated!",

I love biology, I took the lab and asked my professor if I could ever be a TA for her and a research student she actually said she was looking for a student that was willing to be both a TA and a researcher, so yeah just ask",
