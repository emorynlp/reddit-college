  "text": "Hey guys, do you think going for a tablet is a good idea if i already have a laptop? My laptop's battery life is only 2-3 hours but i'd be on campus for 11 to 15 hours (my classes are ONLY on saturdays). I need something that can last that long or able to be charged via powerbank that can do basic stuff like word, power point, excel, and one note with stylus and keyboard. I'm a management major so i don't really need the newest processor or whatever, i only use apps that i mentioned. Budget including the pen and keyboard, maybe around 500 USD. But I've never had a tablet, so i'm not familiar with the apps that are available on tablets. I'm currently looking at lenovo tab p11. Those that have used tablets as their main device, can you share the differences in experience between using a tablet and a laptop as main device for college?",
