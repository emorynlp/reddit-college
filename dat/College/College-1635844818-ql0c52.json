  "text": "Honor code\n\nHello all. I recently got honor coded for an exam. Apparently they stated I was looking away and staring during the test off screen. They suspect someone was next to me but I was honestly looking out the window to pass time. What are my odds and how can I tackle? They told me they have clear evidence of me looking away. I didn\u2019t deny I wasn\u2019t but told them I was staring out the window. I'm taking it to trial. What should I expect? Please advise.",

      "text": "At this point it just comes down to your word vs theirs. They don\u2019t know whether or not anyone was there. Was your grade for this exam way higher than the others? Or were you done in an extremely short amount of time? If these aren\u2019t the case, then they don\u2019t really have much to go off of. I have never dealt with this issue nor have I talked in depth to anyone who has, but there isn\u2019t much else they can say. I\u2019m not sure what the consequence would be, if any.",

      "text": "I don't have any solid advice since I'm not familiar with such situations, but one thing I can suggest is getting proof of your location. If you took it at home in your room, then sit in the exact same place you did when taking the exam and take a selfie video to show the same background you had when taking the exam so they can compare, and then pan over to the window next to you to show that there in fact was a window there. If it was daytime the recording should also show that there was daylight coming from the side where the window was. I don't know if I'm going too deep or if this response is unreasonable, but I feel like if it were me, that's what I would do.",
