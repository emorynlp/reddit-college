  "title:": "How do I tell my professor that I'm the only one who did any work on a group project?",
  "text": "I'm in a group of five people, we have a big presentation due today in about 10 hours. I sent reminders to my group's groupchat for the past week about the project, added in ideas to the chat, shared the presentation with them. Nobody has replied up until 3 hours ago, to which everyone said to \"let them know what to do\" or that \"they wouldn't be able to work on it until 10:00 (3 hours before class starts)\". I've already made most of the presentation since we have to present it to the class in a few hours; one girl actually did contribute but all she did is reorganize some text I'd already written on one of the slides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm honestly kind of excited to see four people bullshit a presentation on something they know nothing about lol. But in all seriousness, how do I go about emailing the professor about this? I've had one person not contribute to a group project this semester but never an entire group like this.",

This situation happened to me my first year and I went to my professors office and told her that I did all the work which was true. I had 3 others in my group who didn't do shit. I had proof on the Google slides too because it says who edited what. Anyways, she gave them all zeros and they were confused why. And I was like idk I got one too I guess we sucked. I never got a zero. I just didn't want them to be pissed at me. Lol. But yeah just tell your professor and if you have proof show them.",

Group projects are always hit or miss, and we can't always tell who did the actual work (although sometimes it's pretty obvious). Just email the professor and explain your situation; include any documenting evidence if you can. \n\nI'd suggest that you contact the professor \\*before\\* the presentation. If you wait until after, it can look like you're trying to make excuses for a trainwreck.",

Honesty just explain every detail you can about how they didnt work on it and that you\u2019ve been sending reminders for however long and no one replied. And you just had to finish the whole thing because you really can\u2019t wait until the last hour to work on it. When I had this happen, we actually had to do peer evaluations and grade the people in our group. And me and the one other girl who actually did all the work gave the other two people a 5% and a 7% bc that\u2019s what the score truly added up to. I emailed the professor about why I gave them those scores and I was worried they would score me wrong (bc how would know how well I worked if they weren\u2019t there at all). Just kindly and professionally bring it up to your professor, suggest that you\u2019re open to discussing in person if need be and they\u2019ll look into",

She gave us an opportunity to fix it - which became me re-writing the 3 terrible portions. At this point I have written the entire assignment and everyone is getting the same mark. \n\nWhile I was rewriting this assignment, everyone else in the group has been studying for the final and working on individual projects for a different assignment in this course. So now I\u2019m screwed either way because I\u2019ve had less time to work on my individual project. \n\nThe professor made it crystal clear that she didn\u2019t care who wrote the only good portion of the original assignment because we were going to get the same grade no matter what.",
