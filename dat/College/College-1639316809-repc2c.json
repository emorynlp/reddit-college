  "text": "Can't breathe. Currently having a mental breakdown.\n\nThe past months leading up to finals were HELL. Due to some issues going on in my life, I was struggling to the point where I had completely neglected studying. This is the first time something like this has happened in my life. I am typically the type of student who studies days before a quiz and weeks before exams. Now, I am completely falling apart and I have no idea what to do.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award! Still breaking down, but hey! I got an award! ",

Try prioritizing your time with the material you think will be the most helpful. You don't have to go over every piece of information you have done in the class. If you have a friend in the class ask them questions too. What class is this by the way? If it's a class I took I can try to help.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not too late! You still have time and you can get a lot done even in just a few hours. Here\u2019s what I do in these situations:\n\n\n- take 10 minutes to make a list of the most important things to know for the final \n\n- take 5 minutes to figure out how well I understand each of these topics. I usually give myself a percentage for each one (\u201cI understand 70% of topic X\u201d)\n\n- take 5 minutes to prioritize the topics based on their importance and how well I understand them\n\n- take 10 minutes to make a study plan. This might look like \u201cAt 11, I will do practice problems from unit X for an hour. Then I will go to lunch around 12. At 1, I will do practice problems from unit Y for around 30 minutes. Then I will look at my class notes for around 30 minutes and make a list of the important things that I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d Et cetera \n\n\nWhen it comes to actually studying:\n\n\n- Turn off your phone and put it out of your sight. If you can, try to study without using your laptop too, because it\u2019s easy to get distracted.\n\n- Take breaks! It\u2019s a lot easier to process and remember the information when you take breaks that don\u2019t engage your mind. Don\u2019t go on your phone or read a book as a break, just give your mind some space to process what you just read. I like to go on a quick walk or meditate as a 10 minute break every 45 minutes or so.\n\n- If you\u2019re having difficulty staying on track, study silently with a (responsible) friend. If they\u2019re not distracting, it\u2019s helpful to have someone with you because it holds you accountable. I usually go to a study room with my friend\u2014we don\u2019t speak a word to each other the entire time but it keeps me on track. If your friends won\u2019t be able to stay silent, then don\u2019t do this.\n\n- If you have the time, it\u2019s really helpful to try to explain/teach the topic to an inanimate object. It helps you understand the topic better and it brings attention to the things you don\u2019t know very well.\n\n- Every few hours, take a moment to evaluate the progress you\u2019ve made. Update the percentages you gave for each topic and adjust the plan if you need to.\n\nBottom line- just try your best and be kind to yourself. If you can only study for a couple hours, that\u2019s okay. One hour is better than zero. Try not to beat yourself up- I know it\u2019s stressful right now, but in 10 years, the grade you got on this final will not matter.\n\nGood luck! You got this!",
