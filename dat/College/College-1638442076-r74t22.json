If you're happy with your current grade on it, say as little as you can and stick to your answer. If your grade sucked, maybe do some prep work and be prepared to reinterpret your answer in a way that will improve your grade. I'm sure you'll be fine. I've never seen or experienced a professor wrongfully punish a student. Its a big deal if they do.",
