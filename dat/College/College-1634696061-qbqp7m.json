  "text": "I've found that the best way for me to really absorb information is by completing assignments, having clear goals to meet and something to do physically really helps to solidify information, however, simply drilling notes/textbooks over and over again usually nets me around high 70s on tests (that being said it's very rare that I'll crack 80 on an exam), I've been using these so often that I'm pretty much set in my ways at this point and have never even considered what a different way would be, is there anything you do that works differently for you or is this the main way most people study for things?",

      "text": "For me and my study group, we usually start by creating a concept map/web of topics or types of problems that would be on a test. We were Chem Eng, so many of our problems involved determining what kind of problem was it, and what assumptions we could make to begin solving it. So creating a sort of flow chart of questions to ask to arrive at the correct set of equations.\n\nThis could work for less solution driven assignments and tests. If it's going to have a written portion, you could group concepts together or come up with cause and effect relationships that might come up on the test. Studying to answer the questions \"Why/How\" is much more effective than studying to answer questions like \"who, what, or when\", unless it's purely a multiple choice test.",
