  "text": "My biology professor recently shared an internship opportunity with the class through canvas. It makes very good money for two summers working in a lab doing research. The problem is the focus is in evo devo while my biggest passions are environmental. I am open to new things and the work is interesting to me, just not necessarily the path I want to take in life. The internship says it is for students interested in pursuing a masters in developmental biology. Should I not pursue this if I know that is not my current plan?",

      "text": "If it's just something that doesn't align with your interests, go for it. I'm sure you've seen all the \"it takes experience to get experience\" complaints, so just getting started is important.\n\nHowever, if it is a job requirement or strongly recommend you are pursuing that master's program, I might hold off. You don't want to take an interview slot just to tell them you aren't actually a good fit. But also, maybe give it a try. I've worked in 3 different industries, none of which are the one I saw myself going into when I started college, but I've loved and learned from all 3.",
