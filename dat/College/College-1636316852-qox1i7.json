      "text": "Hi! Woman here. \nAsk her about herself. Her interests, family, past funny stories, past sad stories, favorite media - asking and listening is the best way to show someone you care and bridge the gap for someone you may not know extremely well!\nCompliment her somehow. Just try and make it not simple like 'I like your hair' 'your dress is nice'. If you're attracted to her, I promise something will pop out to you when you first see her. \nAnd lastly, if it goes well (and I hope it does!) make it apparent you want to do this again. That way, she knows she is wanted and cared for, that you enjoy spending time with her. \nI hope this helps!!! :)",

      "text": "Go do a fun activity. Movies suck because you can\u2019t talk to the person, you just\u2026 sit there. Dinner is good but then you\u2019re forced to think of questions right off the bat. Go do go-karts and lunch or something like that to get her laughing and having a good time. Assuming she seems like that kind of gal. That\u2019s something I personally would love. Could also do bowling, brewery tour (if you\u2019re 21+), or maybe skating. If money is tight, maybe a hike or visit a museum. Anything that gets you moving around is likely to help break tension and lower anxiety, and thus making conversation easier. Good luck!",
