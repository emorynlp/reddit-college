If someone was a data scientist at Google, I know immediately what he is capable of, what he\u2019s done, what standards he\u2019s been held to- because it\u2019s Google. He could be an even better data scientist at random startup XYZ, but I\u2019d have no clue unless I interviewed him because I don\u2019t know that company. \n\nHaving the brand name of a huge, well-known company speaks volumes because they know immediately what kind of quality work you can do based on that company. You become less of a question mark and more of a trialed, seasoned candidate.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re a business major. Do you have any idea how prestige-whorey finance, IB, consulting, etc. is? Very.

I will warn you though, as someone who worked retail management for 2 years, it\u2019s straight ass. Retail is garbage and I would not recommend you do it. It\u2019s not worth it and nobody cares you were retail because retail is literally bottom of the barrel work. Hell, I was a retail manager in high school.",

          "text": "I agree that working for a brand name has a positive impact in most cases. I run a space engineering Master's program. Whenever my students have an internship at companies like Airbus or the national space agency, their chances of employment increase significantly. One of the main reasons I believe is that the employer sees that you've been through a thorough screening process before. If you add a positive recommendation letter from that company on top and make a reasonable impression in your interview, you're more than a solid candidate. \n\nHowever, that shouldn't keep anyone from going to no-brand firms. The experience itself is more important than the brand name. So I recommend comparing the actual internship positions that you get offered, based on your career goals.",

But since the brand name matters so much for screening and attraction, I definitely think the best route is to work a few years at an industry-leading big name and then move on over to smaller firms.\n\nI\u2019m not in your field, but for mine as a business major, it\u2019s very common. People will work at a big4, then use the name to secure a higher-paying role with better WLB at a medium-sized firm. Same thing with FAANG, people will get experience and get tired of the BS that comes with it and secure a killer role at a startup with their experience.",

I just assumed you were from the UK since it's M&S which has origins in Britian, and you said 'uni' instead of college or university - usually Americans don't say uni. \n\nFrom the description you're giving, it sounds like they just want a retail worker for the holidays and they're advertising it as an internship. You should contact someone at the store to see if you can find out more about the duties you'll be performing and what you'll be learning. Maybe discuss the position with an advisor/counselor at your university. If you don't have anything else lined up, you can probably go ahead and take the position anyway since it'll be something to add to your work experience list, but if you have other proper internship opportunities available and this one doesn't qualify, maybe reconsider spending time somewhere where you won't get the experience you're looking for. \n\nOf course, this is just my opinion I've formed based on the information you gave me in your comment - there's obviously a lot I don't know, so that's why I thought it would be better for you to find out more about the position and discuss with an advisor to make sure you'll actually benefit from doing this as you should from an internship.

Everything here is on an honor system basis, where people will give you the benefit of the doubt and believe what you put on your resume/CV. Sometimes they could run a background check to confirm, but you usually don't have to present any certifications. On your resume you just name the company, job title, and have a few lines under that describing what duties you completed/what you achieved/what impact you made/skills you learned etc.\n\nOf course, you can note down everything you have concerns about and discuss it with whoever you plan to speak to. If my advice actually isn't relevant to whenever you live and you actually will require a certificate from the internship, you can contact them and see if they'll provide that. Like you said, the experience is a win-win, because the alternative would be sitting at home with no experience. I'm glad I could help even a little, and I hope you get something out of this experience!",
