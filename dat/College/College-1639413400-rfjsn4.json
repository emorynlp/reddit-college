              "text": "Just to piggy back off this OP. I took all the non-honor/non-AP math classes in high school doing fairly average. Performed below average on the math portion of the ACT and then tested into a intermediate algebra class at uni. Started there and built my way up to college algebra, then precalculus, then calculus 1, then calculus 2. Lowest grade was a B for calc 2. It\u2019s more than possible to accomplish. Start where you feel you\u2019re most comfortable with your skills and work your way up and do not take shortcuts in favor of time. The logic and problem solving skills you learn in math will transfer heavily over to your computer science courses. Wishing you good luck!",

You just need to pass those classes. Being bad at math won't make you a bad software engineer.\n\nIf you want to be a computer scientist or data scientist, you will absolutely need math and use it in your job. Computer science is said to be just discrete maths applied to computation. Data Science and ML is said to be just applied statistics.",

      "text": "Not really. Math has nothing to do with CS. CS is all about logical reasoning which math just happens to have the most out of all other subjects. For a CS major, you have to be good at problem-solving and the ability to line the pieces of code together in a logical order that computers can understand. Personally, I'd say it's more similar to writing an essay for an English class. You have to establish your thesis, for computer, it is just simply knowing what platform your code is going to be based on. Second is your body paragraphs, which are essentially the chunks of code that you had to write and piece together in a reasonable order. And lastly, you have to write your conclusion and publish it for peer editing, which is ultimately packaging your pieces of code for an alpha, beta, or public tester to scrutinize. I personally find it easier to learn coding and CS in general by first learning excel functions and formulas to get a hang of what coding feels like. Ultimately, the only difference is with each language's syntaxes and functions.",
