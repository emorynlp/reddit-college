      "text": "Please say so! At the end of your class, raise your hand and share out loud your feelings. As a writing professor who had to stop teaching this past spring, we hold those memories with us always.\n\nI'll also say this--Pay attention to what it was that made the class so great. Was it the teaching? A great group of classmates you clicked with? Compelling assignments? Whatever worked for you, try to find that in your future work environments. \n\nFor example, if you respected that your teacher gave you a lot of freedom on assignments, look for jobs where you can be self-directed. If you felt a great kinship with your classmates, know that a harmonious team environment might be important for you vs a competitive one. And so on.\n\nIt's easy to recognize what feels bad. It's harder to recognize what's good because it's harder to encounter the good, I think. So when something works for you, take note and see how you can recreate that in other areas of your life. \n\nLast: Good teaching is a SKILL and TALENT. It doesn't happen by accident, especially in higher ed where profs aren't required to have any formal teaching training. If you had a good time, practice gratitude and know that you were a part of something magical and art-like. Feel good that YOU helped create that. Yep! A good class is co-created with students. So think about what you did to make this class awesome and try and repeat that in your other classes. You'll recreate a little of that magic everywhere you go.",
