Better to take extra time than to take too many classes and lower your gpa or affect your mental health",

You usually save the lab classes like Bio and Chem for your second or third year, not your first semester. \n\nI'd say to definitely say to talk with your counselor or advisor about it, but from personal experience you shouldn't be taking that many rigorous classes your first semester because you're still learning how to be a college student. One of my friends took a bunch of difficult classes his freshman year because he thought he could handle them and failed lol",
