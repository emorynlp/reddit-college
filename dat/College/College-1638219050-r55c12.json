  "text": "For a project in one of my classes, we've written an article on the detrimental effects of pulling an all-nighter, particularly for students who do this to study/finish an assignment. I know how often we are all told that a sufficient night of sleep is important for emotional and physical stability, so if anyone is interested in reading the article or watching the video I have linked both below. If you enjoyed either of them, feel free to write a comment or leave your thoughts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFun read especially considering finals are coming up for us all, best of luck to everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYouTube [https://youtu.be/v0RJ84Wf9\\_Y](https://youtu.be/v0RJ84Wf9_Y)\n\nMedium [https://medium.com/@jacob.marks\\_97857/is-it-really-worth-it-4d9f7f1e3513](https://medium.com/@jacob.marks_97857/is-it-really-worth-it-4d9f7f1e3513)",

      "text": "This is one thing that really blows my mind with young people attending college. Once their parents aren't there hounding them about their sleep schedule, they fuck it ALL up. \n\nI heard a kid saying he slept till 1 PM in one of my classes. How in the hell is that even possible? Every time I hear someone on campus talking about that shit, I immediately think they are incredibly childish. Go to bed at a decent time, get up early and get to fucking work. \n\nIt's so simple.",

          "text": "Different people have different internal clocks. I naturally stay up late and prefer to do homework later and sleep in. I was able to take classes that accommodated my sleep schedule and it worked out fine. Except when I had to take physics which was necessarily at 8 am. That was horrible, skipped most of the classes but still did fine.\nAlso some people work at night, so they don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to go to bed early",
