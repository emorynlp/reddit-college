  "text": "I was able to keep my B in cell biology by getting an 84 and an 88 on my two part final.\n\nI was able to raise my Physics I grade from a D to a C by getting an 83.\n\nI aced my Survey of Forensics final.\n\nOne remains, but I know I'll ace that one.\n\nThese finals are what shot me up to be able to maintain a GPA above 3.0. I am so happy and relieved I can move on to Physics II next semester.",
