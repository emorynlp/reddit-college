  "text": "So I\u2019m a senior majoring in Biology in a CSU (Public California university) and I\u2019m pretty sure I bombed this final and am going to end up with a D for the course(STAT Sci). Technically it is still passing. I don\u2019t need it for a prerequisite for a different class but just need it as a graduation requirement for my major. I really don\u2019t wanna retake it because I put so much work in it and it was so time consuming which really boosted up my anxiety. I really don\u2019t wanna go through that again next semester especially cause I have a toddler and I just want my brain to rest a bit \n\nI am taking one more bio class that I need next semester and filling a full time schedule with two other courses non science related that I actually don\u2019t need. \n\nHave any of you graduated with a D? Has that affected you guys in any way? Should I just retake the class and try for a better grade?",
