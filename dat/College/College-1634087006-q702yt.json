  "text": "so I wrote my first in person midterm in over a year last week and felt like I got around high 60s, maybe low 70s, got my grade back today and I got 54%, I'm feeling like an abject failure right now and like I'm just not going to do well in the course at all going forward, how do I stop myself from spiraling and not listen to the urge to drop out right now?",

      "text": "Calculus 1 the first time I took it in spring 2018 I got 30% on midterm 1 and midterm 2 it was awful considering I took AP calculus bc 3 years before, but I got a 3 in the AP calculus bc exam. To be honest, I never understood much calculus in the AP class due to the fact that it was high school level. I later withdrew from all classes.\n\nI did retake it the following autumn quarter 2018 to get a higher score/grade.\n\nHow I coped? I didn't but later found out calculus was an intp personality type.",
