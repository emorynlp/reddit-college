  "text": "I am in college majoring in physical education but I have never played any sports. I grew up hating physical activity and my parents never had the money to put me into extracurricular activities but when I started college I got into working out and I decided to change my major to kinesiology physical education. So i have been taking all my core classes and I cannot help but feel so out of place in this major especially because I never played sports growing up or watched sports and even now, I am not crazy about sports but I notice everyone else is and I am starting to feel like I should not have majored in this at all. It might be too late to change my major, I will disappoint my family especially because all my sisters majored in something they liked and finished school and never once had thoughts of changing their majors so I am afraid to let my parents know.",

      "text": "You\u2019re comparing yourself to (1) your classmates, and (2) your sisters, and you don\u2019t need to.  You\u2019re you, not them.  I think coming from a different background makes you unique, not an impostor.  \n\nIf you like what you\u2018re studying then stick with it. You mention that you feel out of place compared to your classmates, but you don\u2018t say whether you\u2019re actually enjoying the major *itself*.  That should be the main thing that determines whether you switch.  The other thing to consider is what you would switch to, how much of your completed coursework you can apply toward it, and consequently how much more time and money you\u2019d need to spend in school compared to sticking with kinesiology.  An academic advisor can help with this, and you should definitely talk to one.\n\nFWIW, I switched from computer science to physics in my senior year. (Most people at my school switch in the opposite direction, lol.) I had to spend another two years taking physics classes, but I\u2019ll end up with a BS in physics and (hopefully) an MS in CS \u2014 a total of 6 years for a BS+MS, which is standard.  For me, it\u2019s worth it because I love what I\u2019m studying and I\u2019ll come out with a whole other body of knowledge that makes me different from just another cookie-cutter CS major.  YMMV ;)",

Oddly enough, taking care of yourself usually takes care of the people around you. \n\nI went back to college at 32. There's no too late.",
