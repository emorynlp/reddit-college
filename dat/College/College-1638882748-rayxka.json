  "title:": "Are posters allowed in dorm rooms?",
  "text": "I dont know if this is the right sub to ask this, but how chill are colleges with posters in the rooms? I was directed here from A2C. Also I know the college application process is not over so I am not going to college yet, but I have the oppertunity to buy posters now (with new year and all) so I want to buy accordingly. \n\nI have about 3 which I want to take with me till now (might have more cuz I am huge on posters). One of them is framed and I have 2 folded posters which I want to put up. I know JHU is quite strict with their dorm rules, cuz I was watching a vid and the guy said they rnt allowed to put anything up on the walls or even on the window ledge.\n\nAlso how exactly do you recommend putting the folded ones up? Should I also frame them cuz that's what my mom is suggesting but one of them is already quite big and Im international so taking them back and forth might be a bit difficult. I also dont want to ruin them cause tape and glutag ruin the paper.\n\nIf anyone is curious the framed one is a movie poster for Guardians of the Galaxy, one of the folded is a Twenty One Pilots Scaled and Icy poster (the one you get with the box) and the big one is Twice's new album poster (the South Korean edition is huge)\n\nAlso on a side note, I want to take my albums with me, so how much space is there usually in the rooms, and should I be worried about ppl taking my stuff (cuz I have a few expensive clothes and stuff as well) Thank you",

      "text": "Some colleges have different rules on what exactly you can use to hang things. For example my first school only allowed command strips and when I transferred they preferred you use small nails or pins instead of command strips. You can look on their website and see what the rules are for each school but generally they'll allow to hang things as long as you aren't messing up the wall or anything",
