You are a solvent, solid student with a decent average. \n\nYou are not special enough to be an extraordinary failure, nor are you smart enough to be a super genius. You are absolutely competent enough to go to a decent college, and if you go to a community college you will be more than fine.\n\nI can not fathom why an 18 year old would declare themselves a failure, especially when you\u2019re young with an undeveloped brain, but you\u2019re not. \n\nGuess what OP? People with 3.4 GPAs become rich and have six figure salaries and marry and have kids because no one after enough work experience cares that you once got a C in English or whatever.\n\nPeople with 4.0s sometimes major in hard field like chemical engineering and get wiped out by the job market and wages because god know why.\n\nYou are fine. You are competent. You are capable. And you know better than to judge yourself because of some numbers",

Try not to get into too much debt especially if your family can't help you financially. I recommend starting at community college for all of your core classes. Community college is great because the class sizes are small and the science labs are less chaotic. Then you can transfer into a university for your upper level classes. \n\nSometimes achieving your goals will require you to do things in a nontraditional fashion. Not everyone's college experience has to be the cookie cutter 4 years. \n\nI hope this helps you. I think you will do well.",

It's a different kind of socialization with more options. I had a wide variety of friends from all walks of life and different age groups. \n\nI found a group of nice people and volunteered to be the designated driver a few times. I was invited to parties I only dreamed about in highschool. I went to the private team party celebrating a super bowl win ( it was super crazy!). I also got into the vip section at a private JZ concert at a Miami club! Real life is better than highschool. I didn't end up finishing college because I was able to leverage connections into a successful business. I'm trying to pay it forward with what little advice I can give on Reddit.",

To name some: Middlebury, St. Lawrence University (New York), UVM (Vermont), UNC chapel hill, etc. (if you give me an area of the US you\u2019d like to go I can list some more for you to check out)\n\nIf your family is poor you need to make sure you get the FAFSA (financial aid) filled out and apply to scholarships. You will most likely get almost a full ride if your family income is below a specific level. FAFSA will be what takes a lot of the tuition off of the table. \n\nAlso really tell your story in your college essay - it helps admission counselors a lot to be on your side.",
