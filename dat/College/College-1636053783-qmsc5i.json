  "text": "Hello all I am new to this Reddit thing but I just got a scenario and would like to receive the best tips or advice.\n\nDepending on if anyone has had to do this.\n\nSo first off I am a full time college student but I specifically put my classes online so I could work. I work Monday to Thursday 3:30pm-3:30 Am which are 12 hour shifts. I am having a hard time being able to get the right amount of sleep every night along with getting my school work done. In specific I am only working because I want to have nice stuff but I am questioning if it is worth it. I am a high achiever and was just wondering what tips or advice anyone could give me.\nIs it healthy to get 6 hours of sleep so I can do my school in the morning ? If anyone has gone through something similar how did you do it?\n\nThanks",
