  "title:": "Guys after five tries of going to college I finally got my first degree!",
  "text": "I am over the MOON right now. I always wanted to go to college, it was always something that was important to me and on my goals list. I wanted to be a doctor SO bad. I tried right after HS in an attempt to up my shitty HS GPA (I got good grades when I turned in my homework, I just never turned it in) and that didn\u2019t work. I tried again and again every few years, even tried a few certificate programs (MA, cosmetology in a time of desperation) but I could never get it done. Until this time. And two years later, here I am! \n\nThis semester was the last two classes I needed for my associates of science pre-nursing transfer degree and it was the \u201chardest\u201d two classes (A&P II and Microbiology, which I was advised not to take together and ignored). I started out strong and in the middle of the semester my best friend got extremely ill and we weren\u2019t sure if she was going to make it for quite some time, she\u2019s been in my life for over half my life so I just fell apart. She\u2019s at home and still trying to recover and I managed to scrape myself back together and make it through the semester! I had resigned myself to the fact that I might be retaking these classes and cried so many times about it because I\u2019ve worked so hard.\n\nUnfortunately my GPA will take a hit so that sucks (hoping I still have a chance at the nursing schools around me bc it\u2019s competitive) but the important part is that I finished and I have my first degree! One down, three to go!",
