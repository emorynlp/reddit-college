  "text": "Hello, fellow college students,\n\nDaily Advice: Don't worry about your grades. It's better to focus on what you *learn*\\--rather than the grades you get. It isn't all about grades. Get involved in your campus' extracurricular activities and organizations. I guarantee you most employers would rather hire a C-average student who participated in various organizations than a 4.0 G.P.A. student who only focused on his grades and didn't participate in extracurriculars. Stay positive! Don't worry about what can't be changed. You should ALWAYS use a GROWTH mindset, opposed to a fixed mindset. If you tell yourself, \"I can't pass my math or science class\", you won't! It's all about your MINDSET. Focus on the process, not the results. Work on the math or science class daily until you get better. PRACTICE is key. Lastly, NEVER compare yourself to those around you. You are UNIQUE. You are SPECIAL. NO ONE is like you, EMBRACE who you are. BE HAPPY.\n\nGood luck in your education endeavors!\n\n\\-TheAdviceForYou",

      "text": "I agree so much with this, my only caveat is that employers would rather take a B-average student. At least in my internship and post grad job hunt, any recognizable company wanted a GPA of at least 3.0, and with so many companies using automated systems for sorting through the flood if applications, a low GPA will almost certainly get you kicked out of the pool.\n\nOtherwise, good advice that doesn't get shared enough!",
