Did you learn another language as a requirement? Wanna know your firsthand experiences. I'm tired of reading like a textbook definition of those /sigh.",

      "text": "BA in linguistics here. I\u2019ve got 2 academic quarters left and have been explicitly taught basically everything except semantics (which has worked its way into a lot of the other coursework in piecemeal ways). \n\nHead over to r/linguistics for an idea of the conversations being had among similarly inclined folks, and try out r/linguisticshumor for some levity.\n\nThe content can seem dense but if you\u2019ve got a passion for the material its a rabbit hole you can take all the way down. Over my many (6+) years in college I\u2019ve studied Spanish, Mandarin, and French, tho the French is the only lang I\u2019d be comfortable going into a conversation without google translate, but thats just a matter of having been doing it non-stop since high school.\n\nLanguage classes like that help to ground you while you try to wrap your head around all the theory and data. A linguistics program should have a baseline of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. A pit stop in linguistic anthropology or sociolinguistics help contextualize some of the content, and historical linguistics is where you can see a lot of these moving parts in action together.\n\nPhonetics is fun and simple. First of all you\u2019ll get better at making your L2s sound good. But really theres only so many sounds the human mouth can make. (Phonemes have been used to describe sign languages too, I believe, but I have no education in this arena)\n\nThink of phonetics as the \u201cwhat\u201d, and phonology as the \u201chow\u201d. Phonetics is the set of all linguistic sounds, phonology is like how each language uses its own subset of those sounds.\n\nMorphology is mostly all about the roots and stems of words and the affixes you attach to them. Noun declensions, verb conjugations, agreements, etc. This is where sounds start to get their meaning.\n\nI find the line between morphology and syntax to be a bit blurry, but they\u2019re typically distinct fields of inquiry. Morphology is like the grammar of words, while syntax is the grammar of phrases. Great fun but only if you put in the work to learn it right.\n\nSemantics, I havent been taught, but it comes up all over the place. DM me after spring and I\u2019ll tell you about it lol\n\nIMO, linguistics is gonna be the most scientific of your 3 options. You\u2019re gonna be trained to analyze text and speech at a deep mechanical level. With linguistics as a foundation you could go on to education, law, computer science/engineering, translation/interpretation, journalism, marketing, data analytics, public relations, etc.\n\nAnd watch the film Arrival if you haven\u2019t already lol",

          "text": "Heyyy thank you for answering. I really appreciate it. Your comment is so helpful. I'm gonna be in college next year and I've considered those degree programs as sort if like... a backup plan. I just wondered like how different each of them are. Even though I've read the primer, I felt like they were all relatively the same so i wanted to know which one i should reallt pick. I'm interested in those fields of study or something. Like learning languages, learning how to write/edit, translation, etc.\n\n\nI also was worried if ever I would study these programs, could this be a good degree to become a psychiatrist in the future? I mean I figured that there wasn't really like a set degree to take to become one but yeahhhh. I guess it would hinder me if i would decide to go to med school.... \n\nAlso, thank you for the film rec and the reddit comunity! So kind of you \ud83d\udc95",

              "text": "I can\u2019t really speak to the programs at UP, but if you\u2019re set on psychiatry I have to recommend biochemistry, pharmaceutical science, or something else medicine related.\n\nLinguistics would set you on a pretty different path, although you might just fall in love with the science of language.\n\nLang and Lit, as well as CompLit are both fields you oughtta pursue if you want to do those things. I see linguistics as more broadly applicable, as well as being sufficiently scientific.\n\nRegardless of your future choices, i wish you peace and strength on your journey",
