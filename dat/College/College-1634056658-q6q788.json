I currently hold a state job with a CJ Department, I\u2019m hoping to stay with the state until I potentially retire. \nFor those who did CJ or know anyone who did, what Masters program did you choose and why? \n\nI\u2019m considering Psychology, Public Policy and Administration, or Cybersecurity. \n\nAny advice is welcomed and thank you in advance (:",
