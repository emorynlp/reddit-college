  "text": "I emailed my professor asking for a letter of recommendation for a scholarship that I am applying to. This is an online class, so I can\u2019t ask my professor in person (which is what I usually do for LORs). I have emailed them previously about assignments, tests, etc. and they always responded within 3 days. It\u2019s been a solid week and a half, and they have yet to respond. I stated that it was okay if they didn\u2019t want to write me one, I just needed to know either way. Should I email them again? I don\u2019t want to bother them\u2026 but I also need to know if they can write me a letter so I can ask someone else if they say no.\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "text": "Faculty here.  Let me give you what I consider to be a fairly general policy for this type of thing. \n\nIf you ask for a letter of recommendation and the professor doesn't respond, make sure to let at least a week go by.  You've done this, so that's good.\n\nAfter that week has gone by, send a short and direct email saying you're following up on your LOR request from <insert exact date here!> and want to ask if the professor has had time to consider it.\n\nThe reason you want to include the exact date you sent the request is so that the professor can go straight to that date in their inbox to find your original request in case they overlooked it the first time.\n\nAsk the professor outright whether it will be possible for him or her to write the letter by <due date>. Type a professional closing to your email, and then send.\n\nWait 2-3 days.  If you hear back from the professor, then great.  If you don't, take that as your answer and ask a different professor to write the letter.\n\nProfessors are usually happy to write letters for students, but the cold reality is that sometimes professors just don't have the time.  Consider that professors teach dozens or hundreds of students every semester, all of whom eventually need a letter for something, a job, a scholarship, graduate school, etc.  If a professor wrote a letter for all 50 of the students who ask, the professor would have hardly any time to do anything else.  So, if the answer to your request turns out to be no, don't take it personally, and just ask a different professor to write you a letter.\n\nGood luck.",

          "text": "Thank you for the advice! I\u2019ll email them again. They have been a bit quiet in the class lately (posting lectures and weekly announcements later than usual), so perhaps they have something going on in their personal life. I don\u2019t want to burden them, so this time I\u2019ll be very clear that I won\u2019t feel bad if they don\u2019t have the time to write me one.",
