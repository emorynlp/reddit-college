  "text": "My roommates are all random and include 5 girls including me. No one knew each other prior to moving in together. My first month we all lived together I travelled primarily every weekend for music festivals, weddings, etc and while I was gone they formed pretty close relationships with one another, leaving me a bit out.\n\nThis didn\u2019t and still doesn\u2019t really upset me. I am a pretty individualistic person and have a great circle outside of these people. I would admit I am picky about how I become friends with, but I really am kind to everyone I meet. I genuinely have never done anything hurtful to these people. But because it\u2019s more acceptable to be mean in a group, I feel they have all been in agreement they don\u2019t like me. And I understand they may feel angry over my lack of effort to be their friend, but I truly have been nothing but kind to these people. I have seen firsthand them be pretty catty and I simply don\u2019t have much in common with most of them. I still want to be cordial and live together with mutual respect. Lately, I have been feeling that respect is not evident on their side. They will send passive aggressive texts about petty things but then completely disregard me out of large choices. For example, my roommate brought a dog in to live with us for the next two weeks and I had no idea, in comparison, I have gotten cussed at for leaving on bathroom lights, which they all do as well\u2026 they do not talk to me respectfully and I am tired of it. Some of them have ignored my texts for days when they owe me money for utilities I am paying for for the entire home. I just do not feel respected at all.\n\nAt this point, I have no desire to try to fit in with these people, but I also do not wish to make my situation worse. They have added me to a holiday secret Santa with them and some of their friends. Frankly, I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m added as none of these people really feel like they are my friend, and they\u2019ve never had a problem leaving me out of things before. For reference: someone requested a girl to post a \u201croomie\u201d pic and they completely left me out of it LOL. But if I decline, it will be a shit ton of drama.\n\nAnyone know what to do in a situation like this? Or tips on how to not let them get to me in my own home? My living situation has made me so depressed, and I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s anything I can do about it. I am pretty sensitive, and don\u2019t like feeling out of control, so this has been hard on me.",

      "text": "Sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. Bad roomate situations suck. It sounds like you\u2019re already mostly socially independent of them and don\u2019t consider them close friends, nor do you desire to, which is good. The only worse thing than having shitty roommates is having shitty roommates who were your best friends prior to living together. Thankfully though your relationship with them is one of utility, so you need to keep that in mind as you proceed. My advice for you would be \n\n1. Start considering what you would like your next living situation to be. I\u2019m assuming you have a year long lease and the end may feel far away, but you definitely don\u2019t want to be stuck with them next year, and it can help to have some light at the end of the tunnel. \n\n2. Boundaries are your new best friend. In a calm but clear tone, make it clear that your space and your belongings are yours. If necessary draw up some sort of a roomate contract and include their habits that annoy you, like for example no pets. In a group of five there\u2019s bound to be some habits of particular roommates that annoy people other than yourself so try to get everyone to buy in. \n\n3. Keep the peace. Don\u2019t get me wrong, your situation sounds unpleasant, but it could definitely get worse. Try not to be overly petty. I\u2019d encourage you to participate in the secret Santa, just to avoid creating \u201ca shit ton of drama\u201d",

          "text": "Yes yes yes to all of this. Luckily, one of my greatest friends and I will be living together next year in a far nicer and bigger space. It really is my light at the end of the tunnel to get through uncomfortable moments.\n\nI totally agree on avoiding the drama but sticking with boundaries. I also understand their behavior seems acceptable because the entire group is doing it, and I\u2019m the one who doesn\u2019t come downstairs to hangout when they have friends over, etc so they think it\u2019s reasonable. Genuinely all I want out of this temporary situation is respect. I think I will do the secret Santa even if it\u2019s a little awkward.\n\nThanks for the response and advice!",
