  "title:": "Fastest and frugal ways for someone with a 9 to 5 to get a bachelor\u2019s degree?",
  "text": "\nI was hired into an industry where a bachelor\u2019s degree is the norm. I was a rare hire brought in due to experience alone (and unrelated experience at that!) with no higher education.  \n  \nI\u2019ve worked hard and proven myself but I still believe this makes me way less competitive compared to everyone else in the company. Especially on paper.  \n\n  \nI went to college in my early twenties and received a few credits but nothing close to what I\u2019d need for a bachelors degree.\n  \nMy company pays $5,000 USD iirc in tuition assistance per year.  \n  \nCollege is incredibly expensive these days and I don\u2019t want to take on debt, and I understand I may have to, but I think it would be in my best interest to complete undergrad in *something*.   \n  \nWould an online degree program be the least expensive?  \n  \nAre there any that are highly recommended?  \n\n  \nNo community college near but I do have a mid-level university practically in my backyard but with my full time work schedule, I cannot take day classes.  \n   \nThe degree program would have to be primarily or fully online.",

      "text": "Online is a good choice. Usually the classes are asynchronous so if you get ahead you\u2019ll do really well. It depends on where you go to get the online degree for the cost. Some places cost more online for whatever reason. If you\u2019re looking for a piece of paper, the reputability matters less (as long as its still accredited).",
