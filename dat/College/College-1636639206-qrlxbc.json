  "text": "So i recently joined college and i am pursuing mechanical engineering by choice and my friends ( the ones i have made right now) are incredibly boring and we just talk about study stuff ( assignments and questions). My friends in high school were funny and cool people who were kinda goofy and fun to hang out with but imo my friends in college arent. Any suggestions? \n\nPs: im in online college rn as physical classes havent started yet.",
