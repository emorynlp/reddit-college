  "title:": "Why do RAs care about alcohol?",
  "text": "A few days ago my friends and I (all freshmen) were drinking a bit in the dorm. RAs come by three times a night for rounds. It\u2019s a different set every night so you never know what you\u2019re going to get. They knocked on our door and said they smelled weed (we weren\u2019t smoking anything but there are a couple of people on our floor who smoke in their dorm sometimes).\n\nNow we had an empty bottle of wine on the sink and an empty bottle of whiskey on the floor as well as a shot glass. My friend opened the door once they knocked and I realized too late that the alcohol was in plain sight so I stood in front of it, but they told me to step away and confiscated the bottles. They said we would get an email the next day but it\u2019s been 4 or 5 days with no email yet.\n\nMy question is why couldn\u2019t they just let it slide? Most RAs I\u2019m sure drank underage, none of us were particularly drunk and we all were respectful. Nearly everyone drinks at least once or twice in college. I don\u2019t understand why people care so much about what we do in our own private space. Nobody was causing any trouble, nobody was acting out, nobody was just totally out of it. \n\nAlso what should I expect from a first time alcohol offense?",

If someone found out they let it slide, they could risk their whole job. Plus, it's probably a campus rule.\n\nYeah people drink, just be smarter about where you do it.",

I always told my residents I don\u2019t care what you do outside of the dorm and I don\u2019t care if you come back drunk (please sleep here even if you\u2019ve been drinking), but do not drink in the dorm because I\u2019m required to report you, which isn\u2019t fun for me or you",

      "text": "I'm an RA and I can tell you that most of the time I don't care about what goes on in rooms until it starts to have an impact on other people. I don't care that people smoke but when you smoke inside and it smells like shit I'm gonna writing you up. Same idea for alcohol, if I get complaints that people are drinking or that people are being loud I have to address it. \n\nIn your case you likely live in a dry hall (most schools don't allow alcohol in freshman halls).  If so its automatically going to be a write up simply because its a dry hall. Yes, they can give you a warning but if other people find out about it and they get written up for the same thing, they're gonna complain. Its a shitty situation but whenever I do my write up I will add in notes on if the people were cooperative or if they spent the whole time telling me to \"go fuck yourself.\" If you're chill with me, I'll help you out when it comes to what charges you're facing. \n\nMy advice is go to your judicial hearing and accept responsibility. They'll likely have you go to an alcohol class or do community service.",
