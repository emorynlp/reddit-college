  "title:": "Can I Get My Loans Cancelled If I Get Diagnosed with a Learning Disability and/or Suffered Severe Mental Illness?",
  "text": "So basically I am nearly 30 and found out I have been suffering from ADHD my whole life. I also suffered major depression for about 18 years of my life, all through college, and honestly I don\u2019t feel like my mind was fully aware of my decisions and choices I made. I feel like a completely different person with much better control over myself and my emotional regulation. It feels like I went through school with an unknown handicap, like I was cheated at a fair shot, because I was ignorant of my condition and regularly suicidal. \n\nNow that I\u2019m better and have been diagnosed, is there a way I can use this to argue that I wasn\u2019t sound of mind when I agreed to the loans and have them forgiven?",

I wasn\u2019t just young and somewhat naive, led on by misleading college admissions staff, but I don\u2019t feel like I was of a sound mind back then. Like criminals who do a crime while they\u2019re in psychosis can get away with a lot, but I experience life crippling depression for years and survive multiple suicide attempts and I am seen as sane and under sound mind? I\u2019m in therapy now just processing unprocessed past trauma stemming from a lifetime of untreated mental illness, after doing ketamine therapy my mind has fundamentally changed and I feel like a normal person just with some depressing messed up experiences in what now seems like the far past. It\u2019s crazy how I have no recourse.",

It brings me deep anger because I know there are many others out there with even more debt and in worse situations than me, all of this so loan companies can make bank and so the government can privatize the cost of education onto students so they can continue funding stuff that 98% of the country doesn\u2019t benefit from. I\u2019d gladly pay 10% more in taxes if that included access to higher education and healthcare.",
