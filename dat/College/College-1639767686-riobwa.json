  "text": "I want to major in engineering. But I heard that the first 2 years of engineering major are just math and science. And I was recommended to go to community college. But I also heard that community college transfers don\u2019t transfer well and that only 31% of community college student transfer to a four year institution. And many university have a low percentage of accepting community college transfers. But I also want to go to frat parties\nSo what should I do?",

      "text": "Community college is the way to go! Frat parties are a waste of time. You can go when you transfer or visit a friend. Focus on your grades the first two years. You\u2019ll save money too. Know where you want to transfer to and exactly what credits you need and what will transfer with you. Have a backup school too. A lot of the time, there\u2019ll be guaranteed admission to certain schools if you keep your grades up. Look into those opportunities before you even start. The low transfer rate is due to a number of things. Some people just take a course or two to keep their mind sharp, some are going for an applied associates to enter the work force after two years, some are there because they didn\u2019t get accepted to a four year and they end up flunking out. You\u2019re not them. Go in with a plan and goals. You\u2019ll be fine.",

      "text": "I would do 1 year at a community college, but most engineering majors have 5-6 semesters of sequential classes, so if you want to graduate in 4 years you'll probably want to get started on those your second year. The other option is to get all your gen eds out of the way and then just focus on your engineering courses with a lighter load. It'll take you an extra year but your stress will be lower.",
