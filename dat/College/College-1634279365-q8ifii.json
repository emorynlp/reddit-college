  "text": "I\u2019m on my last stretch of community college, I know what school I want to transfer, and I\u2019m currently filling out my transfer application. I never thought on the cost of college, I only concentrated on maintaining a good GPA throughout community college so I would be able to transfer. Now, I have realized that once I transfer, each semester would cost me double than my annual gross income. This is before financial aid, I haven\u2019t filled out FAFSA, but even then, I know aid won\u2019t cover all. This has lead me to be anxious and unmotivated. I\u2019m underperforming in my classes, I\u2019m a mere shadow of the student I used to be. I haven\u2019t talked about this to anyone. I don\u2019t know how to cope with these feelings. I know I can\u2019t afford it, I know I will probably be in massive debt, I know my family does not posses the financial power to afford it, nor the power to get me out of debt.",

      "text": "If your family can't afford to save you from debt and the cost of tuition is higher than your current income it seems almost likely you will get a sizable amount of aid. In addition aid is proportional based on institution You will most likely have to pay some (I did) but I was massively reduced where working part time enabled me to pay off the rest without resorting to loans. It was a hard 2 years but I made it through and I am sure you can too.",

          "text": "Thank you for your encouragement. Knowing that I can\u2019t pay for college is a mental weight that I have to carry around with me every day. It really does suck knowing that I will be in debt if I don\u2019t do something.",
