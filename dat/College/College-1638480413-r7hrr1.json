  "text": "I know rule of thumb is to not write your papers as you go but I do this and can\u2019t \u201coutline\u201d what I\u2019m gonna write about because I find what I\u2019m gonna write about and I write the paper at the same time, sometimes I will find something better and erase a whole paragraph and talk about something else. \n\nI hate doing outlines because it requires you to know what you\u2019re gonna be writing about it ahead of time, broken down into little categories. I have made As on all the paper this year but now my grades gonna suffer cause out lines suck!",

OR Write a generic outline using your text, then write your paper however you want and tell professor that the paper changed after the outline was submitted. If challenged, double down, that the original outline was adequate but your research and the process just went a different direction in review.",
