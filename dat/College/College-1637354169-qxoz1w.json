  "title:": "The Most Effective Study Strategy I Found So Far!",
  "text": "Hi everyone! Final exams are just around the corner, so I wanted to share a study strategy that I found the most helpful so far in terms of remembering more information and getting good grades. \n\nThe study strategy is called retrieval practice (or active recall). Retrieval practice is an active learning method where we try to recall information that we\u2019ve learned previously and it\u2019s a lot more effective than passive strategies like reviewing or re-reading notes. We can do this by closing our textbooks or notebooks and trying to recall as much information as we can remember up until that point. We can also do this by using flashcards or other methods of testing ourselves on the material. When we use retrieval practice, it will reveal gaps in our understanding that we can make a note of to review later on. \n\nI took a cognitive science course where we learned about retrieval practice and other effective study strategies and then I used the strategy for my other courses. I ended up getting A+s in all of my courses that semester! In my experience, retrieval practice is really effective for courses where there\u2019s a lot of key terms/concepts to memorize. \n\nI also made a video where I talk about retrieval practice and other effective study strategies if anyone is interested: [https://youtu.be/lsr9mTlwokw](https://youtu.be/lsr9mTlwokw)\n\nGood luck on your studying!
