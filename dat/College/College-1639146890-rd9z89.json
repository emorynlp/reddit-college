  "text": "Just curious. Assume all the other grades were actually high passing grades, but then the person got caught cheating on the final due to written questions. I assume all the other grades wouldn\u2019t matter and you\u2019d be given an F in the course, but how to know if you would be booted from the program or school? Can\u2019t find anything on that part.",

      "text": "This is largely dependent on the individual professor as at most places, the penalty is up to us (though programs and others may get involved depending on the situation). My typical approach the few times I\u2019ve had to address cheating (which is absolutely the LEAST favorite part of my job because I HATE having to address academic integrity violations with a passion) is to make the first violation a zero on the assignment/exam, but I wouldn\u2019t automatically go right to an F in the course, and from what I understand, you wouldn\u2019t be expelled until you\u2019ve had a few violations on your record. Again, though, that\u2019s highly dependent on the professor and the situation.\n\nWas this a first offense?",

This \"cheating\" or \"academic dishonesty\" report will stay on your transcript for life, unless error. No college and university will take any student that has \"cheating\" or \"academic dishonesty\" report on the transcript. College and university take cheating and academic dishonesty very seriously. No one like cheating or being cheat. Think of this like criminal record on you.",
