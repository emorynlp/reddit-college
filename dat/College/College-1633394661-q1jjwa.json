  "text": "I showed up to zoom class almost an hour late. She wouldn't respond to my direct messages but when I finally got the courage to ask out loud in class she answered them and she assigned me to a group so it doesn't sound like I'm getting kicked out of class. Because she assigned me to a group. This is the first time I've been late all semester. I sent her an extra email after class saying I was confused about what time it was and I said I didn't think it was my social anxiety. So I hope I don't get dropped. But if she wanted to drop me why would she assign me a group? Does anyone think I will be dropped? I don't think she's happy. She hasn't been responding to my written messages. But at least she talked to me during class and assigned me to a group, even though I was late.",
