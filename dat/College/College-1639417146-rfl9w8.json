  "text": "I really really really fucked up and accidentally fell asleep before my final this morning. I woke up 10 mins after it ended and emailed my professor immediately. It was online and posted for 5 days but I put it off until the very last second Bc I was finishing all my other classes & getting ready for Christmas/birthdays Bc everyone\u2019s been pulling my arm about when I\u2019m gonna visit them. It\u2019s totally my fault for procrastinating so long and thinking everything would just work out and now I\u2019m screwed. I had 86% which I hoped to raise to an A after the final but I\u2019ll probably barely pass now and my parents are gonna be so confused and angry.  I doubt the professor will do anything since this was on me. What do I do now??? I hate myself so bad",

I hope that anxiety was enough to make sure u don\u2019t let this happen again but seriously a note for the future, don\u2019t focus on anything else during finals week. Take care of christmas and birthday gifts and plans during thanksgiving break so that you have nothing to worry about when you come back and dive back into finals.",
