  "text": "To put it short, there are 2.5 weeks left in my semester, I've known that I'm failing one of my courses for the past 4 weeks, thought I could catch up but then life happened and I haven\u2019t been able to get myself to do the work. Unfortunately, I missed the deadline to drop the course without academic penalty and would get an F on my transcript if I do. Is trying to do basically an entire semester's worth of work in the next 2.5 weeks even worth it?",
