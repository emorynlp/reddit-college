  "title:": "Should I bring my dog to college?",
  "text": "I just applied to a Uni in Washington. Come this autumn, if everything goes right, I\u2019ll be transferring to this school for my sophomore year. My girlfriend even goes here, so that\u2019s a plus! However, one thing I didn\u2019t think about is... well... my dog. The college dorms don\u2019t seem to allow pets. No worries though, I can just rent a flat right next to the campus that does! And it\u2019s super affordable, especially if I got a roommate. But dogs are expensive, and this is an older dog, mind you. I mean, I\u2019m going to be supported by my family, financially, so that shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue as well. But then I also want to have a college experience. And a dog might take up much of that time. So I have a few problems. I feel like I can handle much of them, but I want to get some input. Should I bring my dog to college? And is there anyone, currently, living on-campus with their dog? How is it?\n\nTl;dr: I want to bing my dog to college, but I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s the right choice. Help?",
