  "text": "it\u2019s getting close to two months here at my college and I have made zero friends. I\u2019m an out of stater so I know absolutely no one and i overall just suck at making friends since i tend to be shy. im extremely lonely and extremely sad. i basically have to force myself out bed every day. it\u2019s getting more and more difficult to focus on school and when I see a group of people waking together or hanging out i want to burst into tears. i worked so hard to get into this school just to have a terrible experience. im at a loss for what do at this point. is it even possible to make friends this late?",

Try to find people in your major and just start chatting with them. If it goes somewhere cool, if not move on to the next one. It's going to be uncomfortable sure, but once you get a group you won't even remember that part.",

I didn\u2019t want to be the person to ask \u201ccan I come?\u201d when my floormates would plan things but they never invited me. \n\nNow they have their groups and snapchats or whatever I just deleted social media and pretend it\u2019s normal to not have any friends. \n\nI know it sucks i get you man.",

(when I'm not stressing out over exams, of course lol)\n\nAlso, I have been in the same boat as you for about 4 years now ever since I started college. It's hard making friends at this stage, but not impossible! You always have time to find that group that welcomes you, it's college after all! Never stop looking because people are out there! Try joining a GroupMe for your class and ask if anybody wants to hangout/study, that always works!",
