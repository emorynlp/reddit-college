  "title:": "My GPA sucks, and it's preventing me from applying for Master degree",
  "text": "I'm majoring in Software Engineering, I've made a few actual apps and games, API backend. But beside that and my above average GPA I have nothing much. I hate myself for this, I know that was the best I could try but still, why am I so average. This couples with my financial issue makes it impossible to apply for Master, specifically a Master Degree in Data Science, because data science field requires a lot of knowledge and training, on math, statistic, understanding of data,... before I can build and evaluate a prediction model, knowledge of programming alone is not enough. Unis that have easier barrier of entry requires high tuition fees, uni with high standard and high barrier of entry has lots of support, but won't accept my low score\n\nI hate how terrible I am, it's so hard to move forward",

I have to understand more about math and statistic, data wrangling, data extraction, model deployment and all the nitty gritty part of the AI industry... That's the reason for master degree, to train me up with skills for my future job",

              "text": "You're overthinking it. Most CS jobs teach you what to do in the first couple of months. You don't have to know all the ins and outs. As long as you're a good learner and know what was taught, you'll be fine. A master is not required, I would advise against a masters right now if it's going to a strain financially. Get a job and you can get a master in couple of years perhaps?",

          "text": "I'm from South East Asia so there really isn't option for community college courses. My GPA for subjects involve programming are really high, like B+ A grade, but for the rest with supplemental subjects they're just above average a bit. So overall when I sum it all up it's just above average, I'm not well rounded\n\n>Also, letters of recommendation count for a lot in some cases. Have youworked with faculty members that could write a strong letter for you?\n\nYeah I could get one, but overall GPA is still a limiting factor you know, I phoned a student support department for Nanyang University (one of many I'm planning to apply for master). And first thing they say is that my GPA puts me in a great disadvantage, this and my inability to pay tuition fee means it'll be very difficult for me. It feels like that the first thing they look first instead of whatever experience I got",
