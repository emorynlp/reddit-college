Everybody knew me and everybody loved me. In fact, I sobbed the day I left high school, in front of probably fifteen teachers, and on the way home.\n\nNow I\u2019m a freshmen in college, I suck. \n\nI was bubbly at first, but soon I hated getting a hi wherever I went, even from people I don\u2019t know. I hate having to wake up early for a class that doesn\u2019t affect my major, like theology, just because my school is a catholic school. I don\u2019t talk to people, I give death glares. I don\u2019t even put on fresh clothes. I\u2019ll wear PJs for days at a time, to class, and sometimes even when I leave school for something like walking half a mile to pick up a pizza. I look like I\u2019m depressed, but I generally don\u2019t want to be bothered. All I do is sit in my dorm and listen to Eminem. \n\nOn most days, I just leave my dorm to shower, poop, eat, study at the library and go to class. I rarely participate in activities, even RA activities. I only go because of stuff like freshmen seminar. A lot of classes I was looking forward to I loathe and just want to get over. I don\u2019t even get the work done in some of them, because I\u2019m not used to the few times a week deadlines. In fact, I have a 2.9 because of that.\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of money, or a car or license, and most of the cool stuff in my college town you need is far removed from cool stuff. Besides, my school is a commuter school, so on weekends, only people there are graduate students. I hate but at the same time love college. I miss the discussions we had in AP classes, but I love having my own room and being able to just talk to myself or say whatever I want without getting mad. ",

We can\u2019t get condoms or birth control because they promote pre-marital sex. If you\u2019re in the same room as alcohol, you go to consueling, you get a suspension, whole nine yards.

I know there are many *possibilities* in life but to say those people aren\u2019t extreme outliers and you want to give me anecdotal or nonspecific evidence to prove your point is preposterous.

                                              "text": "For your first quote, it depends on what classes online you need. I know taking art classes online isn\u2019t necessarily cheap and just because it\u2019s cheap, it still costs money which will be prohibitive because college students are not rolling in money. It also depends on your definition of *cheap*.  Like I said you also need to take time out of the day to do that. And if you don\u2019t have a job you have a full time job as a student and if you don\u2019t have money as a student someone else is paying for it, but guess what will happen if they don\u2019t want to pay for it??? Also in most fields you need experience or demonstration that you can complete the job. You won\u2019t just get the job because so and so is your friend, excluding a small number of cases. You need time to get experience which you won\u2019t get in a day and it\u2019s gonna be hard while you\u2019re trying to pay for other stuff. \n\nFor your second quote, it may have been decreased but by how much? Influence and a support system will always be needed, no matter how much society changes. \n\nThird quote: well obviously you can\u2019t blame me for thinking that when all OP literally said is that you can\u2019t sit around doing your hobby all the time and that you have to sacrifice some time for other tasks, not that you have to sacrifice it completely. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so against that. \n\nStudent loans aren\u2019t necessary for everyone, you\u2019re right. But that\u2019s because not everyone goes to college. They get certificates or accreditation in other stuff. Point being they don\u2019t just start working in a job that they can use to live on their own right after high school without paying for extra work. I never said everyone goes to college or that everyone has to assume those kinds of debts. Not *everyone* has to buy a house or whatever but like OP, I agree that money which you need for a place to live and **food to eat** are necessary to subsist in society even for intelligent people or \u201cmotivated\u201d people like you say. Even if you like a hobby you need money to pursue it and that comes from somewhere, like an actual job. Like I said those motivated people were extreme outliers. It is not easy starting a company by yourself and even then I can name many famous examples where they probably weren\u2019t 100% made *by themselves*. Someone somewhere saw the need for an idea they had and felt strongly about investing in them (and some of them are probably even college graduates ironically), but most of us are not different from the rest, at least not in *this aspect* and the examples you\u2019re thinking above are people that are above and beyond the control of everyday life barriers because of uncontrollable factors like extreme intelligence. \n\nMany of those people you mention still went to top schools, even if they dropped out, and actually used the experience they made from their classes to help and they no doubt were able to sue the connections they made to help them get ahead in life. Is your argument that college isn\u2019t necessary because that wasn\u2019t even the point of this post. Why are you switching to a different argument? That\u2019s confusing. That\u2019s a topic for another time but no one cares if college is necessary. \n\nI never even said you were \u201canti\u201d money but you were completely insulting in your response to the people that are living good hard working lives because you act as if they\u2019re sacrificing the time for the hobbies for the fun of it. Sacrificing your time and *abandoning* your hobbies is a whole different story but OP wasn\u2019t saying you had to do that. . And yes I was really confused about your position because of the way you quoted. Frankly I didn\u2019t even think you would reply. \n\nI read your comment and I have to say that you are free to pursue an unconventional lifestyle, but OP was merely saying that an income is essential for human existence and that those are the reasons why we make an income. You must have interpreted it another way. Even people that don\u2019t live a conventional lifestyle still have debt too. Even those people you mentioned.  Not everyone is rich and can afford to pay off things right away and some of those things you need. In today\u2019s society you actually *do* need some form of debt to maintain good credit which is inarguably essential for everyone, even the highly motivated and intelligent people that pursue \u201cunconventional\u201d lifestyles.

That doesn\u2019t mean they think you have to lose your creativity. Original OP just feels that way. I don\u2019t know what  else you want me to say. The situation OP is in is called being an adult. Feeling more boring is unfortunate but hey, not everyone can afford to do their hobbies all the time and they *must* work. I\u2019m sure you work too. I didn\u2019t get to where I am by playing Nintendo DS all day and if I\u2019m not as creative as I once was, that\u2019s an unfortunate consequence but it\u2019s a part of growing up for most people. So I do understand what OP said but you\u2019ve been pretty much derogatory and defensive for the most part starting from \u201cthat\u2019s terrible advice.\u201d As in spend more time on your hobbies and let your schoolwork suffer. I doubt OP chose to focus more on his schoolwork for the fun of it. Like most students. Again, the blood sweat and tears I showed for my education is for a better future and pretty much most people have to shed those unless you grow up in a economically privileged position with connections galore.

You can't engage with this syntax without projecting onto it, so you don't really understand where people are coming from when they challenge it. I'd suggest re-reading the sentences and stripping them down to what they actually necessitate semantically, and then considering if you can see why other people have disagree with your fundamental premises.",

Make sure you get your shit done for school and work enough so that you\u2019re not homeless but if you can, join clubs, go out with your friends, and give yourself some \u201cme time\u201d for art/music or whatever. Yeah sometimes I don\u2019t sleep as much as I\u2019d like or I procrastinate things longer than I should, but I think it\u2019s worth it.\nIf you really don\u2019t have time, for extracurricular stuff, I would take an art class as an elective if you can. It forces you to make time to be creative and have fun.",
