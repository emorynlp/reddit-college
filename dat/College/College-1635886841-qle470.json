  "text": "So in my fall semester as a senior studying molecular biology and this semester has been rough. I have 3 major classes that probably should have been spaced out but couldn\u2019t, that I\u2019m now struggling in. I have never had this much problems in previous years, maybe one class gave me trouble but everything else was fine, but just this semester sucks. Everyone around me is becoming doctors so they are all really good meaning there are no curves to help me and since these are end of year courses there are no upperclassman tutors I could hire. \nOn top of that I have to pick classes for the spring in a week as well.\nI feel like I\u2019m stuck in a bad spot where it\u2019s to late to change to something easier, to late to transfer to a less expensive school. \nI know I\u2019m not the only one who has ever had to deal with this and I\u2019m just wondering how others got through the stress and depression of accepting you won\u2019t finish college on time.",

      "text": "All my friends are graduating after this spring and I\u2019m graduating at the end of next fall. I was a physics major studying to go to med school, realized I hated my life and changed my major right before the start of my senior year. So not only am graduating late but I\u2019m pretty much starting all over. \n\nI get how you feel seeing your friends and people you know start graduating and stuff but everyone moves at their own pace. Especially if it\u2019s something you can\u2019t change no matter what, there is no point in wasting energy in something that cannot be altered. I promise you, no one cares about you graduating late but yourself. And is you staying an extra year or so the end of the world? There are so many people out there who graduate late and become just as successful as those who graduated on time. I promise, it\u2019s only detrimental to you if you make it! It may be hard seeing your friends move on, but that won\u2019t determine how successful you are. Also, not sure if you want to go to med school, but it\u2019s normal to not start med school until your mind 20s. \n\nKeep your head up!! Things will work out. Best of luck",

My goal for now is to at least pass a more than one of my classes this semester so it\u2019s not a total loss and plan for to retake stuff in the spring.\nNot a med student. That\u2019s sorta a problem as I\u2019m stuck in all these classes filled with med students and all I hear from the teacher is this content will be also on the M-cat. So I\u2019m in extremely difficult classes for students in premed, but I\u2019m not premed.",
