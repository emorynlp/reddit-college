  "text": "Title. There is this 3D software class I want to take during the spring but it is 3 hours long, has a decent amount of homework, and has a lab attached to it. I really want to take it though because I love making 3D pieces and if you complete the course, you can use shop tools at my university without supervision (dumb rule, I know). \n\nWould it be rude or bad to email a professor about his typical course workload to see if I can handle it. It comes from a place of passion because I really want to take his class!",
