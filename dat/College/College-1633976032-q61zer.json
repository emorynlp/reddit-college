  "text": "If it\u2019s not obvious from the title, I\u2019m a first year student and I just failed two exams. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do at this point. They were for different classes and (intro to cs and calc 1). I have another exam for one of the classes tonight and I feel like right now I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. Im so anxious for my next exam I\u2019m actually crying. What do I do? I feel like I\u2019ve screwed up everything for this semester.",

Sometimes they drop a low grade and some profs curve your grade. Just make it through the next exam and do the best you can. Then make a plan to change your habits. Make study guides or go to office hours if you are struggling with the content. You can try emailing the professors and asking them how you can do better in the class. I promise it is not the end of the world, it\u2019s just a rough patch. Good luck",
