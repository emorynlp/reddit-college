I literally have never heard of this and it very likely violates Title IX.\n\nIf it's not *that* invasive but requires undressing and you do not feel comfortable doing so, contact the admissions office.  Ask to speak to someone \"with whom you can talk to privately about the college's physical exam policy.\"\n\nYes, absolutely talk to them (if you feel comfortable sharing).  \n\nIf this is your dream school, don't let this stop you.  I simply cannot imagine a school denying you accommodation.   However, things that might not be eliminated could include any test to find out if you have something that could be transmitted *non-sexually.*   Something like Covid.\n\nBlood tests, Lab work, proof of immunization.   But if they're talking about something more invasive than that?   I'm not kidding when I say \"***That's lawsuit territory.  That is Big Media Story.\"***\n\nIt is absolutely unheard of for that sort of exam.",
