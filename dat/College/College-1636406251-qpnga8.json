  "text": "\n\nIm an 18 year old currently a freshman at Slippery Rock University going for Park and Resource management. Im about an hour and a half away from home and i at least know this isnt where i want to be. In school i got good grades but i could never get myself to put in a genuine effort. I blew through high school with no confidence or motivation and i never put in a full effort into anything. Ive been depressed for so long but i honestly dont know why because i am so fucking lucky to have the things i have right now, i feel like theres no resl reason to feel the way i do. Over the past summer i felt so much better and i kept telling myself (like i do every year) that im gonna do better. Its the end of the semester and im still following the pattern i always follow\u2026 not only just that, i also hate being far from everything i know. I thought being away from everything i knew would help me start over but all it did was make everything worse. Long distance split my girlfriend and i apart, she became so toxic and cheated on me\u2026 i put up with it for months and basically became a pothead for so long just to deal with the stress and pain. Ive been struggling with motivation to do anything and i still have no idea what i want to do with my life. I want to do something that doesnt need more school but theres nothing i really can do. Im not good with my hands so i dont know how i could do a trade. I dont want to be stuck at some dead end job but im just not ready to pursue something right now. I could transfer to another school but im afraid of falling back into the same cycle and wasting money on something im just not ready for right now. I dont know what to do and i feel so trapped\u2026 i know nobody is going to have some magic solution to fix my problems, i just want some advice.",
