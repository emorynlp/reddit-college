  "text": "Was a biology major, and losing passion in my associates so far. I have always been interested in tech, but thought it wasn't a good idea to get a degree for reasons I don't think I can even explain.  \n\n\nI would have to finish 2 more years of schools plus a few additional classes. However, I have the gi bill so I wanted to enjoy myself while going to school, I am in no rush to graduate at the moment. Do you believe taking 2-3 classes a 16 week semester plus perhaps summer semester would be a good idea?",
