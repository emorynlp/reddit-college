  "title:": "Academically suspended for a year, and haven't done anything meaningful since. What should my next steps be?",
  "text": " Around a year ago, in the first term of my sophomore year, I was academically suspended for a term due to low grades. In the two terms leading up to my suspension, I failed every class I had for a few reasons, the main one being that I never did work in advance. Instead, I preferred to spend that time doing anything but studying/homework, such as playing video games or watching YouTube. Another reason was that I don't feel confident in my writing, so when I actually got started, I spent a huge amount of time struggling with stuff like sentence structure, or whether I'm using the right words to make my work sound \"academic\" enough. I know I messed up big time, and I'm worried about how this will affect my future.\n\nDuring this one-year period, I haven't done much at all. I foolishly thought to myself that I could maybe study for the MCAT and prove that I was ready to return to my studies by getting a good score, but in the end, none of that happened. I am currently taking a single course at a community college that involves a fair amount of writing so that I could get more practice, but even then, I'm struggling to get my work completed. Despite all this, I still enjoy learning. I find my courses and professors interesting and engaging. I was happy to do math homework, but when it comes to writing, I freeze up.\n\nI still want to work towards a degree though, but I don't know where to go from here. The college where I was suspended from is a private college, so tuition is extremely high, and that makes me hesitant about returning. Do I try going to a community college instead? What should my next steps be? Thanks in advance.",

I've had several very intelligent friends in college struggle for reasons strikingly similar to your post; years later three were diagnosed with ADHD. Just throwing a thought out there.",

      "text": "You\u2019re in a single class in CC and you\u2019re still struggling to do work. Here\u2019s what I have to say with your given history. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a math or technical genius- not being able to succeed, or at bare minimum, pass a CC course with writing has absolutely nothing to do with intelligence. It has everything to do with dedication and motivation.\n\nSure, you may be academically strong enough to get a degree, but you have none of the motivation and it shows by 2 whole terms of complete failures. You shouldn\u2019t be thinking about college AT ALL. You should be thinking about how to get yourself out of your comfort zone to start doing work you don\u2019t actually want to do. That\u2019s a part of life and especially part of college.\n\nMy advice? Get a job. Work retail or customer service for awhile. Embrace the suck and learn to live with having to do shit you don\u2019t want to. See what life is like for millions of Americans stuck in retail who didn\u2019t develop enough marketable skills in college and use that to motivate you to do well. Hell, join the military to give you some discipline if you need to.",

      "text": "Practice good study habits. Very hard to do but worth it. Start small, 30 minutes of studying then a 15 minute break. Then build from there, 1 hour of studying then a 15 minute break. You get the point, the best way to reinforce good habits is by rewarding yourself for your hard work. \n\nTry to distance yourself from unnecessary electronics when doing an assignment. Being near your phone or computer when it's not being used for the assignment is a huge temptation. \n\nA big tip is to remember that turning in something is better than turning in nothing. Getting a 60 on an assignment is better than a 0. \n\nOne of your main problems is writing. Consider switching to a major that's less writing intensive. Of course you'll have to write an essay occasionally in almost any class. I'm not sure about CC, but at Universities most papers are graded by TAs and most TAs don't focus heavily on sentence structure or minor grammar mistakes. As long as you hit the major topic points and elaborate a little, I believe you could get a good grade. \n\nHonestly, based on your post I belive your writing is already at college level. Using big words doesn't make your writing better. If you use too many big words it may make the point you're trying to make confusing. It's better to get to the point, so the reader can clearly understand what you're saying. \n\nRemember K.I.S.S. Keep it simple stupid.",
