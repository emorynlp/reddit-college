  "text": "I'm extremely depressed and anxious, and this added stress is making my life a suffering. I don't know what I should do. I want to keep on studying, I want to learn new things, but I feel like I'm going to mentally cripple any day now.\n\nWhat makes this situation worse is that it's my very first semester.\n\nI feel like a failure.\n\nI've been dealing with depression and severe anxiety for 6 years now. I constantly have intrusive thoughts. My memory became even worse.\n\nI'm lost.\n\nFortunately, I don't have to pay tuition, because I got into the state funded version of the course because of my good grades in high school. (But anyone can drop out of this version and immediately sorted into the paid version of the course). I have good grades here too. Mostly As and Bs, but I have some Cs and Ds too.\n\nI don't know what to do.",
