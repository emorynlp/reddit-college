  "title:": "Considering dropping out already",
  "text": "I graduated high school this May, and I was pressured by teachers there to apply to college. I applied to a community college near me and I've been going since August. Slowly over this short time I've been regretting going more and more. I'm working towards an AA but the workload is getting to be too much. My mental health is declining due to stress of having two jobs and trying to keep up with school. It's getting to be way too much. I need money more than some degree and I am considering just dropping college altogether. I feel like if I do this though, I will be seen as lazy and I feel like I won't have any motivation to go back to college. Ever. I've only been there for three months, while my friend's are at more prestigious schools. What can I even do in life if I can't handle community college? I'm already missing so much important work and I'm failing some classes. I wish I just listened to myself instead of those teachers.",
