  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019m in an online bachelors program for Psychology and have about 2-3 semesters left. So far in this journey, I\u2019ve only had one professor who actually interacted with the class in discussion forums and outside of class through emails so he got to \u201cget to know\u201d his students by being an awesome professor. I\u2019ve asked him for a reference before and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d do it again. But how do I get more than just him? All my other professors simply just punch grades into the gradebook and that\u2019s all they know about the students. How can I gain more references from professors or should I try to gain professional references from work as i work a job related to my field?",

      "text": "Be active during class, attend office hours and put yourself out there! If the prof sees your willingness to work he/she will be much more likely to want to develop a relationship in the first place. Many profs are turned away by the lack of care and outright neglect that some students bring to there classroom. So, be patient and make sure you make an effort!",
