  "text": "I am a 20f student at community college. I take two trade classes rn, plumbing and construction methods. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve been put in a group with all men in plumbing. Most of the dudes are my age, there\u2019s about five of us plus one older man. We will call him Jefe, because he labeled himself that in our construction class as a joke. \n\nLast week in plumbing we assembling a toilet, Jefe told me i was doing well. He asked my name and i told him. Halfway through the class he calls me Elizabeth. I correct him and he says \u201cI\u2019m just gonna call you Elizabeth\u201d \n\nI asked him not to, multiple times. He kept calling me that. Another group member also corrected him. I started to ignore him and left as soon as possible. \n\nThis week in plumbing he kept calling me elizabeth. I blew him off. Another person asked for my name and i told them. He then said \u201celizabeth, or whatever your name is\u201d \n\ni\u2019m tired of it. i\u2019m not good with confrontation. I know i will have to learn once i step foot into the trade world. He doesn\u2019t harass anyone else like this, not even the other ladies in the class. \n\nwhat should i do? confront him again? i\u2019m afraid of being labeled as a bitch or uncool.",

Any chance you can talk to the instructor and or swap groups? \n\nMake sure you document the interactions with dates and times. If you get no assistance from the instructor, you need to take the times and date log and escalate it to the school administrator.",

Talk to the professor, and if he fails to do something go to the supervisor of the department/ student services and ask for some help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nif no one does anything, start calling the guy \"Dick\" and say that it is the name you chose for him... if other guys start harassing you name them in order of stupidity\n\n\\- Dumbass Sr.\n\n\\-Dumbass Jr.\n\n\\-Stupidity Personified",

You\u2019re paying for these classes and a safe learning environment should be guaranteed by the school. Get your complaints in writing so there\u2019s a record. If they don\u2019t do something, I would make these complaints public with the schools name posted, warning other women their voices are not being heard by administration regarding harassment.",

Maybe go to the Title IX office if there is one. Good luck - it must be awful, and please don\u2019t let anyone normalize this",
