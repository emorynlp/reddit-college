  "text": "I graduated back in 2013 with a BA. My GPA was less than 3.0 but I\u2019m looking to change career fields and they\u2019re asking for higher GPAs. Is there anyway to fix my GPA or am I stuck with my low one forever?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m in the Air Force and looking to commission and become an officer. Currently enlisted.",
