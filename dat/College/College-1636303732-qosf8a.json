  "text": "I\u2019m going to uni next year. I applied at like 4 of the on campus dorms (it\u2019s basically a mixture between a dorm and a frat). I had been accepted later in the process so when the university finally sent my application through to the dorms all of them didn\u2019t have any space left. So many dorm applications that I couldn\u2019t even get on the waiting list. This really bummed me out, I was really looking forward to being part of a community/\u201cbrotherhood\u201d like that. Especially since I\u2019m more of an introverted person and it takes a while for me to warm up to people. Being apart of one would have forced me out of my comfort zone.\n\nAnyways this means I have to apply for off campus residence, which is fine cause most of them are literally right across from campus (walking distance). They have like everything in that main road\u2026 a Virgin Active, KFC, a Pizza place, a club (legal age is 18 here) and a bunch of other stuff. Basically this whole community just for the students\u2026 \n\nI did apply to off campus frat/\u201cdorm\u201d, which allows you to partake in sport and a bunch of other shit. They don\u2019t have physical dorm, it\u2019s just the community itself. But that\u2019s besides the point. \n\nSo like I said the off campus residence is were the majority of the students live.\nSo my dilemma is choosing between two of them. \n\nMy option are:\n1. Living by myself in a small room in a off campus dorm just across campus and everything els being in walking distance - which I really like. \n2. Living with 2 roommates who I don\u2019t know in a really nice place (which is basically a small house) in a estate, which is really nice. We each have our own rooms.\n\nMy problem with the first one is that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll get into a habit of isolating myself and not really making friends since I\u2019m a socially anxious person (My social anxiety isn\u2019t THAT bad, but I know myself well enough to know I\u2019m not going to go out of my way to speak/make friends with someone). \n\nAnd my problem with the second one is I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to get as roommates (they might douches and they aren\u2019t necessarily going to be first years), it\u2019s 5min away from campus - not walking distance. And Uni is far away from home so I can\u2019t just go home every weekend just cause I find one of my roommates annoying.\n\nSo any advice? \nAlso any tips just in general about college/university you have would be great.\n\nEdit: This post is a mess, but I\u2019d appreciate the advice.",

      "text": "as you said you're not that keen to keep yourself isolated from other people, i would suggest you should go for the 2-roomates option, bc having someone with you isn't a bad idea afterall. one cannot guarantee whether they'll be nice or not, but don't be worried about it now. we all take time to adjust with new people and it gets normal after a few weeks/months. Living alone, especially in uni, can take a toll on you. having some friends around will be a good thing. if something doesn't work out, you may have to change your room, but i hope that doesn't happen. have a great time at college! \u263a\ufe0f",
