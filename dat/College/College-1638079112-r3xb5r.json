  "text": "Hello, so I live in Dallas Texas and I applied to Oklahoma State University and got In. My brother graduated there and I love the school as well. The issue is I do not qualify for any school scholarships, and the tuition for out of state is almost $45,000\nThey are giving me $7,000 for my GPA-SAT/ACT scores. Which brings it to $38,000 which is still a lot. I\u2019ve been told I can get in state but I was not told how. Anybody out there know how to? Or who to ask?\nThank you!",

      "text": "Generally, to qualify for in-state tuition, you need to be a resident of that particular state which in most states requires you live there for at least 12 months.\nOnce you are considered a resident of the state, you will provide proof of residence of at least one year to the university. This could include your rental agreement or utility bills etc.\n\nAfter doing all this, you will qualify for in-state tuition. But keep in mind that different states will have different requirements, so make sure to find the ones for your particular case.\n\nAll in all, you will have to pay out of state tuition as long as you are not a resident of the state.",
