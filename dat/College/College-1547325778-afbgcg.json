I understand why it's done in classrooms because there is a concern that shy students will feel intimidated and not contribute, but it seems to me curious (at best) to effectively punish students who are eager to participate.\n\nEducation is about learning, and discussion is a crucial component to the learning process.  Without it, one becomes somewhat handicapped.  It's unfair to ask students who participate frequently, substantively, and respectfully to stifle their own classroom experience because others feel shy.  I emphasize those three qualities because \"gunner\"-type students should absolutely be told to be quieter.\n\nAnyway, that's just why I think it's wrong when students like you are asked to stop talking and why I posted that.  Hope you had a good holiday!",

In hard classes where participation matters, no one ever seems to want to, so I answer all the easy questions at the beginning of the year. And then I get the reputation of \"that guy who always answers the questions\", so I don't have to answer the hard ones later in the year since the professor assumes I know them, and calls on other people (who aren't raising their hands) even when I'm raising my hand. \n\nLast semester in my statistical modeling class with a notoriously bad professor, I was able to get full participation points (and a good rapport with him) by volunteering to answer easy questions on, like, breakeven points early in the semester. And I kept raising my hand even when I didn't know stuff later, because there was literally no way he was calling on me (he pretty much just called on people from the other side of the room for the rest of the year for the tough ones), but I needed to keep looking like the guy who came prepared.",
