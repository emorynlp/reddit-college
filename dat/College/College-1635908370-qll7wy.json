  "text": "I'm a sophomore and this is my first year living on campus. I have a controlling roommate and another manipulative roommate. I'm so tired of living here. \n\nOn top of that, most people at my university keep to themselves, so it's really hard to meet people. \nI get homesick. Almost every single day. I miss my family and my old life so much. I'm tired of my roommates telling me what to do. I miss having people around me that actually care about me and let me be myself. Everyday is a headache. I'm planning to switch rooms when second semester starts, but until then, how do I keep myself happy? How do I make college more fun? And how do I stop being so sad? \n\nIf anyone could answer I'd really, really appreciate it. Like you have no idea. \n\nThank you so much.",

By \"roommates telling me what to do\", I mean that they tell me who to hang out with, what clubs to join, etc. I have no problem cleaning, I meant that I was just tired of them making decisions for me. \nBut joining clubs and going outdoors is definitely a good idea, thank you!",

Getting involved in clubs helps you meet people you\u2019re more likely to get along with and it helps to spend some time outside of your dorm!",
