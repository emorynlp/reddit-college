  "text": " I start classes in January and am trying to do this CS intro course beforehand so I can know a fair bit going in, but I have slacked for 2 weeks now. The course I am taking is luckily at my own pace but lacking motivation and being worn out from working all day then coming home to blow it off is getting really annoying. How do you guys find time to do work or find the energy to do it? I\u2019m not even in college yet but this is worrying me because of those upcoming classes and how I\u2019ll do there.",

      "text": "> The course I am taking is luckily at my own pace\n\nThat's more of a curse then anything. It's a LOT harder to keep up without outside scheduling and prompts.\n\nPersonally, \n\n* Made a 9-5 (ish) schedule so I am in class or studying at least 40 hours a week. Assuming some kinda Coursera class, maybe 9-12 5 days a week for you?\n* Gave myself Sunday off so that's my \"reset\" so if anything isn't caught up Saturday night I have to rush on that\n* If you are stuck in online unscheduled things, schedule a hard time block with labeled alarms. Also pay attention for when you have to be ready for \"class\" and give yourself 5 min to make tea and get set up\n* Use the pressure of other people to help you study! Tell your roommates you are studying x to y time, or go to a library, or stream your screen on Discord.",

If you surround yourself with people who value education you\u2019ll find that shit rubs off on you pretty quick haha",
