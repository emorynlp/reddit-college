          "text": "100% I was a pre-vet major taking all my gen ed at one college before I'd have to move out of my parents house to attend the college I'd get my bachelor's at. I got all the way up to organic chemistry and broke. I did everything right, studied for hours, went to office hours, got tutoring from the chem help center, but I was still always wrong. I decided to switch to wildlife and transfer for that instead of animal science and immediately stopped trying.\n\nMy grades did not get worse after I stopped studying and that really confirmed it for me. Not studying got me the same grades as working hard and it fucked me up for a little while. I ended up with a C- which was a 45%.\n\nNow I'm going into a paid master's program to study wild pig management. My undergraduate major in Wildlife had me studying trees and IDing birds out in the field, that shit was actually FUN! I wish I had known about this career field before beating myself up over having to be a vet. A career field is not worth losing your mental health over, find something \"passion adjacent\" to what you want to do. Chances are you'll find something just as good without all the heartache.",

The junior college didn't have much by way of arch classes, let alone a major, so when I went in to an advising appointment prior to my freshman year, the nice lady said I should be an art major for my 2 years at the junior college. I knew that was not what I wanted or what I would succeed at, but she pressured me into feeling that was the only option. So I did it and had 2 3-credit deep major-only art classes which I failed.

And try to avoid procastination (personal experience), it could leave you with burn out in the long run.\n* Don't forget to take care of your physical, emotional, and mental health throughout the entire semester. Exercise (even if it is just walking a bit), eat healthy but tasty, and keep up your relationships as much as you can. It is important to avoid crashing during stressful times.\n* Sometimes it feels like you are juggling chainsaws on fire with many aspects of your life, that is normal and it will be okay.\n* I love having little routine things I do to. Movie night on friday, drinking some mint hot chocolate when I have a bad day, stress baking during finals, etc...\n* I love having early clases (7 am or as early as possible), that way I have the entire afternoon and evening to do assignments and whatever I want.\n\nAnd there are more...",

One off day is okay, but two in a row is a no go.\n\n- Always study alone. It increases your productivity massively, so you\u2019ll get done with your work faster and have more time to *actually* hang out with your friends instead of hanging out with friends while trying to work. \n\n-  If you don\u2019t need to pay attention to your lecture to do well in the class, then do your homework or do something productive instead. UNLESS the professor is someone you want to do research with, take another class with, or get a recommendation from, in which case, be engaged.",

Self-diagnosis and abuse of medication makes it pretty hard for people to actually get evaluations and help.

Not unconventional but I've known too many people who don't follow this advice. \n\nIf a party seems to be getting big, leave. People start making stupid decisions (fighting, public indecency, etc.) and cops can show up. Don't get looped in for other people causing problems. \n\nThe college experience is different for everyone and relies a lot on the company you keep. People who act cool or do \"cool\" things (party, flake on academics, etc.) can be fun, but might not support you or set you up for success. The people who are involved in clubs/ study/ go to campus events can be the company actually need. Still talk with my nerdy involved friends and because I went that route I found my husband and a major/career that I thoroughly enjoy. \n\nKeep a list of need to do items for when you have spout of random motivation. This tip helped me keep my room relatively clean, fed with prepped meals, and on time for semester long projects. Motivation can be hard to get, so don't waste it when it pops up.",

      "text": "I have a few things that I\u2019ve come to realize in the last three years of college. \n\n1: It\u2019s common that, as a student, you have a few spare assignments that you\u2019re yet to finish that float around in your head. Despite this, you might find that you\u2019d like to just relax as if it isn\u2019t there. The anxiety of having work to do often ruins your ability to relax, but I\u2019d like to say that you need to tell yourself this line: \u201cmy work that I do the night before will be just as good as the work I do now. may as well enjoy my time today.\u201d\n\n2: Build a relationship with your professors. At the end of the day, you\u2019re there to learn and to perform academically. I hate to say this, but professors are people at the end of the day. They lean preference to the students who show care, attention, and interest in the topics at hand. This could play to your advantage when grading comes around and they see your name at the top left hand corner. \n\n3: Apply for internships, even if they seem to be trivial and show up as reminders in your email. I once applied for an internship that was quite elite and, I did it sort of with the attitude of \u201ceh. may as well. why not.\u201d I ended up getting a position out of a metric ton of applicants and I\u2019m no perfect student. \n\nSometimes things just work out, and sometimes you can\u2019t explain why things are falling apart. Just how college goes. Embrace that",

Go out on a weeknight, pull an all nighter or two, take that class that's out of your wheelhouse, change your major, ask that girl/guy/person out, wear clothing that's generally associated with people of another gender, get on the jumbotron at the sports game, have fun (nothing illicit of course).\n\nYou also learn a lot from your fellow students.

The professor will remember you more and will force you to get to class earlier\n\n-take whatever unnecessary courses you can take at a community center and mix it with uni classes to lighten your load\n\n-dont take all your easy or \"basics\" at the beginning, even them out across your years so your load isn't easy at the beginning and hard at the end\n\n-plan all the classes you will take till you finish school, this helps avoid missing out on classes that are only offered in spring or fall\n\n-if people help you help others. always help but be weary of people that take advantage\n\nFinished masters and bachelor's with a 4.0. it's easier said than done but all these things require discipline",

Whenever you are making a big decision, you should understand your position well enough to debate it with someone who disagrees with your decision. Being told by your parents or friends that an idea is good is no longer an acceptable justification. As an adult you are exposed to real life so being given sugarcoated opinions will not save you if you have a crappy idea.

No offense to any country but i did my internship in a sunny country where i had an amazing time and people at my internship gave me great grades and were much more chill compared to my home country. Worht the investment. This also meant that my internship place was already fixed and my school arranged most of it, so less stress and more time spend on other subjects.\n\nKeep relations with your classmates. Through them i got alot of very good summaries and exam questions that got asked every year. Sometimes we would also buy summaries online, share the costs and the summary. They can also explain things to you when you don't understand them. However don't be a leech, make sure to give some input of your own sometime.\n\nOfcourse you have to do some degree of work but thinking about your deciscions really makes a difference (if you're able too).",

If it's a one room dorm, ask if they can go somewhere else (or you go somewhere else). If it's more suite or apartment style, let them know someone's gonna stay the night.

Whether or not I fall into morning or night schedules this always works for me because it allows free time due to the routine-based study and homework habit. \n\nIf you can, get homework done two to three days early and utilize the rest of your homework time to studying for hard stuff. Best way to get this to work is to start off the bat really strong and get ahead as soon and as quickly as possible (if possible).\n\nMirroring the top comment, write drunk (or tipsy), edit sober.\n\nIf it\u2019s possible with your degree without adding too many extra classes, take a minor even if it\u2019s not necessarily relevant to your major course load. A lot of minor classes are incredibly interesting and can shape your experience in your major in ways you may not think\u2014i.e. My friend who is majoring in Business is minoring in Anthropology, and she believes the holistic knowledge of human beings and human functioning will heavily influence the use of her Business degree.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t have time to finish all of your reading assignments. That\u2019s OK. Find a method that works for you to prioritize deriving the most valuable information from each chapter. For me a lot of times this has meant going over the section names of the chapter, the key terms, the analysis and summary paragraph, and the summary points at the end of the chapter.\n\nZOTERO! I also use Scribbr online for APA citations!\n\nBalance work with fun, for real. Don\u2019t drive yourself insane. I like to sometimes even do 15 minutes of work and 20 minutes of fun lol.

I know our cost of attendance is outrageous and we probably need some policy changes regarding it. Unfortunately, the reality is that you will be better off in the long run if you pay attention to your finances while in school. Look into community colleges in the area for your gen eds, and consider taking some (or maybe even all) of your gen eds there to save money. Look into grants. Do work study, part time work, maybe become an RA or teachers aid. Avoid using student loans for things you don't need. (I've seen people get tattoos, buy sports cars, est with student debt and this is not a good idea)\nTrust me, you do not want to wait until you graduate to start paying attention to student debt, and you can take active measures to lower the cost of attendance while in school.",

Use ALL of the facilities your campus has to offer. \n\n\u2022 Other comments mention this but develop relationships with your professors because they could help you get your first job\n\n\u2022 Network with your classmates.

For most things, all you have to do is search for the doi of an article or type the title of a book you are referencing and it will auto fill all of the info. Once you're done writing, just choose the reference format (APA, MLA, etc) and it will create a bibliography/references section for you. Makes things so much easier when writing papers in upper level classes and grad school. It also lets you insert the reference numbers in the paper too. There's a notes function as well for you to make note of what was significant about the article in relation to your paper or whatever.",
