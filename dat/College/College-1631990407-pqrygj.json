  "title:": "I freaking love going back to college at 29 - Wrote a 802 word paper.",
  "text": "Found out that I am dyslexic and I relayed this to my English professor because I've always struggled with reading and writing so I knew this was going to be a challenge. She showed me how to talk type, how to use to the read out feature to help with editing or if I used a the wrong word (like embellishment and embezzlement). \n\n This is my 3rd trying to go back and I always left because I felt like I knew the information, I just couldn't get it from my head to the paper to show I did. I gather all my information, planned out my paper and wrote it in about 2 days. I don't feel stressed or rushed and I am super proud of it. To some 802 words paper is nothing but writing was always so hard. I am using the talk to text write now. This is so amazing.",
