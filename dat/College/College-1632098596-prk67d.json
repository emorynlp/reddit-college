  "title:": "I'm 24 transfer non-traditional and I can't remember basic math",
  "text": "So last year I took pre-calc and got an A in it, it was an online course due to corona and we were allowed to use graphing calculators and it wasn't that bad but math has never been my strongest area. I'm taking calc I at my new school and we are not allowed to use calculators and this has reminded me how bad I am at math. I can't remember basic freaking arithmetic let alone formulas and how to apply what to solve equations. I don't want take lower math classes to stay here longer but I'm thinking I need to take college algebra to remember how to do things properly and I feel so embarrassed that I can't do basic things. \n\n\nI scheduled a tutor appointment for my first two weeks for pre-calc and I'll see how it goes, but is it wise to drop the calc and just take math or is it possible to get away with tutoring. We have one more lecture tomorrow on prerequisites and then we are getting into the material, and the professor said if the prerequisite math doesn't come clear to me I will struggle in the course. \n\nLet me hear your opinions/experiences/advice. Thanks all",

      "text": "As others have suggested try Khan Academy and YouTube. I also recommend trying math problems that build your flexibility. \n\nFor example, solve 12x27 as many ways as possible. \n\nThis means don't just do the normal 27 over 12 way, but try breaking them up into numbers that are easier for you to handle. For example, you could solve 12x30 and then subtract 12x3. Another way is to break it up into (10+2)x(20+7) and practice distribution. Etc. \n\nThese problems are called Number Talks and you can find them all over the internet. Another great way to practice is to try to practice specifically Sum equations and expressions. Those are the things with the giant E that are adding numbers consecutively together. Sums are actually one of the main things used to prove that calculus works, so it may also help you have a better idea of what's happening. You can look up Discovering Calculus with Sums on YouTube. \n\nAside from this, you could do additional calc practice problems. Many are not comfortable with basic maths, but it's important to recognize that and realize that you can solve anything by breaking it down into chewable pieces.",

I believe tutoring can help you and also khan academy is a good free resource to help you. Also I think its BS theyre not letting you use a calculator for Calculus\u2026 at my school a TI84 was a required material for the Calculus 1 course.",
