  "text": "\nHey there guys, I am currently in my third year of college. I just transferred here after receiving my associates degree at a community college and I am studying to get my finance degree. The problem that I am having appears to be a loss of motivation. I do not want to go to college anymore and I want to get into sales. More specifically car sales as I have been working at a dealer for three years now as a porter. They have offered me a sales job before as I have extensive knowledge on vehicles. I know a few of the finance guys at my dealership have not went to college and are making well over 6-figures. Another problem that I am having is my parents. They want me to finish College and that\u2019s is the whole reason I am still in college. I feel like I would be a let down if I drop out. They have all told me that I would have to pay back everything they have spent on my college as they have paid for all of it. \n\nI am just so lost on what to do and some help from you guys would be great!\n\nTL:DR confused about college",

      "text": "At the end of the day, these last 2 years are a moment in your life. \n\nJust because your coworkers have found success without a college degree does not mean you will have the same experience. Depending on their age, they may have come of age in a completely different world than the one you're living in right now. \n\nWhat a college degree affords you is quite simple: options. \n\nYour extensive knowledge of cars is great and it's awesome that you're so good at your sales job, but you never know what the future brings. You never know what you may want to be doing in 10 years that requires a finance degree instead of a high school diploma and some years at a dealership. \n\nOn top of all this, your parents are paying for your education. \n\nUltimately it's up to you whether you continue school, but there are A LOT of people who literally CANNOT afford to go to university. You have 2 more years of your life to afford yourself options AND your parents are financing your degree. \n\nStick it out, go into sales after, have a degree as a back up later in life. \n\n\nIf motivation is your issue, go to your college's tutoring center. Find a peer group that can help you study and stay on task. Organize your calendar. Schedule an appointment with an in campus Psychologist to see if you have ADHD. It's irrational to throw away an education you're close to finishing on a career as fickle as sales.\n\nEdit: Also consider the move to Electric Cars and how companies like Tesla are trying to cut out the middle man, car dealerships. Long term as gas vehicles are phased out, car dealerships may be phased out as well.",
