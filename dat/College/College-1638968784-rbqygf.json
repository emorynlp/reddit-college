  "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI am doing a bachelor\u2019s degree in economy and I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to completing my thesis and moving on. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in your case, but I hate scattered notes and data mess. I\u2019m not a Word or Google Docs type of guy, so I\u2019ve tried out many apps on the market. Some are really good like Notion and Padlet. I also tried out a new app called xTiles which I really liked since it helps link different pieces of info using tiles in a pretty structured way. Haven\u2019t seen anything alike on the market, to be honest, so highly recommended.  \n\nAnyway, I wanted to ask you which tools you use and why cause my lil, sis is taking up studies soon. Would appreciate your insights.",
