  "title:": "Should I stay in school or take a semester off?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently 24 weeks pregnant and I\u2019m having to make the decision on whether or not to take next semester off of school since I\u2019m having my baby in the middle of the spring semester. \n\nIf I stay in school, the classes are in person and they are no longer offering online for the courses I need. I\u2019d have to be on campus for 10 hours twice a week to ensure I don\u2019t miss doctors appointments and can have childcare for my 4yo step daughter. Then I would have to hope that teachers will let me heal after labor, miss lectures, and let me do online work during that time frame. If I take time off of school, then I\u2019ll lose my financial aid. I know I\u2019ll be beyond bored the three months before my baby comes since I am a full time student and take care of my stepdaughter while my husband works. The only thing I\u2019d be doing is being a full time mom which was never my intention, it was only supposed to be temporary while I was in school. Plus, I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll lose momentum,  won\u2019t go back to finish my BA, and go back to working full time with the AAs I have instead. \n\nFor some context I\u2019m 24 yo and I still have 1 1/2 years left before getting my BA. I have already had to extend my schooling to 5 years and this would extend it to 5 1/2 years. \n\nWhat should I do??",

      "text": "Talk to or email the professors who will be teaching your classes next semester to see if they are willing to offer a remote/recorded lecture option. Explain your situation. They're human, too. Most likely they'll be able to work with you.\n\nI'm immune-compromised, and that's is what I did at the beginning of the quarter. One of my professors records class lectures for me to view asynchronously, and the other lets me Zoom into the lectures and records them as well. I can make Zoom appointments with both of them when I have questions or help that I need live assistance with.\n\nAs a general rule, you should always communicate with your professors when you need something. They can't help you if they don't know what's going on, and faculty have a considerable amount of power in the institution hierarchy when it comes to student needs.\n\nI hope this helps, and congratulations on your future baby. \ud83d\ude3a",
