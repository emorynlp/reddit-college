  "text": "I\u2019m a mature student and I\u2019ve noticed an unhappy trend of doing well on labs and assignments then completely shitting the bed on the exams. For example In my one class I have an average of 87.5 in labs and assignments a but get low 50\u2019s on the exams. I don\u2019t know what else to do\u2026\n\nIve spent days studying leading up to the exam and it never works out. Not being able to be tested has lead my GPA to the toilet. Any advice???",

      "text": "Fellow mature student.\n\nWhat has worked best for me is conceptualizing the material. As soon as I leave the class I write a summary of what I've learned and will make highlights for things I think are most important. When I get home I rewrite notes to explain it as if I were teaching it to myself. When I do my labs I really do the same. I analyze the experiments and think about why those different things happened and explain them the best I can scientifically. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI Always review in the morning over coffee for just 20 minutes a day. Keeps me remembering everything. You may need a little longer, but it's doable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ngood luck.",
