      "text": "Assuming you mean Georgia, USA, if you qualify for hope scholarship, you should be able to go to most public colleges in state almost for free. Most places after college don\u2019t care which college you go to as long as you have a degree. Unless Drexel is the only place you can get the degree you\u2019re going for, I really wouldn\u2019t recommend going into debt to attend a specific university. I had to turn down a college offer because I couldn\u2019t afford to go, even though my dad had gone to that university and I loved the campus. Going to KSU or UGA won\u2019t be the worst thing in the world if you can do it without debt. On that note, I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t graduated high school yet and have taken the SAT, but if you haven\u2019t yet, do so immediately to make sure you\u2019ll qualify for HOPE. As long as you have a good enough GPA, Hope can pay for a lot of schooling.",

              "text": "Thanks.\n\nEmory, GIT, and UGA all have great academic reputations. \n\nMy suggestion would be to attend whichever university required the least out-of-pocket payment on your part. \n\nIf you can\u2019t find a university that doesn\u2019t require borrowing money, I would attend a community college for your first two years then transfer. (That also gives you more time to choose a university and you would only need to borrow money for two+ years instead of four+ years. Many university departments offer transfer scholarships, and Phi Theta Kappa also offers scholarships to transfer students).",

      "text": "Drexel is pretty expensive, so make sure you know if you could afford it.  I think Drexel does provide a lot of financial aid which a lot of students take advantage of, and the co op do pay you, you have to look that up and see if you qualify.\n\nAlso, Drexel mean a lot of guarantee co-op for you, this is really the only up side in my opinion. And those really help you find a job after you graduate. However, those are bachelor level job, do you like the bachelor income level of your major, because if you are looking to get a graduate degree to increase your income right after, I won\u2019t recommend Drexel. Do those bachelor level job give you enough income to pay for all those loans? It is up to you to see if it is worth it.",
