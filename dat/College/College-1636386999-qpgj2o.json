  "text": "Soo I had an assignment due at 5pm today, but I didn't do it on time. I was pretty distracted and unable to focus the entire weekend (actually, I've not been able to focus properly for a while now), so I pulled an all nighter last night to make up for it and finish this assignment as well as some other things I had due. I did the other stuff, but then I had classes from 8am-12pm. I figured I'd do this particular assignment after 12 but I crashed and kept dozing off, so I missed the deadline\n\nIt's 8:50 pm right now, I'm halfway done with this assignment, but it'll take me at least 2 hours more to finish it, and even then it'd be subpar. It's 10 percent of my grade, and while I don't want to lose this 10 percent, I'll be so late in submitting that I have no clue if the professor would actually accept it. I've already submitted stuff late to her several times (twice it was only some minutes late and not even my fault, which I explained to her, and once I was very ill so I emailed her before the deadline for an extension and she gave me a 12 hour extension) so I don't want her to think I keep doing assignments late on purpose.\n\nSo when I do submit it, what should I say to her? Or should I even bother with submitting at all now?",

      "text": "Always submit it. Even a 50% is better than 0 in terms of your class average.\n\nYou don't *have* to say anything or make up some excuse, but if you feel you need to reach out to her just let her know you apologize for the late submission & that you do take the class seriously.",
