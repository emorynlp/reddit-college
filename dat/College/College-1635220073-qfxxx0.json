  "title:": "Is it worth it to switch majors so late into my degree?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m currently in my third year at uni, however it is going to be my last before I get my undergrad since I had a bunch of credits from high school to help out. I\u2019m currently a finance major. I like it and I\u2019m interested in it, but ever since high school I\u2019ve truly been passionate about computer science. I took AP and other classes in HS, but never pursued it in college bc a lot of advisors made the program at my particular uni sound very hard to get into. Now I regret it tho, and really wanna pursue that field.\n\nMy question is, would that be worth it? None of my credits besides my general education requirements would transfer over, and I have no clue how long or how many more years it would take to finish the degree. Has anybody done something like that that can speak to if it\u2019s a smart choice? Or should I just finish out the next semester and a half with my current degree?",

After you get your bachelors you could do some bootcamps and/or online computer science classes to get your skills up and running and you could eventually pursue a masters in computer science, but finish the bachelors in finance first.",

Like someone else said, finish the finance degree and pursue CS on your own time, the combination is a strong one. Your degree will absolutely not prohibit you from pursuing a career in CS, so don't worry about that at all.",
