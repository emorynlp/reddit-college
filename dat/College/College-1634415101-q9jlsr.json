  "text": "It's Saturday today. I've made no plans. Had no plans yesterday. No plans tomorrow. I hang out with my friends when they're not working, but we don't do much! I don't mind spending time with friends doing things that aren't necessarily \"exciting,\" I like it, but I feel like I'm so behind. \nI feel like I should be going to parties. I feel like I should be branching out. I feel like I'm not truly embracing this college experience. I feel like I'm going to regret not doing anything fun once I graduate.\nI think I'm just looking for people who are in a similar situation? People who are the boring college student or don't regret being the boring college student? I'm fine with staying home on a Friday night. But then I see what other people are doing and it's really depressing to think about!",

People only post the fun bits, not them black out drunk and puking their guts out. \n\nIf you want to go be more involved or whatever then go do it, but if you don\u2019t then don\u2019t. Best not to dwell on what you could have done.",
