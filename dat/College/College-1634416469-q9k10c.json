  "text": "Parents, relatives, someone you love maybe? I'm taking classes where attendance is mandatory, and if I ever miss ONE CLASS, I'm out of track forever. It's nothing like a STEM class, you spend 2.5 hours with no online project description, you just write whatever they blabber down.\n\nI keep having these thoughts that what if something bad happens during class, and I have to leave immediately. I can't picture myself crying in class, would probably disrupt the class anyway. Will the professor excuse me if, god forbid, someone close dies and I have to leave prematurely?",

      "text": "I originally misread this post. As what do you do if someone dies in the middle of class.\n\nFirst things first assess the risks your classmates will probably be historical this is a risk. Many will be screaming and upset. As the certified first-aider you need to take control.\n\nCall for help, a guys just dropped unconscious. Check for breathing and secure an airway. If the casualty is breathing put them in the stable side position until the ambulance comes.\n\nIf the Person is not Breathing start CPR after checking that they don't have a do not resuscitate card on them. Do it to staying alive while directing some bistanders to call the ambulance and get a defib.\n\nIf they have a do not resuscitate card on them, and are not breathing after securing an airway. Best to leave them alone. Inform the ambulance, so their family can be made aware of there passing.\n\nAs for your question I would ask the tutor to be excused from class and inform your course manager you won't be in for the rest of the week.\n\nSome classesvhave good online portals you may be able to catch up from there",

      "text": "Freshman students are the students most likely to ask this question when I state cellphones are not allowed to be out or on during class.\n\nMy response is that campus police will come and find them to deliver bad news.\n\nI am a bit confused by \"permanently\".  You mean you die during class?  I do not think you would be concerned about your grade at that stage.  If you mean due to a mental health issue due to someone close to you dying this is would be an example of when a late W maybe applicable.",
