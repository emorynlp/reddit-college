  "text": "I have broke my back all year trying to get good grades in my nursing program while also trying to earn money for my tution bill which is much more than its normal cost- becuase my Dad made more money this year- but my Dad dose not pay for my college in any way nor will he help me now. But FASFA and the financial aid office don't care about that. I don't know what to do, the bill is due on the 15th and I have reached out to the finanical aid office multiple time since I got the bill statement and they have been no help. I don't know what to do, my savings account and checking account together are less than the price of the bill by $200 and I do not have anything else I can sell. I am a senior and this is my last semester so I am already in over $29,000 if debt and can not take out anymore loans. Then if I can some how get $200 I don't know how I am going to pay my insurnace, car payements, food etc. Usually my Fasfa covers the entire thing and I don't pay out of pocket. I habe no idea how I am going to survive.",
