I'll talk myself through it or journal. I don't ignore them or disassociate (used to). If you're up for it, plan a celebration for yourself, even if it's in private and it's small. I often like to get Pho or go to a Sicilian bakery. Nothing big, but I love 'em. Over time, this has helped me to make positive news less anxiety-provoking and purely exciting.",

I loved that job and had a really fun time, but I guess since it was my first real-world job experience it was really nerve racking (i worked fast food previously but tbh that job felt like a different dimension of life). I actually wore a fitbit to work and you could see my stress spike every morning as I was heading into office.. the app told me I was working out during that time LOL. I never really dealt with it though, I just powered through it and calmed down once I began to get settled in office for the day.",

I am sure there are doctors who prescribe a daily medication, but those are arguable more harmful to the patient than anxiety itself. I do not know of many people who would willingly sign themselves up for a higher risk of dementia later in life.\n\nAgain, those inflicted by anxiety will live with it for the remainder of your life.

          "text": "You're 100% correct. I would almost lump depression into the same category. \n\nOur internet society has made everybody a victim of depression and anxiety. We look at it like this external thing affecting our life. The thing is, WE ALL HAVE IT. It's the human condition. It's not something that only so many of us get. We all have it. \n\nI really really feel like people would be way better off knowing that they aren't alone in it and that everyone around them is suffering from the same exact thing. \n\nI can't count how many times I see on here \"My anxiety is keeping me from doing my assignments\". That's not the truth. You're keeping you from doing your assignments. Everyone else is getting it done, and everyone else is suffering from these things. It's not the anxiety that is keeping you from doing something. \n\nIt's important not to use anxiety or depression as a scapegoat or excuse as to why things aren't going straight. Accepting that your education is 100% your responsibility is important. I feel as though young people get sucked into this thing where it's terribly easy to blame anxiety or mental health when in reality, mental health problems are more than likely the outcome of the things they haven't been getting done. Instead of anxiety keeping you from doing homework, do the homework and the anxiety will decrease substantially. \n\nIn my adult life these are the skills you must learn to be in this world. I am proactive to take care of my mental health. I always do my assignments on time and I always study. Not because I'm an excellent student but because the debilitating feelings that come when I don't do that are not worth dealing with. \n\nWe are all victims of something. Adopting a victim complex to be able to push blame on everyone else but yourself is a shitty way to live. It makes for a horrible experience and puts you in a hole all by yourself. This isn't an easy lesson for young people to accept and they generally don't. It's like the world is against them but in reality, it's only the person setting the world up around them to be against them. Nobody deserves anything because of what they've been through.",

                  "text": "Definitely.\n\nAt some point, I really consider the fact that these pills just could be placebos. It's almost as if the side effects are the main way to tell that it's 'working'. Otherwise, they just induce a zombie state and destroy your libido.\n\nI think we are unfortunately poised to try to fix these problems with methods we are comfortable with. Instead of learning and teaching mental health strategies to young kids, we are throwing pills at them. We are used to pills, we use them for everything. We can sell pills!\n\nI feel like the truth to it is that depression is unfortunately a part of your own control. At this point, the industry around depression is pretty settled and I think it coddles to the idea that it's a disease that you're not in control of. It makes the person who is depressed become a victim to it like they can't do anything.\n\nThat's just not true. It's not easy, I know this. Realigning the way you look at things is so incredibly important to getting out of depression. Depressed people generally focus on negatives and find it difficult to even find positives about things. That requires a shift in your thought pattern to reinstate positive thinking.\n\nIt's frustrating in certain ways. I've been through the process and it's never exactly fun or effective for me. I feel like the whole depression industry has it made. They've got people convinced that it's a crippling disease that is out of their control and that you need a psychiatrist and medicines to fix it. Commercials paint it in a way that you're the victim of of this horrible thing and that their medicine is the magical cure! Hell, the commercials even tell you how you're supposed to feel when you have depression. Commercials make you feel like the victim of depression then offer you this cozy solution where they'll take care of you and fix it.\n\nI feel like we've taken a normal part of being human and thrown it into an industry to monetize it. If we all believed that depression didn't require drugs to fix and that it was a temporary condition, things would be a lot different. We've shifted the responsibility of our happiness to a tiny pill marketed to us on TELEVISION to solve a problem that they spun into something else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I was searching youtube for depression medication commercials and came upon this one. It's way too spot on. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0v0jUeFGQ0",

                      "text": "I've lost people to suicide because others reacted to their asking for help with depression and anxiety with exactly the same kind of reaction you did. Acting like it's under one person's control and that they shouldn't need help to resolve depression and anxiety when there are perfectly good treatments like therapy, short term medication, or long term medication, all based on numerous studies for each condition, is what gets people killed. Listen to people. If you have kids, listen to them. If they say they can't control it, *they can't,* without help.",
