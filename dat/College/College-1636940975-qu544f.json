  "text": "Moved to a new state for college and didn\u2019t expect to get really homesick but here I am 3 months in and still getting bouts of bad homesickness. Everything I\u2019ve read says go out and engage in activities which I try to do and I have good friends here but some days I just want to sit alone in my dorm crying. Anyone have coping strategies for the bad days?",
