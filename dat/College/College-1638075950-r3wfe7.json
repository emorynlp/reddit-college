I studied physics and astronomy in undergrad, and I know for some of my upper level coursework I would spend 20 hours a week for some courses studying and working on problem sets\u2026 Probably for intro courses maybe around 9 hours per week.

I actually enjoy these classes honestly because they are challenging enough. But then of course all my applications classes utilize math and physics to solve problems but they are always lesser.\n\nI'm just trying to get a good measurement for my time next semester because I got a job off my associate degree (I'm doing 2+2 program) and I'm sort of really busy. Always busy! Gotta learn to love it I suppose.",
