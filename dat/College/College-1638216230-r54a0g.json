  "text": "As a lower half undergrad I\u2019m decently interested in one or two courses that require   Junior/Senior years. May I just pop in during those lecture hours a few times a month? Is this considered illegal or frowned upon? I understand I won\u2019t be receiving credit hours but would like to get some grasp on my future courses even if I won\u2019t understand the majority of the class.",
