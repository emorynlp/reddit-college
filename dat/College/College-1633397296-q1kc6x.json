  "title:": "Falling behind in General chemistry I, how do I catch up?",
  "text": "I ran into some unfortunate circumstances a few times this semester and I managed to miss one of the most important lectures so far (balancing equations, calculating molar mass, and finding % of atoms in a given compound) as well as not having enough time to get conversions down. I also missed the first exam (the lowest grade gets dropped thankfully but I cannot miss another). This class is going extremely fast and I do not think I have enough time to catch up. I\u2019m going to talk to my professor about this tomorrow and see if we can make a plan (I\u2019ve been going to office hours nearly every week to go over topics with him so I hope this will work out well). I just don\u2019t want to drop the class because it\u2019s a requirement and as much as I hate the math you have to start out with, chemistry is by far one of the most interesting subjects out there, and I\u2019m not going to give it up as one of my majors (the other being biology, I\u2019m doing a dual degree). I just wish there was a better way to skip to the part where chemistry is easy once you know the formulas (it\u2019s just retaining them I have trouble with). Any advice? I am in my sophomore year and currently taking A/P I, Cell bio, and precalc as well so it\u2019s a heavy course load. The other classes are fine but this one takes up a ton of time (especially since lecture is 3 hours at once).",

I\u2019ll check out organic chem tutor as well, but I know with tyler I can learn a concept in under 15 minutes (as opposed to an hour with my professor, he\u2019s nice but draws it out so much and makes everything way more complicated than it has to be with the over-explaining)",

      "text": "That stuff is fairly easy to get down. Khan academy is good. Also if you need some quick help or run into problems feel free to message me and I\u2019ll be happy to work you through each step of solving. The biggest thing in chemistry I was the practice. Practice, practice, practice. I got a 98% in Chem I and a 96% in Chem II. My tricks for the tests in Chem I were to (1) write down what units I had, (2) what I needed, and (3) look for the formula on the formula sheet which could fulfill all the requirements. No more than what you have and need, and no less than what you are already given. (I.e. Some formulas may be able to use 2 of your 3 \u201chaves\u201d, and solve for your 1 \u201cneed\u201d, but use the formula which has all 3 of what you\u2019re given and one of what you need.) if it helps you visualize it, treat it like a puzzle. You have all the pieces except one, and the formula is how you put them all together in order to find that last missing piece.",
