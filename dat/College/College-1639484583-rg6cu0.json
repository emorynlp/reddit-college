  "title:": "going to a competitive school but also being one of the dumber people there",
  "text": "I got into a top 5 university for the class of 2025, but I deferred for mainly for mental health issues. Next fall, I do know that I\u2019m going to be one of the dumber people there because my senior I barely learned shit and nearly flunked several classes (heavily due to my severe depression). I wanted to take a gap year to self study but I still haven\u2019t done it yet because of persisting depression. \n\nSo what mindset could I adopt to possibly motivate/encourage me to learn again? I used to love learning (did it quickly) and applying things I knew. Now that depression has caused anhedonia for me, I can\u2019t learn and thus be successful at MIT. \n\nPS: If this sounds pretentious or rude in any way, I apologize! Not my intention at all and please let me know if it does! External consciousness is something I struggle with (but too little and too much at times so I need to find a balance).",

      "text": "Your mental health is the most important thing for you to work on. The difference between children and adults, is that adults have learned how to function with their issues (there are a lot of grown up children btw).\n\nDepression and anhedonia do not go away quickly unfortunately. You\u2019ve had a chemical imbalance in your brain long enough that the nerve endings in your brain have become adapted to it. The current thinking is that due to consistently low levels of certain neurotransmitters in your brain, the nerve receptors diminish in number as they go unused. The result is there is less granularity to those triggers. Think 68/100 vs 2/3. \n\nIt means you lose the various levels of positivity and elation, further worsening you happiness. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nThe only way out of this (aside from medication), is to built and maintain habits that elevate those neurotransmitters. You need to make feeling good a regular chore until your body adapts back to regular mechanics. You\u2019ll need to except use regularly, eat healthy, and force yourself to be regularly social (think a coffee chat every few days).\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to avoid behaviors that reinforce poor brain chemistry such as alcohol and marijuana, video games, and excessive spending.\n\nLuckily your brain adapts like your muscles, so you\u2019ll start seeing results in a month or two. You\u2019ll feel like a zombie at first, but the point is to force your brain chemistry to change.\n\nMIT admitted you because they believe in you. You\u2019ll do great once you understand and can control your mental health.",

You were smart enough to get into MIT and I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t accept you if they didn\u2019t think you could handle the work anyways so you will be fine. Also even if you are the dumbest person who cares? You literally go to MIT and most people know about the grade deflation there as well so you\u2019ll be totally fine.",
