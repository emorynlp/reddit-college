  "text": "(I know I posted about this already, but I have an update).\n\nI have mental health issues so I tend to ruminate big-time on upcoming events. \n\nI\u2019m taking 5 classes of 16 cumulative credits this semester (one class is zero credits but a graduation requirement). \n\nThere\u2019s this online asynchronous course that I\u2019m just not doing well in, nor am I all that enthused to even try in it anymore, so I think the lesser of two evils would be to withdraw from it before the withdrawal deadline, which is next week. \n\nThis would be the first course I\u2019ve ever withdrawn from. There\u2019s a midterm due today for it that I\u2019ve been putting off and putting off and now I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do it (I don\u2019t even think I have enough time at this point). I just haven\u2019t really understood the material and it has caused a lot of constant lurking anxiety for me. \n\nIn fact, this introduction course has made me realize that Public Relations isn\u2019t really for me, so I\u2019m probably going to switch to Journalism and Media for my degree, also. I\u2019ve checked Degree Works and the only difference is that the PR course I plan to withdraw from wouldn\u2019t count for the Journalism major, so I wouldn\u2019t put myself behind, really, just might have to take 5 courses (20 credits) next semester to make up for it. \n\nI have decent grades in all of my other classes, so my pace calculated should be fine as long as I pass the other classes I\u2019m taking. \n\nTomorrow I\u2019m going to take the trip to campus to see if I can withdraw from it with no academic or financial consequences. Each class that\u2019s worth any credits is listed as 4 credits each, so if I read it all correctly, I\u2019d still be at 12 credits *and* qualify as a full-time student if I were to withdraw from the one class (16-4=12). \n\nMy school has flat-rate tuition of 12-20 credits, or 3-5 courses, being a flat-rate cost. Financial aid essentially pays for everything. \n\nMy anxiety has got me super wound up regarding tomorrow. If I end up potentially being charged for withdrawing from that course, then I\u2019d likely have to just stay in it and eat that bad grade factored into my GPA. I\u2019m so worried that I totally screwed myself here. Ugh.",
