A few job prospects examples are Economist, Financial risk analyst, Data analyst, Data Scientist, Financial planner, Accountant, Economic researcher, Financial consultant, Investment analyst, Actuary, work in the public sector and a lot more. \n\nI always suggest people to double major tho. Economics can be more useful when paired up with something else. The other major depends on your interests and goals.\n\nIf you have any other question about Econ feel free to ask me!",

              "text": "Let\u2019s talk about what you have, then. Did you join any clubs relevant to your majors that you could talk about in your resume? Any executive/leadership positions? Volunteered? What skills do you have besides what you learned in class? Nowadays, no matter what your degree is, having coding skills is SUPER relevant, specially for quantitative economics. \n\nTalking about your resume, did you go to the career center in your school to have help and someone else seeing your resume? Made a mock interview to feel better prepared? Always remember you are paying for those things, so use them for your own benefit as much as you can.\n\nThe good thing about Econ being \u201cbroad\u201d is that you don\u2019t have to focus on only one type of internship. You could try applying to Tech related internships as well, depending on your skills, and explore to see what you like. Don\u2019t forget to always change your cover letter accordingly to what the job posting is looking for. This may make the whole job application process longer, but I\u2019ve seen many people saying it actually works. Show the company you are interested in the job, and that they should also be interested in you.",
