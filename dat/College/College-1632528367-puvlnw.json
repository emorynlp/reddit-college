  "text": "I'm a second year but this is my first year on campus - my first week actually and the reality hasn't settled in. It just feels so weird. I low-key feel numb to my emotions because this all feels like a dream that I'll be waking up from soon, or at least I hope.\nI don't mind it but feeling numb has made me less focused in class because none of this feels real and I feel weird doing school again.",

They offer a tour + free candy at the end, & there's a factory store where you can get a big bag of jellybeans.\n\nThere's also Old Sacramento, 20 minutes in the other direction.\n\nI used to live in the area. In fact, a friend of mine went/goes to UC Davis.",

Looks like they're doing Fright Fest - kid-friendly Halloween stuff in the daytime, not-so-kid-friendly stuff at night. I believe they also do a Christmas celebration sometime between Thanksgiving and the New Year. This is one park you might want to visit throughout the year, so you should consider getting a season pass.\n\nAlso, around Christmastime, part of Vacaville turns into a showroom for Christmas decorations. They call it \"Candy Cane Lane.\" It's basically local residents decorating their homes. IIRC, they even give you a map of participating houses.",

It just seems kind of late compared to when most people move to college in New England.\n\nRest assured, you will get used to your college campus and the surrounding area! It\u2019s an adjustment period for everyone when they first move away from home, and I can only imagine how you feel as a sophomore who had their freshman year online due to the pandemic. Hang out with people, go on outings around campus and beyond, anything to make campus feel like home!",
