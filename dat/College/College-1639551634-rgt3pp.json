  "text": " Basically title. Sophomore in college, severely regretting decisions that led to me watching 16 lectures at 2x speed before a final exam tomorrow (not like it's gonna help - this is a math exam so doing well on the exam needs practice... which I don't have).\n\nI can't place the blame on extenuating circumstances, other than the possible psychological toll we all suffered because of the pandemic. None of my close family have gotten super sick; I've not been working part time jobs, nor has my family suffered any hardships of an economic nature. I literally have no excuse other than.... I procrastinated, and now facing a potential C+ in my discrete math course. As someone who's thinking of doing an MS, this is a HUGE oopsie - unless I literally get straight A's for the next 3 semesters.\n\nI suffered productivity in all levels - stopped turning in hw for a foreign language class (did super well on exams + hw's not weighted much = good grade), and procrastinated (but managed to pull of) projects for another coding class. But MATH isn't something you can clutch, it requires practice and consistent work which I didn't put in. And I have no clue why. I didn't introduce new distractions this semester, nor was I in time-consuming extracurricular activities.\n\nI'm not sure if interest in the subjects is an issue. I'm interested in probability (2nd half of this math course), and the coding course was super interesting as well. I took the foreign lang. class purely out of interest; it's not even a grad. requirement. Is the solution to my problem \"Just Do It \u2122 \" and read some type of habit-building book for next semester? Is there something else I'm missing? I didn't always used to be like this! I was able to do very well in high school and do several extracurriculars which is why I got into my college, but now this spectacular crash & burn is quite worrying.\n\nP.S. My math prof is quite a caring guy and I was originally about to email him with my story of woe but this is sth I'm quite ashamed of - hence opting of reddit anonymity. Is emailing him a good idea?",

There is nothing to be ashamed of, I was in a similar to yours situation.\n\nP.S. Maybe some of those [tips](https://ivypanda.com/blog/how-to-actually-enjoy-studying/) would help? If not, what about your rest time? May it be that the reason for your drop in motivation is the fact that you didn\\`t get enough rest (it was my problem)?",
