  "text": "Hi,\n\nI've been taking notes since 10am - 11am this morning till 2pm - 3pm. I'm using a system called Guaranteed 4.0 and notice that now I can't focus and feel mentally tired. Is there a limit in the brain for taking notes? I'm also taking notes by hand and am still on my first chapter. Thankfully, I'm only taking two classes.\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "While there's technically not a limit to how much information your brain can intake (given time at least), there is absolutely one for how much it can process. Several hours of consecutive note taking is simply information overload, and truth be told, you're unlikely to remember much of anything you write down. You being unable to focus and being tired are symptoms of this.",
