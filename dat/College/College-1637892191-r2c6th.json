  "text": "I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! \n\nHow can I stay healthy in college and avoid the freshman 15?\n\nWell, I\u2019m actually a sophomore now and I\u2019ve gained 30lbs if not more in weight since I moved in my freshman year. I used to run on my treadmill in my basement about 5 nights a week before college. But I just get too self conscious running in front of people, especially being in the shape I am now. That makes it even harder to get back into it.\n\nI\u2019ve been having self confidence issues in my appearance and every time I look in the mirror and see my overweight self I just get very embarrassed to the point that I hate seeing family and friends that knew me when I was skinnier.\n\nAt college I literally have nowhere to workout and the treadmills at our rec center are all lined up next to each other right by the window for the whole campus to see, and I definitely have gym anxiety.\n\nJust asking for some tips to stay healthy by eating better and exercising more.",

      "text": "I\u2019m sophomore as well and when I go to college I seem to lose weight. First thing you want to do is try to work out in the morning ( probably around 7am ) or at night ( 1 or 2 hours before your colleges gym closes) for breakfast eat oatmeal topped with some fruit or buy a Nutri bullet and make smoothies every Morning. For lunch make sure you drink water before you go down to dinning halls because it will help stopping you over eating. Another thing too is try to eat salad at least once a day. You want to avoid/limit eating greasy/fried or unhealthy foods(pizza and fries) and eating out. Dm me if you have any more questions",

          "text": "Chewing your food more will also help avoid overeating and trick you into feeling fuller with less, as well as help to avoid gas by not swallowing as much air when you eat. Drink lots of water throughout the day and have less soda and alcohol. Also, get in the habit of taking less food than you think you need at the dining hall. You can always get up and get more if you\u2019re still hungry, but if you have to get up to get more, you\u2019re less likely to feel as hungry and feel like you have to eat everything you take. For example, start with just salad and water. Then if you\u2019re still hungry, get back up and get some meat. And if you\u2019re still hungry after that, then you can get some pasta or something like that. And if you start feeling full, recognize that and recognize that you don\u2019t have to finish what you take. You should never feel uncomfortable after you eat. Also, try to avoid eating less than an hour before you go to sleep.",

Isn't it hard for any American to make healthy choices given the food industry in this country, much less low-income Americans living in food deserts?

A lot of us do, not many admitting to it.\n\nNow granted, I would never walk into the weight room of my gym where all the super buff people are, that\u2019s a whole other mental challenge in itself. \n\nBut when I walk into a gym, no matter how tall, short, skinny, overweight, etc., all I ever really think of is \u201cwow, they seem to be working really hard!\u201d for whatever goal they are striving to achieve. Maybe I\u2019m just always trying to stay positive, I don\u2019t know :)\n\nThere is a quote from Will Rogers from a movie or something about how as you grow older, you realize that people really were not thinking about you as much. And no, this isn\u2019t supposed to sound depressing or sad and it\u2019s not about like family or friends! I like to think of it more about how people spend way more time thinking about how people perceive us rather than actually thinking about the person themselves. I mean *think* about it, here we are worrying so much that other people are going to judge us. Who is to say that all the other people in the gym aren\u2019t thinking the exact same thing?\n\nI say just go for it! Going to the gym is a great confidence booster in itself too, and your body and mind will thank you.\n\nI recommend yoga! It is my favorite, it\u2019s a closed environment typically, and you can sit in the back if you want to!

If your only goal is losing weight, then cut your calorie intake by ~30% (don\u2019t quote me on that exact number, but it\u2019s in that ballpark) and eat more dense calories that will keep you full for longer.  There\u2019s definitely ways to eat well on a college budget.  That said, I would **highly** recommend running for general health - regular vigorous exercise is a small cost for huge benefit.  Personally I\u2019d say ditch the treadmill and run around the neighborhood.  It gets you fresh air, and it\u2019s really enjoyable to explore new parts of town.  IMO using a treadmill is the equivalent of drinking an unflavored soylent shake in place of a nourishing meal.  It might fill the same nutritional requirements as a hearty balanced breakfast, but without the pleasure of eating.  That\u2019s just me though.  Either way, running is a great idea, and you absolutely shouldn\u2019t let self-consciousness get in the way",

I can run on a treadmill for a bit, but then it's also easy to jump on a bike or the rowing machine or the elliptical if I want to work out a few different muscles and extend the workout for longer. And you can switch up a session with weights too between sets of cardio, so you're both encouraging fat loss *and* muscle gain. \n\nIf you only do running then you might develop a \"runner's body\", which is more fat and less muscle than you might expect. Fat has a higher energy storage capacity than muscle for the same weight, so if you only ever go running, and you run a lot, your body is going to try to make you as efficient as possible by burning unused muscles and packing on more fat. That works great for runners, but maybe isn't what most people are looking for when they say they want to lose weight or get fitter.",

Now you're an adult with responsibilities, and no longer doing the simple 5-6 high school classes per day. Now you're not only spending your time in school and doing homework, but also possibly working. It's more difficult to plan out your schedule than it was before. It's not known as the \"Freshman 15\" for nothing, you and a LOT of other students are experiencing it for the first time as well. \n\n  \nWatch your diet. It's really easy to get busy and behind on all your work and schooling, so it's easier to just eat out. Meal prep instead. Don't drink. Don't party. Don't eat late at night before bed, or stay up late for that matter (increases cortisol). \n\nSet aside at least 45 minute to an hour per day to get some sort of activity in. If you're not ready for the gym yet, start walking, with some brisk jogging here and there if you can. Just get out of the house, and stop sitting. Walk instead of driving if you can, that's what shed my pounds off. Especially going to the local stores for food and snacks.   \n\n\nAvoid eating carbs and sugars, which unfortunately are often the cheapest items on the menu and in grocery stores. Fish and chicken are your best meats, and load up on salad (watch the dressing). If you have a meal plan with your college, then it's even easier. Sugar and carbs are not your friend.\n\nOh, and drink lots of water and unsugared tea to fill yourself up! I love Earl Grey. \n\nHappy thanksgiving and I hope you got turkey!",

The amount of calories in pop or milk or juices is substantial and a very easy way to cut calories. Next I would look for healthier options that you can tolerate. Food is essential to college students and just eating bland or disgusting food that is healthier just makes one lose motivation to push through it. If you like fries, substitute baked chips instead. If you like chicken sandwiches, tried grilled chicken sandwiches. It doesn't have to be the absolute healthiest option, but it should be healthier than what you were doing before. \n\nNext is the gym. It is essential to note that no one cares who you are or what you look like at the gym. They've all got their own reasons to be there. This brings me right along to what is probably the most important factor of this entire thing: motivation. In order to properly start and push through the first few sessions, you need some goal to drive you. For me, it was getting over a girl I had significant feelings for. I hated what I saw myself as and decided I would not accept the reality I was in at the time and knew I could better myself. I went there to get physical pain to replace the emotional and mental pain. You need to find some goal that is your north star, your guiding beacon to bettering yourself. It can't be general like \"look better\" or \"lose weight\" because those fall off very rapidly. Find something deep inside yourself that you know for certain you want to change (and can actually do something to change) and incorporate that into motivation to go to the gym. \n\nTldr: drink water, eat marginally better than you were before, no one gives a shit at the gym, find concrete meaningful motivation to pursue this weight loss journey because going just to \"lose weight\" will not stick.",

I've just started up again after a long while of over eating. I hate it, but I think there's also value to knowing what we put in our bodies. I never knew there was such a difference between types of yogurt, for example, til I started looking at the nutritional information. I was able to cut back a lot of sugar that way :)",

      "text": "OK let me give you some advice how to address this should you be so inclined to do so.\nYou have acknowledged what's going on that's the 1st step, 2nd step determining if you want to do something about it. If yes then you're gonna need to make some changes if no keep doing what you're doing. If the answer is yes take a look at what your schedule looks like for this term this term and realistically what can you do if you have a 3 hour break between your morning class and your afternoon class realistically would you be willing to go to the gym between those 2 classes if you hang around on campus and don't need those hours to study. There are usually indoor tracks or ellipticals in gyms even a rock climbing wall these days typically. So maybe decide OK between this class and this class I'm gonna go walk a couple miles on the track in the gym. Listen to some music maybe an audiobook and just get in the zone and spend an hour walking around the track or something like old ladies Do it shopping malls do some laps walking is probably the easiest way to burn off calories that that is convenient and not overly physically stressful. Can you afford to change your diet currently.. If you're on a meal plan on campus are there healthier options available that are within the same price point of what you're currently eating can you eat salad instead of Chick-fil-A for the same rough price. If so maybe start making those changes if you can't figure out where else you can make a change like if you're spending 20 bucks a week on groceries living off campus instead of using a dining plan card and you really don't have a whole lot of options but to eat say ramen four night a week.  And calorie wise stick to less healthier foods because they're cbecause they're cheap and actually fill you up meal wise. I would say OK you can't make changes to your diet but you can't make changes to your physical activit's true physical activity considering most schools include membership to a gym and access to the school gym as part of tuition. So take a look at what you can do physical activity wise practically and and maybe take a look to see realistically if there are some other things you can do. If you drink a lot maybe consider switching to a lower calorie alcoholic beverage the lower calorie stuff typically may not taste as good but but it's usually a little bit cheaper than the Then the normal stuff Beer wise at least. \n\nPerhaps if you have time join in intermeral sports team works team they practice usually once or twice a week but it's a good Way to additionally socialize on campus play a sport and just be active in a fun environment in addition to the fact it's something to do that will get you moving. Perhaps also if you have the finances available and it's feasible perhaps instead of taking the campus shuttle transport to and from classes if you can safely do so maybe you get a razor scooter or a bike and transport yourself that way rather than driving a car or riding the bus.\n\nBut just see what you can do and what can you practically fit into your schedule , What choices do you have in front of you that you could realistically make to have a positive impact on the situation should you want to change it.\n\nIt's all about consciously making a choice to the best of your ability given the circumstances both academic financial financial and activity wise. You have to manage your time your schedule and your activities in college it's just part of figuring out adulthood. Good luck sorry if I couldn't be more helpful",

Yeah sure, being more in shape gives people a bit more confidence, but you should be confident whether you\u2019re in shape or not. Your friends and family care much more about your personality and who you are as opposed to your body weight.  \n\nI\u2019d say try to push through gym anxiety, if other people are trying to judge you while you\u2019re working out, screw them.  I used to be incredibly self-conscious working out in the gym, but I realized that literally everyone there is also trying to get in shape and become better versions of themselves, except for the few just trying impress girls.  Don\u2019t worry about what other people might be thinking of you - everyone at the gym will mind their own workout, only reason they might be interested in what you are doing is if you are using a machine they want to use!\n\nAlso, last point, I think it\u2019s less about exercise and more about what you eat.  Losing weight is like 80% based on diet, and less about exercise.  Like the other posts say, alcohol is surprisingly a ton of calories per shot.  Also, if you eat at the dining halls, make sure to limit your portions and not to drink any sugary drinks.",

Do not go full keto but cut down the carbs and when you eat bread stay away from the childish wonder bread crap and go for whole grain higher quality. \n\nThe gym part is secondary. Find a friend who you trust who is likeminded. If you have anyone already on a fitness regiment then see if they would be open to working out with you. Having a team mate is great for confidence and accountability. Also you may encourage each other to try more than just the treadmill, explore weights, calisthenics, rowing etc\u2026 as you explore new workouts you may find new activities you like and overcome things you are weak at (which is a great way to overcome self consciousness). Start thinking in terms of things you \u201cneed to get better at\u201d and not \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d.\n\nIf anyone judges you then the shame is actually on them because if anyone is making an attempt to take care of their health and mental well being then they deserve an applaud. Starting that journey is the most courageous act and you would be surprised to find out how many people you think are judging you are actually supportive.",

Drink water throughout the day, count your calories, stay in a reasonable calorie deficit, and work towards incorporating physical activities into your daily routine. If you're not comfortable going to the gym, go for long walks and get some adjustable dumbbells to use at home. \n\nIf you are a healthy individual with no allergies or special dietary needs, it is better to portion control before you starting cutting certain foods out of your diet.",

Repeat 4 times, then for my 25 minute break I will do a dance workout on YouTube or something!\n\nIt's also really helpful for me to kind of have a routine for setting up my workout stuff. If my dorm is cleanish, and my yoga mat is set out before I start studying it's WAY easier for me to transition from studying to mini workouts. \n\nI have the same insecurities that you have going to the gym, so instead of running on a treadmill there is a trail on my campus that is always empty so I will run there instead!",

      "text": "If your goal is to just lose weight, this can be done almost entirely through diet. The easiest and most effective way is to simply cut calories. Measure how much you eat throughout a day. Keep track of the calories; you can use Google to get calorie estimates on your foods as you eat them. \n\nNow start operating at a deficit. For me, I simply cut out 1 meal a day, and that was breakfast. This will be difficult at first. You will get quite hungry. But after about 1 week of refusing to eat breakfast, it became totally normal. Felt like nothing changed, and I felt just as satisfied with 2 meals rather than 3. \n\nThis is more-or-less a 16 hour fasting schedule, where I eat all of my day's calories within an 8 hour window. Because of this extended time without food, I can easily go 24-36 hours without any sort of food at all and no ill effects. I don't even feel hungry on days I am forced to skip lunch. It is great.\n\n>At college I literally have nowhere to workout and the treadmills at our rec center are all lined up next to each other right by the window for the whole campus to see\n\nYou don't need exercise equipment to exercise. You can run wherever you want. You can walk. Calisthenics can be performed anywhere you physically have enough room to adopt the position required to perform calisthenics. You can also get resistance bands and a set of kettle bells for easy strength-training at home w/o special equipment.\n\n**TL;DR:** Cut calories. It is by far the most effective and easiest way to lose weight. Consider skipping 1 meal a day.",

      "text": "College athlete here, spent most of my career doing cuts and bulks to try to be more competitive. It's not as difficult as you think, as long as you get on a system you stick with. If you approach food as fuel and eat with intention you'd be shocked how much you can change and get on board with. \n\nDiet is 75-90 percent of it. Eat to be \"not-hungry\" instead of to be full. Get some more protein and fats in your day instead of carbs, they keep you satiated for longer. Personally, I recommend tracking macronutrients if you really want to get serious about it (like counting calories but better cause you can actually feel full a decent amount of the time) but even those two small changes help a ton.\n\nI used to carry a bag of trail mix on me when I was dropping weight, I'd have that and dinner so whenever I'd get hungry through the day I'd take a few handfuls from the bag and be good. It's a tad extreme, takes a few adjustments, don't recommend. Maybe add a light breakfast in, or lunch. Make sure you get hydration and enough fruits/veggies when you do have a big meal.\n\nNot keeping a lot of snacks around helps too. I have this on-and-off habit of eating when I'm bored, which can't happen if there's nothing to eat and all my prepared food is gonna take too long. Having to make food means I'll eat when I'm actually hungry and motivated to cook, instead of on impulse. \n\nExercise helps but as long as you get your 60 minutes in you should be fine. I will say building some muscle or consistently working out drives up your NEAT, so you require more calories just existing and therefore can fit more food in your day. That's always nice.",
