  "text": "Cut straight to the chase:\n\nI\u2019m majoring in music composition, and it is a field that does not make much money by nature (unless you\u2019re\u2026 really good.) I really want to apply myself in the time that I am in college to achieve a living that is fun (through my music degree) also one that gives me a decent living. I also want to major in trumpet performance to supplement that degree, although I\u2019m not necessarily on that path, and I may not choose to do so. Depends on whether I decide to also major in a profitable field.\n\nI was pretty good at mathematics in high school, did well in mostly all subjects. (Aside from maybe English classes). What advice do you have for this?",

      "text": "A minor works as a supplement. It doesn't really stand on its own. For instance, a CS major with a business minor is good because your CS major shows your quant skills and your minor shows your aptitude for soft-skills and general knowledge on business. A business major and a stats minor works well because you have strong business knowledge and can leverage statistical skills to do roles like business analytics.\n\nMath doesn't really support music to make you a more attractive job candidate unfortunately. Besides teaching, or as you say, being very, very good, you're pretty shit out of luck for profitable work for your degree.",
