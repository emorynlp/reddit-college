  "text": "So I've worked really really hard on assignment . Given that  it's one of the class I have the most difficulty with, I was very proud of all my work and was expecting an excellent grade.   \n\nI got a bad grade (barely passed) and cried because of it. I've calmed down now, but I feel a bit ashamed (even if I was on my own) &  childish because it seems like such a middle/high school thing to do. \n\nIs it something you still do ? I hadn't done it in a very long time  (maybe not since my first year in college)",

I would still have little breakdowns my senior year but found that taking a long walk through the nearby national park to be relaxing and clear my mind. I would spend 8+ hours out there after exams where I especially felt shitty about the outcome. It\u2019s not childish, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it!",

You\u2019ve just got to make sure not to beat yourself up over bad grades. Learn from the mistakes and use that knowledge to help you do better on future similar assignments. Also make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep. Sleep really affects your mental state and can leave you in a really bad place emotionally.",

I had a lot to catch up on because of how far behind I was. My GPA was a 1.4 in my 2nd year of high school and when I graduated it was a 2.8 which isn't amazing to most people but was a gigantic accomplishment to me. \n\nNow in college I have really good study habits for the most part with a few exceptions. I'm taking Physics II and I've failed 2 exams now. The first exam I thought I study well enough but it wasn't what I was expecting compared to my previous course. Now the second exam hurt because I actually studied a lot for it and still didn't do well. Better than the first one but not good enough to pass. I felt so stressed after that test and went for a walk with my dog to help clear my head. At that moment when I got my score I felt useless. I've come to terms that if I fail I can just take it again and do better. Also I don't like physics class I find it so boring I actually prefer my Calc II class over Physics II",

Once I see the grade distribution I see how well I stack up compared to the average. Typically, there are going to be some subjects you just struggle with but if you stick with it you'll be fine. None of this matters in 5 years I promise you. Once you land your first job it's cool.",

      "text": "I used to question a colleague of mine who completed their studies in Europe. Generally, the attitude is more relaxed around grading. Instead of focusing on the grade one makes, one generally is concerned about one's own well being in combination with classes and university requirements. Now obviously, this is going to differ based on what you career goals are. However, a \"B\" with minimal stress and a good social life is better than an \"A\" with high stress and no social life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust pass the class and move on. Focus on learning. The grade will follow.",
