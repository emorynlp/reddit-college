  "text": "So I found this really nice apartment near campus for only $500/month which is quite affordable compared to some other apartments here. It's really clean and has a lot of windows for natural light. It's also conveniently located near a coffeeshop, Costco, some fast food restaurants, and a gym. Although it seems like it would be kind of awkward for me to be the only guy in the apartment if I decide to move in.",
