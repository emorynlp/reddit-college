  "title:": "professor gave me an \u201c incomplete\u201d grade despite me having never requested one.",
  "text": "i\u2019ve never had to request an incomplete, but as far as i understand, this is how you go about getting one at my school. you have to request it from the professor, make an arrangement for a deadline for missing work, and the contingency grade is F. However, i never made a request for an incomplete, and that\u2019s what my professor entered into the final grades. i made my deadlines and turned in all assignments except for one minor one from the beginning of the quarter. everything that was turned in was accepted by the professor. my final paper was not graded, however, and has a 0 grade in the online grade book. he left no explanation for why it received a 0 grade (i\u2019m fairly polished with research papers, expected a B or A on it). now, a couple days after grades have come out and i have contacted the professor about the incomplete, he will not get back to me. i\u2019d rather not wait out the contingency period and just go over his head to get this resolved before the next quarter, but i cannot get any answers as to who the next person is that i should talk to. advisor? the dean?? I\u2019m tempted to call the phone number he left on the syllabus and confront him that way, but i\u2019d rather not have to do that.",
