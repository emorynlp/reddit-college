  "text": "i have no one to help me out rn so i\u2019m asking here. i\u2019m in college atm and am thinking of dropping out of this current one and transferring to another. i don\u2019t feel like i fit in at this college, smth feels off. no matter how many great people i meet i feel disconnected with everything. idk how to properly describe it but yeah. i\u2019ve been to other schools where i did feel like i\u2019d enjoy it there but this was the cheapest school and now i\u2019m rethinking things. so i was thinking of just taking the spring and summer time to really think about what i want from college, what it is i really want to do, and also where it\u2019s best for me to attend (environment and program wise). am i going about this right? anything i should ask myself before officially dropping out of this school?",
