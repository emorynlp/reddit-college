I had studied all day but it still didn\u2019t feel like enough. What made it worse was that my eyes were strained from looking at a screen all day. I looked at my test in disbelief that I actually knew a good portion of the information (ended up with an 81 after failing multiple exams before that). So just relax and know you\u2019ll do great. Study the vocabulary and major concepts first. You have to understand the big picture before looking at the specific details.",
