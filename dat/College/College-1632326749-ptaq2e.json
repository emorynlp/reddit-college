  "title:": "How should I go about transferring out of an awful university?",
  "text": "Context: Sophomore (Mechanical Engineering Major 3.5GPA)\n\nI applied to a number of colleges while in high school and was accepted to nearly all of them. After working through the financial aid offers I narrowed my choice down to a university that I believe would've been more than satisfactory. However, life and COVID got in the way and I needed to change to a local university at the last minute. I'm in the fall semester of my sophomore year and I can honestly say that I have been having an awful time. It's a rule of thumb that any class with the word \"engineering\" in the title is going to be taught by an incompetent teacher. The university poorly handled COVID and instead treated the whole pandemic as a way to make more money (charging extra for online classes/new fees for dropped classes). This semester alone I needed to deal with being stalked by a random student in one of my classes and basically needed to file a restraining order against them. My grades are still decent/good but this place is sucking the life out of me. \n\nBasically, I would like some input on what I should do/how I should approach transferring out of this university by the end of my sophomore year.",
