  "text": "So after not being in school for 6 years I decided that I wanted to return to school but when I was talking to a councilor they told me I was still in academic probation and to just pass my classes this semester and ill be okay. um 2 months have gone by and im not doing that great 1 class I fell behind but im almost caught up and the other is a CS class and im just lost in that class. What happens if I dont get out of academic probation this semester? will I have to transfer to another community college? My transcript are terrible because of my mistakes in the past and honestly im just scared to keep failing. idk what to do.",

      "text": "Prof here. The rules are different at every school, so no one here will be able to give accurate information unfortunately. You should have access to some kind of academic advisor or academic support center. Check in with them ASAP because they can give you the real info. And they may also be able to help you get support too.",
