The goal is to make all materials accessible for the maximum number of people. \n\nSo even if there are no students who are visually impaired in the class right now, documents should still be accessible. Having a document in Word doesn't really make things that different for students who don't have a disability but it can make a huge difference for a student who does. \n\nWe don't know if students who sign up for our class have these needs or maybe we will have a student who is visually impaired add the class tomorrow. This student shouldn't need to wait to have all their materials converted to make things accessible for them when it could've been made accessible from the start.\n\nAlso you'd be surprised how many people are visually impaired in some way or maybe they have ADHD or dyslexia and this makes text-to-speech a lot easier.",

Depending on field, most people will be making PDFs in something like LaTeX, and LaTeX cannot embed that kind of information yet. Making an existing PDF accessible seems to need expensive third-party software. I haven't found any quick, easy and free ways to make PDFs accessible, and if it's going to take you hours of your personal time to manually retype every word on the page then it's easier to just never use PDFs.",

There are probably other factors (Some listed in the article and some not) that show its a paradigm shift outside some circles and required knowledge in others.  \n\nAnd argument I would personally make is that the most people see more files and more documents now, many of which are single use.  I've gone to three new doctors in the past year, each has had me fill out patient consent and history forms.  Once I've completed the form and sent it to the doctor why do I need it again? The flipside is everything i used to download and meticulously organize (TV shows and music) are all cloud based.  I don't own them, I don't need to navigate them the app search function does all the work.  Course work is made harder still because I have a laptop, a phone, a desktop, and about 3 work computers I sometimes access for homework during breaks.  I have 1 active one drive profile, 2 active Google and a few inactive Google Doc profiles that crop up organically but seeing it written down.... yikes.\n\nThat said, I learned basic file structure natively when i grew up, but the user experience as designed no longer needs us to flex those muscles as as early in our lives. Attempting to teach file structures early may help some students, but wont stick unless it's put into repeated and regular use.  What's next is what is being suggested here.  Concepts of file organization will probably be taught in student success courses and recommended during office hours/academic advisors meetings.  Some people will take to it naturally and others won't. It will be a hole in skills until repeated use in the classroom or workspace.  Lamenting this cultural change is similar to lamenting that most people don't know how to sew buttons.",

I lost easy portability since it\u2019s large and heavy compared to the 32 GB models, but I need the disk space.  However, most students cannot afford to shell out $2000+ for a laptop. (I really can\u2019t either, but I often flip garage sale items to make extra cash).  That said sometimes EBay has good deals on refurbished ones or some rich dude looking to off load one to make room for the latest and greatest.  \nIf nothing else, maybe trying some of these tricks will help free up some space.  https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_3096092-2906390-16",
