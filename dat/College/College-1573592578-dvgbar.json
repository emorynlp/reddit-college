  "title:": "Writing Prof Here: How to Add to Essay Length Without Fluff or Format Cheating",
  "text": "Alright folks, instead of the normal depressing content on the sub, Christmas is coming early ...though perhaps a bit boring. This is like getting socks. But hey, I know a lot of you need socks, so it's not that bad.\n\nCommon problem I'm sure a lot of you are facing is how to reach essay minimum page requirements. I'm here to help. This is only really looking at one specific technique, there's lots of others, and maybe I'll do write ups on them also. The key here though is that this *isn't* about just padding your essay. It's about reaching the minimum length *by doing what you're actually expected to do.* It's like cheating on a test by smuggling notes in your brain.\n\nLet's take a hypothetical essay discussing polarizing foods. Here's a stereotypically bad bit of (hypothetical) student writing:\n\n>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza. This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.\n\nShit. We just covered pineapple in like 2 lines of text. That was going to be the centerpiece of the essay!\n\nTo improve on this, always look for more clarity, depth, and specificity. We'll start with the first sentence. ...Is there evidence of this debate we can point to?\n\n>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post ranked pineapple on pizza as the most controversial food.\n\nGood start, but what lots of details are missing.\n\n>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial and pineapple was the clear winner.\n\nBetter, but we're using an internet sources a lot of folks aren't familiar with. Is it credible? More detail helps:\n\n>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th.\n\nOur first sentence has now become longer than the entire original paragraph just be expanding on the \"causes a lot of debate\" idea. Now let's move on to \"In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza.\"\n\nFirst we need to tell the audience who this guy is.\n\n>Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust.\n\nAfter that, we should give more detail about just what the study found (I'm making up the study, btw, but Haidt does study disgust). We should provide more detail about the specific research results, and can add a bit of narrative about the research methods as well.\n\n>In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is \"strongly dislike\" and 5 is \"strongly like,\" 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3.\n\nIn the original, 40% disliking it didn't actually tell us it was controversial, it told us only a lot of people hate it -- but we need to know how many like it as well, and the number of ambivalent people is another useful detail. We can go into more depth with some added context drawn from other questions in the study:\n\n>While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it.\n\nGood, that tells us how it compares to an uncontroversial topping. How does it rate among other controversial toppings though?\n\n>Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.\n\nHoly cow, now we've got ourselves a real life college essay paragraph. Let's put the pieces together and see how she looks:\n\n>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th. Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust. In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is \"strongly dislike\" and 5 is \"strongly like,\" 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3. While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it. Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.\n\nThat's more than half a page (TNR 12, double spaced).\n\nNow what about the last line from the original? \"This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.\"\n\nCut it. Don't need it. If I clearly showed you something, I don't need to tell you that I clearly showed you it. You know.\n\nBut wait, we're not done! We can get even more mileage out of this by commenting on the limitations of the study:\n\n>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and there may be a regional preference.\n\nAgain, we can expand this with greater levels of detail and specificity.\n\n>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and regional preferences may have influenced the results. Food preferences and traditions are known to vary from one region to the next, and pizza in particular has regional variations such as the Chicago deep dish. It may be that in some places were pineapple is more popular, pineapple on pizza is less of a contentious issue.\n\nAnd, if you need to squeeze a little more mileage out of it, add a bit of your research narrative:\n\n>However, in researching this topic, I was not able to find a study that compared regional attitudes towards pineapple on pizza.\n\nThat's all there is to it.\n\n...One huge caveat of course. Expanding your writing in this way first requires that you have a clue what the heck you're talking about. You need to have done the research, have actual good sources, and understand the sources and your subject to be able to discuss it in a nuanced manner. If you're still in camp \"lol didn't read,\" this isn't going to help you much.",

I think there was a case in U.S where a student wrote an essay in which the first two and the last two pages looked like a proper essay while the middle pages were filled with \"rocks, rocks,..\" and he got a respectable grade from the paper.

The issue is with the Bennet ancestor, not the laws of the country. In fact, the story prominently features Anne de Bourgh, a prospective match for Darcy specifically because she will inherit from her mother Lady Catherine.

          "text": "Alright, let's see what I can do on this, though admittedly it's not something I'm great at explaining.\n\nI think you need to look at why you're quoting someone directly. What about their original language needs to be preserved rather than paraphrased? Paraphrase indicates that you have mastery over the material, which is usually something good for an essay to show. My students, by contrast, often say they want to directly quote because they can't explain something as well as the original author ...yeah, but the solution is to learn it well enough to explain it just as well, or close enough to be serviceable. If you can't explain it in your own words, you probably don't understand it, and there's your problem.\n\nSo with direct quotes, you should have a purpose in mind, more than just \"prof said so.\" Let's suppose Haidt had this line in his research:\n\n>It would appear that pineapple triggers the disgust mechanism in some of our brains.\n\nThe sort of adequately competent way to introduce this, after Haidt himself has been introduced is just:\n\n>Haidt goes on to conclude that, \"It would appear that pineapple triggers the disgust mechanism in some of our brains.\"\n\nSimple little bit of narrative explaining how the direct quote relates to what we've just been discussing. But, it's not particularly great. YMMV, but I prefer to minimize direct quotations. I think they appear lazy (like you're trying to pad your writing), can raise doubts about your own understanding (I've been at a conference where a presented admitted they didn't understand a quote they used), and frankly, we're reading *your* essay to hear *your* ideas, so we want *your* explanations.\n\nContext is going to be key, but in this instance, the thing I need to preserve is the phrase \"disgust mechanism.\" The rest of the language is very general, but that phrase is a really specific term of art he's coined, and changing that might be an issue. So, I'd get to something like this:\n\n>Haidt goes on to conclude that pineapple on pizza seems to trigger a specific biological \"disgust mechanism\" in the brains of people who find it revolting.\n\nThe key thing here was the addition of the word \"biological.\" It didn't appear in the original, but including it is a subtle way to signal \"I really understand this,\" or even more to the point, \"I understand this well enough to explain it with my own language.\"\n\nI have no idea if any of this answered your question. I maybe just went off on my own tangent, and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask.",

                                  "text": "That's basically folk grammar, which is how most of us learn English. We deduce rules based on how we've seen stuff done and some vague recollection of rules told to us in 5th grade or whenever.\n\nAnd probably 95% of the time it works. Our pauses tend to correspond to grammatical structures, which is also where commas often need to.\n\nThe trouble you can run in to though is when someone is reading with a different rhythm than you might speak with, and now your comma makes no sense and is actually detracting from your writing. You end up signaling to your reader an organization for the sentence different from what you intended.\n\nCommas for the most part come in four varieties, and they're pretty easy to master:\n\n(1) List commas. Everyone gets this. Go fight about the Oxford comma, but most folks have no trouble here.\n\n(2) Parenthetical commas. Commas often, as is the case right now, act in pairs to function the same way as parenthesis. Good rule to keep in mind is to re-read your sentence with the parenthetical phrase removed to see if it still makes grammatical sense. \"Commas often act in pairs to function the same way as parenthesis.\" That checks out, so I'm good to go.\n\n(3) Fanboys. Comma + conjunction/disjunction and both sides can stand on their own? Like list commas, most folks are fine here, if they bother to check.\n\n(3) Ending a long introductory phrase. This is what screws people up. They have a long sentence, so they think a comma is needed. After all, they had to breath, so it must be right. The rule I like to use is that you do not separate the subject from the verb, or the verb from its object, except with parenthesis.\n\n>Some people prefer Hawaiian or Costa Rican pineapple on their pizzas, which is a major point of contention in American cuisine.\n\nNope. The subject of the sentence is the preference, but folks tend to end long complex subjects like this with a comma. Really though, the structure of the sentence is \"The preference is a point of contention\" and you would't write \"The preference, is a point of contention.\"\n\nThe ultimate Academic Life Pro Tip though is to just know your material really well so you can write with confidence, and then make so few other errors that no one cares about the small shit. If you're on a plane and a baby starts wailing and then stops, every sound the baby makes afterwards is annoying. But, if the baby is relatively quiet, the small sounds barely register.",

It's hardly anything. ...Kinda.\n\nIt's actually a weird thing with writing when we talk about how long something takes to write. How long did this take? Actual time at the keyboard? 15-20 minutes. Active thinking time? A few hours. Accumulating background knowledge and experience to be able to write it? I dunno, 20 years?\n\nAn anecdote I like to use is that I did a conference presentation a few years back and wrote the entire thing in about 2 hours the day before. How'd I accomplish that? By writing a dozen different earlier drafts over the few weeks prior.\n\nOr, you know, how hard is it to kill a level 5 monster? I dunno, are we asking how hard it is to kill it when you're level 3? Or how hard it is to reach level 8 and than slay the level 5 monster with ease?",
