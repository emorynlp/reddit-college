  "text": "my roommate makes weird/gross wet noises with their mouth and snores  in their sleep and ive never brought it up to them because they're nice and it would be mean to make someone self conscious about the way they sleep (plus they work + full time student + not from our state so i def don't want to make them feel sad or unwanted since shit is already tough). recently they've started yelling out things in their sleep which jolts me awake.\n\nthe rooms in our residence hall are really thin and recently my next door neighbor has, presumably, gotten herself a boyfriend. the way our rooms are organized makes it so beds are pressed against the side of the wall so her bed is, also presumably, only separated from mine by a very thin wall. this means that when she's getting railed at 10:30pm i can very clearly hear her moaning and bed creaking.\n\nIt has simply become too much. \n\nDo any of u have really good earplugs recs? I tried foam ones but they didn't do much and I tried some cheap plastic ones I got from Wish (\ud83d\ude2d) and those just hurt my ears.",
