  "text": "Hi all, I just wanted some advice on what I should do-I have a group essay due this Friday.  The group consists of me and 2 other people and we already discussed which parts of the essay each of us will work on.  I am nearly finished my part but my group members still haven't done anything on our group Google Docs.  I have also repeatedly texted them asking them to work on it but have not received any responses.  \n\nI also emailed my concerns to the professor yesterday but he still has not responded (which is unusual since he would always respond within an hour whenever I emailed him previously).  I am kind of panicking right now and just wanted advice on what I can do?",

      "text": "I always just make a paper trail. When I finish my part, I email it to the other students so it's got a timestamp to them and it's in it's finished state. I generally do this so people in my group don't forget it, or attribute the work to someone else. \n\nYou can't control your group. Your professor should understand this. If they don't do it but you've done your part, it's easy to show them the email and when it was sent with your finished part. It shouldn't be a problem at that point. \n\nAs for group work, there will always be people who wait until the absolute last second. That's just what's going to happen. Let it go and see what happens. Don't stress over what you can't control.",
