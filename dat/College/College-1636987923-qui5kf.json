  "text": "So I'm interested in studying lots of languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian) during college whilst also pursuing cybersecurity or another computer science major.  I'm also interested in studying abroad in said locations.\n\nFor most people, this would mean additional years which means much much more college debt. However, I plan to join the national guard which means I'd have my full tuition paid off by the government. I really want to become fluent in these languages. \n\nWhat are the benefits and (nonfinancial) costs of taking an extra two years to pursue this plan?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently a high school junior.",
