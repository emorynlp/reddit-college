  "text": "Hi! I am supposed to go on exchange to Lisbon beginning Feb. 2022, I am concerned new covid restrictions may arise and ruin it. I am in my final semester, so if it gets cancelled while I am away I might get screwed. I have always wanted to do a study abroad semester (even though it scares the sh*t out of me)\n\nSummary: I guess what I am asking is do you think study abroad is worth it even with the uncertainties covid create? Or would it be better to just travel with some friends after my semester at my home uni is finished?",
