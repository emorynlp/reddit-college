  "title:": "Is there a University in America that doesn't force useless classes?",
  "text": "I'm frustrated after looking at other country's education systems in comparison to mine. In the UK for example you can get a BS in 3 years because they don't force you to take World History and Music Appreciation when you're a Chemistry major.\n\nAre there universities in America that don't force you to take random classes just to take your money and waste your time? I'd much rather pay for classes I actually want to attend than deal with vapid classes with professors who give busy work and have an inflated sense of self-worth.\n\nFinally, if there's not a university that doesn't force ridiculous requirements, is there a way we can ban together to prevent them from taking our money for classes that have 0 relevance to the major? Money is hard to come by when you're poor, I'd rather use that money to pay bills since I don't need underwater basket weaving for a degree in chemistry.",

      "text": "From other threads on here, I've heard that in Europe what they call a Bachelor's is as useful as an Associates here, and most everybody does an addition 2-3 years to get a Master's and specialize in their field.\n\nAlso, there are numerous jobs nowadays that just require a degree, not a specific one. This is possible because accredited programs and universities all have enough similar requirements that they know any college graduate is supposed to be able to write well, think critically, extract information and analyze the source, basic quantitative reasoning, etc. If you make our degrees more specific by shortening them by a year, you could become much more likely to have to go back and get other degrees for certain jobs.\n\nAs well, gen eds make sure everyone is on equal footing. Maybe you went to an amazing high school and you learned all this, in which case you should have tested out of then or be able to breeze through these classes, earning you a high GPA and scholarship opportunities. For those who didn't have that chance or maybe didn't get serious about education until college, this will teach them enough basics to be competitive with other students.\n\nAnd historically, college was for the rich and wealthy to go become a \"Renaissance man\". Sure it's more common now, but the goal of the institutions is still the same. If you want to just focus on getting a job for cheap, maybe attend a CC first, or go to a technical or trade school. On paper, they're much safer financial decisions unless you know you're going to have a high paying job or want to attend grad school of some sort.",

On top of all that I'd have to deal with covid and visa issues, etc. If another variant happens they may revoke it and I could be SOL. Covid has changed the \"just do what you want\" to a rather large maze. Pre-covid I think it would have been possible.",

I'd avoid the UK simply because of the international tuition rate. You'll be forced to take out private loans with a cosigner at exorbitant interest rates from a sadistic loan company.\n\nYou're not missing much by staying in the US, honestly.",
