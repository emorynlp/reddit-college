  "text": "I barely studied in HS, had a 4.4, did clubs and sports, and never really struggled. I\u2019ve been in college for 3 and half months now, and my GPA is dismal. I study for hours on end, but I only seem to barely pass. Did anyone else have the same experience? Does it get better? \n[STEM major at a top 40 school]",

      "text": "Dude same! I had a 4.0 in high school and now I\u2019m struggling to pass. High School didn\u2019t prepare us and now we have to crash and burn until we figure everything out. I\u2019m a STEM Major too and the course load and expectations are way more than I imagined. Keep your head up and at least this semester we can learn from our experiences and make a better plan for the next semester. Also if you end up failing/dropping any classes(god forbid) you could try and CLEP out of them over the winter break so you\u2019ll stay caught up :)",

      "text": "I didn\u2019t really study in HS either. Was fine last year (freshman year) because everything was online, ended with a 3.9 overall gpa 3.7 science gpa. Looking back though I guess it might\u2019ve been kind of bad because everyone I knew basically had a 3.97-4.0. This semester I\u2019ll probably end with a 3.0-3.2. I\u2019ve learned a lot though so hoping I\u2019ll do better next semester.\n\nA lot of it comes down to study habits imo and not falling behind for me.",

      "text": "3.9 in HS and barely studied...learned real fast in pre engineering stuff that doesn't fly at all. Its taken me a long time just figure out how I best retain information and how to study for certain classes. If you can help it don't cram the last night either, try to spread out the info so you can sleep on it a couple of times. Studying for hours isnt necessarily the answer, its more about being effective with your time. Every person is different so I can't give you a straight oh do this. For me it was writing up the notesheet and doing practice problems, then going through scenarios like ok what stuff could they change on this problem to make it a different one etc.",

      "text": "Yes, it is quite normal for 'Gifted' high school students to struggle something fierce going into college. Remember, only about 40% of the U.S. population goes to college in the first place. Add in that you're at a top 40 STEM school, I would bet you every penny that I own that 85%+ of your class was in your same boat in high school. \n\nThe sad truth is, you aren't actually special. You are completely average compared to your current classmates, and because of that, courses are much more rigorous to actually challenge you and everyone around you, because you have proven that that is the level you can work on with your high school achievements. \n\nAs to whether or not this get's better, that's entirely up to you and whether or not you can adjust your perspective. If you can recognize that no, you aren't the big fish in the little pond anymore, and that you aren't in fact perfect and that you can get help, sure, you can still succeed. If you keep looking back on your high school glory days wondering why you aren't excelling anymore for the rest of your college career, no, no it will not.",
