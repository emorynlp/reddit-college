  "text": "My last year of college, I had a 19 year old asian (I am not stating country) when I was 23. Needless to say, we were too different to work, I never spoke to her from October-december (when she left).\n\nI feel bad in one respect. She had culture shock, never lived away from home before, and I was doing my capstone project, stressed over 5th year and wanting (I would go to friends/frats not in the room) but party. \n\nSo she's in bed and I would try to behave but come back really really early. I brought no one back but it was too many differences to handle.\n\nI often forget about her as she and I minimally interacted. but seeing posts about roommates brought me back to thinking about her.\n\nnext semester I was living alone, and just trying to get though last classes and find a job. \n\nAnyone else feel similar?",
