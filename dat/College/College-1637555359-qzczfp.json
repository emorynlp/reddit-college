  "title:": "Studying abroad in Japan this coming Spring and am in desperate need of scholarships. Help!",
  "text": "I'm accepted through ISEP for a program at Toyo University. Unfortunately a lot of scholarships for Spring 2023 (late March to mid-August) have passed and I'm stuck without many options right now. I need help finding some that are still open. I asked on /r/studyAbroad first but their sub is way smaller and less active than this one, so I'm hoping I can find some more help here.\n\n(Info for any eligibility criteria): I'm a 20 y/o male, white American, third year student. I'll be primarily studying the Japanese language while abroad. My GPA is 3.311 and I am also the dependent of an active service member.\n\nSince the Spring semester in Japan goes into the middle of August, I don't know if Summer 2023 scholarships would also help with it or not.",
