  "text": " \n\nDear college professors,             \n\n*We are doing our best*\n\nI know it may seem like we are slacking and not participating, but these last few months have been tough for all of us. Our school years were cut short, trips were cancelled, and we were *forced* inside all summer. As college students have all faced some sort of hardships during this time that need to be understood\u2014and possibly given some compassion in how you deal with us.\n\nI am now a freshman in college, and it honestly does not feel like it. I sit at home all day, losing the motivation to do anything\u2014especially school. I sit behind a camera and listen to...\n\n**Lecture after**\n\n**Lecture after**\n\n**Lecture...**\n\nIt is getting Exhausting\n\nIn high school, I was never one to procrastinate, but ***now*** it\u2019s normal for me because home was always a place for relaxing, and limited learning. Online classes make me feel like I have all the time in the world to finish assignments, but then I get assigned even more homework in another class. At that point, I get stressed with all the work I have to do that *could* have been finished at an earlier time.\n\nThere are many distractions surrounding us at home and it is hard to block them out. Whether it be our family talking, our pets making noise, or just our minds wandering. It is not easy to keep one\u2019s mind focused on a screen for a whole class period, the mind does start to wander.\n\nThere have been times where I am in a class and **BOOM** I completely blank and I start to think about other things and miss something important that the teacher was talking about. Yes, I had this problem in person-to-person classes too, but *never* as bad as I do now. Teachers are not there to get you back on track, so it is up to you to keep yourself engaged, which is hard when you are on a screen for most of your day and have little to no interaction with fellow classmates or teachers. \n\nTo help us stay engaged small group discussions often can help. This gives us time to talk to our peers we usually don\u2019t get to and hearing other people\u2019s comments can really help to understand a subject.\n\nThis little to no interaction with teachers and fellow classmates is difficult, but it is also hard because I was looking forward to making new friends during college, and now, it seems almost impossible. There\u2019s no time for us to get to know each other, other than when we get put in a breakout room for no more than 20 minutes. Even then, I feel isolated. \n\nWhen you cannot make new friends due to not having the time to get to know each other, life becomes lonely. And loneliness has had a huge effect on my school year, forcing me to shut down at times because I do not know where to go for help when I need it, and I do not want to disturb my friends when they are going through the same things.\n\nWithout the interaction I\u2019m used to, I find it hard to wake up in the morning knowing that I will have to stare at a screen for how many hours of homework I happen to get that night. I feel like my whole life is school now and there is no time for me. I know I am not the only one feeling this way. \n\nMy friends and I have talked about our experiences with online college and most of the opinions were *not* positive. Our lives have become the same routine everyday.\n\n# Wake up, get online, do homework. \n\n#                            Wake up, get online, do homework. \n\n#                                                     Wake up, get online, do homework. \n\nWith all of the screen time everyday that students have, you could give us breaks throughout the lecture and give us time to take a step back and breathe. Time away from the screen is important. \n\nFor me, school is easier to get through when you have friends that are there to help you. Since the start of the fall semester, I have not talked to many of my friends that I used to talk to everyday. \n\nPhysically being at school was *so* much easier because we knew that it was a place to focus and get work done. Now after a long school day, we just close our laptops and *pray* we make it through the semester.\n\nThis is a new experience for all of us. Most students were going to school in person before the pandemic started and now everything is different. It is hard to go through change so fast and sudden. We never expected a pandemic to derail our lives, but it has. \n\nTake the time to think of the way we are feeling and understand that many of us would rather be in person, just like you would.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Stressed Student",

      "text": "Honestly, I think it is hard on both sides. I've had professors break down in class and have seen my class mates struggle. I did online community college through out most of high school but this seems to be a different monster. None of my teachers are trained in online learning and end up making it closer to onsite learning through zoom. This isn't healthy for either side so the current format is not the best. Some students don't have an appropriate place to turn their camera on in class and then the professors complain about us being lazy. Most of my classmates have never had to deal with online school before so it is a challenge. The professors aren't used to this  format and end up making waaaay harder than it needs to be. We need to understand each other more in this hard time and be more compassionate on both sides. I see this comment section becoming into an age war when it isn't. We all miss our friends and we are all anxious to go back on campus. Just don't start pointing fingers at each other on who's to blame and who's harder to deal with. I do agree that the homework needs to be a little easier for those who have not been online but I also agree that the students need to give their professors grace. Most of us have lost a family member to this pandemic and we are all grieving.  Just go easy on both sides and things will run more smoothly.",

      "text": "As an instructor it always makes me really sad to hear things from my students like this.\n\nHonestly, it's a huge puzzle. What I'd be interested in would be your concrete suggestions for how to be better.\n\nHere's the puzzle:\n\nImagine you are instructing an 800-person intro to sociology lecture. \n\nYou have to give everyone a grade based on their mastery of the material. All of your policies have to be fair and will be used by try-hard students, students who are trying to game the system, depressed students, students who are working, students who have families and full time jobs. So you better make them fair. \n\nAlso, you have to manage 8 TAs, who have weekly sections.\n\nHow do you make people show up for section and actually interact with each other (and turn on their cameras)? \n\nHow do you have the TAs grade them? Based on participation? Do you force students to turn on their cameras? Do you make them do unsupervised breakout rooms? Do you have them all in a big conference call? One way to help them participate is to force them to turn on their cameras. That is considered cruel by many. Another way is to give them a pre-section assignment so they all show up prepared. But that's extra work (busywork)--the price for a better discussion. The payoff is that students get to talk to each other. \n\nHow do you do lectures? Live lectures are incredibly awkward. You're talking to an empty room of 800 squares. And if you mess up in some way you could be recorded and distributed on the internet as a meme. Plus managing the chat is difficult.\n\n Asynchronous lectures are boring for students and unmotivating to watch.\n\n... Do you upload slides? Well, if you upload slides with every word, they won't watch the lectures. They'll just use the search function when they need to, thus not learning the material.\n\nHow do you do exams? You can't stop cheating. Students create massive group chats and share answers. Do you make them open note? Now you have to write a tricky exam for students that's hard enough, easy to grade 800 of, and not easy to cheat on. Good luck.\n\nYour best bet in many cases is to just give more individual, un-cheatable assignments... But it's more work. And not just for the students--for you too, grading. And with extensions.\n\nPlus, how do you deal with it when a student misses an exam because of internet issues? Or because their family member dies? Or because they have to work? How strict are you?  If you're not strict at all/have no rules, you're making it demotivating to do the work. \n\n(And also, it's a royal pain to give extensions in a class over 20 people--you have to keep track of them, and remember them and enter them correctly. Good luck with your 800-person lecture). \n\nAnd if you're kind/lenient, what happens when it becomes a pattern? If a student misses 6/10 sections, do you grade them the same as other students who didn't? If a student doesn't do half their assignments because they're depressed, what grade do they deserve? (Which is to quantify their learning of the material). \n\nAlso, as others have mentioned, teaching isn't fun right now. I'm getting so many emails all the time, and they're all bad news. They have some issue with the class, or they need an extension with something. Almost all of my interactions with students are time consuming, and neutral or mildly unpleasant.\n\nPlus, we are dealing with the isolation too.  We all live in our rooms also. Many of the students have moved home. You are living with your families, near your friends. A lot of instructors are graduate students, or professors who aren't from here. They often have very few friends, and no family nearby. Plus, we are supporting ourselves. Many have children too. Grad students are instructors, students, AND research slaves. \n\nAnd... it's a lot of work to plan a class, and make the above decisions. Plus, to write tests. Plus, to be familiar with the material well enough to teach. Teaching a class (especially for the first few times) is about the same amount of work as taking 2-3 classes. You are responsible for all the deadlines and assignments (you have to do them to design/explain/grade them). You have to answer to a lot more people.\n\nBut the hardest part is the emotional labor to show up, and deal with students. Not only do we have to make these decisions, but we are expected to make material that's so engaging that it can compete with other things on your computer--that you'll want to do it over Netflix, or video games, or other content put out by massive corporations with huge budgets, huge teams, or at least (like tik tok) no educational material to bake into their entertainment.\n\nIt's not that teachers don't care. (Well, sometimes they dgaf, but that's not a coronavirus thing, that's a problem with the incentive structure for tenure... They're graded on their research, and their teaching is like small homework assignments).  \n\nIt's more that it's a truly difficult task, and we don't know how to deal with it better. But real suggestions are helpful.",

Either do the work or don\u2019t but it isn\u2019t your professors job to pass you just because you prefer in person to online.",

      "text": "Same situation with professors. We don\u2019t write open letters. Let me elaborate and give you a real life scenario.\n\nWaking up to kids unexpectedly crying, or maybe parents who need medical attention, have to drive to pharmacies to pick up meds. Kids getting sick/needing shots/ etc.\n\nOk, you ran and handled kids needs, but now you have to skip breakfast, ok just coffee, fuck coffee no time, prepare mic and laptop ASAP, lecture, answer emails, grade homework, write/revise research proposals, online office h, update lecture materials, answer colleagues emails, zoom meeting with student, zoom meeting with department head or admin, zoom meeting with program officer, screen applicants, zoom meeting with undergrad committee A B C D, international zoom meeting with collaborators, zoom meeting with conference organizers. Review grants, review peer-reviewed papers.\n\nLearn this new online platform that the department proposes to use, learn how to use another platform that your colleague prefers to use. Switch from Microsoft to Google to Apple accounts and whatever the fuck the Univ decided to use within several min. Meanwhile got emails from impatient students \u201cdid you get my email my dear servant professor?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m submitting a regrade request because I deserve partial credit and I know how to grade my exam better than you do\u201d\n\nAs you make the plan to Write and revise academic papers, handle student complaints, ... then it hits you.\n\nOh, spouse is washing the dishes and changing the diapers, at least I have to cook lunch, and dinner, and kids want to play with you. Wait we are out of milk... pick up your phone, and got a text from dept head. Oh one student got corona, now you have to switch assignment and make it \u201cnot too stressful\u201d. Oh one colleague also caught it, and potentially others, another zoom meeting to discuss worst case scenario. \nOh now conference can\u2019t go but it\u2019ll switch to online.\nHey new online platform to learn.\n\nThen as you tried to wind down, catch a quick rest, spouse said \u201cI think I will have to quit my job/ our company is doing massive layoffs\u201d\n\nAnd you sighed .. you also remembered that you haven\u2019t showered or... (did I skip brushing my teeth? Did I shower yesterday? Do we still have enough toilet papers?).\n\nAnd you get an email. Your best friend/colleague, a non citizen, told you that his parents have passed away but he cannot go to visit because our case is the highest. By the time he finishes his quarantine his parents would have been buried. You are wondering .. how do I console him..saying nothing is the best perhaps but.. you can\u2019t be there with him because he is in a state with the highest outbreak rate!!\n\nYou think students life is tough?? Are you that self-centered?? Sorry to say this, fuck your motivation. Just imagine that we are in the midst of another World War. People back then don\u2019t think about losing motivation. We just need to think about how to SURVIVE this stupidity.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I understand but EVERYONE is suffering, greatly. And professor is not at the worst situation, doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, funeral workers are at a much worse situation. At least you don\u2019t hear in the news that one professor is dying after another.\n\nEveryone is greatly suffering here because the leaders of this country have been grossly incompetent, and approx. half of the America wanted another 4 years of this.\n\nAnd to boldly said \u201cliberate state X Y Z !!\u201d , \u201copen the country\u201d \u201cI think the science doesn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWe have to take back the country from doctors\u201d.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let COVID dominate your life\u201d\n\nHa? Like what Dave Chappelle said, with that mf getting on a chopper and receiving VIP treatments, it\u2019s like you drive down to a homeless neighborhood, eating a juicy burger walking around and saying to homeless people \u201cdon\u2019t let hunger dominates your life my people, nom nom nom\u201d\n\nSorry for the long rant, but fuck this open letter, fuck the anti intellectual movements and please wake up.",

Contrast that with how Asians treat their professors with respect, considering it a noble profession. The truth is, only a tiny fraction of your tuition goes to the professor. \n\nYou want a better quality of education? Eliminate the sports, and demand for transparency in the admins. Ask them to justify the salaries given to higher admins (not the lower ones) and football/sport coaches. \nIf you halve their salary (hey they don\u2019t have to prepare and do online lectures, right?), the university can double the hiring and reduce the workload.\n\nImagine you own a grocery store, and you only hire one employee, he has to do the cashier, stocking, purchasing, delivery, cleaning up, handling angry customers, handing returns. Oh, and have meetings after meetings with suppliers and distributors. That is roughly the number of students per faculty, and most of them were asked to write grants to get federal and state money.\n\nOr to court the endowment people.

Your physical library building might be closed, but your library provides access to scholarly articles and other resources online. Your library probably has a virtual way to get in touch with librarians, either through chat or email, where you can ask for help getting started with finding scholarly articles. Alternatively, you can connect Google Scholar to your library's holdings. This allows you to access full text articles you find because it will log you in through your university credentials. If you go to scholar.google.com, on the top left corner, look for the three lines. Click on those, and then click \"settings.\" From there, click on the \"library links\" tab. You'll get a search box, where you can type in the name of your college. You can then select your college from the list. Now you can research your topic and get access to many articles without hitting a paywall. Hope that helps!",

He just gives us homework and quizzes and expects the book to teach us. \ud83d\ude12\n\nSeriously seems like a lot of professors are taking the opportunity to have their work cut this semester due to the online aspect, and are taking advantage of the fact that they can post old lecture videos instead of taking the effort to live lecture over zoom. And then they give students more work to do that the professors would do during a normal semester, essentially forcing students to teach themselves.\n(I understand that not all professors are like this, I have seen some rather dedicated professors on this subreddit. I am simply speaking from my own perspective.)\n\nAs a sophomore, I got straight A's my first two semesters of college. I loved classes when they were in-person and was highly motivated, much more than when I was in highschool, but this ain't it. \n\nI'm seriously thinking of taking a semester or two off and coming back when classes return in-person. Not out of laziness, but because next semester is when I start taking my major classes, and I don't want to struggle with those classes online. I wonder if enough students drop out, will classes return in-person sooner?",

A lot of the world was already moving to doing things online before this hit. If an adult preparing to graduate from business school thinks sitting through class on a laptop all day is difficult, through a schedule of classes they got to plan for themselves, they\u2019re in for a rude awakening when they get that offer letter for their first real job. And in many ways that is the intent of college. To prepare students for the real world. This is the real world now. Believe me when I say learning the ropes in a college setting is going to be far less stressful than showing up to your new job and being expected to know how to do all this stuff on day one. Your new boss will not be as patient with you as your professors.\n\nYou also make the assumption that, what, this isn\u2019t as difficult for instructors because they\u2019re married, have kids, etc.? So they\u2019re not lonely? Is that what you\u2019re saying? Spare me. Are you aware of how time-consuming higher education is for faculty and how it severely limits how much free time they have available to foster relationships outside of work, even pre-COVID? Have you ever stopped and asked yourself why so many professors are unmarried and childless? They literally do not have time for a whole lot outside of their jobs. They do what they do because it is what they love, not because it affords them leisure time.\n\nI\u2019ve been dating a professor for the past few months (not one of my professors, to be clear) and what we define as dating is probably nothing like how most people would define that term, although it works great for us. We see each other once a week and we usually have to plan that time around when he\u2019s not recording lectures or grading. We\u2019re only able to do overnight stays every couple of weeks because most weekends he is so burned out that he desperately needs the time alone. He teaches five classes (to make ends meet) and has about 200 students between two separate universities (yes, did you know some of your professors do not just teach at YOUR school?). He had a lot of his lectures recorded already but they were done with Adobe Flash which is \u201cdying\u201d this year so he has been re-recording all of them. IF HE IS LUCKY, he can fit two into one day. And on those days he doesn\u2019t check email, do admin tasks, etc., otherwise he won\u2019t get the lectures done. Those still end up being 10-hour days at minimum. He has had to do this for all five of his classes this semester because all of them are different. He will not have a winter break because he\u2019ll be busy recording lectures for the five classes he has coming up in spring as they are different than his fall classes, as well as re-writing mid-term and final exams, on top of loads of paperwork, then getting everything set up to \u201cpublish\u201d on Canvas. That doesn\u2019t even include any of his research requirements, planning for study abroad in 2022, acting in his capacity as director of undergrad for one university, etc.\n\nBut yeah, professors have it so much easier than the students.\n\nI am the only person he sees on a regular basis. (Despite all this, we\u2019re super happy\u2014just having to work through these tough times.) He hasn\u2019t seen his parents/siblings in weeks. He barely even has time to call his best friend in Australia every week for a chat. I\u2019m his only real sense of relief right now, and I live 30 minutes away and have work commitments of my own. All in all, the only people he has seen since summer are me, his parents, and one of his friends who lives down the street. It\u2019s not glamorous. Not in the least.\n\nStudents need to get rid of this notion that professors are tap dancing their way through this. Maybe even enjoying thenselves. No way. My boyfriend tells me regularly, COVID has made their jobs exponentially more difficult. He has said every professor he knows misses being in the lecture hall with their students. It is far less time-consuming on the front end. They\u2019re not loading you up with work just for fun. They are fulfilling learning objectives set forth for them by their department. If their coursework doesn\u2019t meet those objectives the program goes away entirely. Trust me when I say the last thing they want to do is create more work for themselves by having you submit more assignments. But they do have pre-defined metrics they need to follow as well.\n\nAs a student myself I will also tell you that my own professors are much more sympathetic to the students that are treating them with kindness, respect, and consideration right now. It takes two minutes to drop them an email once a month or so and thank them for all their hard work this semester. And it makes all the difference in the world to them when you actively participate in live classes. That\u2019s not sucking up, that\u2019s being professional. This skill will take you a very long way when you graduate.",

Those who cheat for academic gain\n3. Those who do little to participate\n\nThe fraction of those that fall into one or multiple of these categories easily pushes 1/3 or 1/2 of the hundreds of students I teach each semester. One could argue that these traits are all \"human nature\" but I refuse to defend them with excuses. That would be a slap in the face to those that actually work hard and take their education seriously. \n\nI am not disillusioned. I am stating facts. I am here to tell you that nearly every single student I get is perfectly *capable* of meeting their academic responsibilities. It is most unfortunate that many *choose not to* which is odd given that an education is, as you stated, quite expensive. I find the level of resentment quite appalling as there are *so many people* who would sacrifice so much more just for the opportunity to sit in one of the many empty chairs in these lecture halls *each and every class meeting*. \n\nIts a free country.

But I do expect them to push their standards.\n\n> you\u2019d be better served acting understanding than trying to warp students\u2019 personalities\n\nI try to make each and every one of them to believe in themselves. People like you tell them its okay to perform poorly under the guise of \"being happy\". You know what isn't happy? Having discussions with students who flunked a quiz, an exam, or worse yet, the course. Nothing about that feels good on *both* sides of the desk.\n\n>  because this idea, that personalities are malleable and you can be anyone you want to be, is unscientific and more the result of convoluted attempts to justify a bullshit meritocracy \n\nBut the fact is many personalities are malleable. This is quite evident when students email me all excited about their high exam score and how they had turned their bad habits around and started working harder. Those emails are the best. I keep every single one.\n\n> Because I was everything you probably expect your students to be and ultimately miserable and intellectually constrained because of people who pushed upon me philosophies like your own.\n\nSo I make students believe that they have the *capacity* and *capability* to perform well in an academic environment and that's somehow evil? I'm sorry you couldn't handle being a 4.0 student. So many would sacrifice to have that. And guess what... they do and they earn it.\n\n> If you\u2019re a student out there reading this please don\u2019t listen to the prof who makes you feel like a piece of shit because you lack the focus to work on tasks that don\u2019t really matter at all\n\nThis is where your jaded past really shines through. You see absolutely no \"good\" in telling *anyone* that they don't work hard enough and that it is the \"system's\" or \"the man's\" fault. \n\n> spend the time you would\u2019ve spent studying making friends, and your life will be fine (if not better).\n\nI completely agree with this. If you are not willing to push yourself, college shouldn't be for you and you should focus on other things that make you happy! Not everyone has to go to college and there are a near limitless number of ways to pursue a life that you want! I'll be a huge cheerleader on the sidelines.\n\nI get that this is a sensitive topic for you. You have your own view based on your experience, but trying to discredit me by subtlety describing me as a terrible person is quite desperate of you. You know what the biggest joke class is on campus? The one where you do nothing and everyone gets an A (looking at you whoever teaches art appreciation). College does not and should never cater to lowest common denominator.",

From discussions with my colleagues, I think almost all of our online classes are actually lighter than before. \n\nThe difference is that students are now having to do more learning on their own, and they are struggling with that. \n\nRemote learning isn't really the hurdle, either. Putting together videos and online content was something that I figured out in the Spring. The real issue is that students' lives are being affected by the pandemic outside of the classroom. Consequently, I can't design an online course that requires much engagement because students aren't able to engage. I can't require attendance because students aren't able to attend. It's one thing to put together good lectures, but if the people on the other side of the screen aren't watching, the situation is pretty hopeless. Student attrition rates are way up and many are failing.  I am willing to go above and beyond to help my students but they need to be willing to work with me. So many students have already given up, and I can't fix that.\n\nAnd from a professors point of view, all of this chaos is only 1/3 of my job. When you say \"consider a different profession,\" remember that teaching is only 1/3 of mine. Nonetheless, that sad third is now taking up all of my time as I try to pull students out of the muck.",

It describes my experience\u2014all of our experiences, really\u2014perfectly.\n\nIn addition, my school decided to break this fall semester into two 7.5 week periods so that we would only have to take at max 2-3 classes versus 5-6 at a time. In some ways it\u2019s helped, but in others it just causes more stress.\n\nMy professors haven\u2019t condensed the material they\u2019d normally teach under normal circumstances. They\u2019ve just accelerated the rate at which we cover things. We skim over topics that would justify a deep dive for the sake of time. I retain next to nothing from Zoom classes and have to find ways to regurgitate as much of it as I can into assignments to receive passing grades. For the first time in my career as a student, I\u2019m solely concerned about my grades and grades alone rather than my comprehension of the actual material.\n\nAdditionally, because we\u2019re compressing 15 weeks of material into 7.5 week chunks, my school has elected to hold classes on days we\u2019d normally have off. Labor Day, Columbus/Indigenous People\u2019s Day, Veterans Day, etc. In addition to being a student, I also work a part time job 5-6 days a week to help my family make ends meet. I haven\u2019t had a day where I didn\u2019t have school, work, or both since the end of August. Even weekends are spent either catching up on assignments and studying, or working at my job. \n\nI know I\u2019m fortunate to be able to receive an education and working during these times, but honestly, I\u2019m so stressed. I haven\u2019t had a day to myself. A day to sleep in. A day to binge-watch Netflix. A day to play video games. A day to read a non-school related book. A day to spend quality time with my family and friends. A day to go on a walk my dog.\n\nI\u2019m spread thinner than I\u2019ve ever been as a student, and am just hoping I finish this semester with my head above water.",

So, please have some empathy for your daughter's teachers too. I assure you that we're trying out best, and if some aren't doing so well at that, it's because this has been a very new and difficult transition for everyone involved.\n\nEdit: Because I read some of your other comments, just know, nearly all of us have reduced our coursework for the semester. Students just don't realize that because some of the work they are assigned would've been done in the actual class period. For example, for my class, the students often have chapter readings, a discussion post, and an activity each week. The activity would've normally been done during class, but because everything is online, students consider it homework outside of class (which is just a perception issue).",

My chemistry professor certainly doesn't want to be teaching to a zoom full of black screens and no interaction. I personally know a lot of high school teachers who are MISERABLE recording their lessons in an empty classroom. Teachers and professors teach because they want to, not because they want to make students' lives miserable. \n\nIn some classes, where every assignment is designated open book/internet (because it's near impossible to regulate cheating without using programs like Proctorio), yes, the tests and assignments are harder. That's not the professor wanting to make me cry, it's the professor trying to make sure I know the material instead of just getting really good at using the internet. \n\nI get that this makes it harder. I've been there. We all have to push through and work together and have empathy for others. Just as we are learning to take our classes remotely, educators are learning to teach classes remotely. It's not a smooth transition, and everyone involved is under a lot of stress. Be kind to your children, students, teachers, and your children's' teachers, because everyone is just doing their best.",

Give yourself days where you don\u2019t do any work and other days actually write out a realistic schedule and follow it. Make time for exercise even if it\u2019s just putting on music or a podcast and doing some stretching for 10 mins. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t do anything super dangerous, but you should still be visiting with friends/family.

          "text": "I don\u2019t think most undergraduates understand the professors role at the University (unless at community college). \n\nTheir primary role is not teaching. They not only make most of the content which takes way longer than it does to present it (please make a 50min fast paced powerpoint and present it if you don\u2019t believe me), but they need to be constantly writing grants, submitting proposals, managing research labs, dealing with admin and school operations, and keeping up with publications and literature. \n\nEven from my perspective as a grad student who works 65 hour weeks (only 20 of which is teaching) college is not a 9-5 job type deal. For every credit your registered for you need to spend 3 hours outside lecture to master the material. For full-time (takes 5 years to graduate at this pace) you should be spending a minimum of 36 hours doing assignments and studying outside lectures. \n\nMy boss is in 7 days a week 11 hours a day trying to fulfill what the school is asking of him. So there\u2019s zero tolerance for people complaining about the workload unfortunately. \n\nBut he does try to give extensions when he is recognizing someone who is overwhelmed, and he still has seen lower scores than ever before in his 35 years teaching. I respect him, and he cares even though he does push his students to learn as much as possible. \n\nI do get sitting at the computer all day though, it\u2019s tough but either you learn the material or fail. We cant lessen the standards even farther (especially the US as education has gotten really bad here). \n\nIf your having a hard time, please take a year or two off and come back when things get back to normal. You will still need to work your butt off to get through it but hopefully the social aspect and \u201csuffering together\u201d with peers will help you get through it. It did for me. Another option is to take less classes until things get back to normal so your not suffering so much. \n\nHaving the right environment is key to success in a full time school load. Zoom and online makes this near impossible for most.\n\nI feel the pain believe me. I do think we all need to work together to get through but I\u2019m sure some professors are being dicks, but they are likely that way in person as well. \n\nEven with in person classes, I had a a few professors who would assign 40+hour take home exams during exam week. I did not sleep for several days straight when in their classes during exam weeks. Many times I thought I would not make it. \n\nWas I pissed? Yes. Did I work alone? Yes (or it\u2019s cheating) Did I suffer? Immensely. Do I hate the professor? Hate their guts. Are they different online? NO! \n\nDid I get through it? Yes. \n\nStay strong guys you can do it but it won\u2019t be easy. \n\nGood luck!",

                  "text": "Actually, I'd say the vast majority really care about teaching. The problem isn't our lack of caring. The problem is the incentive system.\n\nYour education frankly doesn't matter. Incredible professors don't get rewarded for their effort or for their class results. I'll get a slap on the hand if my students underperform, but I get absolutely nothing if they all ace the course. If anything, we're punished because the only metric anyone cares about is research, and by spending time caring about *you*, we neglect that research work. Any idiot in that system will immediately figure out the best course of action is to sacrifice teaching. The alternative is to lose your job and not be teaching *or* doing research at all.\n\nPeople who don't enjoy teaching are put in charge of intro courses they hate and have teaching loads too high. People who love teaching are forced to spend most of their time worrying about research, or are earning below minimum wage and living out of their car. \n\nYour professors are doing *at least* double the amount of work you're doing: research as their full-time job *plus* teaching *plus* marking *plus* admin *plus* service work like paper reviews, committees, PhD vivas all around the world, etc. If you're slacking, procrastinating, and finding it hard to be chipper in your 9am lecture, then your professor is obviously not having a good time either. Most of your professors are struggling *at least* as hard as you are right now, but students expect leniency while professors are allowed none. \n\nThe only reason half of them haven't had a total breakdown is because they're not allowed to. There's no one else to teach. They have no choice but to carry on, to show up to every lecture, to mark every assignment, to post updates to the LMS. They get snappier, slower, and make more mistakes, but it has to be done.",

They don\u2019t have to do good to keep their job, but they are ones that make the extra effort even tho they don\u2019t have to because they care about YOU! \n\nSadly you can\u2019t say that about all of them (or even most of them). \n\nI would love to be a professor but I can\u2019t stand working with those types of professors who don\u2019t care about student development and are just jerks who can\u2019t be fired cause they have tenure. \ud83d\ude22",
