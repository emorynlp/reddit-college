  "text": "Hey guys, I'm going into the second semester of my third year. I'm a bio major. I applied to be a tutor for some entry level bio classes and for whatever reason I got rejected, so I've been looking at internships but I can't really find much.\n\nWhat are some things you guys do to be more involved or gain experience? I haven't done clubs because most of my degree has been online. I am joining a lab next semester but most of the semester will just be training and basic stuff before I start my thesis over the summer. I work as a lab tech but it's boring and unrelated to my degree and I really would like to find something better to do with my time.\n\nLet me know what you think.",

          "text": "Honestly it was just a really generous offer. There's a group of research companies near my school and when I was a freshman I just applied like crazy and interviewed as many as possible. It wasn't really in my field of interest (genetics), it was a position in an immunology lab. Because it was mostly data entry and sample collection it didn't require a bachelor's.\n\nIf you're doing anything research related or really technical you'll almost definitely need a bachelor's. But if you can find a clinical lab (even if you can't get a tech position) they have tons of entry level positions just for organizing samples and data from clinical studies. Especially during the pandemic the demand for employees to process tests or build test kits has increased a lot.\n\nApply even when you think you're under-qualified. I agree that most tech jobs do require a bachelor's so just set notifications on Google jobs and keep your eye out for ones that don't specify qualifications or don't have very high ones. Even if you think it's just out of the ballpark, you never know unless you take that chance. Hiring managers are human and if you build a good case sometimes they can overlook your youth or inexperience. \n\nIt helps if you have extremely clear goals and some work experience. In my interview I painted a very clear picture of where I wanted to end up, and I was fortunate enough to interview with a boss who identified with my goals and genuinely wanted to help me. As a ps, keep in contact with *all* interviewers. Even for the jobs I didn't get, some of the interviewers sympathized with me and helped me look out for future opportunities. \n\nI know it's hard and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't 98% luck for me, but it is possible. Good luck!",

I know some people work full time and also go to school full time simultaneously, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to do that unless I really needed the money",

My boss also let's me rearrange my schedule each semester so I can fit my work hours around my classes.\n\nI've worked additional jobs during college and honestly unless you're really broke the full time work is not worth it. It was way too much stress for me to handle and I only did it because I needed to. Hold out for a part time position if you can. I know they're tough to find but they are out there. :)",
