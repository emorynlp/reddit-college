  "text": "Due to how my life played out and circumstances I\u2019m finishing my degree now as General studies in social sciences and humanities. I have 5 classes left to go. I\u2019ll have 0 debt! Anyway- I\u2019m looking at different masters programs but I\u2019m also interested in honing in some skills from various certifications. Has anyone became a Scrum Master or gone down the road of self-training software development/ coding etc? What other certifications are worthwhile to gain some specific skills without doing a masters program? My friends hubby who\u2019s a scrum master makes over $100K a year and works from home, and loves it. She said she would go for that career if she wasn\u2019t busy with their 3 kids right now.",
