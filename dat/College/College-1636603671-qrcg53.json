  "text": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share some advice for people who are trying or struggling to make friends in college because I see a lot of people making posts about being lonely or feeling social isolation. I'm a shy and introverted person so keep that in mind as you read the post.\n\n1. It's okay if you don't have any friends yet. Sometimes it takes a while to meet your people. Even if you have 0 friends today doesn't mean you will have 0 friends for the rest of your life. Even if you make friends in your first year, it doesn't necessarily mean you will be friends forever. People change over time. Maybe you'll realize you don't have that much in common. This happened to me with my friends from first year and it's completely normal. You never know when you will meet the people that you will connect with very well. It might be first year, fourth year, or after college.\n2. If you're looking to make friends, go to places where other people are also looking to make friends. For example, check out your college's events calendar, attend sporting events, or join clubs that you're interested in. When you go to these events, try to make yourself approachable with your body language and facial gestures. Smile and make eye contact with others. Avoid crossing your arms or wearing headphones. Someone might approach you if you seem like you are open to it. If not, say hi and introduce yourself to someone. It can be easier to approach one person or a smaller group rather than a big crowd based on my personal experiences.\n3. Don't settle for friends who are not compatible with your personal beliefs and values. If your friends have some different interests or preferences than you, that is fine (e.g., food, tv shows, hobbies). You don't have to be the same person and agree on everything. On the other hand, if they want you to do activities that go against your beliefs and values, you always have the right to say no. It's better to have less or no friends than to have to sacrifice who you are to be friends with someone.\n\nIf you have any other tips for making friends, please feel free to share!\n\nI also made a video about more tips for making friends in college for anyone who is interested: [https://youtu.be/U9Nky\\_nUP64](https://youtu.be/U9Nky_nUP64) :)",
