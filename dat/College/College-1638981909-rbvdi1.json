  "text": "I\u2019m(m) a freshman in college rn and I do not have any experience with girls like at all but I have a large group of friends. Recently I\u2019ve become kinda close with one of them and she asked if she could stay in my room for a week until the end of the semester, because she\u2019s moving to a new dorm next semester and is moving her stuff a week early.\n\nIdk if I like want to date her but she\u2019s been pretty like \u201cclose\u201d to me I guess and I just want to do some stuff with someone I know.\n\nSo like what do I do? How do I approach about that sort of thing? Is it like weird to ask that sort of thing?",

You've known her for a while, you're supposed to have a general idea of her perspective on stuff like this. Also, it might ruin the relationship you already have if you tell her you want to have casual sex with no actual commitment. Sure, she might be into that but what makes you think a redditor can help you out lmao",

I would do it after she moved out of your room so she doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable sleeping near you. Is it worth the less desirable outcome? \n\nIf you want some girl\u2019s perspective, I\u2019ve had one guy ask me that. I mean, I surprisingly wasn\u2019t creeped out or offended, a part of me kinda appreciated his honesty (I guess?) and asking for my consent. I said no and felt awkward around him for a while, but I didn\u2019t flip out. Tho I guess I\u2019m the minority of girls here in this situation that doesn\u2019t expect guys to be able to read my mind and may have to outright ask me things, and yeah most other girls might flip out and think less of you. I\u2019d be careful about it, or at least wait until after she moves out of your room. Just keep in mind that you\u2019re risking your relationship with her if you do ask her. And if she says no, respect that, as in don\u2019t keep asking her.",
