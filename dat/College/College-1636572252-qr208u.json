  "text": "I\u2019m double majoring in international studies and Japanese. I\u2019m very confused with how my university does academic advising so i\u2019ve fallen behind on two course requirements for my Japanese major. One of my academic advisors told me I was all set while the other one said I was falling behind on two classes and told me it would be wise to take two winter break courses or two summer courses to catch up. I\u2019m conflicted because this semester has been tough for me and I feel like I deserve a break not to mention I really need to catch up on my finances to pay my bills and I also am struggling with an Ulcerative Colitis flare. I\u2019m not sure if I should just suck it up and take it or just do it all over the summer. Any advice is appreciated.",
