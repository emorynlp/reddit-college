  "text": "TL;DR - I feel I was socially outcast because of my age and grades. Advice on making friends moving forward? \n\nSo I\u2019m on \u201colder\u201d student (25) in my first year at a 4yr university. I got my associates at a community college while I was in the military and got out to pursue my degree full time. This was my first semester so I took it easy and only took 1 science class which is A&P1. Literally everyone in this class is aspiring to go to med school or equivalent and I\u2019m no different(dental honestly but same idea). First test this semester I bombed. I\u2019ve never been one to have to study so this was new and honestly a wake up call. I put together a study group and got the highest grade on the next test and have been pretty consistent sense. But here\u2019s the kicker my study group dumped me after the second test. No reason just started meeting without me and made another group chat only answering my messages to find out what I got on test. I found out from one of the group members it was because of my grades and that \u201cI don\u2019t like to hang out\u201d. I live off campus with a partner and don\u2019t really want to invite anyone over who I don\u2019t know as we have a lot ove nice things we\u2019ve worked hard to collect and don\u2019t want ruined. I don\u2019t drink in fact I never have (neither does my partner no reason other than we just don\u2019t like it and thinks it\u2019s a waste of money) I have been used so much as a DD and an alcohol provider, I don\u2019t like to put myself in that situation. Anyways all that is beside the point. Is this what I have to look forward to on my next year and a half? People being weird about my grades and acting weird cause I told them when they asked? I even tried checking myself and making sure I\u2019m not sounding condescending,rude or disrespectful. Tried avoiding the conversation all together as well but people insist. It feels odd to lie about something like grades. Also any advice on getting along? I feel like I\u2019m connecting better with the TAs than I am my peers. I was hoping I would be making some friends as all my military friends have moved on and don\u2019t live in my state.",

      "text": "You have to remember the younger students are not mature in any sense of the word. I totally understand you being a bit of an outsider because of your age and experience. The grades just add to it. There's so much jealousy and cut throat hatred around pre med that I don't enjoy their company generally. \n\nTry getting a new study group of more nerdy people.  The more outsiders you have, the better! Cool kids are groupthink kids. TAs and grad students are good people for socializing. \n\nThank you for your service!",

          "text": "Thanks for the support! I didn\u2019t feel like 5-7 years is that big of a gap but I was thinking about how much growth I did from 18 to now and you are absolutely right. Next semester I\u2019m gonna try to find the ones in my age group and go from there. The only thing with TAs is that they can\u2019t fraternize with undergrads so I\u2019d be toeing a thin line I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to loose their job because some kid thinks the TA is being too friendly to a student. I\u2019m hopeful for next semester. Thanks for the reply!",
