  "text": "I have no clue how to ask him to hurry up without sounding like a pushy jerk since I only gave him a month warning to write one for me (I asked him on Sept 5th, and letters are due Nov 1)\n\nHe may just be busy and I'd want to remind him but at the same time I don't want to be that guy who comes off as rushing him.",

I know that whenever I'm asked to write a letter for a student I always submit on time, but it almost always goes to the bottom of my to do list. If you are worried, I would simply send them a reminder email 5ish days before the deadline.",
