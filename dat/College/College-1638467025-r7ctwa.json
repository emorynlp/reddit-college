  "text": "I had a lot of mental health problems this semester dealing with depression anxiety and even contemplating suicide for a while.I ended up doing really bad in some of my classes. I however got help realized a big root of one of my problems and got better and started feeling more hopeful about the future then ever.\n\nExcept now I look at my grades and see I\u2019m failing and I feel like I ruined everything already. I just found myself believing I could have a better future and now I feel like it\u2019s all gone and there\u2019s nothing left. I think I\u2019m going to fail one class and get probably b or c in the others.\n\nCan I recover from this or is my bad first semester going to stop me. I just feel so hopeless with this weighing me down.",

      "text": "Yes, recovering from a bad semester is definitely possible! I speak from personal experience with this matter. What helped me, is to take a step back, and look at what went well, and what didn't throughout this current semester, and try to figure out why. Then, easier said than done, but try different things to help improve just one of the things on your list, and go from there. Everyone learns differently, so if exams are a problem for you, then you might not have figured out how you learn best, and how your brain best retains information. Another general thing you can do is talk to your professors, if you feel comfortable doing so, and ask them if they have any advice to give you on how you can do better in their course, or similar courses.\n\nI don't know what major you are, so there might be specific advice I could give you from the STEM perspective... Feel free to pm me if you want :)",
