  "text": "So I\u2019m conflicted on what career I would like to take in life. I\u2019m conflicted on either going into accounting or either heading into video game journalism. On the one hand with accounting it\u2019s almost definitely a lot of work with something I\u2019m okay with doing but don\u2019t love it but also probably making a decent amount of money. Then game journalism I have something I\u2019m passionate about but there\u2019s also the fact that I may not make it and won\u2019t be able to make enough to live a comfortable life. Debating on journalism/ English or accounting. Would like advice.",
