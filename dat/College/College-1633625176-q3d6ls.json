  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore majoring in communication sciences and disorders. My freshman year I was elementary ed, but after spending last summer working in a daycare I decided it wasn\u2019t a good fit for me anymore. I know it\u2019s only October, but I have been thinking about summer jobs, and I\u2019m kind of at a loss for what to do this summer. My college is around 4 hours from home so my school can\u2019t really connect me with anything. I tried to find some stuff online but most of them have to do with kids. I babysat all through high school and I was extremely exhausted and stressed doing the daycare job last summer and I really just want a break from working with kids. The only other option I can find is to be some sort of front desk/administrator person which isn\u2019t the worst option but I can\u2019t find anything available right now but I could also just be getting way too ahead of myself because again it\u2019s only October. But on campus during the school year I work for my schools custodial service, and while looking online I found a position posted for a summer janitor job for the school district I went to during K-12. So basically it\u2019s a job really close to my house that I am experience in and super comfortable doing, but it gives me no future career relevant experience. Is that bad? Should I wait until spring and look for a front desk job? Help",

      "text": "I worked at Walmart for 2 summers during college stocking groceries. It was close to home and paid decently (more than I could find elsewhere at the time), and stocking groceries certainly didn\u2019t relate specifically to any career that I planned. \n\nIf you need to make money, take the job that works for you. Any job experience (as long as it\u2019s legal) is good to fill space on a resume until you can work your way into something more relevant long-term.",

You seem tied to the idea of going home for the summer, and if you want a relevant summer job, you need to be willing to go somewhere else. Ask your professors and advisor about summer research internships, they\u2019ll help you figure out how to look.",
