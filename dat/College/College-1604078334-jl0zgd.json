  "title:": "Professor won\u2019t allow me to make-up a midterm?",
  "text": "So I had a midterm this week and got in a serious car accident the day before. (the midterm was only open during the day it was due.) I was unable to do the exam, and in the course syllabus it states, \u201cMake-up tests are given only if there is solid evidence of a medical or otherwise serious emergency that prevented the student from taking the exam\u201d. I wrote her an email stating my situation and offered to provide all documentation as necessary. My professor replied that since they went over the test during the following day\u2019s lecture, there is nothing I can do to make it up. \n\nMy grade went from an 85 to a 51. \n\nEDIT 1: So I should probably clear this up. I emailed the professor before the test was due, and she didn\u2019t respond. Then I followed up after the test was due. I also didn\u2019t make it to class where they reviewed the test, but the lectures are recorded so technically I could go look at the answers at any time.\n\nEDIT 2: Some of you are asking for the exact wording from my professor so here it is. The first email I sent, several hours BEFORE the test was due was where I explained my situation and stated that I would be unable to take the test on the given date and asked if I can make it up. To this I got no response. Then I sent a second email the next day asking again if I can make up the test in some way, as the syllabus says I should be allowed to. Professor replied to my email with, \u201cNo you can not make up the test. The solutions were covered in class. Thank you.\u201d\n\nHope this clears the confusion.\n\nIs there anything I can do in this situation? Can I message someone higher up in my college about this? I can\u2019t really afford to fail this class, especially not for a reason such as this.",

I was told I would fail my final and fail out of nursing school....for going to the ED because my heart felt it was going to explode. \n\nWell, I definitely didn\u2019t accept that and went immediately to the department head. She very quickly changed her tune. \n\nI don\u2019t care about class standards or rules or policies. Life happens. This same prof had 3 weeks off for a family death in a summer semester. We literally missed out on weeks of lectures and help, but no one complained because we felt sorry for her. However, when that same understanding doesn\u2019t extend to students...nope. You can fuck right off. Side note, I also lost my aunt the next day and she (again) told me to fuck off or take the final that day. \n\nSuch. A. Bitch.",

Pay attention that not all papers work. It must be a fit/sick note. There is a diffence between the papers the doctor might give you. If he gives you a paper that you were in an appoitment the day before the exam that won't work. It has to be a paper that states that from day X to Y you had medical leave(something like that, I can't remember the exact name lol)",

Forward all emails/documentation that you've sent and received from your professor, regarding the midterm and why you missed it (as well as the syllabus; don't send medical documents unless prompted), to your dean and your academic advisor. As well as this, inform them of your current medical situation (as in how you're doing at the time you send the emails and how you were doing when the test took place) and what you would like to do to remedy the issue (i.e. making up the exam, getting an exemption from the midterm, etc.).\n\nMake sure to say that you want to be cc'd/bcc'd for any and all communication regarding this issue. Also, if any email is sent to you and only you, regarding this issue (whether it's from the professor, dean, academic advisor or otherwise) cc/bcc both your academic advisor and your dean when responding to the email; if you're not responding to it, and the email sent to you is just meant to be a memo about the issue, forward it to your academic advisor and Dean.\n\nYou want to make sure that both your academic advisor and your dean are fully aware of the issue at hand and that you had no control of the situation that occurred. That rule of \"no-make up exams\" is meant to be a safeguard, so that students don't purposefully miss an exam in an effort to cheat, but it's not meant to be held over a student's head to actively penalized them. It may feel like you're being annoying by sending every email to your academic advisor and your dean, but at the end of the day it is their job to help you, especially with an outstanding situation like this.\n\nSorry for sending an essay, but I want to try and help as much as I can. I hope your situation gets better, and if you read this and want to discuss it further, dm me (if you actually read this far).",

Email the professor again, inquiring politely but firmly as to why the syllabus clause would not apply here, and preemptively include the documentation of your crash. Most platforms have completion tracking, so the professor will be able to see whether or not you accessed the lecture. Mention that you had not attended and did not view the lecture, and request again that you are able to take the midterm. If that does not work, then it may be time to get the head involved.\n\nEmailing the dean is just going to waste their time and piss everyone off unnecessarily. It won't do much more than emailing the head, but it will make sure that the entire experience is much more negative for all involved.",
