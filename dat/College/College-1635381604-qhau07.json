  "title:": "Advice from a senior: take courses that overlap different categories",
  "text": "We all need to take electives and/or general Eds that have little (or nothing) to do with our major. Sometimes these requirements seem like a lot, but there's something I learned from experience: take courses that satisfy more than one requirement. A little example, in order to satisfy the general Eds at my university, we have to take courses in 10 different goal areas (math, writing, science, communication, social studies, etc). But, looking at the description for these different options I could take, many of them applied to more than one category. So what I did was take as many courses as I could that satisfied as many requirements as possible, even if I really didn't like the material, that way I saved up money by not taking unnecessary classes, and at the end of my degree I have already completed my elective requirements, so now I have room to choose easy classes/classes that I like in my final semesters, so I can focus on my main classes and graduate.\n\nI don't know how it works in other countries or even other universities within the US, but I guess that some of them might be similar in terms of electives, so that's my advice to you",

      "text": "I envy the basic logic of your school. Where I am, they are very explicit about the fact that even if a course fulfills more that one credit requirement, you have to choose which one it applies to. No double dipping. Makes it rough for people trying to dual-major/minor in a field that shares a lot of courses with their primary major.",
