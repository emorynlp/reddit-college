  "text": "I\u2019m looking for help from my college because we were able to identify the girl who was in the room with me and she was the only one in the room with me I had talked the computer under my notebook I had a little bit of a coughing fit so I walked around the corner so that I wouldn\u2019t make her uncomfortable since we were the only two in the small room on the security video you can see that once I\u2019m around the corner towards the restroom where I washed my hands and came right back in those minutes she quickly leaves the area and you can see her eyes Darting left and right suspiciouslyNot that that means anything\n\nBut the fact that it is a dead end and we were the only two in that room no one else answered or left the room I was only out for a minute or two and when I came back my computer was gone I raise the alarm I have described her perfectly on the video we were able to see her but of course she\u2019s wearing a mask but identified her and the man that she was with who had left earlier they can look on the video and they can see and follow her on campus where she came from or where she went\n\nI was not allowed to watch that tracking portion as a security guard performed that I only helped identify the person and they did the tracking while I did my police report with the police who had arrived then they were hoping if she was still on campus that the police could politely ask her to search her backs since the campus security would not but the police said he would unfortunately this never happened so I assume that she immediately left campus of course it\u2019s possible that she was still there and security just didn\u2019t take any action\n\nI am hoping to still recover this machine although I know that it is probably gone forever in my thinking since we have identified her in this fashion it would be simple enough to send that photo to everyone who taught classes that day in the building and just have the teachers be able to say yes this is a student in my class would be enough for the dean to be able to make a little announcement to that class about the reward that I will offer for the return of the computer \n\nOf course if I could get the college on my side it would be easy enough to identify this person but I need to get the other people at the college to help me and I don\u2019t know if they will obviously this is against the schools code of conduct and it just seems to me that if it\u2019s too circumstantial for the police to pursue this matter that it\u2019s not to circumstantial of a case for this to reflect on that students code of conduct\n\nI reached out to the dean of my school I mean the dean of my department into the presidents office there is a administrative assistant there I just want to escalate this and see it because we only have two weeks left of classes she\u2019s obviously going to be in that same building again next week she\u2019s obviously still in a class there is still time to potentially recover this \n\nI\u2019m not really interested in punitive measures but am I wrong to think that the college could ask her to return the computer with that sort of implied threat of hayu know you\u2019re putting your academic career on the line do you think the college is going to help me at all or are they just going to let me fail out of school now\n\nOK the college did provide me with a loaner to use and they provided me with the accessibility software that I use on this computer loaner the problem is that the accessibility software records my lectures my notes for me so all of my notes and all of my recorded lectures are gone I can\u2019t get any of those back going in the finals now and I really desperately need the most recent notes going into this last round of exams before the finals I\u2019m super screwed am I wrong to think that the college has some way of helping me and could potential he help me more \nin trying to recover this machine machine\n\nDo you guys have any other ideas and yes I did not have the find my device activate it now I know for the future to do that is anyone else have experience with soft in college and know who I should be asking for help I just went to the date of my department and sent an email I copied the head of security and now I\u2019m reaching out to the presidents office because I just don\u2019t know",
