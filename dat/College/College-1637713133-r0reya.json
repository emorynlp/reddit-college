  "text": "Im a freshman in college. It\u2019s only a few days into break and I feel uncomfortable. It can\u2019t help that I had to put my dog down yesterday and that so much has changed since I got back. \n\nI just miss my dorm which is a weird thing to say. I miss my friends and I wanna have that routine that I got used to back. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this or has felt like this? Does it get better the more you go back and forward from home?",

Just be thoughtful about this with your family - they may be really hurt if you say it to them. \n\nI also got physically ill after every semester. Like all the stress and adrenaline to get through finals left me exhausted and immune-ready. Every. Single. Time.",
