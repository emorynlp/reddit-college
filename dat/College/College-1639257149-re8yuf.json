So make sure you are taking good care of yourself physically and practice healthy stress management. \n\nAlso if you *still* need it - here's your permission to say **NO** to any situation that doesn't benefit your mental and physical wellbeing.\n\nShout out to all the students with narcissistic parents and toxic families, you are a **warrior** and you got this!
