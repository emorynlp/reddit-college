  "text": "So I just took my finals and in one of them we used the lockdown browser but there was no webcam check because we were having problems with it my professor said he turned it off. I just wanted to know if it still recorded the audio because I was playing some music and got up a few times to wander around and think of the problem and they usually don't allow those things.",
