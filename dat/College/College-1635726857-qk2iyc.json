  "text": "My roommate is an intense gamer and is addicted to League of Legends. Every single day, I come home and hear obnoxious clicking and typing all day. It drives me absolutely insane and I don\u2019t know how to live like this. He used to keep me up at night playing games, but thankfully he\u2019s gotten better at it.\n\nIt\u2019s just frustrating because he doesn\u2019t leave the room and I never want to be in my room and it just sucks when after a long day of classes or work, I come home and feel like I can\u2019t even relax in my own room. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to bring this up to him because he\u2019s trying to join the esports team and has been playing nonstop lately and I don\u2019t wanna shit on his hobbies or passions, but it\u2019s just too fucking much. He doesn\u2019t really have any friends so this is pretty much all he does so I don\u2019t know how to tell him to stop playing.",

You both live together and both have needs that should be compromised on. \n\nHopefully he is understanding and can come to some agreement.\n\nmy brothers roommate had several alarms that go off at 4, 5, 6 am. and that drove him insane. not only that his roommate\u2019s girlfriend called him throughout the night all the time. finally he said something and they coordinate alarms. and he just grew balls to tell his gf to stfu",

      "text": "This is going to be an unpopular comment, but most people who game all day are bad news and I'd try to change roommates if you can.\n\n He is never going to stop until he fails his courses and gets suspended, and he's probably not going to clean up after himself or practice basic hygiene. It might not seem so bad now, but as he begins to fail his classes he will become progressively more depressed and game more and more.\n\n I've had 3 roommates like this and they all just spiral downward until they get kicked out of college. Most of these people can't be saved so it's best just to change rooms.",
