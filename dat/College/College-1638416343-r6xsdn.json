  "text": "This is my first semester at a community college. Nobody in my family has ever graduated college apart from my cousin so I asked her to help me. She said I should major in communications just because it\u2019s a good versatile degree and because I have no clue what I wanna do yet. Is this a good degree? She is stupid and got a degree in feminist studies so there\u2019s that. Should I switch my major I\u2019ve already failed one class this semester and it\u2019s been weighing heavy on me (it was a math class) what\u2019s a good degree. I\u2019ve heard business degrees are amazing.",

Usually,  if your grades are good, but it will be harder and on average, pay less.\n\nBut if you choose a major you hate, odds are you will never finish it.\n\nEvery community College has an extensive guidance counselor system. Use it",
