  "text": "Hey guys I really need some advice, I'm currently not doing good mentality and my classwork has suffered tremendously. I had all A's about a month ago, but now I'm failing 2 of my 5 classes. It's my first semester here in college and I don't want to let anyone down anymore that I already have. It's stupid I know, but I'm worried about it negatively affecting my GPA if I drop out now (I've also put in a lot of work in those two courses and it hurts to just \"throw it all away\").",

      "text": "Im sorta in the same boat. failing 2 classes. im dropping out of one becasue i think i can pass the other one. I don't know what advice to give you but hang in there and really talk to your professors you never know what could happen. If your professors tell you that theres no chance of you passing the class then drop it. Its better to drop it than fail.",
