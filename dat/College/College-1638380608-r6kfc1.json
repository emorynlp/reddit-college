  "text": "One of my classes is in a classroom where every little sound is amplified. The acoustics just make every sound so loud and it\u2019s so annoying because I\u2019m trying to listen, trying to hear what the professor has to say but it\u2019s impossible when people are having side conversations. Stop talking when the professor is talking! It\u2019s rude \n\nOr when the professor says something and everyone jumps in with something to say; I understand that it\u2019s interesting and you have a story to share but most of the time it\u2019s irrelevant or a small tidbit and I\u2019m just like ?? What was the point of saying that? \n\nIdk i\u2019m not trying to shit in anyone, but it is annoying to not be able to hear the professor and there are ten people talking at once and all the sounds just pound my eardrum and it\u2019s overstimulating. I find myself trying so hard not to cry or get up and leave because of it.",
