  "text": "I got an email from the counseling office saying that I need to meet with a counselor because I got a \u201cU\u201d (unsatisfactory) on both my midterms. The semester ends the week before Christmas, and my grade in my one class is a 25 out of 100. My other grade is at 65 out of 100. I really can\u2019t afford to fail these classes. I\u2019ve already taken the one class before, and I failed so I had to take it again this semester. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even make it.",

      "text": "Echoing what everyone else has already said: there is no shame in retaking a class.\n\nBut since you said you want to graduate already, contact your professors! Go over each midterm with them\u2014try and figure out what didn\u2019t work for you. Did you study the wrong material? Did you not study enough? Did you under-answer some questions? If you\u2019re honest about the fact you\u2019re struggling and show that you are working hard in your classes, they may offer you some extra credit or some generous rounding at the end of the semester. Be transparent with them \u2014 it\u2019ll help you in the long run! Professors who know that a poor student is working hard tend to be kinder with the final grade. Either way, tell them you\u2019re going to try studying differently for the final and ask them what else you can do now to pass.\n\nIf you have any friends in the class, ask them to form a study group OR simply ask if they want to go over what happened in class. I don\u2019t know what kind of classes you\u2019re taking, but a good (and very easy) way to study for your final is this: at the end of each class, sit down and write a couple fake test questions that touch on the big ideas from that lecture. If you have the energy, add two or three \u201cobscure\u201d multiple choice questions. You\u2019ll have a practice test by finals, which will help you figure out what you need to review and what you\u2019ve got down pat! Taking that practice test will be super helpful, especially because you\u2019ll have \u201creviewed\u201d each lecture after class (helping cement what\u2019s going on) and then reviewed a second time by taking that test, all without actually cracking open your textbook! \n\nAll this to say \u2014 it\u2019s ok. You\u2019re going to be ok. You have time! You got this! No matter what happens, it\u2019s fine to retake classes. College is hard. You\u2019re doing great.",

Not saying you're a bad student or that you don't do these things but you have to motivate yourself and get your discipline to the point where you can sit down and do your work even when you don't feel like doing nothing . Otherwise you're just throwing money down the drain and spending extra unnecessary time in college. Good luck man, hope everything works out for you.",
