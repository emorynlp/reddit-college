  "text": "I'm having a rough time figuring out financial aid despite going to the financial aid offices and how this all works. Student Centers and Bursar's Office barely give help because they navigate you back and forth to help desks. I was just told I can't use any financial aid if I'm going to school part time without having taken any gen-ed classes and having less than 24 months in school by our student admissions but then the financial aid office said that yes, i will get aid, but it'll only half of what i would've originally gotten if i went full time instead. I'm just concerned because I need housing help. My FAFSA hasn't come back yet but once it has ill figure out how much I get but I'm freaked out because if I live in the dorms I won't have anywhere to come home to. My mom is into small life living and my dad's moving to Florida, i can't afford a plane ticket and my parents have no room for me. My family won't let me live with them. This is the best spot for me for college because i already live here and have made friends and if I go for my specific major this is the only place i can do it. Housing really scares me because i don't want to end up homeless\n*not asking about admissions I'm already accepted just confused about housing",

      "text": "In order to be considered full time, you have to be taking at least 12 credit hours per semester. I don't know if this policy applies to your school, but the same goes for on-campus housing.\n\nI'm a little confused, do you currently live in the same city (or driving distance) of your university? Why would you not have anywhere to go if you decided to live on campus?",
