  "text": "Hello!   \nI was wondering if anyone else was thinking about registering for the Inside Washington Seminar that is in January 2022 by The Washington Center.   \nI haven't seen much about it online but the contact person at my college was really excited that I was interested in going. I submitted my application and deposit today for it.   \nIt sounds like a really great opportunity for the political science, government, international relations, and history majors (and minors) but also anyone in general.",
