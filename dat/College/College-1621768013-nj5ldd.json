  "title:": "I\u2019m proud of my upward trend through college",
  "text": "First semester was a tough adjustment. I got cited for underage drinking (which was expunged from my record thankfully so it didn\u2019t impact me at all long term). I got a 2.47 gpa. By the time I was going into junior year I had a 3.04 cumulative gpa. Come this last semester of college I got a 3.93 for my last semester of college and brought my cumulative up to a 3.3. I know 3.3 isn\u2019t anything to brag about in and of itself and I wish I did better earlier on so I didn\u2019t have to bring it up so much but I\u2019m proud of the upward trajectory I\u2019ve had over my college career. Grad school is definitely likely for me!",
