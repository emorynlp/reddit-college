  "text": "I'll try to make this short. We have a bad professor. The dean of the math department already had to get involved on one issue and made her excuse a project she had no intention of excusing. She has lied. Some students have never received an email response from her the entire 8 week asynch semester. She's made several large mistakes but for brevity I'll leave them out.\n\nMy question is, has anyone been in a similar situation where the professor was the reason you did badly in a course, and you were able to get a grade change? I don't know my final grade yet, but if its anything like I'm predicting I would like to contest it. Several students are in the same boat. (PS, I am an A B student. I would not blame my prof if the bad grade was really my fault.) There's a meeting with the dean of the college on Monday where we will get more info but I wanted to hear yalls experiences.\n\nTL;DR: AWOL professor caused class-wide bad grades, I'm wondering if anyone has successfully got a grade change after the class ended.",

I have had one professor so bad that they didn't give any details about what finals entailed, and I lost it! I won only because I had backing of literally all classmates! The teacher basically curved mad heavy into our favor! \n\nso if they \n\n- have little to no resources on finals\n\nand\n\n- have very small curve\n\nand\n\n- is known to be terrible teacher\n\nand\n\n- you have backing of classmates\n\nyou will have fighting chance!",

As far as finals she uploaded a small practice test which is nice, but throughout the semester she hasn't helped the students with their math questions. Considering the math department dean has had to get involved already, I thought I had a good chance. Thanks for replying!\n\nEdit: Reworded a confusing sentence",
