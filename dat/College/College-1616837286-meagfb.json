  "title:": "These past 2 1/2 Covid semesters have ruined me as a student",
  "text": "Hey, this is my first post, wanted to just get my words out somewhere cause it\u2019s killing me inside.\n\nThese last few semesters just drained everything out of me. I transferred to a new college last semester, and ended up withdrawing from one class, and barely passing the remaining 3, although 1 of them I\u2019m retaking because it\u2019s such a core class and I still don\u2019t understand a good portion of it, and the curve was really low which is the only reason I passed.\n\nNow this semester I tried to lighten the work load and take only 3 classes, and struggling again and might have to withdraw from a core class. I\u2019m so over learning online, I\u2019m so much more engaged and happier in person, but I can\u2019t retain information when I sit at a computer screen for 10 hours a day. These semesters have plummeted my mental health to the worse it\u2019s been. It feels like this year amounted to nothing and I\u2019ll basically be redoing my sophomore year of college all over again next year, and I\u2019m ok with that as long as in person classes resume but idk it makes me feel like a complete failure. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this and is getting a similar experience out of this past academic year? All my friends are passing their classes and managing far better than me and it\u2019s hard to talk about this with them, would just like to know that I\u2019m not alone in this",

      "text": "OH, another tip that I can recommend but may not be for everyone depending on their level of discipline: Some of the classes I'm taking will by asynchronous, meaning no zoom meetings. One of them being college algebra. Not only do I not have to worry about attending their zooms on time, but I can also work ahead whenever I want just to get it over with so that I can then put my focus elsewhere. You bet I'm doing that with ALL my math classes.",

      "text": "**BRUUUUUH**. I feel you so hard on feeling like you do better with in-person classes. I'm internally screeching right now because I am having to take both Anatomy and Physiology one AND two ONLINE, currently taking the first one and it is no ***J O K E***. **Y'AAAAALLLLL** half the time I'm dying inside because I feel like I'd be learning this a lot more in person, but I mean all you can really do is the best you can in this situation. I'm trying to not kick myself as much because let's be honest, this is a h e a v y subject to learn with lots details that also tie into what you learn in BIO. So much muscles, so much bones, joints, articulations.... It's my first time taking a class like this so it's to be expected to find this challenging. That's normal. Some subjects may be more challenging to you than others too and that's fine. What doesn't make this as bad for me is that I'd rather read about A&P than math, hahahahaha. No shade to those who really like that subject, I just cannot get myself to focus as much. My attention span is shorter with that one. What also really helps is that the professor I have for A&P is super understanding and has made certain accommodations for some situations.\n\nOther than that though, you seriously aren't alone here. What has helped me a bit is knowing that other future people that you may run into like interviewers at grad schools or whatever will hopefully look at this point in time as a time to give us a little bit of grace due to the circumstances. Like right now, I'm just aiming to pass the first part of A&P with at LEAST a C or at most a B if I'm lucky (LOL). Then once I take part 2, I'll at least be more prepared and know what to expect. If I absolutely have to redo this first A&P class for whatever reason, I will worry about that later.\n\nNot sure how exactly the workload is for you but, because you mentioned feeling so drained, make sure you give yourself some time to breath in-between assignments. I know damn well I need to give myself a break once I notice myself making dumb mistakes on practice quizzes/exercises/homework and can't maintain enough focus to finish whatever I'm reading. This could be anything from going outside to get some fresh air, meditate, listen to music, anything that can help recharge your battery and relieve your eyes from lots of screen-time.\n\nAlso if you can, to make bigger tasks/projects look less daunting, try breaking it up into smaller bits and disperse it throughout the week (or however long you need) in a way that you feel you can get it done. The chapters I gotta read for both A&P and my developmental psychology class are ***T H I C C*** and there's no way I'd read that all in one day. Trying to do so will only spike my anxiety so therefore, I break it up into chunks throughout the week by dedicating a chapter to a certain day to focus on. How you do this will also depend on the pacing of your coursework.",

I\u2019m set to leave the school I go to now and transfer for the fall semester, but...\n\n my $ situation is all jacked up cuz of covid and I really don\u2019t see how having $10k+ in loans is going to be worth it whenever I go. Mom is shelling out $2000 a month and although she\u2019s generally supportive she feels the need to throw it in my face on occasion.\n\nI\u2019m getting rejected left and right from most of the schools I applied to for transferring \n\nMy motivation and desire to keep chugging away at the classes I\u2019m taking now is rapidly depleting and I\u2019m considerably behind in all of them \n\nI feel lost, trapped, and a bit scared- I want out. Im a journalism major who wants to freelance and who\u2019s writing is top notch (as I\u2019ve been told by many writers, English teachers, etc) feeling more and more like this is all a scam and I should just forge my own way instead.\n\nLast semester I broke down crying because of the workload and being inside most of the time has warped my already shaky mental state even further. I managed to pull two As and a B- (withdrew from the fourth class entirely because I just couldn\u2019t) and going through that again makes me want to curl up into myself. \n\nI\u2019m just tired. \n\nEDIT: I\u2019m a sophomore I guess I should mention that",

      "text": "I'm in the same place trying to stay on track with school in an all-online setting. I am a 31 year old vet that started school after I got out of the army. I've been going to community college for 5 years working towards transfer to a university for aerospace engineering. I finally got to the point last semester where I could apply for the fall 2021 term at universities. After 5 years of work and a 3.8GPA I've gotten accepted to every school I've applied to, including CalPoly SLO and I was so proud because it is my top choice. But these past two semesters have been so rough. I am currently trying to get through this very last semester before I transfer, but I am having to take multivariable calculus, engineering statics and physics of electricity and magnetism, NONE of which lend themselves well to fully online instruction, but are all required major-prep courses for all but 1 of the 9 schools I applied to. I've managed to keep my head above water in math and engineering, but my physics teacher has made it his stated goal to make the class as difficult as he can so that he protects his \"reputation as a tough instructor\". I've had tough classes in the past, but the workload is insane, the class average is <50% and I am sitting at 53% which means that if I can't pass this class I am looking at an entire year before I can reapply so I can get into a decent university. I feel like the last 5 years has been for nothing. All of my work and all of my other grades (at least in the eyes of the universities I want to transfer to) will be overshadowed by one single class... It's infuriating.",

I will admit that it led to me falling behind on lectures and such, I\u2019ve felt paralyzed by the workload and it felt daunting to start it which just made it worse and that\u2019s my fault, but now the last day for withdrawal is Monday and I don\u2019t trust myself to be able to bounce back with this while actually understanding the material, so I\u2019m leaning towards withdrawing.\n\nThe other two classes I\u2019m in I\u2019m doing good, the homework sites that they use are helpful in teaching the topics as we do the work in addition to lectures, and I\u2019m confident I can pull through with a B or A in both those classes.\n\nAs for coping skills, I really don\u2019t know, there was a lack of research on my part cause I just told myself this semester would be better, which was my fault.",

I'm paying to learn not just get by. Since the weather is nice, I've been taking my classes to the back yard. Sunshine and a view of nature mildly helps with my mental state. I've also been lucky to find a few people to study with. We meet for an hour and review material and ask questions, mostly me, on sections that need clarity. The social interaction has also helped improve my mood. Get out of the house! Walk around the block, drive around a super nice neighborhood, get a  coffee or tea. 10 hours infront of a computer is a lot. Can you minimize that at all? Are your books on the computer? Can you get a physical copy to reduce looking at the computer? Do you have to attend lecture?  I stopped attending my cal class. The professor goes to quickly for me to keep up. So I study the material and work on assignments during the lecture time and only attend during reviews. Online learning has been a blessing for some people. They have the motivation without the need for social interaction. I've always been a better student with in person learning. My facial cues are a dead give away when I'm not grasping a concept and most professors would see that and re-explain. But that is no longer the case and trying to get a question in seems impossible, without looking like an idiot. There is also the summer coming up. Perhaps you can revisit your notes to refresh on that core class. Just some tips from a struggling student that have helped me keep going.",
