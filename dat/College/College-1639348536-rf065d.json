  "text": "Been contemplating this a lot. Rn I have a 97 GPA, with most of my classes falling between the 94-100 range. Finals are coming up, and I'm unsure if I should spend a few extra hours studying and completing some generous extra credit assignments given by professors due tomorrow. While I'm in a pretty confident and safe spot, I'm not sure if an actual percentage matters in college like high school, or simply focus on getting at least a 94 to maintain an A. What are your thoughts?",
