  "title:": "Update on filming music video worth 40% of my grade with no one to help me.",
  "text": "Okay so, since this is worth such a considerable chunk of my grade, we are given 6 months to film and edit it. I now have one month left and 0 footage. \n\nUsing lots of peoples suggestions I managed to film the \u201clip sync\u201d part by myself and was pretty pleased with said footage. However me being the dumb fuck I am dropped the SD card in a forest when trying to film the narrative section and never found it so I\u2019m now back to square one. \n\nI\u2019ve had many other things going on and my attendance for this and other classes is extremely low, I also have a job so no time on weekends to film and I cannot film after classes as by then it is too dark. However this project is stressing me out so much I am considering skipping all my classes next week just to film this, which will take a considerable hit on my attendance and I will fall further behind in the other subjects but at least id have something to show for whats 40% of my grade. \n\nI still haven\u2019t found anyone to star in said video so I\u2019ve pretty much accepted I\u2019m filming and being in the entire thing. I\u2019m very disappointed that it\u2019s going to look so crap considering how long we were given for it, but I have the time management skills of a potato which is probably something I should talk to someone about because it\u2019s effecting my well-being. \n\nIm not sure if skipping classes is a good idea or not and what I should even do. Do I just pretend everything else doesn\u2019t exist and get this project out the way? I\u2019ve genuinly never felt this stressed in my life and it\u2019s making me really depressed amongst other things.",

      "text": "Hey. Broadcasting Major here. I understand the stress of having to film something. I get extreme anxiety with anything I have to film. \n\nHave you asked other classmates to help you out? And even if you just have acquaintances and no friends around... it doesn't hurt to ask someone who isn't your friend. The worst that you can get is a no and you'd be surprised how many people are willing to help out.\n\nGood luck dude. And don't skip class. You can do this.\n\nEdit: Even if you do a half ass job... you will still get some kind of grade. So even if you do it and it doesn't come out well.... points are points.",
