  "text": "Hello, I'm writing my master's thesis, the title is \"Equity price risk and capital markets in pandemic period - analysis on selected companies.\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just starting, and since I was doing my bachelor's degree in international trade I'm not too sure where to find sources for what I need. I'm currently looking for some credible statistics around investing (number of participants in capital markets (households/companies from say 2018-most recent year that I can find), how their preferences changed (e.g. I'd assume in march 2020 they preferred government bonds when everything seemed bad and then they saw the stocks rebound and moved into that) maybe these investment preferences for banks/funds/households, how the number of investors in cryptocurrencies changed over the years).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaturally, any good literature/articles about equity risk/capital markets would be highly appreciated as well. (I've read only  Cagan, M.: Stock Market 101, Adamsmedia, Avon, MA  pretty much)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Alternatively, if this isn't the place for this question, could someone direct me to a reddit where this question would fit?\n\n&#x200B;",
