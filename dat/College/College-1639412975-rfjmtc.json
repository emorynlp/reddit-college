  "text": "My thirty-six year-old classmate has two children, an evening job and journey time from her home to our lecture halls (and I'd assume a lot more adult responsibilities than my teen ass) and she's absolutely crushing all her classes. Then here I am struggling to do the simplest tasks on time, doing mediocrely in exams and procrastinating like crazy with my almost-fourteen hours of free time during the day. How can I be more like her?",

          "text": "Definitely time management is key. But also, you might not be busy enough. In my experience, once I started working part time I got way more done, and much sooner because there were more restrictions on my schedule. Even with clubs or hobbies, last month I did a 30 day video challenge for my YouTube channel and things like dishes and laundry got done more often because I had limited time and a project I was committed to, so the necessities had to get done sometime and there's no time like the present. Structure and goals are great motivators.\n\nBut also don't overload yourself. Learn your limits slowly, otherwise your grades and mental health will suffer. But just an idea for you to try out maybe.",

      "text": "Lol my circumstances are very similar to your classmate. I excel bc my need to provide a good life for my kids is a pretty large motivator. I can\u2019t afford to fuck up ever, because then all the hard work and juggling and blah blah, would be for nothing. \n\nI did pretty mediocre before kids tbh. Not sure what would have motivated me at that point lol maybe have some kids \ud83d\ude02 jkjk",
