  "text": "I have 2 more semesters of my undergrad, I'm pursuing my bachelor of science in clinical counseling psychology, and working full time as a registered behavioral technician. I am currently taking 15 credit hours, and I feel with 3 a's 1 B and a C, that I'm failing. All I can think about is the C. All I can think about is I'm failing, I'm close to a D. This is my most difficult subject, I've been avoiding chemistry for as long as I can remember. Here I am, taking all the tutoring and study sessions I can, and still feeling like I'm failing. I'm scraping by with a C. I'm an a student. This feels like shit. My anxiety is going nuts. I feel like this could impact my ability to get into grad school.",
