  "text": "My gf is in her second year medical science at probably the best school in our province. She was an A+ student in highscool and had a 4.0 gpa for her first year university online. This semester, she is overwhelmed with the work load and is not doing well in her classes. All she does all day and all night is study, so her effort is there, but the results aren\u2019t. She wants to possibly switch into bachelor of health in another, less prestigious school in the city but she thinks her grades from this semester will have her at a dead end. She is going to talk to an academic advisor next week but I want to try and find some options for her to consider and possible make her feel less discouraged? Any advice is appreciated!",
