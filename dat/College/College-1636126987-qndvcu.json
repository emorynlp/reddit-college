  "text": "I (18F) just passed high school and wanna put myself through med school, i basically have boiled it down to 2 choices, i either go to extremely expensive and prestigious institute with great education, or a lower ranked (government) less preferred one but it's fees is almost near to nothing. In both scenarios it totally depends on the hardwork I'm willing to put in to make it big later in life, it's just that in the expensive one I'd be less dependent on myself and find better guidance.\n\nThe deal is, there is no way i want to be a burden on my mother, and the fees is fucking hefty, my father died earlier this year and that just makes it more worse, if i do choose the expensive one I'd take student loan but I'd have to pay it for the next 15 years of my life, and getting through med school is just the 1st step, there's usually higher courses which have become important to be a good reputable doctor, I don't wanna end up spending so much on me just in the beginning, in the other one i would have to completely study everything on my own (Maybe that's exaggerating it, but from what I've heard). I'm confused, any help is appreciated.",

It really doesn\u2019t matter what college you go to, the name doesn\u2019t really mean anything for the most part. As long as you put in the work and get good grades and show your worth, the outcome will be almost identical. Only difference is you will have less debt.",

      "text": "Don't bother with the expensive schools unless you get a scholarship that makes the price comparable to a state university. Medical school adcoms do not give a single shit about the undergraduate university you attended. Prioritize nailing down that 4.0, studying for the MCAT, and getting in clinical and research hours. Work part-time as a medical scribe or get on board with a couple of your professor's research projects and that'll make a much bigger difference than the prestige of the university you attended.",
