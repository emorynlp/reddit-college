  "text": "A lot of sites have good educational resources that don't tend to get as much press as the default [khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). Which is nice, but does have its limits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has been a fun afternoon seeing what was available, if you have any recombinations leave a comment on what you find.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Openstax](https://openstax.org/)\n\nA most standard curriculum course.\n\nThe main focus seems to be [college physics](https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics), [Principles of Accounting](https://openstax.org/details/books/principles-financial-accounting), and [Anatomy and Physiology](https://openstax.org/details/books/anatomy-and-physiology).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[College of the Canyons](https://www.canyons.edu/academics/onlineeducation/ztc/textbooks.php)\n\nA more diverse collection of resources.\n\nAnything from [personal finance](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_personal-finance/), [theatre](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ibRKS2v_qeQwXuZHKAvb2I0jAn7GwCSM), [child growth development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AulDW7aQGLw&t=11638s&ab_channel=ArchivistRecordings), and a lot of books on [water technology](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EykqopXTw09wxCiwHeaOD7W8AlSVtXmi).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/)\n\nOER movement is rooted in the human right to access high-quality education.\n\nThis is more like a small library of recourses. Which I used as a starting point to find the other materials. The main downside is that it takes more work to find what you want but is well worth it.\n\nIf you want to find [colleagues](https://www.oercommons.org/groups/), [materials](https://www.oercommons.org/oer), or if your focus is more [common core](https://www.oercommons.org/hubs/common-core) they have a lot of options.",
