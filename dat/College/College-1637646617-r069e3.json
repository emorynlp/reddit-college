  "text": "Hey, so I'm supposed to come up with 4 premises for just one of any of these ideas and write a paper on them but I'm not really sure what I should talk about \n\n    Euthanasia is moral\n    Euthanasia is not moral\n    We have a moral responsibility to help the poor\n    We don't have a moral responsibility to help the poor\n    The wealthy should be taxed more than the poor\n    The wealthy should not be taxed more than the poor\n    The government should mandate vaccines\n    The government should not mandate vaccines\n\nI was thinking of doing the first/second or the last/second last one but what can I talk about? The only thing that I can think of is that it allows a person to die a \"good death\" instead of torturing but idk what else.",

      "text": "You could include the last one as one of your premises in the second one. An example being why should the government not get to dictate your medical care (such as in the form of vaccines), and yet they can dictate that it is unethical to medically end your life? Then, one of the arguments for not mandating vaccines is that it should be a personal choice for each individual, but then why is living not? Why is it ok for someone to decide that the vaccine associated risks aren't worth potentially saving their lives, and yet someone can't decide that the actual impact of living with certain conditions is worth ending theirs? To piggyback off of yours, it would allow someone to decide not to suffer any longer with something they already have, and yet the popular way to go is to instead believe people should get a choice because of something they don't even have yet (be it vaccine injury or the result of not getting one). All of this falls under the umbrella of hypocrisy that is dictated by what the majority of society believes is virtuous and/or ethical at any given time. Right now, it is having the right to choose, regardless of the adverse effects either way, beforehand. However, once you are suffering adverse effects, and likely through no choice any of these people made, then you should have to suffer with it.",
