  "text": "Hey all!\n\nI\u2019m looking for some advice.\n\nI have a class where 1/5 of the grade is class participation, which is up solely to the digression of the instruction. Knowing what I know now, I should have dropped, but I didn\u2019t think he was as unreasonable as he is.\n\nThe class is the easiest course in the world, but I just show up and do my work, turn in it on time or a day early.\n\nHe regularly tells the class what an \u201cover achiever\u201d I am, so for the group project he paired me with the two most absent people. The project went ok, but now with the project and the participation grade, I\u2019m nervous.\n\nI always got the feeling that he would give me a B, for no other reason than spite. He\u2019s extremely passive aggressive. He will only reprimand the people he doesn\u2019t like, while ignoring the same actions from those he likes. His implicit bias is off the charts and sadly, I\u2019m fair sure he doesn\u2019t like me.\n\nTo make matters worse, I tried talking to my parents about this and one of the things that bothered me was a response that, \u201cWell a B isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d While I know he\u2019s right, I wanted to save the B\u2019s for courses that were actually difficult, or thing that I really couldn\u2019t comprehend.\n\nIt\u2019s having a negative impact on my drive and motivation. I\u2019ve worked so hard to get A\u2019s this semester, but if a B is something I can\u2019t avoid, should I just be happy with B\u2019s my other classes too?\n\nI did want to try to get into an excellent school, which might be out of my reach no matter what. I got terrible, terrible grades the last time I went to college, so it\u2019ll be difficult to change that.\n\nAny advice would be awesome!",

      "text": "Have you thought about having a discussion with your professor about what your participation grade is looking like? It's sounds like you don't actually know that it's bad but are only nervous that it's bad. You should confirm it's actually bad before you start worrying about it, lol.",
