  "text": "I am a 35-minute drive away from my college. I  have been enrolled my last two semesters in online classes. Part of me misses being in-person and having interactions be in-person with my professors and classmates. On the other side, I am/ have gotten very used to having my classes be online. Which do I pick? Online or In-Person classes? I know that there are pros and cons to both options. Anyone out there in a similar predicament?",

              "text": "real talk man, at the end of the day you gotta focus on your edu, and your career. Friends come later, you aren't doing college for your friends. I feel like so many young people these days are dependent off their friends for everything you know wheter that be eating outside, attending classes by yourself etc.\n\nYou just gotta act like an adult and do your things by yourself you know. Cause your getting a degree for yourself not your friends you gotta look at it long term right. You are doing this for yourself your friends ain't gonna do sh\\*t right. \n\nLemme tell you something, in my opinion there are wayy more pros to doing online school compared to in person. Convenience, flexibility and you get to WFH. Take advantage of it. Why go to a in person one like your gonna have to spend time on commute, etc. Waste of money and all that.",

                  "text": "Agreed. I prefer online classes because i can save money on not commuting a long distance and overpriced cafeteria food. not to mention, online classes are generally easier because they are most of the time open book and you can use the internet to search up answers. Don't understand why people stress about going to college just to make \"friends\" when there is an easier alternative option that is less expensive. Having an easier academic life that is less stressful is more important than making short term friendships.",

The point fo getting your degree is to get ur edu and that diploma to help you in your career, not friends.\n\nFriends in college are especially a distraction as well, you gotta look at what helps you. Having friends, how is that gonna provide value to you. That's the way u have to see it.",

Taking one class would be good to kinda of strike a balance and get reacquainted with in person classes and have more interactions that are in-person. \nI am torn though,still\u2026As an essential worker with 3-part time jobs my time management skills are better with a more consistent schedule - and online classes seem to meet that flexibility and time management checkbox for me. I like your idea though.\nThank you!",

      "text": "So I had a 40 minute commute to and from class. First year I was in person which I enjoyed. Second year I was online. Third year I was hoping to be fully in class, so I moved to campus. I'm a hybrid right now. 2 in person, 4 online. \n\nTbh I hated online class all throughout second year, mostly because of being stuck at home with my family. Which lead to me moving out eventually anyways. I think if you live by campus then you take advantage of in person, since you have access to the teachers right there. I had teachers online ignore me for weeks when I would email them questions about assignments. \n\nIf you commute, I would say do what's better for how you think you'll learn. If you need a teacher's attention then in person is best. If you're more independent then go for online. Online I found that I taught myself the material more when in person I felt that my needs were met. \n\nCommuting does suck tho, I hated it. Did it for 2 years and wanted death. Especially for 8ams.",

The bit of social interaction just doesn't weigh up against not having to rush to class, being able to eat in peace at home, and working through the recordings at my own pace.",
