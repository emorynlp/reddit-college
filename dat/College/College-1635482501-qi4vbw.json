      "text": "Make sure you have all your gen eds. Look into a math class. If your hs offers it, take AP Calc, maybe even AP Stats. You can always look at schools you\u2019re interested in and see their requirements for the CS major. You don\u2019t really need specific classes necessarily to get into the major after graduating highschool, but obviously taking AP level courses in highschool can count for credit so you don\u2019t have to take them in college. I\u2019m sure CS majors might require physics and a science course. So maybe AP Physics or AP Bio/Chem. Keep your class schedule pretty rigorous and do well in the APs so your GPA stays up! Good luck",

In my experience, they generally have you do Calc 1-2, and then give you the option of what higher-level maths you wanna take that I stated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: As for science, choose bio over chemistry. Easier IMO and more interesting.",
