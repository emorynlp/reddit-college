  "text": "Just a question. I\u2019ve never heard of a college doing this before mine. I want to know the stats but I\u2019m not allowed to do a poll on this sub. \n\nMy school has free condoms at the health center, at stands at the lecture and learning centers and at the front desks of residence halls. Students can just take as many as they want. Sometimes there are multiple brands to choose from. \n\n_we have good condoms but the free tampons in the girl\u2019s bathrooms still feel like concrete_  oh well \n\nSo, dead ass does your school do this???? I thought college would be like \u201cNO SEX NO DRUGS NO NOTHING\u201d and kids would have to fight them. But my college is just \u201cyeah just wear a condom and come to class\u201d",

There\u2019s about 2,000,000 cases of chlamydia a year *in the US*. 500,000 of gonorrhea. 100,000 cases of syphilis. \n\nWomen are more likely to be asymptomatic for these as well, although men can be asymptomatic as well. Apparently up to 75% of women and 50% of men are asymptomatic for gonorrhea at the time of diagnosis. Think about how many cases aren\u2019t diagnosed",

But because they\u2019re not properly taught how to have safe sex, they put themselves at risk for getting an STD or unplanned pregnancy, which sometimes leads to abortion, because being pregnant in high school can be scary.",

Some high schools are very strict about teaching abstinence in hopes of keeping kids from having sex, but the truth is, some of those kids are still gonna have sex. I think most colleges realize this, especially because college students are older. They would have to pretend to be blind if they thought teaching abstinence would keep the entire campus full of virgins. That\u2019s why they just hope that you do it safely at the very least, & they give you easy access to condoms because they\u2019d rather you have safe sex than to end up with an STD or an unplanned pregnancy. Just wish high schools thought the same way. Personally, I think if more high schools taught sex ed & how to have safe sex, I feel like the abortion rates would drop.",
