But there's a nearly infinite number of careers out there, some of which don't exist yet. Many of these careers require an agile mind, the ability to communicate, and the ability to make connections between ideas and events, and all of these are things that can be developed in almost any major.",

A Sociology degree won't be of much use.\n\n>  or even teaching.\n\nTo teach in public schools, you generally need an Education degree plus a subject matter concentration/minor. Sociology is not a commonly sought-after subject matter concentration because it is rarely ever taught prior to the college level.\n\nTo teach at the university level, you need post-graduate studies. While some fields permit teaching with a Master's degree at schools like Community Colleges, it would be rare to be a competitive candidate to teach sociology anywhere without a PhD.\n\nIn general, when people talk about 'useless' degrees, they're referring to the fact that those degrees do not qualify you for any job that has more than a generic degree requirement. Pretty much every job you could get with a Sociology (undergraduate) degree is also a job you could get with a Computer Science degree, but the reverse is not true.",

Study a degree is a certificate showing you\u2019re not totally stupid, that\u2019s really useful. \n\n4. Degrees aren\u2019t job training, you don\u2019t do a degree in plumbing to become a plumber or a degree in project management to become a project manager. \n\n5. Stem subjects generally open more doors, for more possible jobs, so you\u2019d be in a better position to get some jobs with a degree in a stem subject.\n\n6. If you don\u2019t like math, it might not be a great idea to\nget one of those jobs that requires using lots of math.",

I know numerous people, in STEM and in humanities, who have really great jobs they enjoy in their fields or related fields. Any degree can get you where you want to be if you know what you want and make a plan. Also, about \"if you don't know how to market yourself\", the issue is not people cannot market themselves and their skills. That is something we could all improve on but just because someone is unemployed it does not mean that is the reason. When a job is set on hiring someone with 5 years or more of experience it is very unlikely for the new grad to get that job when competing with someone that has the same degree and the experience. \"No one cares about humanities anymore\" then explain how we will have important careers like therapists, social workers, journalists, educators, administrative workers, technical writers, lawyers, business owners, interior designers, human resource workers, city planners, marketing strategists, etc without humanities backgrounds?

You seem to forget that society has a job/career hierarchical structure not based on merit nor worth, but knowing your way and talking yourself in and out of situations. No one really cares about what school you went to nor how impressive your extra curriculars were nor how smart you come off. If you think society values that then knock yourself out. The college system is a filtering process and that's all it is. Everyone thinks they are college material, and assume that they will have a good career afterwards: Maybe.\n\nYou can try to have a flexible career path all you want, but you will just prolong your debt and time out there thinking there's a hot shot opening waiting for you: There's no guarantee of anything no matter how well you plan things.\n\nYou chose to get \"a job\" and you weren't paid for it: That's exploitation under the guise of an \"internship\". How do you think capitalism exploitation works? If employers could take advantage of you, you wouldn't have a salary at all.\n\nWell, I can't say that I am surprised that daddy paid the bills and \"provided\" a \"comfortable\" lifestyle (if you say so). But did you know that also comes at a cost behaviorally and emotionally? Earn you way in and proud? Are you even listening to yourself? Let me guess, you're the type to call other people lazy and entitled because they don't work hard enough to get out out of a bad economic and financial situation or calling people on UI moochers? Yikes! You're far from reality, hun! But hey! Enjoy those scholarships and aid because I am sure daddy can't pay for it all!\n\nI will tell you one thing. No one cares about your rules/ethics/morals. You assume the system is fair and they are playing by the rules or yours: That's way off from home. I guess you can't learn everything in school.\n\nI knew college students or people in academia were smart, but equally dumb at the same time. You're no different.

Though, there are ways to set yourself up to be more prepared for a position. \n\nI did choose to get a job and I was paid for it, just like how my internship is also paid. I\u2019ve always stated in my advice to others that unpaid internships are a way to get free labor and they won\u2019t see you as an equal or a valuable member of the team. Unpaid \u201cinternships\u201d are just overworked college students doing the work people at the company don\u2019t want to do. The only time an unpaid internship is acceptable is if it\u2019s with a government certified non-profit organization. \n\nOnce again, if you bothered to ask instead of assuming about me- bad economic situations are rarely the person who\u2019s in that situations fault. Some people can\u2019t work due to disabilities, being a full time student or many other scenarios. Generational trauma is also very real and very apparent in America. Disability pay in America makes it so people barely scrape by. Not to mention the discrimination towards people with criminal records who can\u2019t qualify for free housing or government aid due to something they did when they were 18. You wanted me so badly to say that poor people are the villain but they aren\u2019t, the system is. \n\nThe system isn\u2019t fair and it actively prays on people coming from a low socioeconomic status. Yes, they\u2019ll cover the cost of your schooling but a couple Fs or dropping out results in those students being slammed with a bill they can\u2019t afford. It\u2019s mentally toxic and draining to be under that kind of pressure. \n\nI don\u2019t have a scholarship and my debt is 1/4 of the American Average. You want to make me out to be a retched person for paying for my school but literally told someone the other day that scholarships are \u201chand outs\u201d.  So what insult are you going with today? Am I a bad person for working while in school? , Would I be an \u201centitled rich kid\u201d if I had my dad paying for my schooling? or Would I be an even worse person for accepting a \u201chand out\u201d? You talk out of turn just to satisfy yourself but never stick with an opinion. You always pick the option that you think proves your point but your inconsistencies are even worse than your condescending demeanor.",

With being one of the best comes money, in every profession. \n\nIf you are in a job just to make money and hate it, you won\u2019t climb up the ladder as fast as people say you will. \n\nThe best thing you can do for yourself is look at common careers within your major to see if there\u2019s one you want to follow. Also look at job outlook. Most people look directly at the salary but the outlook is the most important part. \n\nThis probably wasn\u2019t incredibly helpful to you but if everyone went into marketing there wouldn\u2019t be job availability, same example goes for every career. There\u2019s a need for everyone you just need to find a niche.",

My major that I am picking is mechanical engineering because that fits the billet for my career. For you, a paralegal should be going to a 2-year school and a teacher should study what they want to teach at the high school or college level. I personally would say to not go into teaching for high school or below only because of the pay but if you are willing to sacrifice the pay then go for it. I would recommend teaching at a college though. You could get your degree then teach at a high school for 2-4 years while getting your masters then apply to teach at a community college or 4-year. I do think sociology is useless tho and people should only minor in it because of its inflexibility. Social work is also a good career if you want the 4 year version, I think that is the only time I would recommend it along with teaching.",
