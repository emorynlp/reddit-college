  "text": "I was supposed to receive my grades for my first semester today, and for 3/4 of my classes I did. However, for one history class it says that I received no credit on my unofficial transcript. While for this one particular class, the professor is known to take longer than usual to put grades in, I am worried that something went wrong. Should I wait a few days to do something, or should I immediately email him?",
