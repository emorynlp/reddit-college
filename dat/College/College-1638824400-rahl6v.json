  "text": "\nI went to college freshman year and made a small group of really close friends (the two other girls went to hs together and had been bffs for a while). We planned to love together sophomore year but my mom made me cancel bc of covid- the girls basically hated me and were mean after that. I had another best friend at college but decided to not keep up w her anymore bc she was flakey and yeah. All of my other college friends were more of drinking buddies or friends of friends.\n\nI stayed home from college sophomore year and junior year. Next year I should be a college senior but I\u2019ll have two years left so technically I\u2019ll be a junior. I\u2019m not sure if I want to go back to my old college and just meet new friends or transfer. But either way I\u2019ll need to meet new friends.. I was thinking if I transfer schools maybe I\u2019ll rush a sorority. But all my old friends were in Greek life so if I stay at my current school I woudlnt want to rush.. I was thinking the best way to meet people would be by finding roommates to be friends with.. but when will people start posting looking for roommates.. i also don\u2019t see anyone posting looking for \u201croommates and friends\u201d and it\u2019s all just ppl wanting roommates",
