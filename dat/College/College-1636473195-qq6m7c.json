      "text": "I\u2019m currently working as a supply chain manager, full time student, National Guardsman, and a father. I have almost no free time but I\u2019m able to find time here and there to relax and enjoy life. I\u2019m actually quite bitter about college, especially on this subreddit. But as much as I hate the institution, I do have to admit there are doors college degrees can unlock. If you want the *college experience\u2122\ufe0f*then I don\u2019t recommend it. My GPA is a 3.3, it\u2019s only hard if you procrastinate.",

      "text": "Tbh it sucks used to work 30 hours a week and was a full time student. I burned out. I had very little time for anything other than school or work. I was too exhausted and irritated to do anything else. I have a 3.8 but 0 sanity. I decided to live with my parents thru out all of college to save money and have no debt. My college experience just left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. And a lot of pessimism and cynicism \u2728",

Not gonna lie it blows with how little free time you have for friends and family however it\u2019s rewarding in the fact that you have money to pay for college and for things you want instead of still having to spend money (gas,bills, etc) and not gaining money.",

      "text": "Bro it is ROUGH. Not impossible but it's definitely not for everyone. I used to wake up at 5 a.m to go to work everyday and I would get off at 2. I would rush home and get a 40 minute nap and get up and get ready for class. I would be there until 8 or 9 p.m , rush home to shower and get something to eat and try to do some homework before going to bed and get ready to do it all over again the next day. I was always sleep deprived but I managed to pass my classes even tho I had to sacrifice my social life a bit. Got a C and some A's too. It's doable but rough as hell haha, since my motivation is always at an all time high I really didn't have any problems",
