To an extent. At my uni, MIS majors made the most out of college compared to any other business majors. Admittedly, it\u2019s a weird gray area because you\u2019re not specialized enough for lucrative SE jobs and probably overqualified for a lot of other jobs. But you can still get into plenty of data-oriented roles, which means high pay and remote work availability potentially.\n\n\n3. FALSE haha. Plenty of opportunities, now more than ever. It\u2019s probably the most lucrative time to get into SCM both for salary potential and career progression. The reason for this, though, is because many people are ducking out because it can be very high stress due to covid-related constraints. It\u2019s hellish. But jobs will always be there, pay rather well, and every day brings a fresh problem to resolve. Supply chain rotational programs are meant for people right out of college\u2014they pay well and it\u2019s a way to get into management quickly, so they are a bit competitive.",
