  "text": "I was a transfer student, so I\u2019ve lived in the dorms at multiple different schools. I\u2019m generally a bit of a pack rat, so I\u2019ve developed a minimalist approach to packing for college in order to keep clutter at bay. This minimalist approach is especially important this semester, since you might end up having to leave with short notice due to the pandemic. Here\u2019s some advice:\n\n(Note: I am a girl, guys might pack a bit differently, but I think most of this advice is gender-neutral)\n\nClothes:\n- only bring clothes that are appropriate for the climate and season where your school is. Think to yourself, \u201cwill I realistically need this clothing item between now and the next time I come home?\u201d If not, don\u2019t bring it. \n\n- only bring two week\u2019s worth of clothes. This will keep clothing clutter to a minimum and motivate you to do laundry regularly so you don\u2019t have dirty clothes everywhere. \n\n- Most of your clothes should be casual and comfortable, but you should have one \u201cgoing out\u201d outfit (you shouldn\u2019t be going to parties this semester, but you might want to dress up if you have a date or something) and at least one professional-looking outfit for if you have a job interview or presentation. \n\n- maximum 6 pairs of shoes. Any more than that will be difficult to find space for in your little dorm closet, and will take up a ton of space in your luggage. You will be walking around a lot more than you did in high school, so plan your shoe choices accordingly. Function over fashion. \n\nDecor:\n\n- This semester I\u2019m actually not bringing any decor at all. I know it sounds depressing, but a lack of decor will make it much easier to pack everything up if I end up having to leave. Under normal circumstances, though, I recommend photos, posters, and string lights or garlands. \n\n- DO NOT BRING ANYTHING that takes up space on a horizontal surface. Your desk is small, and you will need it for your school supplies, papers, and as a space for eating and/or doing makeup. You will regret bringing anything non-functional that takes up space on your desk or other flat surface. If you want to decorate, use your walls!\n\n- I wouldn\u2019t recommend bringing a tapestry. My roommate had two of them and they were constantly falling down because dorm-friendly wall adhesives (i.e. adhesives that won\u2019t damage the wall) aren\u2019t strong enough for tapestries. \n\n- Some dorms have really crappy lighting. In my first dorm, the light was so dim it was essentially useless. I ended up buying an LED floor lamp to solve this problem. If you don\u2019t know what the lighting will be like, wait until after you move in and then buy a floor lamp from a local store if it ends up being necessary. \n\n- If you ever do makeup, bring a desktop mirror so you can do your makeup at your desk. Your roommates/floormates might get annoyed if you\u2019re constantly using the bathroom sink mirror for applying makeup. \n\nOther things:\n\n- Don\u2019t bring too many dishes. One or two of each item is good. Plus, some items can serve double-duty! For example, I didn\u2019t have a bowl and whenever I wanted soup or something, I ate out of my coffee mug. Make sure to bring dish soap, a sponge, and a dish towel so you can wash your dishes in the sink. Your dorm probably won\u2019t have a dishwasher. \n\n- Only bring the hair care stuff you actually use. My mom told me to bring a hairdryer, but I hate blow-drying my hair, so that hairdryer was a total waste of space. You know yourself best. Bring the stuff you know you will use, leave behind the stuff you probably won\u2019t use. The same applies for makeup and jewelry. \n\n- Bring cleaning supplies to keep your room hygienic. If you have a bathroom in your dorm room, you and your roommate(s) will be responsible for cleaning it, so bring bathroom cleaning supplies. If you have a communal bathroom though, you will not be responsible for cleaning it. \n\n- For school supplies, bring the stuff that works best for you. If you prefer using pens instead of pencils for note-taking, bring lots of pens and only a couple pencils. If you love organizing with folders but you hate 3-ring binders, don\u2019t bring binders. You are the boss of your organization system in college. There is no school supply list. Pick the supplies that have previously worked well for you, and leave the ones you\u2019ve always hated behind. \n\n- Even after using these less-is-more tricks, you might still feel like you have too much stuff. At that point, you probably don\u2019t have too much stuff. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to add your own tips in the comments.\n\nEdit: One last thing... if you end up needing something that you didn\u2019t bring, you can pick it up from home on your next trip back or order it online. Sometimes it\u2019s actually better to underpack than to overpack. You might be surprised how much you don\u2019t actually need.",

At my first school, you weren\u2019t required to live in the dorms, but I chose to because my home was too far away for a daily commute to make sense. At my second (current) school, freshmen and sophomores are required to live in the dorms unless they commute from a parent\u2019s home or are older than a typical underclassman. However, the mandatory dorms at school 2 are cheaper than the optional dorms at school 1. Some dorms are single rooms. Most are doubles, some are triples or quads.",

      "text": "I think we\u2019re all concerned about classes moving straight to online. I\u2019m living at home, but I want to add in a few tips that might help. This semester, it might be useful to keep things in boxes/crates/bags to make packing up quickly easier. Also, DONT bring winter clothing right away. Wait until it gets cold and then switch it out when visiting home or through the mail. I honestly don\u2019t think most schools will last long enough to start getting cold, but if it does, be prepared to swap out clothing and watch the weather. The one thing I\u2019d stock up on is foods you can eat if you\u2019re too nervous to go to the dining hall. Ramen noodles are your best friend. Keep a bunch of that, any other foods you want, and a stock of drinks with you.\n\nIf at all possible, use either a kindle or an app to get textbooks on. This will mean less stuff to carry around and you also get to skip the hassle of returning textbooks from home. \n\nMake sure to bring something along that you can kill time in your dorm with. Parties and outings will be out of the picture for a while. Since you\u2019ll have plenty of free time, pick an activity that\u2019s easy to keep in your room. If that\u2019s playing an instrument, drawing, reading, or anything else simple like that, you\u2019re set. Make sure to take care of yourself and have things to pass the time.",

      "text": "I'll toss in my thoughts, so here are a couple things for guys and gals to keep in mind. Especially if you have a room mate this year. \n\n* take two laundry bags, one for clothes you have worn in public, the other for clothes you have only worn around your room mate. This way you can keep things separated and you know which clothes need to get sanitized should someone contract covid. \n* to minimize research time in the library (this is for my fellow humanities majors who are doing research) geta scribd subscription and use it when you can. \n* If you normally take a gaming system and TV and you live near campus I would suggest leaving it at home until things smooth out (should be by labor day, I hope). \n* If you don't have one get a gym bag so you can keep workout stuff isolated from the rest of your room (keep all gym only items in it and wash it when you wash your public clothes or as needed) \n* if you aren't taking a daily multi-vitamin, this would be a good semester to do so (every little bit you help your body matters in case you contract it)\n* Explicitly for the people with roommates, this is not the semester to bring your hookup/ S.O. to the dorm.\n* keep one pair of shoes explicitly for the gym if financially possible (which means it stays in the gym bag except for washing day)\n* to my fellow dudes, please for the love of God, REMEMBER TO KEEP THE DEODORANT STOCKED! I know it shouldn't need to be said but after two years of college I am absolutely disgusted with my own sex sometimes. please please remember deodorant.",

I was a paper person as well and one of those folding binders with different tabs helped so much for handouts. \n\nAlso for gamers discipline is a must. I watched friends fail out of semesters due to having full access to their console or gaming rig 24/7.

          "text": "To add on to this: for first year comp sci students this also applies to you. I know a lot of cs kids end up thinking that they're going to need their big pc for whatever reason (usually think they'll want the power for school work), and that's not accurate. For your first year, you will be fine with a normal laptop. \n\nThat being said, and keep in mind you may need to transport it home sooner rather than later, I'd bring it if you're on the fence. This semester specifically. In person socializing may be minimal, and you may end up spending a lot of time in your dorm on your computer. \n\nFor anyone used to using a tower at home, and is leaving it at home, I recommend getting an external hard drive and putting copies of any files you think you may want on there.  Any music, photos, movies, old school files -- anything you might have on your tower that you think you may be taking for granted. \n\nOn the note of laptops: I honestly recommend seeing if you can buy a second charger for your laptop. Leave one in your dorm at all times, even when you go home for a reading week etc. I'll be honest and say that this could be a waste for most people, but if you forget a charger at home or lose or break one, its lifesaving. If you don't have a macbook, it can sometimes be difficult to find the proper charger last minute, too -- rushing out to best buy or walmart might not save you if you've lost or broken your only charger.",

Even if you\u2019re only in your dorm for a month before we all get sent back, it\u2019s pretty likely that you\u2019ll be in that dorm for 80%+ of your time at school due to the pandemic. \n\nLibraries and other study areas will be at limited capacity, so you\u2019ll probably have to study at your dorm. Dining halls (at least at my school) will be to-go only so you\u2019ll probably have to eat in your dorm too. And clubs, events, etc will be zoom only for large clubs, and in person events will be significantly worse. \n\nSince you\u2019ll be spending so much time in your dorm, for the sake of your mental health, decorate your room and make it nice to spend all that time in!",
