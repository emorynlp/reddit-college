  "text": "Please I\u2019m sorry if this is a stupid question but I\u2019ve been looking at the classes after loading a sample course plan for my degree. I tried submitting them after selecting my times and professors but they got rejected because I needed to take prerequisites. I go and see my prerequisites classes but they also need prerequisites as well? Either that or a required score on a placement test. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t make sense of this, can someone please help me.\n\nto sum it up, my classes need prerequisites but I can\u2019t even take prerequisites without other prerequisites or tests.",

      "text": "Can you go all the way back to find the very first prerequisites you need? If you can I\u2019d advise trying to take ones that will open up the most classes next term, or if the classes you\u2019re looking at need multiple take those at the same time. \n\nI\u2019d also definitely recommend talking to your advisor, they usually know the exact sequences of classes you\u2019ll need. Sometimes they can give you overrides too. I was allowed to take a class and the prereq for it at the same time once; it doesn\u2019t always work but also doesn\u2019t hurt to ask!",
