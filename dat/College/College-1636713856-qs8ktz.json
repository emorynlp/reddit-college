  "text": "I will be attending college on campus for first time very far from my home. I have never left my home before and have no friends on campus since everything was online and I never really made an effort. Any suggestion and help will be appreciated. Definately don't want to be crying before others in college, or about to.",

      "text": "Keep busy. Go to events, talk to people as much as you can, and keep busy. Find any on campus organizations that seem interesting to you and join, go to any events that the student gov or student life office puts on. Check out the intramural sports or group fitness classes at the rec center. It takes time to find a new community when you move, but put in the work and little by little you\u2019ll miss home a bit less. \n\nIt\u2019s totally normal to miss home and it can be hard to get your new environment to feel like home. Knowing people there, having events to go to, and in general having too much going on to be homesick all play a role in helping the aching for home to die down. \n\nGood luck friend, I\u2019m hoping it works out for you \ud83e\udd17",

      "text": "Like the other commenter said, stay as busy as possible. This was also the farthest I\u2019ve been from home alone, and I didn\u2019t know anyone here. I found that homesickness comes in waves put it will pass and get better. Chat with your family when you can I found it helps. And don\u2019t worry about crying. If it makes you feel any better I broke down In tears from stress and homesickness at the end of my first class in front of my classmates and professor and I don\u2019t think anyone cares at this point in the semester.\n\nIt\u2019s hard but I know you can do it. :)",
