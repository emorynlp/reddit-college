If you knew your scholarship depended on the exam, you would make sure to know when the exam was and make sure you get there early.\n\nPeople \\*absolutely\\* make mistakes.  But if I don't take extra time out of *my* schedule to help someone who didn't take time out of *their* schedule... that means I'm a bad person?  \n\nProfessors always say \"well when I was a student I \\*never\\* would have done X.\"  Honestly, they don't know what they would do if they were a student because they're no longer a student.\n\nSimilarly, your saying \"*If I were the professor and my student missed the exam day I\u2019d let him make it up in some capacity and wouldn\u2019t even think twice\"* is moot.  You're not a professor.  You don't know what you'd do.  \n\nYou've already said, \"*well in some cases they don't deserve it*.\"   So how bad does the student have to be?   If they miss one assignment and ask for an extension then we shouldn't give him a make-up?    What if they never asked for an extension, but haven't handed in 3 assignments.  What if they handed in all the assignments, but didn't show up for 5 classes.\n\nDon't say you 100% know what you'd do until you're doing it.",

If you don\u2019t know, check the syllabus, check your school\u2019s final exam schedule (just google \u201cCollegename finals schedule 202X\u201d), and finally, email your professor.
