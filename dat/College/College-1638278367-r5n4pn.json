  "text": "In this one class I got, you get to pick your own grade and explain why you deserve it. I haven\u2019t been to class for reasons (for a month) but like I still do all the assignments on time online. I explained to her my situation and she was like \u201cI understand\u201d. Attendance was never stated to be mandatory in the syllabus too but the class does have discussions\n\nY\u2019all think I can get an A? Or is that pushing it",

Because she said she understood, write reasons your work was A worthy, not A worthy given circumstance. You\u2019ve already explained yourself to her, so focus on performance. \n\nI\u2019ve done something similar- I had a physics class once that was very very easy for me, so I often missed class when I had other work. I explained to my professor that I actively meet the learning goals expected of me in my performance, but on a life balance aspect I did not feel it was necessary to go beyond those expectations. I explained it wasn\u2019t a lack of respect I had for his class, but more that I was accomplishing the learning goals with less work because the material was not new to me. He was very understanding that I didn\u2019t need his teaching and appreciated that I still displayed the proper effort despite not attending lectures.",
