  "text": "I have a friend who is in bio-chemistry major and it is extremely hard. I heard that they have a standard curve about 15% so i know it is not a chilling course. So my friend have a quiz online and it is extremely hard, she said it is so hard that she have to cheat (she rarely cheat). She posted the question to chegg but it doesn\u2019t work so she just tried to do it by herself. Later she got the annoucement that they found the question of the quiz was listed on chegg and threat that they will contact to chegg to find out who posted this and will have them kicked out of university. She use someone else\u2019s  account that are not studying in her university. Is there anyway can they track her down?",

Planes go through A LOT of testing in a ton of different scenarios to prove airworthiness. \n\nAnd the second something DOES go wrong, emergency airworthiness directives (think recalls) go out and could render every airplane of the same type unairworthy until the situation is fixed. \n\nI\u2019m assuming a lot of other fields have similar restrictions. I\u2019m a \u201cpiloting major\u201d and cheating in classes mean nothing. Because you still have to pass a practical exam consisting of oral (theory) and practical (flying) in order to get A license. So if you cheat in college, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference",

I try hard in all my classes and I\u2019m learning in all of them but if there comes a time where I don\u2019t know the solution and my grades are depending it, sure I\u2019ll cheat if I can get away with it.
