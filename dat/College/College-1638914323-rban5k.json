  "text": "I struggle with mental health issues and thrive on routine and being busy. Winter break is coming up in a week, and I\u2019m dreading it. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to get through it, honestly. I\u2019m trying to make a list of things to do but between being away from friends and unable to do things outside (since it\u2019s freezing), my options are limited. Does anyone have tips or suggestions on what to do or how to cope?",
