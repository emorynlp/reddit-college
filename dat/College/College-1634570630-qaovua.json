  "text": "Today is my first day of online classes. I'm 25 and not super tech savvy but I think I do alright. None of my classwork is available and I'm losing my shit. I'm taking a condensed semester so I only have two classes right now. One is available and I've done everything I can but most of the links are broken or not updated. The other I cant even open my class on blackboard. Why??? I've emailed both professors and I'm just waiting for a response. I go on vacation this week and was really hoping to get everything done before we leave but now that is definitely not going to happen. My SOC professor made the syllabus available to us a week early and even had assignments due yesterday evening but I couldn't do any of it lol. I'm so confused I know they have lives as well but couldn't at least ONE thing go right?!?",

I have been using blackboard for two years and had a similar problem last week. All you can do is email your professor and wait. Good luck!",
