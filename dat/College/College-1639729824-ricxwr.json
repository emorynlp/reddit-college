  "text": "I am enrolled in an online university where, instead of 16 week courses, the semester is split into two sections of 8 week courses. In the latter half of my current semester, I've been dealing with a lot of issues with my home life that has caused me to be less active that I would have liked. Essentially, I didn't turn in assignments or even log into my course materials for 4/8 weeks of class. I'm (surprisingly) only failing one of my courses but am worried that I will be unofficially withdrawn from the course that I'm failing. I've reached out to the professor and they have allowed me to turn in my missing assignments, but since this is a math class and I missed essentially half a semester I still doubt I'll be able to pass. Can this be considered an unofficial withdrawal or will I just fail?",
