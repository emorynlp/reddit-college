  "text": "Of course you can say that internship is a chance for learning and enhancing employability, but that should be your own choice. I don't see the point of paying the school to work as a free labour (Not all internships are unpaid, but most of them are) for a company. You can do it anytime if you want to. Moreover, sometimes students are required to do internship by their studies which makes them difficult to concentrate on their studies.\n\nIt seems to me that instead of really wanting the students to learn, a compulsory internship is just a way the school want to guarantee the employability of their graduates for enhancing it's reputation. It's not really for the benefit to the students. \n\nFurthermore, even if an internship is compulsory, it's nonsense to have it graded. How could you judge if one's doing good in their internship? The evaluation from an employer could be biased. The internship report could look dull but that's all about the position in the company, it doesn't mean the student didn't put effort into it. Even if the student didn't do well as the employer expected, the effort for being a free labour should be appreciated.",

      "text": "At the places I\u2019ve been, internships have to be paid in order to count for credit. Internships are also quite helpful when it comes to employment in my field. Maybe things are different for your field.\n\nEvaluations are almost always biased to some degree. Effort doesn\u2019t count on the job; you have to produce results. Grading should reflect how you are performing in the internship given your relative standing. I could see a case, though, for making an internship more of a pass/fail thing.",
