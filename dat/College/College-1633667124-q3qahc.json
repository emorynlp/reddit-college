  "text": "Our school does a quarter system. There is so much stuff crammed into one week that I can\u2019t possibly retain all of it. There are exams every 2-3 weeks. I can\u2019t find time to study for the exams and then study for the current chapters. I feel like stuff is just going in one ear and out my other ear. \nOn top of that there are 2 other classes that require a lot of lectures and homework. Lots of exams and quizzes. \n\nHow can you study for all of those classes when exams are within the same weeks? \n\nI wish that it was like high school where they gave you a week to study for the exams without learning new chapters. I don\u2019t think that is has to do with being and adult. There should just be a week of studying for exams without new assignments or lectures.",

Assignments that require ME KNOWING HOW TO DO IT. bc they\u2019re graded by accuracy not completion. It\u2019s a lot of info to take in and learn every week.. it\u2019s only about to be week 3/10 next Monday.. help",

I feel exactly like you most of the time: too busy pushing out work to actually think about / absorb / grok what I\u2019m \u201clearning.\u201d  The transition from high school is especially rough: take a serious high school class like AP Mechanics that you had a year to learn and study for, and \\*poof\\* now you\u2019re expected to learn an equivalent amount in 10 weeks!",
