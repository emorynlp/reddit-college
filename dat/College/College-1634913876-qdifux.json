  "text": "So I'm a freshman and I'm gonna go to my first college halloween party. I'm just wondering if you guys have any ideas for what I should where that is low effort and cheap (I'm a guy). The reason I'm asking is because I don't know how hard people go at college halloween parties. Do they go all out and wear a nice costume? Or do most people not really care and do something low effort? I don't want to be underdressed. Let me know!",
