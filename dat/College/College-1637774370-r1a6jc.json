  "title:": "Why do I have to take classes that I don't care about in college?",
  "text": "I'm currently a high school senior and I have been pondering on this question for a long time. I hear that in the process of applying to college, you at least get to *choose* the variety of classes that you want instead of just having them given to you like in high school, but what if none of those classes are really relevant to what you want to do with your life and you find no meaning in them? \n\nI understand that you have to choose a variety of core classes because they supposedly make you a more \"well-rounded\" person and they serve to push you out of your comfort zone, but I feel that a person could still be well-rounded by just taking the classes that *they* want instead of classes that are irrelevant to their chosen pathway. \n\nAs a young adult going pursuing higher education, I feel like I should be able to govern my education a little more. Has anyone else felt like this before?",

      "text": "In addition to helping you become well rounded, some of the basic core classes help put everyone on a more even playing field. High school education varies wildly across the country and some people have subpar teachers. Taking English, math, science, and social studies the first year of college can help some students get to the level they need to be for their more specialized courses and it can open them up to ideas or career paths they didn\u2019t know were options because of where/how they grew up. \n\nAre core courses annoying? Yes, but not much can be done about it. Use it as an excuse to take something random just to see if you like it.",

I was an engineer at a tech school who had to take 8 humanities classes alongside six science prereqs, but this was pretty open ended. I just had to make sure I took 1 class in humanities, 1 in arts, and 1 in social sciences, and that 3 of my classes were in one field. \n\nIt's very rare for schools to demand you take a racial and ethnic studies class specifically, though they often have a boilerplate online diversity class you just click though.

I just finished my MA at SFSU last Spring and they require all undergrads to have at least 3 credits that qualify as ethnic studies. Doesn't necessarily have to be an ethnic studies class, but it has to have a heavy focus on some kind of ethnic studies-related content. I taught an undergrad class there in humanities that happened to fulfill the ethnic studies requirement. I think college students benefit from these classes way more than OP realizes. It doesn't matter what field you go into, you will work with people from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. Having a very basic understanding of cultural difference is incredibly important in any professional setting.",

      "text": "Because the general population not taking and understanding basic science and math classes because it's 'not part of their chosen pathway' is how we get to a society where a huge chunk of the population doesn't believe in vaccines or other public health measures during a global fucking pandemic, and doesn't know how statistics work\n\nI felt similarly when I was in high school, but as I've grown, I've come to appreciate why we have things like general education courses. Taking history and civics classes makes you an educated citizen who can put modern day issues into historical context. Taking literature classes gives you insight into a variety of experiences beyond your own, helping you develop into an empathetic and knowledgeable human. Taking writing classes teaches you important communication skills that are applicable in literally anything you will ever do - not just career-wise, but again, just as a human being. \n\nPlus, like others have mentioned, when you're 18 it's hard to know what you want to do with your life in a lot of cases. Even if you think you know, you might find that you change your mind - I was on an engineering track until I took an amazing biology class, and decided to switch my major. Now I'm doing a PhD in the subject and my career path looks way different than I thought it would when I was 18 and enrolled in core engineering classes in college. Taking general courses exposes you to things you may not have thought you were interested in, but could change your whole life.\n\nNow, the way we structure education (especially high school education) in general, especially regarding standardized testing, is a whole 'nother problem and I think many people are right to be disillusioned with it - but that's a different conversation",

It is irresponsible and illogical to think you can be a good doctor by only understanding and learning about one part of it; the while body works together and a heart problem might be a manifestation of a problem somewhere else. In order to fully understand how the heart works, you must understand its interactions with every other part of the body which means you must understand how other parts of the body work.

You'll go to the ER and they'll do an EKG and determine you're not having a heart attack.\n\nI would argue that it's the primary care provider's responsibility to rule out psychological problems, and the specialist's job is just to make sure there's nothing wrong with the system that they specialize in. For example, you go to the primary doctor with high blood pressure. The primary doctor should screen you for anxiety issues and then send you to a psychiatrist or psychologist for additional assistance if such is indicated. If you also need to see a cardiologist, I'd expect the cardiologist to be focusing on the cardiovascular system, and almost completely  (if not completely) ignoring the brain (because that would fall under the domain of mental health, which - I repeat - should be treated by someone with more psychiatric or psychological training than the cardiologist)",

When you attend college, you almost exclusively focus on your major requirements. Similarly, professional education such as legal or medical schools is handled at the undergraduate level rather than requiring unrelated undergraduate work prior to entrance.\n\nHowever, very few American students are even qualified to enter such schools because their secondary school background isn't sufficient. There are normally high stakes exams as well as rigorous curriculum requirements that the average high school diploma holder doesn't meet.\n\nWith that in mind, there *are* degrees that have minimal such requirements even in American colleges. Engineering degrees increasingly require minimal non-technical coursework. Nursing and other undergraduate level medical degrees often require none.",

I was a chemical engineer, but I had to take 8 humanities classes. I was always able to find something that interested me, and I always got something out of it.\n\nAnother thing is, not everyone is super certain of what they want to study in college. Even someone who comes in gungho about a subject can change their mind. Prereqs and electives can be a big part of this process.",

This one is similar but more social: you don't know what you don't know. Everybody is an idiot about something at every age. 40-somethings like me are often idiots about how to parent small childen; we're confident going in that what we do will work, and real life constantly proves us wrong. High schoolers are idiots predicting what they'll be passionate about a year later in a new setting let alone as a career. I bet this lack of humility had an evolutionary benefit when 17 was middle age, but in college and adulthood it's a killer. Stay open to things. The majority of college students will change their major at least once, and that's not because they were indecisive. They either needed to or they simply discovered something new they enjoyed more. Gen ed requirements help make that change possible.",

I loved psychology, anthropology, and communications (would say I enjoyed less than half of my classes, maybe even under 30%).  I was just a little disappointed with my college experience and now even my experience finding a new job. \n\nI went to CC in SoCal. Majored in psychology and was about to transfer. Had over 60 credits. Realized I wanted to switch to something that would be more profitable, so I wanted to explore business or CS. I needed to take another 30 credits in CC then transfer. Or transfer, and take nearly 90 credit hours. So I switched to communications hoping it would maybe give me more opportunities. That\u2019s a lot of time and money and now I\u2019ve been working in sales for a few years. Just finished school this year with a degree in communications and I\u2019ve had a really difficult time finding a job that\u2019s not in sales/recruiting. And I do not have a degree/experience for a lot of jobs that pay well that require hard skills and analytical skills. \n\nObviously you can learn these skills through YouTube, certifications, and grad school. It just takes time.",

Technical writing teaches you how to explain what is going wrong to the client- who has never taken a programming class in their life and has no f*cking clue what the difference between C+, java and Python are.  Another example- your a lawyer.  How do you explain a how local maritime law applies to the company executive board, none of which ever take a law related anything class?\n\nEvery gen ed class is relevant to every major. History classes teach you stuff HS history never got around to teaching.  An art history class can help an civil engineer build something thats useful and nice to look at.  An acting class can help you be more confident in speaking with others and help you think faster.  \n\nIf you want to take classes you want to take and not be tied down to a specific set of classes- Get a BA in Liberal Arts/General Studies.",

Thats why having a college education can help you get a position like a manager or even just a normal low skill job, even though the majority of things you learn in college you wouldn't need to know in low skill jobs. You're seen as better educated than someone without at face value.\n\nA school that teaches only what you need to know to get into a career field is called a trade school. This may be all you need to get into some careers, but you can't teach every job this way. General education helps you develop your critical thinking and problem solving skills. As well as some information can be either interesting or even useful to know.",

It also introduces you to subjects you would not normally pursue and, in some cases, sparks an interest in a field you did not know existed.\n\nWhen I was in college, I had to take several science classes that met a \u201chumanities\u201d criteria.  This meant I had to take a class about medical science and the only one that fit my schedule was a class in sexual health. The idea of that class freaked me out, but when I walked into class I was surprised to learn how normal it was.\n\nThe professor\u2018a lectures were about how different societies and cultures treated sex, what was considered \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d, how those ideas shaped the roles of men and women, how it defined what a man or woman was and how it has been studied over the years.  We looked at how certain aspects of sex were criminalized over the centuries and even labeled as mental health issues and how that shaped cultures and societies.\n\nAs an historian, it was fascinating to see how much time and energy people devoted to codifying and regulating and criminalizing this one physical act.  And it was equally fascinating to see a room full of young adults go from giggling fools making jokes about the subject to asking honest questions.\n\nAfter the class I was more confident, I had passed a subject I knew absolutely nothing about and had learned a great deal.  It gave me the confidence I needed to take harder classes in my field and even take classes in fields I thought I would not like (like computer science).",

My university saw that I had an Associates degree and waived 65 credit hours of liberal studies. \n\nAfter coming to the end of my undergraduate college experience, I'm starting to come to terms with how undergraduate works. \n\nUndergrad is a place of social development when kids were too scared to enter the world after highschool. College was \"just that place that your parents make you go to\", but it wasn't really an education place (at least in my mind). \n\nThis social development comes into play with the unrelated liberal studies courses to make you a rounded person. If you are looking for REAL education, you will have to attend Master's/Doctoral school to get that. But for this, try to have fun and learn to handle new responsibilities (making appointments, drinking alcohol, having sex, etc.) as you start to navigate the newest chapter of your life. \n\nHope that helps a little. \ud83d\ude07",
