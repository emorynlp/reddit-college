  "title:": "what to do if i didnt get to go to highschool?",
  "text": "So i need to apply for grants, scholarships, but my mom took me out of highschool and both my parents treated me awfully. I wanted to go to highschool and begged but she told the schools she was homeschooling me. \n\n   I have my ged now, and im going to college because i want to and need socialization. and i cant take the yelling and threatening to make me homeless anymore. They did tell me they saved 7000, but i dont even know if thats true since my mom lies a lot. I really want to go to college, but they make so much 120k+ a year that i dont think i qualify for anything. \n\n   I'm 20, and any advice you can give would be great. I am an avid writer, so maybe I'd be good at writing essays. but my only other hobby is playing video games. I want to volunteer for an animal shelter and pick up trash around my area but havent yet since its too cold and i don't have a car. \n\n   I was hoping to not have their stuff counted as they really don't treat me the best but i already completed the fasfa form and even tho my mom always tells me shes gonna kick me out i dont know if thats \"at risk of being homeless\"?",

      "text": "I think if you get some colleges in mind that you want to apply to, you might be able to contact the financial aid offices at one of the colleges to get help filling out the FAFSA. Either that or just go ahead and apply and then fill out the FAFSA after you get accepted with help from the financial aid office of the college you get accepted to. \n\nIf you think you\u2019d be better off working and saving up some money you can also look for receptionist, front desk, or data entry jobs. A lot of them don\u2019t require a college degree and they\u2019re just desk jobs so you\u2019ll be fine with chronic knee pain.",
