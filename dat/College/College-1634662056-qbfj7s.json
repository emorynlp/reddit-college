  "text": "So I go to a University in Quebec, Canada called Concordia. I really want to apply to a college in Nova Scotia, Canada and for my application it's asking if I have current University credits. I have some but most of my semesters in university have been horrible. There were semesters where I barely showed up for class. So should I tell them I've been attending University and send them my transcript or should I tell them I've only finished high school?",
