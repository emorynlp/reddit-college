Honestly, I\u2019m leaning toward getting my associates degree from my community college instead of transferring. What are the pros and cons of what I want to do?",

      "text": "Currently I\u2019m getting my associate from my community college and then transferring. The main reasons I\u2019m doing so:\n\n-I\u2019m getting my GERs out of the way now that are free at my community college rather than transferring and paying since sum for the same basic level of math writing etc. \n-gives me more time to get financially set \n-for me transferring means moving to a different state entirely, and being at a community college for the first two years has allowed me to make more professional connections in my home state, If I ever wanted to return I could and have a small network to work from \n\nI\u2019d imagine a con of doing this is losing out on the freshman experience of dorms and what not, but personally I don\u2019t care to have forced roommates and eating the school food",
