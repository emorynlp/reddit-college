  "text": "hello, i\u2019m 19F and i know it sounds like an odd question, but it\u2019s been on my mind. i\u2019m a freshman this year, and despite being at a large school, i\u2019m so scared i won\u2019t find someone.\n\ni know i haven\u2019t met everyone on campus (that would take a while ahah), but ive come to the solid conclusion that i\u2019m asexual, and i want a partner that wouldn\u2019t mind or complain if our dates mostly consisted of cute picnics or movie nights or making some cute paintings. everywhere i look the guys i interact with all talk about their hookups or all seem into a specific type of girl that i know i just don\u2019t fit into. i know it\u2019s early but i just feel like i\u2019m asking for too much to find someone who\u2019s just right for me without one of us having to compromise.",

      "text": "If you haven't had sex I wouldn't write it off just because of the reputation hookup culture has given it. Sex should be an experience that both people enjoy given the right communication. But to answer your question I personally consider sex an important part of a relationship and would not want to date someone that doesn't want to have sex. I'm sure there are people at your school that are ok with that though.",

      "text": "Find a guy who identifies as asexual as well and see how that part of the relationship goes. Would probably be best if you tried to meet people through some LGBTQA+ organization to help you find individuals who identify as you do. Note that asexual individuals are still not commonly understood as well as other groups so it just might be harder.",
