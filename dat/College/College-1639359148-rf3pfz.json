  "text": "I have decided that i am dropping out of college for a semester and transferring to a new one. I\u2019m a freshman right now and do not like the school i\u2019m at. I thought that i didn\u2019t really like anyone and i was constantly depressed due to my girlfriend breaking up with me. However, over the past few days I feel like i have been reconsidering because i really like my friends but i feel like it is too late and I don\u2019t know what i\u2019m doing with my life.",

              "text": "Colleges are generally a big place. You\u2019ll get over your ex enough to see her in passing. There are other people there with the same interests as you. You\u2019ll never be satisfied if you\u2019re running from stuff like that. You have to put yourself out there to meet new people with similar interests. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll have the same problem at the transfer school. Unless the college doesn\u2019t have the major you want or is insanely tiny, I wouldn\u2019t transfer. You\u2019ll run into the same problems at a new school. Find a way to make this one work. \n\n\nThat\u2019s just my two cents. I could be wrong. I\u2019ve just never seen a transfer work out when someone was running FROM instead of TO. Maybe you should talk to a therapist to help you figure out what the best move is.",
