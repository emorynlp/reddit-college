Like the certs make you more marketable but if you already know people, you can get your foot in the door of some cool jobs/spaces without them.",

Always learning the next step in certs so it\u2019s never really boring. I think it\u2019s a great career.",

      "text": "> Is IT worth majoring in college?  \n\nIMO: Yes.  \n\nCerts-only education is enough to get you a job.  \nBut a certs-only education does not do a good job of preparing you for an entire career.  \n\nGoing to college for IT isn't mandatory or in any meaningful way required.  \nBut it should pay off dividends nicely in your accelerated career progression compared to certs-only.  \n\n-----  \n\nPlease take some software development classes.  \nPlease don't graduate without a basic understanding of and appreciation for Linux.  \nPlease pursue internships at every single opportunity.  \nTake a class on cloud technologies.  \nTake a couple of classes on security.  \nBuild a people-network.",
