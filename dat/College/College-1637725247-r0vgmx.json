  "text": "The class\u2019s overall grade is 64%. The highest grades on tests are Cs. The average scores on the last 2 tests were 37% and 46%. My grade in the class was at 72%, but after the last exam I\u2019m most likely going to fail the class. I\u2019ve never done this poorly in a class. I had a high school gpa of 3.7 and a college gpa of 3.5. The last day to withdrawal was Friday, but I didn\u2019t because I forgot it was an option. Is there  anything else I can do at this point?",
