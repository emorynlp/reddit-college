  "text": "Tomorrow is my instant decision day at school and four schools are coming to interview me and tell me if I am accepted or not. I\u2019m not a good talker, and I get so nervous. I\u2019m not even prepared for what to talk about I literally bs\u2019d my application and put different majors for each college. Any tips, or ideas on what they\u2019re gonna ask me?",
