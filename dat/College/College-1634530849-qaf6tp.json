  "title:": "My dumbass accidentally submitted an nsfw image on blackboard. What do I do",
  "text": "Just a few moments ago I had accidentally submitted a nude nsfw image of a cosplayer on blackboard when I was intending to submit an assignment for my freshman seminar class. I just emailed my professor about it but still feel extremely worried because I feel like what I just did could either be considered offensive or give reason for my professor to kick me out of the class or the school to kick me out entirely. What do I do, what do I even say because I literally have her class tomorrow morning.\n\nUpdate 1: I just tried to tell her about it when I got in class early but she simply brushed it off at first. Mentioned to her that I apologize and the first post I submitted was something inappropriate and she just brushed it off again and said something about people submitting garbage. Either I'm safe or she doesnt really know what I'm trying to say.\n\nUpdate 2: So far I've received no emails or any complaints so I think I might be in the clear completely. Will wait it out for a few more days just to make sure.",

No one can deny the *horni*, only accept it. We all must live on and laugh when the *horni* befalls upon us at our most vulnerable moments, otherwise life cannot go on. *Horni* is a natural component of the universe.\n\nBut seriously, please don\u2019t be ashamed or feel bad for yourself over it. This was an accident, and I\u2019m pretty sure your professor has seen similar situations if he/she has been one long enough. Eventually over time this awkward situation will pass and you\u2019ll have a moment to laugh at in the future. \ud83d\ude0a",

Unless the model is underage (which I doubt in this case), I would think the worst is you get a warning, fail the assignment, feel awkward around the instructor... but I doubt it would lead to school suspension or something like that. If you feel really uncomfortable, you can drop the class and explain it was an accident. These things happen and you're an adult who's personal/sexual life is your right to enjoy the way you want. If your professor is reasonable she will understand. But I'd recommend you let them know why you decided to drop the class before proceeding with that idea, because they may see you are truly embarrassed and they'll most likely sympathize with you. However, if you're more comfortable just dropping the class and disappearing, that's cool too but there'll be a nude photo in the professor's possession and sounds like she still doesn't understand what it is... have you received a grade on the assignment? Maybe ask her if she's graded it and act surprise when you find out what happened... idk but it's not the end :)\n\nAt the very least it's not you in the photo :)",
