      "text": "I have a bachelors degree and then decided to get a paralegal certificate.  I love being a paralegal.  My program was about 18 months long and pretty interesting.  My only advice is to make sure the program you get into is ABA approved, as some states require that.  Also, I used to want to become an attorney, but after working with attorneys for a decade, I realized quickly I would not want to do that (way too stressful!). Good luck.",
