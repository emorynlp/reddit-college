  "text": " So, I am writing an essay about a movie, and I am using a similar thesis to what I used in an essay last year. My essay last year was about the book on which the movie was based. Is it self-plagiarism if I use different examples and completely different wording? Of course, it will have near the same conclusions, but I will be using different examples, and it will be from the movie rather than the book. Sorry if this was confusing; I tried to make it as readable as possible.",
