  "text": "A few minutes ago I was working really hard on my final exam and was working a problem until the timer ran out and submitted my incomplete exam. I made about a 20% on that exam. I\u2019m trying not to blame the professor as much as I can but they are used to in-person so they\u2019re kinda all over the place in the online course. Takes them an hour to explain something when youtube does it within minutes and it\u2019s even harder when they makeup certain things to prevent cheating but all it does is confuse me. I\u2019ve never failed a class in my life till this class and it really brings my spirits down for continuing my education. I mostly blame myself for not taking the initiative to push myself further and be more outgoing so I could study with classmates because they may be able to explain things to me that I cannot understand. I\u2019m going to retake the course and hope neither my GPA/financial aid offs themselves.",
