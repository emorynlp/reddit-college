I'm gonna start interviewing people soon but I'm having difficulty making questions. I did my Literature review but still then I'm having a hard time making interview questions. So some advice will be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Based on the literature review, what gaps in our knowledge about the topic in education? So, if the literature has said A, B, and C about the topic, what else could we learn about 1, 2, and 3 that we think are related to the topic but have not been studied?\n\nYou also were probably drawn to the topic because you were curious about it. Did you have research questions you wanted to know that the literature did not fully answer?\n\nIf you are still stuck, then think about your research question(s) as a starting point. What do you hope to learn/answer overall? In your example, your overarching RQ seems to be something like, \"What are the experiences of LGBTQ+ students in education?\" That might be your first question - \"Tell me about your experiences as a member of the LGBTQ+ community in education. In your view, how has your identity influenced those experiences?\" If you have specific foci (i.e., discriminatory experiences), you can design further questions specifically about that. For example, \"Have you experienced discrimination in education due to your LGBTQ+ identity? If so, would you mind elaborating on that experience?\" \n\nIn interviews, you will usually always ask follow-up questions with each of the questions in your guide, so design questions to be open-ended, and listen for things that your participants say that make you curious to learn more or get more detailed information that helps with thematic analysis later down the line.\n\nHope this helps! Welcome to the wonderful world of qualitative research! :D",

And LGBTQ issues is just starting to get attention in my country so there is not a lot of research done on the topic. Honestly I thought the interview section would be the easy part.",
