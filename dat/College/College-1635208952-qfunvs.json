It would be unethical for him to give you, and only you, extra credit - let alone enough extra credit to make up 20% of your grade. There isn't a backup plan. You just focus on doing better for the rest of the semester.",

I emailed the professor to ask about my grade and he offered extra credit. Which I took and I ended up passing the class with a B in the end. Some professors don't do extra credit,but a lot of them are nicer than you think and won't be antagonized because a student asked a question. OP should 100% try just in case.",

Take the chances that you can, the worst that can happen is nothing changes. I my email I was honest and told her that I was suffering from depression and not handling school as well as I thought I could while also caring for my family, but that it was not financially possible to drop out so I needed to try to continue. She replied that depending on my work the rest of the semester, she may drop my failed test and use the average from my other work as my grade for the test.\n\nIt is good to have a back up plan though.. Plan for the worst, get your resume ready, plan to work at mcdonalds for a few years if you fail. Not that you will need to, but getting used to/accepting the reality of that being a possibility might get rid of some anxiety.",
