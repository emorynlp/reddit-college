  "text": "like my dudes...\n\nim a nihlist. ethics are a social construct and entirely subjective. go further, and good or bad are both 2 sides of a coin, just like the north and south, so there is no problem here. I generally dont have any desire to \"improve the world\" or care about bad things happening or lets say a country or democracy dying as its all meaningless. \n\nyou are asking the wrong guy about ethics and if you want my honest opinion, your not gonna like it. LOL. thankfully im not in engineering, cause id have to take a proffesional ethics class and Id probably fail it if I was honest lol.",
