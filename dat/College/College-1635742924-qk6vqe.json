  "text": "I would love to study EE but I am terrified because everywhere I look online suggests that it is impossibly hard. That one woiukd have to be a perfect A student who is naturally good at maths and that even top student are crippled by the workload.\n\nIm just a simple guy, I dont think im above average intelligence but I just really like learning about that subject and the employment oppertunities and career paths seem amazing. \n\nI was probably below average at math in school but I had no interest and didnt even study. Now I have an interest and a will and desire to learn so I hope I cam do a little better than before. But I have no hope of getting A's in maths by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nI honestly dont know what to do. I dont want to study for 3 years only to fail  \n\nCan you give me an understanding of how truly crippling this subject is ? Is it simply going to be too much for me and I need to just study Finance or something a little easier. \n\nHow can I assess this sitiation in order to establish whether or not I could pass without actually experiencing the subject ? Its very daunting as I am going in completely blind as to wbat exactly the tests are going to be like...\n\nCan you help me to assess whether or not I can do this ?",

      "text": "If you\u2019re as bad at math as you say EE really isn\u2019t the major for you. It\u2019s 95% math and physics in the courses and the labs are very time consuming. My school has ESET (electrical systems engineering technology) which from my understanding is like EE but with a less mathematical focus. I\u2019d recommend that to you unless you want to slog away at becoming a Calculus master. You are pretty much required to know mathematics up through calc 1/2 like the back of your hand before you even have day 1 of college for EE",

      "text": "In my opinion, give EE a shot. If you aren\u2019t prepared for it, you will fail out pretty quick rather than wasting years. I am a second year EE right now so I can\u2019t give the best advice. What I can say is that you need to really have a thorough understanding of algebra and early calculus (calc 1 and maybe some calc 2) before you go in. It is a tough major for sure, but I think the amount of time spent studying makes it tough rather than the actual material. You will likely spend much more time studying than other majors.\n\nFirst year will consist of Gen Ed\u2019s, calculus, chemistry, physics, and an intro EE class or two. Really take these classes seriously if you want to give yourself the best opportunity of succeeding. You will quickly find out if you have it or not. \n\nAt the end of the day, nothing in life worth having comes easy. Every older EE I knew during freshman year had no difficulty getting a $70k+ job straight out of school.\n\nEdit: shitty grammar",
