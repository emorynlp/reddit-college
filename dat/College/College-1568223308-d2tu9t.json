Having been part of my school's choir, I will also occasionally sing for all the lovely people around me, occasionally in languages they don't understand; I can sing the national anthems of the Soviet Union (1977 version, though I'm partial to the first part of the refrain in the '44 version), Germany, France, Italy (somewhat, more like the first verse), and North Korea. I'm an American going to college in southern Kentucky, so yes, I know I have wayyy too much time on my hands.",

Definitely recommend if you like music and safety/environmental sounds.",

For me they get a little uncomfortable after an hour or so straight since there's a hard plastic part that goes over your ear, but the sound is great for the price. Also note that they're half open-backed, so if you aren't in an open place and your music is loud enough other people might be able to hear a little but it hasn't been a problem for me.\n\nEdit: Also note that since they're half open-backed that the sound is generally \"spacier\", meaning that it shouldn't sound kinda trapped and muddied like closed earphones or headphones.",
