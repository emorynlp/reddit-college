      "text": "Faculty here.  Whether or not 5 pages is a strict minimum will depend mostly on the individual professor, of course.  Still, as a general rule, page requirements tend to be enforced more strongly in lower level classes.  That's because someone will complain \"I was barely under 5 pages\" after having turned in 3 pages of text written in size 16 font.  So professors have to be strict(er) at that level in order to weed out the obvious garbage.  But you're right that most of us prefer quality over quantity.  If you turn in 4 3/4 pages of insightful, well-researched, well-written text, I'd probably let the page requirement slide.  If you turn in 4 3/4 pages of incomprehensible rambling, then suddenly that 5 page requirement becomes non-negotiable.",
