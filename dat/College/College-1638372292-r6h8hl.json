  "text": "**Semester 1/8**\n\nJust wanted to come here and talk to my future self about things NOT to do (or to do). Take my advice or not, this is just for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Sleep, bitch**: Yes. If you need 10 hours, do it.\n2. **Yes, take care of your mental health, but still do your work**: Your mental health is extremely important, and you realized that early on in the semester. But sometimes you end up on social media all day as a way to take a break from work, and then you end up wasting hours unnecessarily. That leads to you being behind in your classes, which messes up your mental health more, causing a cascade. Just take small breaks throughout the day and try not to get distracted.\n3. **Move regularly**: Eh, you walked a decent amount this semester, but there were days that you got headaches from sitting down all day. Try to move every day, even if you don't feel that great. You will end up feeling good anyway.\n4. **No, you're not ahead**: You thought you were ahead in your classes so many times, but a day or two later you end up behind again. There really is no such thing as \"being ahead\" unless you've mastered the course material already. Always keep a lookout for what's to come.\n5. **Start projects early**: You are a procrastinator at heart, which helps you exercise your creativity at times. But for God's sake, at least be aware of deadlines. They're so much closer than you think.\n6. **No microcheating**: This is probably one of the most important ones. You've never \"properly\" cheated, but you have definitely looked up some answers for small questions with tight deadlines. What that does is it gives you a habit of thinking \"I don't understand this right now, but that's no problem because I'll be able to pass by without it,\" which leads to very superficial studying. ***No cheating under any circumstance***. It'll be better for your grade in the long run.\n7. **Sleep**. My current sleep deprived self needs to repeat this for emphasis.\n\nYeah. Please follow this. No need to be perfect, but at least make some improvements. And make another one of these at the end of your second semester.",

It feels like I'm walking in a fog, full time school and work feels like I'm just surviving more than living. I know shit gets bad when I'm driving  and think if I just make a hard right off the bridge I can get some rest.",

      "text": "I love this!!\n\nActually the sleeping one is really accurate, something I realised is that when I was 4 hours past my bedtime trying to finish something, unless 100% necessary, was an absolute waste, two hours in and my efficiency dropped massively, better to go to sleep early, wake up like a 3am or 4am and finish the thing.\n\nAlso moving is greeeaaat for mental health confidence and overall putting aside for 1 hour the worries of school and going back to them with a fresher mindset. When you excercise your brain focuses on c[ontroling pain through endorfines](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax#:~:text=Exercise%20reduces%20levels%20of%20the,natural%20painkillers%20and%20mood%20elevators) and that also helps you control those overwhelming emotions one has every once in a while.\n\nI just feel like giving some advice from my 7 semesters so I\u00b4ll allow myself to do it hope you're okay with it:\n\n**Try using written resources to keep in track everything you have to do for school**: Some people do agendas, some use their phones, what worked for me was using post it notes and pasting them on the wall. I put every assignment and reading I have for each class and cross them once I've finished it.\n\n**Don't beat yourself up if you can't do everything you want**: It's normal, sometimes in social media we see people that seem to be able to do everything, remember that's just a facade you keep doing you.\n\n**Don't have social media in your phone:** Geez, personally I started to do this this past semester and I swear my time management got so much better and I stopped comparing myself to everyone so much (still do it), its much more clearer now to me that instagram particularly makes me feel really bad about myself. Its probably the social media I enjoy the least now and effectively the one I probably check out the least. Ofc this doesn't include texting apps which are crucial.\n\n**Understand not everyday is great:** This is pretty obvious from a rational point of view, but its difficult to embrace it. Sometimes one just feels like doing nothing, in which case just do damage limitation, try to do the more efortless tasks, or find healthy ways of using those days like reaching out to people to hang out, reading or watching a movie.\n\n**Balance your social life:** My weakest since when I study I tend to retract myself from people and tend to forget reaching out to my friends which is an important part of life, something i need to work on so its pretty hard for me to be balanced.\n\nsorry, hope I didn't bore you, I feel like I also wrote this for myself, have a nice one!",
