  "title:": "Roommate asked security to open my bedroom without my consent",
  "text": "My roommate thought my windows was open, and causing the residence to be cold (he\u2019s probably too stupid to know how to use a thermostat), so he got the security to go, and open my bedroom to check if it was really open while I was away. I\u2019m feeling violated, I didn\u2019t allow anyone into my room, and the worst thing is that he didn\u2019t even tell me about it, I didn\u2019t even get any sort of notice by the security, I only know it happened because we have a mutual friend who was there when the security unlocked my bedroom door yesterday, and she told me today. What could I do to prevent it from happening again?",

Your friend probably didn\u2019t know it was an issue since some people are very open to letting others into their personal space.",
