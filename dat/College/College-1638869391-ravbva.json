  "text": "So I've been in community College for about 2.5 years now, I've been going through my pre requisites for x-ray tech. The thing is I've never been good at biology and I was kind of pressured by my parents to get into this. The past couple of semesters have been duds and I've been retaking classes for the entirety of my college career because they pretty much want me to have a 3.5 GPA to get into the program because it's so competitive (it's the only school that offers that program in my area) Since the pandemic happened and we went all digital my grades suffered horribly because I couldn't adapt fast enough to the curriculum. \n\nNow after years of trying but getting know where on something I never enjoyed in the first place, I'm thinking on changing my major to Networking which is something I'm very in to outside of college. \n\nIs it smart for me to change majors?\n\nHow do I break the news to my parents who have high expectations of me to work in a hospital being an x-ray tech?",

      "text": "If you\u2019re not happy with where you currently are at, change is never the wrong thing to do. Plenty of people change their majors when they realize they\u2019re unhappy with what they\u2019re currently there for. But I\u2019m a big believer that you should always do what you think would make YOU happy and do what you want with your life. \nUnfortunately, when it comes to parents, whether or not they are disappointed with you will already be set. Many parents have expectations for their kids that aren\u2019t within the child\u2019s best interest. If you try to explain that you just aren\u2019t happy where you are and you want to work towards something different that will make you feel more confident in your studies and with your life, maybe you\u2019ll find they have a soft spot and they\u2019ll learn that things won\u2019t always be how they imagined. But if they are harsh, I wouldn\u2019t take it to heart. Their reasons for being upset with you will never matter more than your reasons for wanting change. I say make that change OP and get on track to being a happier you. Good luck!",
