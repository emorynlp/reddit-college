  "text": "Hello Professor [Wronged],\n\nI dearly apologize for being absent during my intended presentation time on Tuesday the 30th. Frankly, I do not believe that I have a valid excuse. Rather, I would call it a lack of cognizance. I had been preparing my presentation much earlier that morning and felt ready to go.\n\nRegardless, I am emailing you to make clear that I wholeheartedly accept the logistical consequences of my absence. However, I would still take this opportunity to share with you my presentation slides. Although I was wrong to incidentally miss class, it would be doubly ignorant to do so without showing my work.\n\nYou will find my PowerPoint attached with this email \u2013 I would ask you to please review it and consider accepting a later or recorded presentation from myself for partial credit. Otherwise, I would be glad to do so even for some moral retribution on my end.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Idiot]",

For the record, this won't work if you have been doing poorly all semester or have a history of showing up late / asking for exceptions. But in most cases, professors will think back to the one time they happened to sleep through something super important for no good reason and will have mercy on you.\n\nHello Professor \\[Wronged\\],\n\nI am so sorry for missing my presentation time on Tuesday. I was finishing up my presentation in the morning and ended up sleeping through class. It's entirely my fault and I feel ridiculous for it - I should have finished the presentation earlier, set multiple alarms, and / or had someone call to make sure I was up, and I didn't do any of that.\n\nWhile an opportunity to submit a recorded presentation or make it up in office hours would be a relief, I completely understand that missing my assigned presentation day means I'll receive a zero on the presentation. I did want to still send over my slides because I'm proud of my work and was excited to present it. \n\nApologies again - I am extremely embarrassed by this and know that it won't happen again.\n\n  \nSincerely,  \n\\[Idiot\\]",

Also, once your done, try reading it over and ask yourself if it's completing its intended purpose in the most direct way that is still polite. For emails, I often write how I would speak to them face to face while still following emailing conventions. That may not be the best advice if you don't have a different voice for teachers or if you still use that flowery language in your speech. Also, I know many teachers I've had said \"don't write how you talk\", but so far I haven't had any problems with my emails.",
