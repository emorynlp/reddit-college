  "text": "Im a 1st year transfer student. I used to be extrovert person that I loved meeting ppl and hanging out with them. I was very outgoing until this traumatized, toxic happening in college which led me to take legal action. Im still suffering from that trauma, became an extreme introvert and started to lose self-esteem\u2026most of my friends who I hanged out with and I don\u2019t talk to each other and in my new school, i only talk to few ppl but stay in my dorm most of the time. I want to change and cope with my trauma but its still stuck inside of me. ;(",
