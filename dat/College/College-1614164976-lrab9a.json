For any of you reading this who are feeling isolated at school - reaching out to anyone you liked and got along with in high school is a good idea.

      "text": "I graduated in the before times, but I think the pandemic has actually had the opposite effect for me. Leaving HS I didn't have very many friends, and those that I had lost contact pretty quick. To compound it, I graduated a year early, so while I was a freshman in uni, those that I still talked with were HS seniors. Those acquaintances disappeared quickly.  \n\nNow with the pandemic, I feel like making new friends is almost discouraged, and that's kind of depressing. Compared to the first couple semesters before covid, where I made plenty of friends through working on class homework and studying, that just doesn't happen anymore. In large lecture halls, sitting 6 seats away from anyone else makes it really hard to meet other students and collaborate. The majority of my friends now are those that I made in my first handful of semesters from the before times. In that sense, not a whole lot has changed for me socially, despite having higher level and degree specific classes which I don't share with my friends anymore.",

Girl started banging a married man & planning to run away with him 2 months after she turned 16. She turns 18 in a month so we'll see what happens. \n\n1 had an ankle bracelet during high school for rape of a girl in the high-school. Rape happened literally 3 feet away from homewrecker above. Disputes still on if it was rape or not. He went to class same building & everything, just he had to walk between classes outside of passing period. \n\nMany underage alcoholics & nicotine users. Various theft & fighting people. Small towns are not necessarily quaint. Everything except murder happened & half of it was pretty normalized. Cops are all but useless. They do arrest the major meth heads & one child torturer while I was in high school. Surprised no one in my class is pregnant yet.

Not smart. Education in America & at least my town, sucked dick. So it becomes a cycle if uneducated people staying & making more uneducated people. Also why 3 to 1 people vote Republican. Then with nothing else to live for, people drink & do drugs. That's illegal, so they do some other illegal stuff along with it. They eventually have kids they can't financially support, so those kids turn to drugs, alcohol, & crime just like their parents. And the population doesn't want to improve itself. Most anyone that does, leaves the small town. So yes, poor, that's what their parents did, people who break the cycle leave, uneducated, & trained to hate change.",
