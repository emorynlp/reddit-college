  "text": "Would I (21F) be on time if I start applying to scholarships, especially those for English majors, in November? \n\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, here are some of my accomplishments. I wonder if these things would help me get something: \n\n1. I graduated with an associate degree. \n\n2. I finished my associate degree with a high GPA (somewhere in the 3.90s). \n\n3. I made the Dean\u2019s List every semester I studied at my alma mater. \n\n4. I excelled in my literature, grant writing, and fiction writing courses. \n\n5. I\u2019ve had fiction and poetry in publications. And an article about GarageBand got into a publication on Medium.com. \n\n6. I\u2019ve been studying Spanish. I have intermediate skills but I could become an advanced-level learner soon. I\u2019ll be taking the CLEP exam in December.",
