  "text": "Hiya Reddit! I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I am about to fail out of two project-based courses because it took me until the fall semester of my junior year to realize that I am in a major that I am not passionate about. I'm a junior computer science student with a high-paying internship on pause because I have no desire to continue. I'm a junior computer science student on a scholarship that will only cover my tuition for 4 years, and if I change my major now, I doubt I will be able to complete all of my credits in a year. I'm a junior computer science student that's wanted to be an actress since their first steps, but let controlling parents, insecurities, and the real world, convince me that I needed a high-paying, realistic job like an attorney or software engineer. What's the point of working in a field I am not passionate about? I don't know whether I should ride out these last 3 semesters or change my major to film or theater arts so I can study my passion.",

      "text": "I would suggest to finish your degree. You can pursue film and acting later, but since you're already so successful in this stable career, I would advise you to ensure that you have CS as a backup. You can even potentially get a job to pay the bills/tuition while you go back to film school. Since you already have a potentially prestigious internship, I would assume that you would be able to get a high paying job later on. \n\nIf this was one or two semesters ago, a major change wouldn't have been a problem. But now, in my opinion, you'll be better off finishing your CS degree in order to make sure you have a stable future and can pursue your dreams without having to worry about bills. I'm not saying this to put your passion down, but because it is a fact that it is easier for a skilled worker to find a high paying job in the CS industry in comparison to others, such as film. \n\nI know it might seem difficult to complete if your heart isn't in it completely, but if you choose to take this path, think of this as a stepping stone to you being able to do what you truly want, whilst maintaining stability. Good luck with whatever you choose to do! :)",

      "text": "I would suggest you just stick with it and finish your degree. You can always change your career and go back to college in the future when you have the money to do so, and you might even find that you actually quite enjoy your job in the process. Additionally, the acting industry, like the music industry, is not so much about talent as it is about connections. If you have a lot of money to throw around and can get a good agent, it will be much easier for you to land acting roles. So, get your CS degree, save and invest your money, and when you\u2019ve got the means to do so, pursue your passion.",
