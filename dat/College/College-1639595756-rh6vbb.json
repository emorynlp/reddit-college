  "text": "I came to uni 2 years ago after community college and bombed and then transferred back to CC. When I came back to uni my GPA was still a 1.92 at that specific school (my cumulative is like a 3.1) and after repeating one course and making and A and a B in two others I have a 3.075 now. I\u2019m no longer on academic probation and get to spend up to 8,000 in ETV money on school related expenses next semester. Maybe I can do college.",
