  "title:": "My friend started freshman year last month and has multiple presentations each week. They are getting drowned in work plus their groupmates never do anything. We are in different colleges but I want to help them however I can. Please help!",
  "text": "They literally have no time to even go out and get dinner on Sunday. Instead they order it and continues their work. They cannot even sit down and watch YouTube without assignments lingering on their  mind. I just want them to feel like they can breathe a little.\n\n(They- one person here).\nFyi: their college doesn't haven't any club culture or anything. They are feeling like their college decision was wrong and idk how to help them).",

      "text": "They need to help themselves. There\u2019s nothing you can do. Your friend was smart and strong enough to apply, accepted, and make the decision to attend. Now your friend has to learn to self-advocate and navigate that college. If all of this fails then perhaps your friend needs to consider applying for a transfer elsewhere. You can be a sounding board but you really need to give your friend space to arrive at their own conclusion.  \n\nAs far as work load, depending on major, that could be the life for a while, depending on how your friend allocates time and have study effectiveness solutions.",
