  "text": "It's not because of academics. I'm an international student. I'm in my home country studying in a US school online currently with a 15 hour timezone difference. It's been rough and took a toll on my mental health (I'm awake until 3, and my sleep schedule is all over the place) I want to move there already for Spring (took Winter quarter as gap to think) but my parents doesn't want me to go. They just keep saying it's difficult. They encouraged me to apply abroad but won't let me go abroad. They say it's cause pandemic, but I would have much rather been told abroad is a no go if it were like this. I'm considering just dropping US school and job abroad dreams and going to school locally, live locally, die locally. (I'm looking to take law school)\n\nI don't know what to do anymore, I just want a semblance of stability. Advice?\n\nTldr; I'm considering dropping US school because parents won't let me go in person and wants me to go online for as long as I can. I'm thinking of just going local and dropping my dreams to satisfy my parents.",
