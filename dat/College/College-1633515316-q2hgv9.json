  "title:": "What is college like for foreigners in the states?",
  "text": "This is probably a very general question that makes no sense but I'd love to hear someone's opinion on the matter anyway. So I currently have a weighted GPA of 3.7 and I'm a senior in high school with an ACT score of 30 and no honor classes, AP classes or extracurricular activities under my belt because I live in Egypt and things like that generally aren't offered here even though I'd love to be able to do them.\n\nMy principal spoke with me personally about helping me with the scholarship application process if my family is willing to let me study in the states as I'm pretty decent at art and writing and my entire life dream is to be able to pursue a career in animation and grow in the States and hopefully be able to study it in the states as well except I'm not allowed to go even though I get good grades and I have a shot at a scholarship. \n\nWhat I was wondering is whether or not any students that have left their home countries to study abroad have had good experiences and has it been beneficial? Are the opportunities better than the ones available to u elsewhere? How is the teaching system and treatment of foreigners their in education and just life in general?\n\nSort of just hoping maybe an outside opinion can help in some way.",

      "text": "Depends. I\u2019m a white girl from Europe in NY so for me it is pretty much like home, there are very little cultural differences. I\u2019m at a community college ( I want to transfer after 2 years) and I must say the stuff we learn is pretty easy, college level classes are harder in Europe. I like that it\u2019s not so focused on one thing, here you have to take gen ed classes in many fields, not just your major, this is something I missed when I studied in Europe. The biggest set back is that you can\u2019t work and have to pay for everything- no financial aid or in state tuition for us, but this is something you are prepared for. I really like it here, my professors are much more involved with us than my previous experience and there is a lot to do. The US is much more focused on the university experience and making the most of it so if that\u2019s what you are looking for it\u2019s perfect. People in general are very nice and open, even too friendly for me",

More important note, he\u2019s gotten some good job offers from some American companies too. \n\nSeems to me most international students do pretty dang well at my school.",
