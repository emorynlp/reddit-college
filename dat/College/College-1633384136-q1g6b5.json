  "text": "Honestly if you want to study for long periods of time, use that strategy. I've tried it and I actually get stuff done. For 50 minutes work on what you need to do. No social media, no phone, nothing that will cause distraction. Then for 10 minutes do whatever tf you want. Im by no means saying I invented this. its been known for a while. but if you havent tried it, and you are prone to procrastination, give it a shot",
