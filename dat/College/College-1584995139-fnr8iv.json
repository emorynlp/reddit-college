Some students just won\u2019t be able to focus on GPA this term because of circumstances out of their control. The decision to switch to pass/fail grading for this term was made so that more privileged students would not have an advantage over those who don\u2019t have the same time and resources. It sucks for those who want to raise their GPA, but pass/fail grading is absolutely necessary in the wake of this pandemic.",

You can't enforce this. Are you going to check if people open up new tabs in the browsers when taking an online test? What if they have a laptop right next to them? Enforce students to get a video camera, and a headset? Enforce students to record themselves while taking a test? How do you prevent this? You can't.\n\nOther things to consider, I go to a commuter school, and most people are older individuals with full/part time jobs, some of them are probably laid off right now. I don't think any of them are worried about school work, but instead where to get their next meal. Just because some one decided to go for normal GPA to get A's doesn't mean they are better than these people are all.\n\nI am a CS major I have 14 A's and a 1 B+ right now. I am trying to transfer to other schools this fall, so I know GPA is an important factor. In addition, I am positive that grad school will not care about 4 A's or 4 passes under current circumstances. They want to see consistency, I would even argue that 10 A's + 4 Passes is better than 10 B's with 4 A's. If you can get A's with limited resources good for you, but there is no way for the schools to validate if you did any of the work. Even if you really did pushed yourself and earned those A's fairly. Therefore, I think it is fair for everyone to go for P/F instead of GPAs. Schools know this, this is probably why they are doing P/F in the first place.",

I don\u2019t think having scripted discussion prompts is the same as being able to talk to people in real time. There are other reasons too why in this situation online classes  are messy but this is my main concern right now.",
