  "text": "Hello!\n\nI am due my baby in a few weeks, and I am about to start my semester at college.\nI am planning on taking only one 4 credit course, and the schedule of the class will workout with my husband's work schedule.\n\nI was wondering, has any of you had any experience with at tenting College with a baby at home?\n\nClasses will be literally around the corner (3 min drive from my house), 3 hrs in the morning twice a week.\nI do feel it's doable, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice for an old lady studying again :)\nI did take already two semesters off because my beginning of the pregnancy was awful and I gained my energy back half way through the Fall semester, when it was obviously too late for classes.\n\nThanks :)",
