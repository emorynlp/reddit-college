  "text": "I have really enjoyed online learning and want it to continue post-COVID, as well as enjoy online events! How should I promote it? Right now I'm asking and people understand, but I'm curious about how to do it post-COVID for school like how companies are allowing remote and hybrid work.",

      "text": "My sense is that you're in the minority. As time passes we're going to discover that online learning is a disaster for most students. Doing both in-person and remote based on student preference is expensive and difficult, and schools will default to in-person since it's the preference of most students. This is going to be a tough sell. That said, there will be schools and programs that will cater to those who want online learning.",
