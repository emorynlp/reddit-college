  "text": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m just finishing the GDL with ULaw and I have been accused of plagiarism.\n\nI have completed this course completely remotely and don\u2019t know any other students because of this and apparently some of my work looks \u201cvery similar\u201d to another student\u2019s.\n\nBasically they asked us, as part of an assignment, to write up a table that contained legislation of what was required in certain reports, I did this and then referred to the legislation in my table as well. I am under the impression that everyone\u2019s tables should look the same but of course I don\u2019t know as I have not seen anyone\u2019s work nor am going to ask to. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice here? I have a hearing next week and I actually had to leave work early as I was so upset by it. I would also appreciate any insight into what the punishment may be for this.\n\nTIA",
