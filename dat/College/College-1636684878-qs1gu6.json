  "text": "Maybe this is just at my school, but for both my gen Ed classes and classes for my major, people don\u2019t talk. At community college I got to know the kids sitting next to me. Now it feels like everybody wants to get the fuck out as soon as possible. I\u2019m an extraverted person so this is bumming me out hard.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to strike up a few conversations with people next to me. They definitely just wanted to be left alone. I even got a couple peoples phone numbers that seemed cool but they ghosted me immediately. This never happened to me in community college.\n\nCan anybody relate to this? What should I attribute it to? The lockdowns? The fact we wear masks? Did everybody just get social anxiety? I mean hell I know I did for a while but it\u2019s mostly dissipated now.",

Everybody stands up and leaves right as class ends and just leaves. I sit with 4-5 seats on either side of me. There are small groups of friends from high school scattered around. It really is depressing.",

      "text": "I feel you on this. I transferred from my community college to my 4 year university in Fall 2020 and it\u2019s extremely rare for people in my synchronous lectures to share their cameras or even talk. I\u2019m even a Supplemental Instruction Leader for a bio psychology course and it\u2019s like everyone just wants to hear me talk and not actually ask any questions when I host my sessions. I\u2019ve talked to my professors about this. I think it\u2019s possibly due to burnout but also that students just aren\u2019t treating the courses like college level. I personally am planning on graduate school and I\u2019m doing my apps right now and I wouldn\u2019t have my letters of recommendation or be in research if I didn\u2019t just straight up engage and learn about opportunities in office hours and during lectures. It pisses me off and bums me out when no one wants to talk. Socializing is a huge component of college and having in-depth conversations to me is what I expect. But I guess college is the new high school for many people.",

So I really need to step up my personal engagement with my professors. It\u2019s just really hard mentally when you\u2019re all alone in a new place. I feel detached from my surroundings.\n\nOn another note, maybe you\u2019re right. I try not to attribute this NPC behavior intrinsically. But maybe it just\u2026 is the way college students are now. ):",

I think one positive from all this weird online crap is that it\u2019s never been easier to engage with professors. Find times for clubs and organizations too! I\u2019m Vice President of an international honors society and I just prepare zoom sessions with a few other students to talk about psychology stuff we are interested in. Looks kick ass on a resume. Especially since you said you\u2019re doing well, find out if there are any honors societies for your major and get in. Every little thing will help. Also visit your writing center and ask around for CV examples and how to write Statements of purpose for future programs. Sorry a lot of random info but I have a headache and I try to give advice if it helps.",
