  "title:": "Reusing an essay from a class you failed when you retake a class",
  "text": "I am retaking a class I failed last year. It was a hybrid grad class (a class with both undergrad and postgrad students but the only difference is grad students have to turn in a research paper). \n\nI did poorly last year and failed because it was a class I struggled to understand online and did poorly on the homework and final. \n\nI wanted to know if I could just use the grad paper I submitted last year, for this semester's class. (with obvious edits). Its the same professor. Only worth 8% of my grade so I can whip up a new one by tomorrow night, get a 50, and be fine but I would love to save that time studying for other finals.",
