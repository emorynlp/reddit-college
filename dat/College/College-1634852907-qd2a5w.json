  "text": "I know a lot of people that strongly prefer just the midterm and final, but I  not only do better when we have 5 tests, I legitimately learn better and retain the information. Added to that, we often end up knowing  small percentages of our grades with 2 midterms before drop time, if we  know anything   .  Anyone else feel this way? I feel like writing my potential professors  next semester to ask before I sign up for their classes.",

      "text": "I agree with this, there's also more assessments for you to know where you're going wrong, especially if the course builds heavily on previous material.\n\nWith more tests, I also feel that there's less to study for, which means you can possibly spend more time mastering the content rather than hurriedly rushing through your reviews.",

      "text": "I don't have enough time for 5 tests. At least midterm season is a set period for suffering for 1-2 weeks. Extending that to the whole semester sounds like hell.\n\nHaving more tests during class time also means less lectures. So you'd learn less material overall.",
