  "title:": "Tips From Someone Who's Graduating Soon",
  "text": "Alright so it's finally my senior year and I'm gonna give you my college cheat codes: \n\n1. Try to sparse out your classes throughout the week. Nowadays some schools follow the MW and TTH rule, meaning like some classes might be on Monday and Wednesday while others will be Tuesday and Thursday. Unless if you are working, try not to schedule your classes all on the same days, especially your first year. The reason being is you're gonna wanna skip, and when you do skip you'll find yourself skipping ALL the courses. Scheduling two courses a day gives you an even flow for college with breaks in between. \n2. Understand how your classes work and how YOU work. Some classes mark participation points and can take a heavy toll on your grade. Other classes don't count participation but offer a lot of material. Use these to your advantage and make sure when you skip classes you know the repercussions. \n3. You're gonna be tempted to eat at the dining hall everyday and drink all the soda from the soda fountain, but pace yourself. Its not healthy to live on soft drinks and pizza. GET A MINI FRIDGE. PUT SOME SALADS IN IT. BUY FUCKING WATER. \n4. Toilet paper is a necessity you won't think about until you run out of it. In the even that you do run out and don't have cash to spare most dorms have a public bathroom in their lobby and usually are accessible at all times. It's a pain in the ass but a good contingency plan \n5. If you're doing horrible in your classes: communicate with your professors early on. Don't just drop the class or continue to flunk. Usually professors understand that some students are going to have a hard time pacing themselves and are willing to work with you if you reach out to them early on. \n6. If you are in the middle of the semester and you feel like you're going to fail a class, speak with you academic adviser and see if you can take it pass/fail. Usually you need a legitimate reason for this (disability, sickness, financial troubles), but showing your academic adviser that you're serious about your goals will make them more willing to help you\n7. Remember not everyone has the stereotypical college experience as you see in movies and TV, and that not every college experience is the same. Personally I had to take breaks in between semesters, transfer my courses to a different university, change majors a few times, take part time courses, take summer courses, work part time and go to school full time, and work full time and go to school full time. College should be taken at your own pace based on YOUR needs. If you can't afford it, its okay to take a break and work to save up the money. If you realize you aren't in the right path, its OK to change majors. ",

Its not healthy to live on soft drinks and pizza.\n\nMaybe it was just my school's dining hall, but they essentially divided everything into \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" categories. In the unhealthy category was your typical foodstuff like pizza, burgers, french fries, etc. But in the healthy category was all of this great, home-cooked food with tons (not exaggerating) of side vegetables to pick from. I ended up becoming a vegetarian the last two years of undergrad, only ate dining hall food, and ended up losing a good 20 pounds because of it. \n\nI *did* go to school in rural West Virginia though...so YMMV.",

If you don\u2019t 100% understand something there\u2019s absolutely no shame in asking about it. If you\u2019re feeling down, depressed, homesick? Seek guidance! The resources are there for you!\n\n 2) check out what kind of insurance your school has AND USE IT! a lot of schools, part of your tuition has been spent on a insurance package. Look into it! Use it! You may have coverage for dental cleanings and deductibles for things like eye glasses and medication. Take advantage of it! Get your teeth cleaned! (Example my school covers a large range of medical so I can get three massages/alignments for my back at 5$ a pop!)\n\n3) if you know something came up an assignment is going to be late: tell the prof in advance. Usually there\u2019s a mandatory penalty but if you can show you\u2019ve worked on it, even with just a rudimentary outline, they\u2019ll often be more willing to cut you some slack!\n\nTl;dr - reach out! There\u2019s plenty of resources to help you succeed, you just need to utilize them! Ask questions! It\u2019s scary but it will help.",

          "text": "well i started school in 2012 like the summer when i graduated high school, then 2012-2013 i did nursing school gen eds (which are basically gen eds plus pre reqs), then i took the fall of 2013 off because i was supposed to go to school in michigan but that didn't end up happening. So i went to school there in 2014, but i was sexually assaulted so that obviously kinda affected school so i took another semester off and then over the summer worked and did part time school before i had the money to transfer credits back to my home state. I went to community college from 2015-2016 and at this time i took summer courses and worked part time which is how i was able to save a year. then in 2017 i applied to another university in my state and did winter and fall 2017 and winter and fall 2018. This is my last semester, I'm 24, I started college at like 18 so it did add two more years to me but to those of you who wanted to know if you can go back or not...you can. I am gonna have a Bachelor's in Information Technology, and i currently work in a web hosting company, and I'm an aspiring web developer",
