      "text": "My recommendation on the backpack is an ogio backpack. I got one as swag from an internship and it's phenomenal. I had a dedicated laptop sleeve on the back that kept it nice and protected as well as a huge pocket that could fit several textbooks and a 5-centric notebook. It also have pockets with all the pouches and slots for pens pencils and calculators.\n\nNow that I'm graduated when you set as an emergency 72 hour kit and it's stuffed to the brim but is extremely sturdy and comfortable to wear even when it's so full.",
