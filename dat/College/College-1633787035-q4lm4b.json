  "text": "I\u2019m a college student who had sent in an assignment a few days ago, and Urkund (my platform) says that there is a 2% match between my assignment and another student\u2019s work. I don\u2019t know if it was a past student or not, it was just in the database. \nI didn\u2019t copy the part that student had written, I wrote it in my own words and it was a coincidence.\n\n What should I do now? Could I be accused even if the coincidence was that small?\n\nEdit: I have gone into my subject page and I have a zero even though nothing has been graded, have I been failed?",
