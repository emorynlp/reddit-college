      "text": "As far as the name thing goes, I usually deal with this by carrying around a label-maker with me at all times and labeling people with their names after they introduce themselves to me and telling them never to take it off. They usually think it\u2019s a funny inside joke so it actually works, but it\u2019s my legit way of keeping names. As for the other stuff, I use microsleep every few minutes to keep my energy levels high (yes, even during \u201cextracurricular activity\u201d); the sleep really adds up over time.",
