  "text": "I failed a class this semester and feel like a idiot. I know that I\u2019ve jeopardize my financial aid and feel like I can\u2019t really do much now but retake the class. I\u2019m more worried about the situation with financial aid because I can\u2019t afford college and neither can my parents. This is the worse and I\u2019ve learned my mistake and won\u2019t do the same next semester or following years to come. For now, I\u2019ll probably have to use my refund money to pay.",
