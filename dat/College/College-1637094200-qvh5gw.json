  "text": "I wasn't ready for college the first time around. I was 18, immature, and wasn't ready to put in the work. I barely hung on for a few years and finally was dismissed from my university due to poor grades.\n\nThis was about 6-7 years ago and I've grown up a lot since then. I make good money, have a good job. But a college degree is something I want to accomplish if at all possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I even go about getting back in school with poor grades? Do I need to go the community college route? Is it even worth it?",

      "text": "You should go to community college and seek to transfer out. 6-7 years later is a long enough time for your grades to not really be considered anymore. They know you\u2019d have changed. And don\u2019t see CC as a loss. People go to CC and transfer to Berkeley and UCLA. Even Cornell takes a hundred or so top-tier local CC transfers a year.\n\nStarting at CC means nothing against you. I interviewed with a big4 Sr. Manager who started at CC, but got his MS from Cornell. I myself am a CC transfer student at a fairly prestigious CA public now. \n\nSo get out there man! Sign-up and get started.",

              "text": "It depends on what state you go to. If you\u2019re here in CA for instance, it\u2019s super easy as CC costs $46 a credit and there\u2019s numerous online degree completion programs from the cal states. Also the fact that there\u2019s a CSU within spitting distance of everywhere means you can always finish in-person, part-time.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s up to you to decide worth. Will it boost your earnings potential or is it for personal growth? How much is the personal achievement is worth it to you? Etc etc. that\u2019s all you man.",
