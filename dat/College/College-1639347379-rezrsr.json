  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, this is my first time posting to this thread, but I could use a bit of advice I guess. I was always one of those kids in high school who did really well but never really had to try. So far, this has been pretty detrimental. I\u2019ve been trying to go to therapy and fix my study habits, but I feel miserable because school has been so much harder for me. I love the major (bio) but I have all of these classes that make me hate school and forget what I even like about it. It\u2019s to the point where I have no idea what I want to do for grad school or if I\u2019m even smart enough to get in. I guess I\u2019m just really lost and could use some advice?",

      "text": "Same here, really lost and thinking about changing majors and etc. I think you will get into grad school just don't give up. As for career choice, try searching or looking up multiple online if you hadn't already. Theres vids on youtube. Meet or contact other people in the same major as you. Or attend job fairs. Not sure if this helps but good luck",
