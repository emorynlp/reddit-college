  "text": "Hello everyone, so I\u2019m in my first year of my CSE program and so far we haven\u2019t even written any code. We\u2019ve been doing binary and algorithms along with pseudo code, things like that. We haven\u2019t actually created anything yet but I\u2019m still extremely stressed out due to Calculus and chemistry along with the computer science class. I\u2019m not doing that well in it and I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll really enjoy doing it for years to come. My biggest thing or fear is CSE is such a lucrative degree path that I just don\u2019t know if I can really find with any other degree so that\u2019s my biggest fear really. I haven\u2019t attended any of the hackathons that have been going on due to me just not really being interested in them even though I know they\u2019re important. Any advice? Idk if it\u2019s the math that\u2019s messing me up since I\u2019ve always been not so great at Math or if it\u2019s the fear of just coding all day and not talking to anyone. I don\u2019t know, any advice would be appreciated. Like I said, my biggest fear is the money.",
