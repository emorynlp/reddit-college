  "text": "Just a PSA even though we all know to do this. If you're in a class, especially with TAs grading all the work. They are overworked to begin with and you never know when they happen to be grading your exam when they are in a bad mood, just don't care, etc. etc. \n\nI had a test grade released at 1:40am last night. 'That's weird' I thought since grades have to be manually released. The thought of having an exhausted overworked grad student checking my answers at 1AM made me extra suspicious so I went through and re-read everywhere I had points taken off. I ended up getting 2 points (out of 100) back on an exam worth 40% of my grade. \n\nCheck your answers!",

      "text": "I second this. Canvas marked my exam automatically and I went back and checked. The given solutions on the questions I got wrong made no sense to me, so I emailed the teacher asking for clarification on why those would be the correct answers (ask in this manner, not saying \"I think your answer is wrong\"). I got 10 points back for 2 questions, and the teacher explained that grad student assistants just take the questions and answers from the test bank and alter them a little, and sometimes the answers remain unchanged so it messes things up.",

      "text": "Yes, look over your answers, but if you have issues you should go to office hours and say \"I wasn't sure what I did wrong here, could we go over it?\".\n\nI really don't recommend directly e-mailing your professor for points back. A lot of people get in the mindset of \"I'm entitled to these points and the grading is wrong\" without even considering that their answer was missing something, they might've completely misunderstood the question, etc. In my experience, this is the case 90% of the time (student's grade was accurate) and since they fixate on getting points back, they don't listen when I try to explain what they did wrong (so they end up doing the same thing wrong in the same way on other exams...).\n\nJust be genuine, ask to go over the question and your answer and if there were grading issues your professor will notice while you're talking.",
