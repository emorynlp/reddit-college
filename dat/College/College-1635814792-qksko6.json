  "text": "So for the couple of months we have been in school and roommates my roommate will periodically throw up. After we go out to eat and sometimes just randomly. They always try to hide the fact they are throwing up and refuse to talk about it. I\u2019m not sure what to do. They are my best friend (they have been for years) and this is the first time I have noticed this. Obviously they don\u2019t want to talk about it but I think they might have an eating disorder or something else. I\u2019m not sure how I can help",

      "text": "i went through this with a close friend as well maybe gently bring up that you\u2019ve been noticing this behavior and you\u2019re concerned for their well-being since you really care about them, don\u2019t accuse them of having a problem but give them the option to open up and let you in on what\u2019s going on if they feel comfortable. or if you don\u2019t think that would work you could always leave the numbers for some of your mental health resources on campus on their desk or something like that. if it\u2019s getting severe maybe reach out to their family? but that could really put a weight on your friendship especially if that\u2019s not actually what\u2019s going on or if they have a rocky relationship with their family. it hurts to see your friend struggling but in this situation if they don\u2019t want to talk about it or get better there\u2019s not much you can do aside from let them know you care and you\u2019re there for them",
