  "text": "I have exams in 6 weeks and am 7 weeks behind the lecture content. I've been struggling because everything is prerecorded so I've just been doing my assignments and working on other subjects. This has resulted in me falling behind in chem. \nI can't figure out how to catch up or study properly? Am I too late?",

      "text": "There are lots of people on the mini-mester term system, like AZ State. Most classes are over 7.5 weeks instead of 15. My brother took chemistry in that time period - it was hard but manageable. You'll be fine! I like the advice about talking back to the lecture.",

      "text": "Listen to lectures any where you can while you do mundane tasks like laundry, dishes and walking. Talk back to the recordings, out loud, to make that brain/body connection with the material. Example: say out loud, \u201coh! So what you\u2019re saying is that\u2026.. and then repeat bits of material.\u201d You must interact with the knowledge for it to feel known. Through the assignments you probably know more than you realize.",
