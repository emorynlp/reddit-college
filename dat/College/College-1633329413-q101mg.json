  "text": "Due to my current living situation I'm in a point in my life where I must persue a master's degree. In my country you need an international master's degree  if you really want a decent salary and more opportunity. The problem is, I can't afford that.  I'm currently thinking of applying to a full scholarship program that is available for people from my country but the options I see are soo limited and nothing interests me. I majored in business administration in my low class country and I feel as if there's nothing for me to do a master on. The only things I see on that program are investment, finance and some online digital marketing stuff. I do have another scholarship program where I can apply, and I could study anything from the united states but the process is way longer and time is my #1 concern. What also worries me a lot is that my main goal is to move out of my country since I dont see a future for me here since I'm gay and I don't live in a very gay-friendly country and also because there's lack of opportunity, lack of safety, and lots of corruption, but its not easy to move out to Canada or USA when you don't have first class preparation. I still live with my mother and I feel like this is my only option to move out and make a decent living since it's almost impossible to live alone with the salary I make. Time is running out, the whole process for the scholarship + the international master's completion + the mandatory 2 years of work in my home country after returning  takes 4 years. I'm 24 so I'll be around  29 or 30 by the time the WHOLE process is finished. And that's killing me cause, and I know this will sound silly for some people, but I literally have never had a partner and I'll have to wait until I'm 30 to be available, move out and maybe work on my personal stuff, it scares me because at 30 everything is harder and I feel like I'm not living my 20s. No friends, no partner...I don't even know what I'm gonna do after returning back to my country to stay here for another 2 years. I don't wanna miss anybody and I aso dont want to force anyone to come with me. But I must start the process in 2022 or else it'll be too late, I can't make up my mind. Please someone help me",
