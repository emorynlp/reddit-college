  "text": "I had a final exam in fall 2019 in macroeconomics. I completed all the questions and even came to him a couple of times during the exam. My exam has been written with a pencil, and I got 26/30. I lost 3 points because one of the questions I didn't attempt. I assigned the meeting with him on January 7 after almost a month after the grade was posted because he was not able to see me earlier. When we met, I didn't expect that I missed a question, and I definitely forgot everything about this exam, but when I came home that's got clear that I actually completed this part, but it has been erased because I personally remember how I was coming to him regarding this part. I got B for this course with 88%, but if this part would be completed I would get almost 94% what would be an A. What shall I do in order to get my points?",

      "text": "Moral of the story: write in pen. Seriously, it's a lot easier to cross off am answer with a pen than to erase. If it's a calculation based test make sure you give yourself space to get the wrong answer. \n\nAlso the prof has no reason to erase your answers. (Unless they are a secret villain who has plotted this moment for a long time). Chances are you forgot you erased it and handed it in before you realized you didn't answer it. This isn't an appeal because you failed, it's an appeal because you think you deserve better. Most appeal committees/department will dismiss this immediately.",

Maybe during the test you were provided some instruction which was erased following your mid test discussion with the expectation you would fill it in yourself and the professor would not technically be answering questions for you. Then you sat back down and continued the test without actually answering the question.  Or perhaps.....Frankly, stating that your arrival home \"triggered\" a sudden clarity regarding the situation sounds like you've presented this narrative to your parents who are calling you out on a lie by asking you to pursue the matter further. Either way, you have a blank test which isn't redeemable for points.",

So I was fully prepared and was sure to answer it. As a result, I am confused that my work is missing for this question. I believe there was a chance that my test was altered after taking it. Is there anything I can do?\" \n\nAs another commenter mentioned, the much more likelier case is that a fellow student got a hold of your test and erased an answer. Even if the class isn't curved, someone could have just been salty about doing poorly in the course, or wanted to look better, or resented that you seemed to be doing well. Maybe they saw you raise your hand in class and got jealous, or maybe they don't know you and just erased some random answers on random people's tests. \n\nIt's a good idea to bring this to your professor's attention, because first off it's possible this was a more widespread problem, and second off he should have some knowledge about who handled the tests, where they were stored, etc. that could help answer if another student accessed them. \n\n(Not only would suggesting he changed it ruin your chances of him helping you, it's also very implausible. If he had too many A's he could just curve the test or final grades.)",
