  "text": "I did pre-algebra in 8th grade, Algebra 1 in freshman year of high school, Geometry as a sophomore, Algebra 2 as a homeschooler, then I got a college-level score on the HiSET. I also took the Accuplacer, which along with my high school transcript and the path I'm going (transfer track, Computer Science) put me in College Algebra and Trigonometry with no remedial math classes necessary to meet the prerequisites.\n\nHowever, I'm in asynchronous online classes, with no Zoom meetings or video lectures, only assignments with weekly due dates. There's obviously stuff I need to learn, because I'm just not \"getting it.\" I could grasp enough of the basics to complete my first homework, but it's going to be harder from now on.\n\nWhat does a tutor do? There are options to schedule a session with one, but I don't know what to expect with that. I'm guessing they can't teach you what you didn't already learn because they're not teachers, or help you with your homework because that would be cheating, so what can they do? If I scheduled one every week like I'm allowed to, would it be with the same person or whoever's available?",

      "text": "Whether you get the same person every time will depend on how your school handles scheduling. While they won't be able to just give you the answers on your homework, a good tutor should be able to walk you through the process so you understand how to do it in the future.",

Check out Khan Academy or The Organic Chemistry Tutor.\n\nYou can go at your own pace and cover exactly what you want, I'm not sure about your school but the tutors at mine were students that took it a year or two ago and what you're covering might not be as fresh in their minds.",
