I have no idea. \n\nI started an internship mid-semester and am going into my junior year, and have felt so damn overwhelmed because it's just a constant cycle of class and work and homework and its bullshit we weren't given anything. Guess this is how President Michael Crow treats us not to mention there's a fucking pandemic. I work partially at home and do all my zoom classes at home online so I'm cooped up in my room all day.\n\nI have slowly began losing willpower to make myself do my assignments. All I want to do is just play video games because I get so much more satisfaction when I try my best to win in comp matches.\n\n I have roughly less than 3 weeks left, but feel like I have no steam left in me. I try and see that I am a lucky person to be in college and I am grateful for this opportunity, but I am feeling a ton of the societal and psychological impacts right now. \n\nDo you all have any thoughts on how I can get myself out of this slump?",

There are spring and fall semesters, but each semester has two terms. For example, Fall Term 1 is 12 weeks and Fall Term 2 is 6 weeks. There\u2019s a 2 week break in-between each term. There\u2019s a 3-week winter and summer session that overlaps with the second terms. \n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why it\u2019s so weird. My friends who went to traditional senior schools (also in the US)  also thought it was weird. \n\nPersonally, I quite like it. Having two terms for fall and spring is so convenient, especially when it comes to financial aid. I was able to take 24 credits last semester.",
