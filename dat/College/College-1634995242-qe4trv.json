So if I wanna enroll in any IT courses in college then does it matter if I chose science or commerce?",

      "text": "I will in American university, but as far as I know Canadian ones work very similarly, most us schools care more about your GPA, standardized test scores, and application essays. I am a computer science major and I know plenty of people who never took a CS course in high school. So long as you have some degree of math experience (and can hopefully fill in some gaps with your essays) you will probably be good. However, I would recommend choosing more relevant electives for your 12th grade year if you can.",
