          "text": "I'm convinced that in most classes the average would be at least like 15-20% higher EASILY if everyone went to all their classes and did all their work. Instead people skip lectures, chegg/use the internet to do their assignments for them, and end up severely behind and proceed to talk about how difficult to class is. Obviously not the case for everyone, but definitely the case for a lot more people than it seems.\n\n\nNot that I'm complaining though, I'd take my free curves any day. There have been so many exams where I come out thinking \"holy shit the exam was fair but I was just fucking stupid, I definitely did poorly\" and I end up 20 points above the average because half the people haven't attended the class in months and just relied on speed watching recordings and chegg thus far.",
