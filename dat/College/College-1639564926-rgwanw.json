  "text": "I made a [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rg1yua/help_i_need_92_responses_to_this_hair_related/) post yesterday. Although I haven't reached the target yet, I would still like to thank the 80 people from this sub who filled the survey.\n\nAs promised, here are the findings: \n\n* Almost all responses came from US.\n* Average rating of Hair Salon Services is 6.7/10.\n\n**Problems**\n\n* 75% report that there is no way to determine if there the new trim will good on them.\n* 44% report that 'When I sit in the hairdresser's chair, I feel powerless. I just have to accept my fate and say that the trim is great even when it isn't.'\n* 33% report communication problems with hair dressers.\n* 21% report that hairdressers lack skill.  \n* 20% have given up on hair dressers, they trim their own hair.\n\nScreenshots of data on Gender & Hair Trim Frequency are available [here](https://imgur.com/a/9aVmlk7).\n\nI'm still short on responses, so please do fill the survey if you haven't yet.\n\nLink: [https://forms.gle/Xo1rq1jHFzd4JLQc8](https://forms.gle/Xo1rq1jHFzd4JLQc8)",
