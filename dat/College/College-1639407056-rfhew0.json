  "text": "Took pre-requisite courses (along with upgrading courses because I was bad in High School) to transfer to UBC-Pharmacy and my time at Douglas was 2016-2019...left because my GPA went down again & I wanted to try something else (Medical Lab Assistant at VCC)...got waitlisted for the 2nd thing and then decided to go into Pharmacy Tech but at CDI College...failed it the first time; went back for the 2nd time and got further in but after seeing how a couple of the instructors taught it, it discouraged me & I saw some reviews of CDI in general....and now I have to score 84% on the final to continue in the program.\n\nSometimes I feel like I\u2019m at my wits end & sometimes feel like going back to Douglas College (maybe major in Psychology first), but atm I just feel depressed by how much I screwed up (Covid definitely helped me realize that...idk why it only happened now)",

If you learn from your mistakes and struggles, then you gained something valuable, EXPERIENCE. You should take a break if you can and find what truly makes you happy and chase that happiness!",
