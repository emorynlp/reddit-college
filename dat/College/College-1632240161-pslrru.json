      "text": "It depends a great deal on your situation.\n\nIn general, it looks better to withdraw and then retake the course. In some schools, there's direct grade replacement but many schools average the two grades. This means your GPA can take a significant hit from taking the F. Moreover, failing courses normally creates a massive short-term dip in your GPA which can threaten academic standing (especially early in your academic career).\n\nThat being said, you should always talk to the professor before dropping a course you're potentially failing. In many cases, what you perceive as a 'failing' grade is merely a bad one (such as a C). For coursework that isn't relevant to your future studies and you're unlikely to do much better on in the future, taking a 'C' can be a reasonable out.\n\nOne significant exception to the above is financial aid. If you're reliant on federal student aid and dropping a course will drop you below 12 (or 6) credits, you will be required to immediately repay the difference between your current course load and your new attempted course load. Chances are that you will not be able to do so - and you will not be able to register for future classes until you do.\n\nFor students dependent on that money, that means the seemingly simple decision about dropping a failing course potentially means bringing their education to a screeching halt. Often for years as they struggle to repay loans they weren't expecting to have to repay prior to completing their education.",
