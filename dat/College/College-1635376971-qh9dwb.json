  "text": "Hi there!\n\nI'm a junior(ish) at this point and have been working 46 hours a week in a relatively high-stress job. This year I'm stepping down to 25 hours a week! In the past, I have been able to handle about 15 credit hours while doing this job, tough and honestly heartbreaking at points, but I never had to do an all-nighter because I planned it out well. Plus, I've managed to keep a 3.9ish GPA. I'm trying to avoid an extra semester of college, so does 18 credit hours next semester sound too bad?\n\nFor reference, I'm taking Criminal Justice and the Social Structure 3000, Criminal Law 2000, criminological theories 3000, host security 2000, organized crime 3000, and white-collar crime 3000. I know that the criminal law class will of course be a pretty heavy one given it's on law, but the others don't seem too bad to me. Do you think it's doable given my past history? I'd appreciate some advice even if it's as simple as calling me out for something stupid I'm doing.",

You have greater knowledge of your school\u2019s difficulty for those courses, the demands of your job, and above all, your ability and limitations. Some people have pulled this off before, some people have failed. I would say one semester isn\u2019t too bad, but I would ask people who know you better too if you really need a strong assessment of your time management and etc",
