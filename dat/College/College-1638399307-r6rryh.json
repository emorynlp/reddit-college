  "title:": "Lied on my Financial Aid appeal form",
  "text": "Okay so TLDR I lied on my Appeal form for the financial aid office since i had a low gpa, i said that i lost my job. When in reality i quit due management. But then I got hired a month after. They are asking for a letter of termination, should i forge one, will they call my ex employer\n\nSo basically I'm going back to school and the last time I was there I had a bad GPA cause it was the middle of pandemic and i quit my job and also had a toxic roommate. I wrote in the appeal form that i was fired rather than quit. Later 3 weeks later i got hired for a higher up position at the same company. So i have an offer letter but no gemination letter. \n\nShould i forge one. Would they call my ex employer? \n\nWould my appeal change if i told them i quit rather than got fired. \n\nWhat should I do i want to get financial aid for next semester i want to finish my degree I'm one year away from finishing. \n\nI really don't know what to do",

      "text": "Tell them you never got a letter of termination. Don\u2019t lie from here on out it\u2019ll only make the hole deeper. If they ask why you didn\u2019t get a letter say you actually quit and didn\u2019t see a difference between the two (quitting vs firing)",
