  "title:": "Failed calc for the 4th time, I'm so tired and my options are thin",
  "text": "I'm supposed to graduate next semester, but Calc has been holding me back for years. In high school I did good in AP Algebra I and II, but got my ass handed to me in AP Pre-Cal. I barely passed by the skin of my teeth, and calculus has been so much worse.\n\nEvery year I've gone through tutoring, used the university's practice exams, and studied my old exam copies. But it always takes me 2-3 practice attempts to solve a problem. My problem is execution. I ace the homework without notes because I get multiple attempts, and immediately realize the issue when answer is wrong. But when I get to the exams, I overlook my errors and turn in wrong answers that seem completely correct to me. It's always a negative sign, or an incorrect antiderivative, or something that muddles every correct step before it.\n\nI'm tired of practicing problems. I'm tired of sitting through YouTube professors and Khan Academy tutorials. I'm tired of going to office hours over the same issues. I'm so tired of calculus. I'm out of attempts with my uni, and I even failed it at my community college in the summer. And I'm tearing my hair out because in my professional field, the only calc concept with practical application is derivatives. Even during my one year internship, I did hundreds of calculations for a project and derivatives were the only thing I used from calc. \n\nCurrently my only way out is passing my CLEP exam next week. But if I fail that too, I'm out of loops. I'm going to meet my academic advisor soon, but I'm pretty sure she'll tell me the same thing. This practically irrelevant class is throwing four and a half years of work out the window like a bucket of dirty water. I don't know how to tell my mom. I don't know how to tell my brother. I don't even know what I'm going to do when next semester ends. I feel like trash, and I fucking haaaaate calculus.",

      "text": "Agree with the other opinions here, you should really go back to the foundations and look at algebra. Start there and build your way back up to precalculus and then tackle calculus, because what you\u2019re using in that class and where you\u2019re most likely making mistakes is with the rules and operations of previous classes. As well, you may want to find out if you have anxiety related to test-taking. Many professors would be more than willing to accommodate if you just explain your situation. Good luck",

          "text": "I can't lie, I've heard that suggestion so many times over the years and it's exhausted. I've been taking Khan Academy courses on Alg I and II alongside my college Calc for at least three semesters and I recognize the issues but they aren't improving. I'm aware that my issues lie back in simplification, trig, and inequalities, and I've worked on them over and over. But when I make those mistakes in real time, I don't catch them because I think I'm doing it right. I genuinely can't return to algebra anymore than I have, and I think I'm worse at it now than I was in hs. So I'm just destined to be fundamentally bad at calc?",

          "text": "I still don't have the fourth quarter of the unit circle memorized. I lose track of and confuse trig identities, derivatives, and antiderivatives. Sometimes I forget a step in chain derivatives or distribute things incorrectly and end up with an answer that is correct but not simplified right. I'm garbage at integrals and antiderivatives. Problems like \"area under the curve\" and \"rate at which fluid leaks from a container\" boggle me. I often forget when there's a negative attached to a number and don't carry it over. And sometimes with the dot product, I often add numbers when I'm meant to multiply them because of some disconnect between the math I do on paper and my mental math.\n\nEdit: Also tangent lines. There's so many set ups for tangent line problems, and I can do ones where it's like \"find the tangent where x=...\" or \"tangent parallel to the vector...\" but as we have to do more, I get the methods confused and get stuck.",

      "text": "Everyone here is giving great advice. I would personally suggest you write out the steps for each type of problem you do in class. This has been a life saver for me in almost all my math classes. Really understanding the steps in necessary in order to know what you are doing. You should also write sample problems next to the steps to see exactly what is being explained. If there are multiple variations of the same problems, write that out too.",

However, I got A's on all my calculus w/ studying less than 2hours/week. I wouldn't stop you if you like studying mathematics and solving hard problems. But there are a lot more things out there and I don't want you to suffer from studying something that makes you unhappy. It may sound harsh or not be the advice that you wanted to hear, but you can accept who you are as is, you may not excel in calculus but you may be talented in some field that you've never tried to study?",
