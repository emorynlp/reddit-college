      "text": "Learning itself is a financial incentive if you know how to apply the knowledge. A lot of students don't get a traditional job after college and go do something else.\n\nPublic speaking, personal finance, or car repair. You can take a class on these things and there will be a financial incentive even if you don't get a job.\n\nAs long as you are learning and maturing, I find it hard to see how there is no financial incentive. Whether the residual financial incentive is worth it once you remove the intention of going in order to get a job is another question.\n\nFor it to be worth it, I think you would have to be pretty mature and definitely someone who is driven with a big picture mindset. It would be for deciding your next phase of life or finding something new to put effort towards. This is mostly older people or students who have already gone through college, not the average 18-year-old enrollee. You would be at a point where the cost was more managable due to your career and you saw it as a self-development investment.",
