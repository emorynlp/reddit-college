  "text": "I've failed basically everything I've ever touched in this class. I don't think I passed a single assignment. Apparently the final grades will be curved, but I don't know how much. He told one student a 50/100 on the midterm exam wasn't even failing, even though the average was an 83. I got a 42 on that exam. I don't expect to get a better grade on the final (already taken it).\n\nIssues:  \n\n\n\\-Found the course ridiculously challenging, admittedly  \n\n\n\\-Unresolved anxiety/attention issues  \n\n\n\\-General burnout  \n\n\n\\-Full course load\n\nThe latter 3 contributed to me not putting in sufficient time into doing the course work. The first maybe could've been resolved had I made friends, attended office hours, etc. but I after the first few weeks I was too ashamed to really talk to anybody so I just kept telling myself next week would be better.\n\nCan I talk to the professor at all? Is there any recourse for this? There were 3 assignments I didn't turn anything in for, but he has in the syllabus that there are no makeup homeworks or anything. And the solutions are already posted.\n\nIf I fail, how do I dust off my shoulders and move on? I have been such a shit student for the past couple semesters, I hate the feeling. I wanna have a more positive self view. My course load will be lighter next semester so I feel okay going forward. I'm spiraling about what this means for my grad school and career prospects. I am so anxious over this",

      "text": "I don\u2019t foresee any professor being inclined to help you when you\u2019ve had missing assignments and now upset about your grade. Unfortunately, I would just accept that this is the consequence and figure out what you can do better next semester. I found establishing times each week where I go to the library  (same times, same days to build routine), to be most beneficial. This helped w the attention/ anxiety stuff as well for me, bc I\u2019m not home w a bunch of distractions and I know exactly when I\u2019ll be working on things (avoiding the whole \u201cI\u2019ll get up early to do this\u201d or \u201c I\u2019ll stay up this day to do this\u201d and it getting pushed back more and more). The best way to ease your anxiety, is to just do the stuff you need to do and release its hold on your brain- though I can understand how anxiety can be debilitating a lot of times. Good luck to you!",
