  "text": "I just finished my final exam for physic 2 and I did it so miserably. I have always struggled with this class so i tried to put a lot of time to study but I guess my hard work didn\u2019t pay off. I really don\u2019t care if I have a bad grade, I just want enough to pass the class and move on but with how I performed earlier, the probability of me needing to retake the class is pretty high. My average is really basic rn, so with a bit of luck, maybe I could pull it off. I acknowledge I could have studied better than what I did bc I didn\u2019t practice doing exercises that much and just tried to read and understand the correction the teacher provided to us for the homeworks. This way of studying worked for my last exam and I thought I could do it again this time too. Anyways, this post is probably just me venting bc I\u2019m really disappointed at myself, I really despise physic and knowing I might need to redo the class is making me feel sick",
