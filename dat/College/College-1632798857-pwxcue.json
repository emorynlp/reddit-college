  "text": "How do you turn study buddies, class friends, people you are acquainted with through clubs/orgs into friends?\n\nI have realized that throughout k-12 I depended on other people to initiate and on the fact that I see the same people everyday to make friends. Now that I am in college, this is not working out so great and I don\u2019t think I know how to approach turning acquaintances into friends. I worked at a customer service job that requires Trader Joe\u2019s or Lush level friendliness so I am good at forming acquaintances but I completely struggle after that. I hate and suck it at vulnerability and struggle to behave in a way that is not \u201cscripted.\u201d \n\nAll that to say, I am not sure what is the appropriate (not weird) way to text/talk to an acquaintance or class friend about things that are not related to the class or the context in which you met them?",
