  "text": "So my college dorms are especially small. Like even smaller than most dorms. 2 twin sized beds a small desk dresser and cabinet leaves maybe like 30 square feet of space left at the most. We managed to arrange our room in a way that most of that extra spaced is centralized in a decently sized spot, but that essentially makes it so our beds are staring face to face. It does get a little awkward some times. So I was wondering if there were any easy purchases to allow for more privacy without essentially splitting the room completely in half.",

Use it for studying, napping or just to get away. Saw a girl make an amazing one. I could have moved in there.",
