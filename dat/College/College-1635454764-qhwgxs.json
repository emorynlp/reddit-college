  "text": "Honestly, for the past three weeks, I've had three different colds, all extremely severe in my opinion. I can't look at a screen without my eyes burning, my head pounding and I physically can't breathe through my nose.\n\nI had a cold one week, then it disappeared for the weekend and then my dad came in from work with the cold and i caught it from him. Cue having the cold again for ANOTHER week. I was fine at the weekend yet again and then I had to go to a nursery for my teaching placement.\n\nOver 20 toddlers had the cold and I caught it from them yet again. I've been absolutely drained and pretty much bedridden with the cold again and my lecturers are on my case, sending me emails asking me why I've been lacking in my work recently. I explained that I've been ill for the past 3 weeks and she said It sounded like an excuse and I'm clearly faking it. \n\nThe worst thing is that i can't even medically prove it because due to covid, doctors aren't giving out medical letters for the 'simple cold' and I can't step inside the building because the cold symptoms sound like covid symptoms and they basically turn you away.\n\nI've done lots of covid tests and they've all been negative.\n\nWhat can I do? My lecturer is pissed off at me and keeps calling me a liar and that I'm making up excuses.",

      "text": "I would try my best to get a doctors note and some medicine especially if you're down this badly. Amoxicillin/Penicillin should work and for me it helps a lot if it's a virus. My health center doesn't give out doctors notes, but my prof accepted a picture of my antibiotics with the date they were given in frame. Did you let the prof know when you got sick each time? Many profs if you do this they are very accepting. If it's after you got sick for 3 weeks and you are just now notifying them they can be not as accepting. This is because it comes off as if you were slacking and need an excuse and time to catch up. I would tell them again that you are sick and due to uni policy you are unable to enter the building and explain due to hospital/doctor protocol you are unable to receive a note. Is there another form of proof that will be accepted. If this does not work I would go above them.",

          "text": "There's absolutely no need to use Penicillins for a cold. First off, they're antibiotics, *not* antivirals. Taking them for a virus will do absolutely nothing to help it, as antibacterials only treat *bacterial* infections. Second, antibacterials that strong are reserved for conditions that don't respond adequately to other treatments. Penicillins are not first line medications because they're most often unnecessarily strong, and can have serious long-term effects on immune strength. There are many antivirals that are *far* better suited and actually appropriate for the treatment of viruses, but antibacterials and antivirals should not be prescribed unless necessary. If you have a healthy immune system, you can fight off the *vast* majority of these infections yourself. Antibacterials and antivirals can cause serious issues with immune health in the long term when over prescribed, let alone the *many* unwanted side effects that they can have.\n\nAs somebody who is immunosuppressed and *has* to take antibiotics or antivirals for infections, take it from me that the long-term side effects are not worth the moderately shorter recovery of a healthy adult that's capable of fighting off the infection themselves. I'd much rather be sick for a short time like I was before I had to start taking immunosuppressants than deal with the necessity of antibiotics or antivirals when I get an infection now.",
