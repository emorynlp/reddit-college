  "title:": "How many times is too many times to switch majors?",
  "text": "Hi,\nI have almost no idea of what I want to do with my life. I have switched majors almost once every semester and am now a senior. I have to take an extra semester anyway with the major I\u2019m in now and I\u2019m debating to switch back to my last major because I hate my current one. It would take about the same amount of time to finish but I feel ridiculous constantly switching back and forth and am a little worried about how it will affect my financial aid. Does anyone have any advice? Have any of you switched majors several times? If so how many? Am I being ridiculous? Should I just stick it out? I\u2019m very bad at my current major and I don\u2019t want to just scrape by and end up in a job I\u2019m completely unqualified for.",

      "text": "I\u2019d recommend is exploring career options in various departments, that way you get an idea of what they do and you can get paid at the same time. (Like being a research assistant) Some people I know just get what they\u2019re closest to finishing and go from there so they at least have a degree for higher paying jobs. Most importantly, do what you like and are interested in. Best of luck!",

Most people don\u2019t work in the fields they major in any way.",
