  "text": "I'm starting to crack down on my isomnia that has been persistent for a year now. There's a lot of various factors that cause it such as working a night shift and late night assignments but now im starting to believe my bed is an issue as well.\n\nMy bed is hard, broken, and causes me pain every now and then in my shoulder, back, and knee. I say its broken because the center pole collapsed and its now a v shape. I wake up in the middle of the night too.\n\nI saved up $4k for college, this money is only for college. Should I dip into the savings and take out $500 for a new bed frame and mattress? Would buying a new bed frame and mattress be a \"college essential\" purchase? Thanks!",

I've been on all of the sleep meds and honestly finding ways to change your behavior and routine can be as or more useful long term, or at least it has been for me.\n\nIf you do buy a mattress, though, make sure it's the right one for you. I bought a soft mattress when I moved into my place and am now constantly alternating between sleeping in bed and on my hard ass couch. It's a real momma bear poppa bear situation. I definitely wish that I had chosen more carefully",

I buy for value and settled on the IKEA Haugsv\u00e4r, they come in multiple sizes and the material is good quality. You can buy a frame if you want. One of my favorite things to do is just making the frame myself with 1\u00d78 lumber (plus slats) and painting it.",

Your sleep quality is extremely important because this is the time where your brain \"repairs\" itself. \n\nSpeaking from experience, I'd also like to throw in that sleep deprivation can give you health complications that can still fuck you up years after you're done with college. I don't care what hours you choose to sleep, just make sure you get enough hours. There is no merit in \"powering through\" college by not getting enough sleep.",
