  "text": "The original source for this video was a PBS special and it was reuploaded to YT by some random dude. My professor linked this video but I'm trying to intext cite this video and it feels weird to cite this YouTuber. Is it still the same thing as any other video citation? I saw something else but most other websites just say to cite the YTer.",
