  "text": "Hey guys, I go to a small rural liberal arts college- and I want to throw a fairly large party for my birthday which is coming up after winter break. The dorm rooms here aren't big enough to throw a party in, so I was wondering if you guys had any ideas. The most obvious option would be throwing it in an AirBNB next to campus, but I feel like that has some snags. Let me know what you guys think!",
