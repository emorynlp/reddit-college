  "text": "TItle is pretty self explanatory I just transferred to a new school into a harder degree and am failing almost all of my courses. I haven't been going to class at all and am going to receive 3 F's. My GPA was already kinda bad due to the covid semester and now it's plummeting even more. I'm absolutely horrified to tell my parents and feel like a huge piece of shit. I have no idea what this means for me going forward in school or even if I will continue. This semester has been really bad for my mental health, but I feel like my parents won't really buy that (I don't even know if I buy that tbh) just feel kinda worthless overall and really unsure of the steps forward.",

      "text": "as much as its probably gonna suck, you should really tell your parents about this cause if you hide it they\u2019ll just get even more upset.\n\nas for the classes, i dunno if your school offers tutoring but i\u2019ve found that it\u2019s helped me a bit. if your professors offer extra credit too then ask them. don\u2019t be afraid to ask them questions about the class matters either, they\u2019re there to help you.\n\nalso, dont be afraid to take a semester break from college if you need to. if your mental health is goin downhill that bad, then it may be worth it to take a break. you can also look and see if your college offers mental health counseling. not all of them, do but the schools ive been to have it for free.\n\noverall, make sure youre takin care of yourself man. i know how it feels to be stuck in that kinda mental rut, and it sucks. your grades can wait, your mental health cant. i hope it works out for you, and if you wanna ask about anymore advice feel free to shoot me a dm or somethin",

      "text": "You will be okay. This kind of stuff happens to a lot of people, especially in a new environment. If it\u2019s not too late Withdraw from the courses you are currently failing - a W looks much better on a transcript than an F. It\u2019s absolutely a personal choice whether or not you tell your parents, most of the time, they aren\u2019t able to see your grades anyway unless you specifically allow it with your school. If you choose to tell them, just tell them the truth and explain how difficult it has been. If you don\u2019t want to tell them, then just say you\u2019ve dropped classes because you didn\u2019t feel like you were absorbing the information you needed to. Tutoring is definitely helpful, also contacting professors and letting them know your situation is never a bad idea. You\u2019d be surprised how lenient professors and Dean\u2019s can be - especially when it comes to mental health. See if your campus has any study groups, or free tutoring for the class. It would also be a good idea to evaluate your choice in major, I was failing classes left and right with my first major until I was finally able to figure out it wasn\u2019t right for me. Once I switched majors, I haven\u2019t gotten a bad grade since. You can take a semester off to work and figure out exactly what you want to do, or even just take a couple classes to stay in the rhythm. Everyone has their own way of learning and figuring out life, especially in college. Don\u2019t feel bad or sell yourself short, college is no walk in the park and doesn\u2019t come naturally to most people. Allow yourself some leeway and don\u2019t beat yourself up over grades! If you want to talk more, don\u2019t hesitate to message me. I\u2019ve had a lot of friends with different college experiences, and I\u2019ve had a lot of trial and error and figuring things out - but I\u2019m in my final year and have learned that figuring things out and failures have only helped me in the long run.",
