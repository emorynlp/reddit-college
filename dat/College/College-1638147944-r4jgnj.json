  "text": "Basically what the title says. I just graduated with a degree in exercise science but am planning to go to school for an accelerated nursing degree. I have almost all the requirements except for 2 courses that I wish to take in an accelerated format online.\n\nWhere should I look to know that my credits will \"count\" and I can complete these courses in 8 weeks or less? There is a lot of crap out there and I didn't expect it to be this hard weeding through it all....",

The summer term itself will vary so you'll need to search around but most are early June-July and/or late June-early August",

I don't think there are CLEP courses for them, so I would say they're somewhere in the middle..\n\nWaiting for summer would really set back my plans so I'm hoping to find another option.",
