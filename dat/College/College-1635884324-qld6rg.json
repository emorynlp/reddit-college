  "text": "Is it really for the better good or is it for their own ego/satisfaction? Im in college to learn the material, prove that I know the material, and get a credit so I can graduate. Im not talking about group/discussion based classes, I understand that participation is important for that but it seems pointless for courses where you just learn a subject.",

      "text": "Participation and students saying things and asking questions let's me know as a teacher what students don't get. If I ask a question and get a wrong answer, I can be sure that it is not just one student who thinks that answer, and so it is something I need to go over again.\nIf I ask a question and get right answers, that means I can move on.\n\nIf I ask a question and no one answers, I have nothing. I can only assume either no one gets it or every one gets it and thinks the question is so basic it's a trick question.\n\nBasically participation of students is a way to evaluate comprehension and it is a way to keep students engaged (bc they might be called on)",
