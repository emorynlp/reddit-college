  "text": "I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m unable to take out a single loan for the entire year, even when I select the dates to cover that specific time. I\u2019m in community college so I use the websites own estimated cost when I attempt to do that, or even less. My issue is that they always get denied, even with a co-signer but the same amount gets approved through multiple smaller loans. For example, if I ask for 15k to cover the entire year, it gets denied with a co-signer but I can take out 3 loans of 5k with no problem. Has anyone else noticed this and if so do they have any sort of advice? (Beyond applying for scholarships because I already do that)",

      "text": "We can't tell you the answer to your specific situation but it could be related to your tuition vs. how much you are asking for. Or $15k just simply being harder to get approved for than $5k from three separate lenders. Having the co-signer doesn't automatically help because even a lot of older people can't get a $15k loan. It's hard to guess without seeing your application.\n\nYour community college is $15k/yr? Also what makes you uneligible to take out federal loans?",
