  "text": "This may be a little bit of a personal question so I don't know how many people are going to respond, but I'm just curious to see how everyone is doing. Im a freshmen and since I got to college, I've probably spent way too much money on stuff like posters(and stuff to hang them), fast food, and other stuff that has really drained me. I definitely want to get a job second semester, but I want to see if anyone is in the same boat as me",

      "text": "$4.8k in my checking account, $2.5k in cash, and $10k in my college savings account. \n\nI\u2019m privileged though. I\u2019m a freshman but don\u2019t work aside from Instacarting. My parents still fund my car insurance and living expenses as long as I\u2019m in school. \n\nI\u2019ve saved my money by rarely spending what I made my senior year and this past summer. I\u2019m also currently going to CC for free as a way to save myself two years of student debt. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to brag in any way, just retaining financial transparency. Handling your money is a matter of budgeting your needs versus your wants.  I used to spend insane amounts of money on crap I didn\u2019t need until I realized how little it benefited me in the long run. Once you escape consumerism, you\u2019ll be surprised to find how much you don\u2019t desire the things you do, or how little worth they really have.",
