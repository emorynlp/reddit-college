  "text": "A few weeks ago we had an exam. Due to a few people being sick the teacher allowed us to take the exam online or on campus. The choice was on us.\n\nSome of us took the exam on campus, i was one of them, but most took the exam online. Most of the people who took the exam online cheated. 6 of them cheated by working together in a facebook groupchat with 40 people in it.\n\nWe have a class of 25 so there were people in there that didnt either quit or were in a different year...\n\nNow someone sent screenshots of the chat to the teacher. We dont know who did it. I admit that i thought about is but a friend of mine was one of the people cheating and didnt want to sell him out. Also i would gain nothing except a target on my back. \n\nThey all were investigated and some of them got pretty low punishments, others got none. \n\nWe still dont know who sent the screenshots to the teacher but some people suspected me. They started spreading this and most of the class hates me now even tho i didnt do anything.\n\nI contacted a teacher but they cant do anything to show that i didnt do it. The only thing they can do is release the identity of the person who did but they arent allowed to do that. \n\nSo essentially i still have to study at that school for one and a half years with a bunch of people that hate me for something i didnt do. \n\nAny advice? It's the first time in my life that everything was going sort of well with my classmates and now this. I don't know what to do.",

Just maintain that you didn\u2019t do it when pressed and continue to be nice to everyone, don\u2019t start anything obviously. They are lucky that the punishments weren\u2019t worse, they should be grateful. They\u2019ll learn to not cheat in huge group chats anymore, because that\u2019s a dumb thing to do in general. It\u2019ll be okay.",

      "text": "They're probably seriously overestimating their prowess and deductive reasoning skills. They should probably spend more time studying. Also, I would probably lean into it and be like, \"those dumbasses cheated in a group chat with people they didn't know and I'm the bad guy cause I took my test on campus? The professor or TA was in the chat for all I know. They're idiots.\"  \nStory time: I was in a stats class and over 50 people got busted for sharing homework answers and doing the tests over video as a group. They were very scandalized when and went on a witch hunt (for the narc) when  everyone in the class had to log into a video call and do their homework while being watched to demonstrate that they understood the material. Eventually, it came out that one of the geniuses added the professor and his TA to the group me at the beginning of the term. That \"email class\" thing goes to everyone, including faculty. When they started conspiring and sharing video links in the group me he or a TA would  log on and watch them do the whole thing. After a week of proctoring, he failed all of them and filed official honor code complaints or whatever. They STILL DIDN'T know he was in the group me and could see them getting their story straight. When they had to go before the school and answer for what they did, that's when they learned he found out from them directly.",

      "text": "Nothing, your classmates are dumb and salty simple as. Never do anything that could be seen as cheating in a group chat, I wouldn't trust a soul there. The fact that they thought they were safe is the dumbest thing, especially with literally leaving a digital vault (group chat) that recorded their actions. And good on you OP for not getting sucked into it.",
