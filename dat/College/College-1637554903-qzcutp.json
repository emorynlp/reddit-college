      "text": "Every week I make a new excel sheet where I write down all of the things I need to read/watch/do for school work and the work I actually need to submit. Then I organize these per day of the week and mark whenever I finish these things. If you\u2019re intimidated by following a set schedule assign yourself work day by day. My biggest struggle is dreading all the work I\u2019m going to do, but if you have everything you need to do set out in front of you it helps out a lot. Also, whenever you\u2019re doing work or studying, put all of your focus on working for 25mins and take a 5min break. This routine helps me stay on task and look forward to something without getting distracted easily/for too long.",

For me, I would insert my hobbies in between the day so I'll think I have lesser time in studying. Then, I'd be more eager to study and do my tasks. It works for me.",

Although, there's a lot of information in there. \n\nThe first sentence is interesting. You need to figure out a way to tell yourself that it's more useful to do things early than wait and inevitably hate it. Get it done now so you can relax and be proud of yourself. \n\nMy only tip is that right now, get caught up with all assignments due in the next two days. Stay that way.",
