That class was so difficult for me (due to my undiagnosed ADHD because I studied so hard) and they do not offer it for the summer terms and I already planned my schedule for the spring. Should I just take principle of physics over the summer, since they offer that over the summer?",

              "text": "Definitely a good question for your advisor then! If it isn't required for your degree or for applying to professional schools, then you should be able to take whichever one you want. Just be sure it counts for whatever you need it to count for (physical science core elective, etc.).\n\nEdit: Sorry, just noticed you did mention med school. The other thing to check on is what type of course \"principles of physics\" at your school is. If it's more a general studies course, med schools won't like that. You'll need to take a physics sequence that STEM majors take.",
