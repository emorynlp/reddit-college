  "text": "And I'm kind of freaking out a little about it. I currently have a C in one of my classes, business law (not going into law). So, if I get a C or worse on the exam, does that mean my grade will go down? I've studied a little but it's hard because I don't have as much time to study when I work 8 or sometimes 9 hour shifts at work and I also need money. I don't want to retake this class because next semester is my last semester before I graduate. Btw, the final is 20% of my grade.",

I do it all the time before the final exam. It will ask you what percent the final has on your grade as well. I\u2019ll go look for it and link it for you!",
