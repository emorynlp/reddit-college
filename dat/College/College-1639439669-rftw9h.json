  "text": "I\u2019ve joined a few study groups with other people from my class for doing the homework together and studying for the exams together but Idk if they\u2019re really helpful, and also it tends to be kind of awkward (at least for me) because we don\u2019t really talk to each other in the group unless one of us has a question, then the rest just answers their question and we move on doing our own things at our own pace in silence. I guess it\u2019s good for motivating me to study because otherwise I\u2019d just procrastinate if I\u2019m studying alone. Are other people\u2019s study groups like this?",

      "text": "Uhm i feel like the only good time to study in a group is like a day before the exam, or like a few hours before. You could ask each other questions which weren't too clear to you or you could listen to the struggles they've had through studying. But if you're thinking of studying with them without having studied the subject before, that's a bad idea.",

      "text": "my friend and i study together a lot; we usually do anki questions together, go through our notes and quiz each other, or give ourselves a question and write out the answer (ex. a life cycle) alone, then look at the actual answer and go over it. it\u2019s harder in larger study groups with lots of people who might not be friends though, bc typically one person has to really lead the whole thing/have ideas on what to do as a group, and a lot of the time 1-3 people will know everything while the others don\u2019t get a chance to answer any questions",

      "text": "Study groups are only useful if you find them useful. If you\u2019re better alone or one on one with a tutor then that\u2019s totally fine. Now if you\u2019re still motivated to try then I definitely recommend studying with people that are at least friendly acquaintances with you. Finding some things to banter about and bounce questions back and forth without awkward tension is the goal. If you can\u2019t find that then either you\u2019re with the wrong people, study groups don\u2019t work for you, or maybe the class isn\u2019t designed in a way for it to work that well. If I were you I\u2019d experiment and try different groups to see how it feels.",
