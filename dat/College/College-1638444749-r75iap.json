  "text": "Hey guys I'm a second year student in a lac and got caught paraphrasing another students work -- was under panic attacks and anxiety episodes at the time -- and yes I realise this  justify copying shit off of others work and I was stupid and dumb. \n\nHonestly, I'm more than willing to accept whatever consequences I'll be receiving like getting an F on an assignment or the course, but I was preparing to transfer next year to another college. It was supposed to be guaranteed admissions with a certain number of gpa and credits but says 'only reason the why the student wouldn't be accepted with the conditions met are felony or serious academic dishonesty.\" \n\nSo I guess this is my question. What does 'serious academic dishonesty' mean? Will this ruin my chances of transferring?",

      "text": "Really depends on how the professor is handling the situation. If you're just getting an F on the assignment then it's being kept within the course and no official paperwork is filed. If you get an F in the course they have to file an academic misconduct report and that is a big deal.",

I didn\u2019t get a F but I do think it\u2019s gonna go up on the conduct record and not really sure how severe the consequences are gonna be. If this is just a minor issue and isn\u2019t going to jeopardise my transfer then I\u2019ll just own up to it and move on but idk man",

              "text": "Whether or not you own up to it has no effect on the severity of the punishment. If the school decides to make this a serious charge, it will do so regardless of your confession. The only thing I've seen save a student from getting a mark on the record was voluntarily withdrawing from the class and sometimes the school.",

      "text": "I\u2019d recommend asking this in r/AskProfessors. Imo this would count as serious academic dishonesty and would probably bar you from transferring, but it might depend on what the punishment/consequences are of what you did. Are they giving you an automatic zero in the course or just on the assignment?",
