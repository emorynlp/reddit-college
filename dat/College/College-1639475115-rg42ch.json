      "text": "Depends on the class, financial and managerial can be pretty easy depending on prior knowledge. It\u2019s cost and intermediate accounting that most struggle with. Both are weed out courses and are often taken right after the easier Financial and managerial classes. As a result, students don\u2019t realize they need to study and end up failing.",

      "text": "I earned my BS in accounting last spring. Financial 101 and managerial 101 came easy to me. So much so, that the Professor encouraged me to change my major from business to accounting as I was naturally good at it and enjoyed it. I studied a little for the 101 courses and had no issues getting very high As. Intermediate 1 & 2 is where it gets hard. Classes like fed taxes, forensics, auditing, and advanced accounting were relatively easy for me. \n\nSo to answer your question, 101 finance and 101 managerial are easy if you\u2019re willing to learn and put in some effort.",
