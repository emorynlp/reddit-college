      "text": "Depends on the class, financial and managerial can be pretty easy depending on prior knowledge. It\u2019s cost and intermediate accounting that most struggle with. Both are weed out courses and are often taken right after the easier Financial and managerial classes. As a result, students don\u2019t realize they need to study and end up failing.",

      "text": "I earned my BS in accounting last spring. Financial 101 and managerial 101 came easy to me. So much so, that the Professor encouraged me to change my major from business to accounting as I was naturally good at it and enjoyed it. I studied a little for the 101 courses and had no issues getting very high As. Intermediate 1 & 2 is where it gets hard. Classes like fed taxes, forensics, auditing, and advanced accounting were relatively easy for me. \n\nSo to answer your question, 101 finance and 101 managerial are easy if you\u2019re willing to learn and put in some effort.",

      "text": "I just graduated with my accounting degree. Accounting isn\u2019t the easy but it does get \u201ceasier\u201d. \n\nPeople think they can get by with memorization or minimal studying but you can\u2019t. There\u2019s lots of rules and applications that you need to fully understand before solving any problems.\n\nYour first two accounting classes (financial 1 & 2) should be fairly easy* but when you get to intermediate 1, that\u2019s when it\u2019s challenging. It\u2019s known as the \u201cweed out\u201d course and this is where most people drop or change majors ( I almost did).  There\u2019s just a lot of information to process in so little time. So it\u2019s very important to create good study techniques! Cost was challenging (lucked out with an amazing professor) and audit was not my favorite because of the course structure at my university. \n\nAccounting is doable but compared to all other business majors, you\u2019re going to have to put more effort into studying.",

I\u2019m a business major so the concepts came easily to me, but the actual spreadsheets with debits and credits.. not at all. I was so lost. I somehow got an A though so there\u2019s that",
