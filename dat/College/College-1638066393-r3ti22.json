  "text": "I dread getting class retakes since I've had one too many. I have lupus and lately the flares have been more frequent sending me in and out of the hospital multiple times. I have a slightly busy schedule at work as well thus keeping my class deadlines has been such a nightmare... Now, I randomly clicked on some links online which led me to successessays.com, and immediately someone from their end chatted with me and convinced me to use their service. After I shared my story they recommended me to use a tutor to do my whole class, CNL 518. It may not sound okay to do this but I really needed help which they gladly offered. This marked the end of my struggle and I am so grateful. Sometimes it is alright to use these services no matter what the society thinks. My \u270ccents...",

      "text": "Aww OP I feel you!! My health has really declined this term and I\u2019m currently in my senior year, which makes things a lot more terrible for me considering the amount of workload I have. \nI\u2019ve had no choice but to file for extension requests for a number of my assignments, just to prolong my deadlines as I was cooped up in the hospital for so long. I also took time out from lectures and seminars and my doctor issued me an MC. \n\nIs there a process whereby you can file for extenuating circumstances? I\u2019m pretty sure most colleges have it. \nIt would be so much better for you to delay your assignments and take time off school to relax than to engage a company/person to do your work for you!! \n\nIt\u2019s no judgment on my part, I completely understand needing a break, but it\u2019s just a question of - is it really worth the risk?? \nI know it\u2019s tempting, but a lot of these companies probably plagiarise others\u2019 content and they may not know how to reference correctly or format a bibliography, which may cost you more marks. \n\nFurthermore your work will probably be scanned via TurnItIn to check for plagiarism. \n\nSomeone tried to do this in my course and got busted bc the company basically plagiarized someone else\u2019s essay. You\u2019d have to be very sneaky though.",

      "text": "I think you are doing too much. I would lower your class load next semester and see if you can lower the hours you work. Your increased stress levels could be contributing to the flares and make them happen more often, making life more stressful (it is a cycle). Is there a way you can take college slower? Take fewer credit hours per semester that is still cost-effective? \n\nAnd please please do not use a writing service for your classes. I guarantee you that will lead to you failing the class and getting disciplinary action. You will seriously regret it. It will impact your life in ways you don\u2019t realize if your professor finds you did this. It isn\u2019t worth it. It is better to turn it a quickly written essay or get an extension than doing that.  Colleges take plagiarism very seriously. \nYou are also not learning anything if someone takes your class for you. What\u2019s the point of college if you don\u2019t do the work and learn? That\u2019s where you develop skills for work after college in the field that you want.",
