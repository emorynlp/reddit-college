  "text": "So I'm in first year of a double-diploma (idk how it's called in eglish) of History/Italian, and before that I repeated first year of \"Economical Management\" (pretty sure it's not the right name) for 2 years in another college. \n\nI have absolutely NO motivation whatsoever, and I don't know what I would rather do if I dropped out. As the title says, I'm 2 months behind, I did nothing, missed a lot of classes (I'm pretty sure I'll get a 0 in three or four classes that I skipped too much), missed a couple of assignments, didn't read any of the books I have to read. \n\n TLDR : Didn't do shit for 2 months, don't even have the material to study, huge piece of shit, thanks.",

      "text": "I wish I could help you out. I'm kinda in a similar boat. I've shown up to most of my classes, but I haven't done most of my readings. I've taken zeroes on a lot of small assignments, and on a few larger ones too. I want to do well--every week I say that I'm gonna put in the work and turn things around, because I know I have it in me. But then I procrastinate and just don't have the motivation to do stuff. Almost all of my assignments that I have handed in have been handed in late. \n\nI'm gonna see a counselor I think, because while I feel fine mentally, I don't have much motivation. You might not be able to turn this semester around, but maybe you can talk to someone to help ensure your next semester goes well.",
