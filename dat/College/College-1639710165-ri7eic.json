Needless to say it broke me, tanked my gpa, put me on probation n all other crap- all of this during covid when we were living online..\n\nI understood that I lacked the basic foundational skills that were needed for that class, and the instructor was very VERY strict too. \nSo, I took the preceding class, offered by the same professor- did well in it and gained the needed foundation- went over the contents of the class that I failed, which I then understood better- took a higher level statistics course- did really well in it and waiting for my final grade rn\u2026. \n\nIt was all about being determined, understanding why whatever has happened, and correct yourself while overcoming the crushing imposter feeling you\u2019d have. Build a peer network that are on the same path as you and can lift you up when you need the most.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s not the end of the world.",
