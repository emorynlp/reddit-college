  "text": "I have a certain classmate who is extremely stuck up, she'll brag about absolutely anything from texting a teacher to getting a good grade (fyi, I'm in a field where grades really don't matter and I score decently but she's a bit of a scumbag who asks everyone on purpose for their report card knowing she's done the best). She's absolutely unbearable, but also good at what she does. How on earth do I deal with someone like this.",
