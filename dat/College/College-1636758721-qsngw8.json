  "text": "Before you started your first year at college, you had an idea of what you wanted to major in. But did you stick with that or did you change (and why)? I\u2019m still a senior in hs and want to go to college but I\u2019m still having a hard time figuring out what I really want to study.",

      "text": "Stuck with it, then added a second major because I realized I wanted more of the second major but was close enough to finish the first major. If you change your mind later, you can often turn whatever you started with into a minor or second major. Depending on where you go, most of the stuff you take first-year counts towards most degrees, so I wouldn't worry about it too much until after your first year.",
