  "text": "Hi. First of all, I'd like to say that this might be a no-brainer for quite a lot of you, but I am having a hard time deciding.\n\nI am an international student who will start university in the US next fall, and I am currently stuck between two different universities; University of North Dakota & Arizona State University.\n\nASU has been my dream school for quite some time, I really like the urban setting as well as the large student body and beautiful weather. I will be a transfer student and I am planning on finishing my major in 3/3,5 years. Tuition is $31,200 a year, without accounting for scholarships that I plan on getting.\n\nUND is partner to the international college I currently go to, which gives me the possibility of getting in-state tuition ($11,100 a year), and I will be able to finish my bachelor in 2/3 years.\n\nLooking at it economically, UND is the clear winner here. But then I let my feelings get in the way. I've dreamt about Arizona since I was around 14, and it is where I would like to spend the rest of my life, I am just not sure if the cost difference is worth it.\n\nHow much would this potentially change my college years, and would it be worth it or not. I will be having student loans regardless of which school I pick, but my homecountry has a pretty goot student loan and scholarship system so it won't be much of an issue.\n\nAm I just being picky, or am I right to listen to my feeling in this situation?",

      "text": "I would caution you that \"dream\" schools, sometimes aren't what they seem, and it's hard to know what you truly would like until you're there. Urban setting? Great in your home country, but terrifying in a foreign country? Big student body a plus where you're from, but feel lost in the crowd here? And  Mesa is beautiful in February when I've visited a few times, but summers are killer.\n\nAlso, if you plan to finish a degree program in 3-3.5 years rather than 4-5 like most students, you probably are going to be pretty focused on your studies, so the college atmosphere may not matter as much, and saving yourself 60-70k sounds like a much more sure thing.\n\nSincerely, a stick in the mud (and someone who transferred away from their first college choice that wooed them during Senior year).",

          "text": "Thank you for the response. \n\nDue to UND being a partner school of my current college, and our school of record. This year + some of my high school classes from last year will count towarss my major. I would therefore be avle to finish in 2 to 3 years. And as I would like to get a masters as well, I would most likely be able to have that by the time I would finish my bachelor anywhere else. So my plan is to maybe just got to UND for say 2,5 years, then get my masters somewhere else. \nIt kinda sucks to have to make a choice, as I would really like to go to Arizona, but economically and timewise UND is a lot better of an option, then I can take my masters in Arizona or somewhere more urban.",
