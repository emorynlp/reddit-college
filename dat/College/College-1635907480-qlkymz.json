  "text": "So, hopefully I am in the right place to ask this but maybe someone can relate and maybe get advice.\n\nBackground about me: 24 years old, just finished a two year technical degree in Health information management decided to come back to school this quarter because I was two quarters from finishing a general associates so why not have two? \n\nI live with my wife who speaks fluent Spanish, and her mom and dad only speak Spanish. I am constantly around Spanish IE all Spanish church, go to plenty events. Etc. (Been with her for 4 years, have not missed a church day in long time). \n\nThe dilemma:\n\nThis Spanish class I am taking I am getting a lot of conflicting comments from my professor. She thinks I am getting all my help from my wife and when I write sentences in Spanish she thinks I just translate all of them. My problem is well I understand Spanish very well, I usually get the jist of a normal conversation by listening in. My problem is when trying to speak on the fly I still have a hard time. When writing I have more time to think and I can pick up on what to write. I guess my question is for those related to native speakers of other languages have you been in a similar situation? I\u2019m not saying my Spanish is perfect and I definitely need practice pronunciation but when it comes to understanding I am very good and catch myself responding in English because I still don\u2019t have enough confidence to speak.\n\nThanks for reading, and hope you all are navigating well through your own studies!",
