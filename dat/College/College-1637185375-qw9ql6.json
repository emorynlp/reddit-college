  "text": "would it be possible if I become a nanny instead of paying the 11k to live in dorms, at least for my first year. I'd prefer dorms because I think I'd get more out of living on campus, but its so expensive.\n\nbeing a nanny not only would provide me with somewhere to live, but I'm getting paid to live there and then I could time my classes around the kids schedules. \n\ntheres obviously some risks like what do I do if I get let go or fired, and is it really the best idea for me to be able to stay focused on school work, etc. but I wanna know what you guys think.",

      "text": "well you're also assuming the school you go to will be located in or near a community affluent enough to have a market for live-in nannies. Also keep in mind often live-in nannies are also expected to do housework in addition to caring for children. Tbh I think it would be hard to juggle a basically full time job with full time classes - since you'd have to perform enough labor in a month to make up for rent and more.",

But if you think you can handle it (though I honestly imagine that would be an incredibly overwhelming adjustment and load of responsibilities for a freshman) and you can find someone willing to hire you then go for it I guess. However, make sure your school doesn\u2019t require freshman to live on campus. My school does and I know many other that also do that.",
