  "text": "I got caught cheating at a Junior College. Hi Reddit, I need help/comfort. I got caught cheating on my math exam this morning. I used YouTube tutorials to study a type of problem, and it\u2019s in my notes, but she says I can\u2019t explain to her what I did well enough because it wasn\u2019t the way she taught us. So she said she\u2019ll give me a 0 for the exam. Her syllabus says she\u2019ll also report the name and incident to student affairs. The second time cheating (which I don\u2019t fall under the category of) she\u2019ll F you and refer you to the affairs center for disciplinary action. Will I be ok? I\u2019m only a freshmen. I\u2019m so scared.",

This is equivalent to saying you cheated on an exam because you memorized the lecture notes and executed them on your exam. Did your professor ask you to explain the response to you answer on the test? If no, then there should be no reason why they would even take points off if the answer was correct unless they specified that you must use the same method that you were taught. If the professor gives you a zero I would first talk to them about it, if they ain\u2019t budging, I would go to their higher up",

This is what every lecturer in every subject does because it's fair to assume since students are using something that has being taught in the lecture.\n\nBut if the student has written something that was never taught in the lecture, well, wouldn't this surprise the lecturer? This would make OP stand out from the rest.\n\nThink in the lecturer's perspective. If you were a lecturer and you saw a method/technique/tool being used that was never taught in the lecture, wouldn't you as a lecturer question OP's understanding? Maybe OP cheated by using a phone/other electronic device during the exam? (I know OP didn't cheat but these are concerns that the lecturer will have). And this is the lecturer's responsibility; that is, to check for OP's academic integrity.\n\nAnd due to that, the lecturer has the right to question OP's understanding to know whether OP cheated or not OR if OP understands the solution to be awarded marks. It's simply the job of a lecturer.\n\nI mean, students should know that using a method/technique/tool that was not taught in the lecture is a risk unless the question specifically gives the freedom to use any method/technique/tool. If the question doesn't specifically say that, then using the methods/technique/tool used in the lecture is the safest bet as the lecturer assumes you understand it. Otherwise, be prepared to demonstrate your understanding.\n\nIt's OP responsibility to demonstrate understanding when using a method/technique/tool that was not taught in the lecture because if you don't, then are you really learning and what did you learn then? So, why would OP get marks for something OP doesn't understand?\n\nI am willing to bet OP is not the only one who have used a different method/technique/tool unless the class is very small and the lecturer should be questioning all those students who have used methods/techniques/tools that were not taught in the lecture.\n\nThat's what happens at my Uni and so should in every Uni for better learning outcomes. There are countless times when students have been interrogated/questioned to check for understanding/to check if the student has breached academic integrity. The Uni has a reputation to save as well and so, only want to reward the hardworking students who demonstrate understanding and that's fair enough, isn't it?",

OP should know why the Pythagorean theorem is being used.\n\nFor instance, if OP has used the quadratic formula, then OP should be able to explain why it is being used. What is its significance? What useful information does the quadratic formula give you?\n\nIt could be as simple as \"I used the quadratic formula to find the x coordinate because I need the x coordinate to compute the distance\".

If there's something that you do in your head make sure that you write it out or verbally explain it to her. Just because you arrived at the answer in a different way doesn't mean that you cheated. It's no different than driving a different route than someone else and still arriving at the same location. \n\nIf she insists on giving you a 0 and reporting you then you should not only appeal her report but go to the Dean (manager) if the department to discuss it. This is a serious accusation and you need to fight it. \n\nMake sure that you are communicating with her via email and/or a messaging app approved by the school (Blackboard is common in the US). If you do interact with her in person make sure that you take tons of notes about what she said. \n\nI recommend typing it in an email and when you've entered all info send it to yourself. Keep that email handy and if another in person encounter about this issue happens make sure to reply to that email with the new info and hit send. This will create a pattern of behavior and create a timeline that you can use to prove what had been said. This is a good habit to get into for future encounters that you may need to reference in regards to work, parenting, anything that can come back to bite you in the butt. \n\nGood luck!",

From the prof\u2019s perspective what you did is akin to plagiarism. It\u2019s like you copied someone else\u2019s idea without understanding it or attributing your source (you did tell her where it came from, but you didn\u2019t really know what was going on). You have some reasonable explanations you can give here that will help you. I think showing your YouTube viewing history and when you watched the vid prior to the exam will definitely help. It would also really help if you took notes on the vid and especially if you did some practice problems you did with that method prior to the test. Did you practice using the YT method? Showing and explaining your attempts at learning are going to be your best way forward here. \n\n\nI teach college freshman level math and will explain a bit how I would view this situation. To me, it is a HUGE red flag if a student uses a different method of solving problems than I have taught and then cannot explain what they did. The most common reason for this is the student has used photomath or a similar program and has just copied a solution they don\u2019t understand at all. That is worth no credit in my book. If you can SHOW me that you were trying to learn and just didn\u2019t quite get it, that makes a HUGE difference in my perception. You need to meet ASAP with your prof, in person if possible. You need to come with evidence of your exam preparation. You need to be apologetic and ask more about what you can do going forward than what has happened on this exam. You may well be getting a zero on this exam because you did take an idea that was not your own and try to apply it without the necessary knowledge to back it up. Say you are sorry for this. Say that you want to improve as a student and ask for help moving forward from here. This won\u2019t kill your academic career, this wasn\u2019t egregious, more like a relatively minor error in judgment from an inexperienced student. If it were me, I would take pity on you and give you an opportunity to do something about this zero. Your prof may or may not, that is at her discretion. Be kind, understanding, apologetic, and make it clear that you want to learn from this experience. It will be ok.",

                      "text": "Many (most?) students do not fully understand the scope of what constitutes academic dishonesty. I agree that OP did NOT cheat during the exam. *However*, using an idea that is not your own and that did not come from course materials without being able to explain that idea does fall within the umbrella of academic dishonesty. Whether or not you like it, the prof has a valid case here. If OP wants to fight this (worth it in my opinion, OP was not egregious and also has a valid case), they will have to go through whatever student judicial protocol there is at their school. Cheating during the exam is not the only form of cheating. Like I said above, this is similar to certain types of plagiarism, like borrowing an idea without attribution (it\u2019s not *exactly* that, but similar). \n\nFrom my own experience, I have had to go through academic dishonesty proceedings on two occasions: once when I used an idea discussed in class to make a point in a paper I wrote for that class. I expressed the idea in my own words, added other thoughts that were uniquely my own to the idea, cited my other sources (other than the class discussion) and only used it as one item of many (10 or so?) in support of my unique thesis. I was found at fault for not citing the class discussion and claiming the idea as my own. The prof could have given me a zero on the assignment but instead decided to grade it as if the offending paragraph were not included at all, and then knock it down a letter grade from there. She put me through the academic integrity process so that there would be record of it if I plagiarized again. \n\nThe second time I went through academic dishonesty proceedings, I had taken an exam where the essay topics were given to us ahead of time. In order to prepare, I memorized a short quote (like two sentences) from the relevant book including the page number and the MLA citation of the book itself so I could cite my source in this closed book, in person exam. The prof accused me of cheating because she thought I had snuck the book into the exam itself. I had taken the exam in a testing center and was able to access the video feed showing that I had not brought a book in. I also brought in my preparation notes where I showed that prior to the exam I had worked on memorizing the short passage and citation. I was found not at fault here and my full exam grade was reinstated. However the prof changed her exam instructions for the future to explicitly forbid memorizing/using direct quotations because it would raise suspicion of dishonesty. \n\n\nI think what OP did falls roughly in line with what I did myself as a student and there may be consequences for OP. They likely won\u2019t be severe. Whether or not you think this is fair is irrelevant. Academic dishonesty is quite a broad scope.",

If you know the theory applied behind it, you could reason out answers to any problem the theory applies to. So just because a problem isn't answered the way you want it, doesn't mean it's cheating. I could understand if you docked points for a wrong answer and a wrong method though. But if it's a right answer and a right method, just not done how you taught them to do it, that's just bad teaching. You're teaching them there's only one way find an answer to a problem. But if they're genuinely not cheating, but were instead smart enough to figure out a method that's easier for them, that's a good thing and you could ask them why they found it to be easier and perhaps teach the rest of the class that if it did turn out to be more efficient.\n\nI feel like there's cheating and then there's your definition of \"cheating\".

I understand that because OP couldn't explain their reasoning it might seem like they used a tool during the exam, but I also have had times where I completed a math problem but wasn't able to explain my process. Sometimes, you just work on autopilot. The other thing is that this is a college-level course, which gives you leeway in how you solve problems. High school math courses are much more strict in how you solve problems, but that's not the case for college courses. I've used Khan Academy and other sources to help me understand concepts before, and it was acceptable to my professors. OP should definitely forward the video to their professor and possibly request to do a similar math question in front of her to show that they are capable of applying it. Unless the syllabus specifically states that students are only allowed to answer questions using her methods, it doesn't make sense to impose such a heavy penalty. I can understand where you're coming from and I also think the student should ask for help so that they can improve moving forward, but I don't think it's appropriate to give the student a 0 and report them to student affairs.",

I feel like unless the student was physically caught with a prohibited tool or has similar answers or formulas as other people in the class, there's no way to definitively prove academic dishonesty. As a college professor, shouldn't your focus be on fostering the students' education, which means allowing students to explore their reasoning skills?",

Do they know without you guiding them since it's an exam so they should.\n\nWhat do each of these parts represents/where did this number here and there in your problem come from? It's ok if it's right or not right,i just want the gage what your thoughts are.  Such as  V=? C=? \n\n\nThat should jog their memory enough to snap them out of it especially if all they did was cram.\n\nThen start to ask okay so write down this part of the equation that you did on a sheet of paper . \n\nGood now see this? I have this part covered. Write down what comes next or continue doing the equation.\n\n\nIt is a lot of extra steps but In highschool that's when kids start to experience mental health issues, outside pressure , etc the most and that could be fucking them up when their teacher is doing a 1-on-1.

If one question has 7 steps to solve it, you can't point to one part and expect them to know right that second.

Something as well established as the Pythagorean Theory can have [367 proofs, at least] (https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/).  I'd bet you can spilled \"a^2 + b^2 = c^2\" pretty readily, but if you are going to fail because you thought of them as squares and triangles (Note: this description fits at least 3 of the proofs), instead of only squares, perhaps like your professor would, that'd be absurd because one is more correct than the other.\n\nEven in your example of \"derivative the long way\" is at least two ways of understanding it, with limit as x->a & limit as h->0.  As a student, don't you think you *deserve* to know both, at the minimum??",

He encouraged us to do the same because if you know what your doing and why in the problem then in his eyes there was no need to waste time repeating it when it wouldn't be something you do daily. \n\nWhat you DID do in the real world? Math on a calculator. If you knew how to do the problems in class and why you could go out anywhere , use THOSE equations ,(on the calculator) to figure shit out quick without spending 20 minutes remembering all the parts again and writing them down.",

Doing anything during the exam that gives you an unfair advantage is what cheating is whereas using before hand acquired knowledge (which is basically studying) is not cheating. She is simply upset that you used a method different than the one you were taught.\n\nLet me give an example. If you asked your dad for help, and assuming he\u2019s great at math, he showed you the way he was taught (which is different from what you were taught), she can\u2019t consider that as cheating. You simply replaced your dad with a random person on YouTube. Talk to whoever is responsible and tell them what actually happened if your teacher won\u2019t listen to you. What you did is in no way cheating. It\u2019s not even unorthodox. It\u2019s basically what the world has turned into. Teachers failing to properly teach which brings students to refer to outside help, which is completely legal and allowed.",

Then she doesn't have shit on you.\n\nIf you do get called in to any board, reference the Youtube video and explain why that method clicked with you better than the way she taught it.

Tell not only your professor but the student affairs correspondent that you did not cheat during the exam. Explain you watched the video before the exam, and that you just couldn\u2019t explain it to your professor on the spot.\n3. Make sure everything is in writing/email. \n4. Contact higher up if necessary. Some schools have like, student government services that support students falsely accused of cheating. See if your college offers something similar. \n\nI wish you the best of luck, but you are going to have to be very careful with how you word things.\n\nWith my friend, she said she \u201cforgot to cite a link she used\u201d and apologized and corrected it. Yeah the professor immediately reported her. I don\u2019t know what my friend was thinking telling her that instead of telling her the truth (she did not even use the source, it\u2019s complicated) because she thought it would be easier to just \u201cmove on from the situation\u201d.",

Don\u2019t let this count as a cheating mark on your academic records because it isn\u2019t cheating. Sure a 0 on the specific problem because you couldn\u2019t explain any part of it I can understand because it doesn\u2019t show proficiency, but that does not equate to cheating. \n\nI also don\u2019t think that it\u2019s fair she give you a 0 for the whole exam. I think it\u2019s worth asking for a retake to prove yourself. \n\nListen to everyone else\u2019s advice and get in contact with the department chair to dispute your case to make sure it isn\u2019t going to marked as cheating.",

      "text": ">Will I be ok?\n\nYes, you will be ok. This isn't the end of the world. You are not going to die due to anything that comes from this. Yes, it might feel like you will die, but many things in life are that way. There are literally people dying in the world right now that would gladly exchange places with you.\n\nThat said, in the absolute worst-case scenario, I believe you could start over at another college. I am not saying this is great or preferable, but I'm saying I think it is possible to go to another college and just don't let them know about this college. Effectively, the world would not know you ever went to this college. \n\nWhen I was at university, the only way a university knew anything about you is through sending them transcripts. So, if you don't send them transcripts from place X, they won't know you went to place X.\n\nOn another subject, if I were you, I'd fight this to the death. I'd write then call the dean. I'd threaten with lawyers. I'd consult with lawyers. I'd scream, I'd yell. Using another method via YouTube and then not being able to explain it isn't cheating. At worst, it's social anxiety. At least, the story you told doesn't have any sign of cheating in it. Showing the \"powers that be\" the YouTube video and then showing them how the notes/work on the exam reflects that should be enough to prove you didn't cheat.\n\nOk freshmen person, you ready for a life lesson? The squeaky wheel gets the grease. The best defense is a good offense. You want to know how to deal with this? Look at Trump. Trump would not only be on full attack mode, but he'd win in the end. Why? Because he would be on full attack mode and to refer to the great philosophical work, the Fight Club movie, most people... most *normal* people... don't want any trouble. \n\nSo, use this to your advantage. Stand up for yourself. You're right, the teacher is wrong. Fight for what you believe. Take your fear and cover it with raw semen hatred and anger. Hulk out. Rage against the machine. Show this teacher she just F-ed with the wrong person.",

One of the ways these students get caught is that the people they're paying don't have access to the course notes and thus don't use methods taught in the course. When a grader sees a method not used in the course (especially if it's more advanced then the course content) this is a red flag. They would then ask the student to explain the method and if they can't then it's some evidence of cheating. \n\nFrom the professors perspective, you've answered with a different method from the course and can't explain it. This makes it seem like you've paid someone else to answer it for you. \n\nWhat you should do is show them the video you learnt this method from. If you get easily flustered in person, try sending an email instead of having a meeting. By showing them the video, you are showing them where you learnt the method from. You may not be able to explain why the method works or what it's doing but at least you can explain why you were able to use it.",

Giving you a zero for the exam is bs.",

I failed out of the course because it was a final project worth 70% of the grade, meaning i went from an 89 (B) to a 59 (F) for missing a quotation mark & being labeled as plagiarism. I wasn\u2019t kicked out from the university, but it was a pain in the ass to re-take the course, so I asked the Dean for either a re-do or a final exam, and i ended up passing with a 70, since i bombed the exam. I would speak to your professor and show her how you studied, and if she\u2019s stubborn, talk to student affairs yourself.",

Whether OP got a 0 or not on the entire test or just the question, that\u2019s for them to deal with, but being accused of cheating holds a lot of weight in college and does stain your academic image. \n\nBut I do not think OP cheated. Unless they used the video or notes DURING the exam, they did not cheat. Did they apply class knowledge in the exam? Idk, maybe not, maybe yes. But cheating is, IMO, the most important concern here and I think the prof is wrong for accusing OP of that. \n\nAlso, I saw a comment about not saying \"regrettable mistake\", which I agree with. Don't incriminate yourself and do be confident that you were not cheating. Maybe edit your post because the last thing you want is the prof to be some super sleuth, find this post and use the *third sentence* in your original post against you.\n\nGL and know you weren't cheating.",
