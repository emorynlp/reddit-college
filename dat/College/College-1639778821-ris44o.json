  "text": "I think i want a career in the arts, not art education, so I'm searching for colleges. My issue with art schools is that they are often really small, limited with extracurriculars etc. I want to go to a college that has really good and diverse art programs with professional opportunities while being able to have that \"\"\"college experience\"\"\"\" with clubs and parties etc. Does such a school exist?",
