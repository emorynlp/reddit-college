  "text": "So there I was. Out of class for like, 4 weeks because of a medical thing. Had to be in the hospital a couple of times. Finally was able to email my professors and they understood, and are letting me make up most of the classwork I missed. That said, back against the wall, I'm about to speedrun 4 weeks of classwork in 4 days. Wish me luck, and any tips?",
