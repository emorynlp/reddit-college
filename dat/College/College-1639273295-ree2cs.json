  "text": "Honestly, college feels nearly impossible to complete with anxiety and depression always creeping around. Sometimes the rough patches I go through affect my way of thinking/focusing on course work. I\u2019m so bothered by many things in life and I\u2019m letting it affect me to the point I just close my laptop and stay in bed. Do you think colleges work with those who have mental health issues? I feel embarrassed to ask professors for extensions all the time. :/ dunno what to do.",

There I was able to get more help than my own psych doctors provided, which included sending me to a mental health facility.  \n\nMost professors are fine with students asking for an extension, but if you do have issues trying to get an extension, go to your uni's disability services offices. \n\nI did this, and got a accommodation that allowed me to turn in assignments one week after it was due, by providing the necessary paperwork from other doctors.",

I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about, and it kicked my ass throughout sophomore and junior year. But it\u2019s still your fault if you don\u2019t seek out resources that can possibly give you extensions. If you did put in the effort and there are no resources/they don\u2019t help you/you get turned down cuz your problems aren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d (whatever that means), then it\u2019s not really your fault.",
