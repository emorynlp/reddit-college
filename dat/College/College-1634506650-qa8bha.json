  "text": "Title says it all. I need help. My parents forced me to become a commuter because they wanted to keep me in their sight, but after letting them know so so many times how miserable their decision made me, they finally gave me more independence, but not before threatening to kick me out if I took a year off during the COVID online classes to think about what I wanted to do. So I went with Psychology. Even though I was constantly thinking about the fact that I'm a commuter every single moment of every day and how much of my hard work had gone down the drain, the one bit of hope was that I would be able to go to Germany for a Psychology degree. Tuition free, cheap dorms, an opportunity to learn a third language, all great stuff. Until I looked deeper into it and discovered... Germany has none in English. There is approximately one school that has a straight psychology degree  in English. and the tuition is 22k per semester. The rest? Hyper niche degrees that have to do with research instead of therapy. I have actually been losing my mind for the past two days.\n\n\nI need help. All my life it feels like I've just been getting told to work harder and just been snubbed by my parents' paranoia and overbearing attitude. And now that I finally have the chance to make my own decision, I have non-existent options and it is driving me up the wall. I had my heart set on Germany because so many people speak English and the tuition is so cheap, as well as the cost of dorming being extremely extremely low so I could finally get the college experience I always wanted. But now? I have no idea and I am actually yelling. I got screwed over. Hard. Please, if anyone knows of any more psychology degree programs in English I might have missed or an alternative country to Germany, don't hesitate to write. Because right now I am absolutely losing it and don't know what to do anymore.",
