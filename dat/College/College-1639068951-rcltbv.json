  "text": "I had a couple of books that cost around $80 each and my professors insisted that we REALLY needed them. Now that its the end of the semester, I realized that we never really used them. All of the material came from lectures, which is much better than reading books, but I don't want to spend so much money on books that we never use. \nDoes anyone have something like this happen or is it me being stupid?",

      "text": "Reading is a fundamental part of education, so ideally, you\u2019d read the book even if you\u2019re not directly tested over its contents. That said, I\u2019m pragmatic enough to know that most students will not go out of their way to do extra work that isn\u2019t directly tied to a grade, so I tell my students it\u2019s optional. It at least puts the onus back on them for how much they get out of the class.",
