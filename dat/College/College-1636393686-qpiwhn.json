  "text": "I had a counseling meeting today where I discussed how I have been debating on transferring closer to my family because I\u2019m 1500 miles away, I\u2019ve given it a year and I\u2019m just not happy here. \nHe said it sounds like I\u2019m running away. There\u2019s more details, but do you think he\u2019s biased because he is paid by the school and they wouldn\u2019t want me to transfer?\nMore details in comments\u2026",

          "text": "Okay. Well my college experience so far has been sub par. I went to community college in texas when i graduated highschool because my family relocated and I am paying for everything myself so I thought the smartest decisions financially was to stay then Covid happened and the person I was living with backed out of resigning our lease in match 2020 so I went to stay with my family in the new town they moved to up north and was doing school my school online. Then I got into a program here in texas but again still online for fall 2020 then I moved here January 2021, I work 30 hours a week. I haven\u2019t met \u201cmy people\u201d and trust me I\u2019m plenty sociable. I think the issue is I\u2019ve constantly been questioning if I want to be here because I\u2019m not set to graduate until spring 2024 and i can\u2019t see myself spending two more years here away from all my younger siblings, I\u2019m mature enough and have grown on my own I\u2019ve lived two years on my own, but I was telling the counselor I think I want to hit pause and establish myself up north get instate and then finish my degree. I\u2019m just worried I\u2019ll be seen as a failure or a loser for taking so long to complete my degree. Hence why I made the appointment with the counselor to sort out my thoughts. Thank tou",

      "text": "Here\u2019s my take. it\u2019s just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt: I never recommend seeing a university based therapist. I have been to two universities and both only allowed students to see the therapist for free, 3 times a year, which is not long enough to build a relationship or for the therapist to know your personality tendencies. I don\u2019t think they are being biased. I think they don\u2019t know you. \n\nLots of kids come into the office debating transferring bc they are homesick. The generic answer to give is to stick out bc when you go into your career, many don\u2019t see their family as much as they would like to. They don\u2019t get paid any more or any less money based on the amount of students that transfer out (unless it\u2019s hundreds of students).\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t feel right to you, then it probably isn\u2019t. Compare what you lose by transferring to what you gain. You\u2019re the only one that knows what works best for you.",

      "text": "So here's a thought for you to chew on: not only may he actually be right, it may not matter at all that he is right because sometimes running away IS the correct course of action.\n\nHowever before you transfer take full inventory of your academics. How much time is left at the current school, credit hours remaining in your major, and if you transfer, are you capable of earning enough credit hours in your major at your new school to graduate at your new school. If you cannot earn enough credit hours in your major to graduate at your new school if you transfer, you might want to try to suck it up. If you can, however? Totally go to where you want to be.",
