  "text": "To give some background, I am a 3rd year student. I\u2019ve been struggling with school since I entered. Fall of my freshman year was difficult because of adjusting, but things got worse since Covid hit. I have always had mental health issues, but never reached out to anyone and my academics have suffered because of it. I have a 3.4 only because I have dropped classes and have used P/F options various times so far. This semester, I couldn't handle things on my own anymore and I decided to reach out to my university\u2019s mental health center and was diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and Anorexia.  All of these things have made my college experience extremely difficult this far and I definitely just want to take time off and focus a bit more on myself. Everything feels extremely overwhelming and I am unable to do daily tasks sometimes. Any advice? I\u2019m currently attending college 4 hrs away from my family, and would also love to be closer to them as seeing them occasionally raises my spirits. Would it be possible to transfer after having withdrawals on my academic record? Would I have possibility of returning in the spring semester if I do?",

      "text": "Yes, you would be able to transfer. It\u2019s not a pattern for you (having an F or W every semester) and it can easily be explained to admissions at the next school you attend. \n\nI was in the exact same shoes as you. I was going to school 5 hours away and struggling with my depression/anxiety/panic disorder. I transferred an hour away and i\u2019m so much happier being able to see my family and hometown friends more often.\n\nIf you can stick out this semester it would help, and you could start applying for spring semester as a transfer now but if your mental health is really deteriorating, dropping would be best.",

      "text": "Obviously the best thing would to ace/do well in the class but if thats not possible for whatever reason then the next best thing to do is withdraw. The worst thing is to get an F on your transcript.\n\nI know this isnt the same but i was battling addiction my freshman year, I was doing horrible in classes and I was academically dismissed. I was forced to take time off from school and I focused on recovery. Im back in school now and thriving. It might be good for you to take a leave of absence and get into some type of recovery program. When youre in college you need to make that your priority, but thats not possible or not healthy when you have the issues that you listed. Theres no shame at all in taking some extra time to get a degree and the way I look at it, its better to finish later and finish strong than it is to finish on time but struggle and not do well. Good luck :)",

      "text": "Definitely possible to transfer, a few Ws will not hurt you, speaking from personal experience here. I went through a very similar situation last semester. My mental health was struggling big time, my usual five course workload was beginning to get all too much and I struggled to keep up with my physical health as well, I was miserable and wanted to drop out. To me, getting a W on my transcript was the end of the world, so I tried to push through but that made everything ten times worse, so In the end I withdrew from one course and got a W. After that, my course work load got lighter and I felt much better, I also went to my doctor to get prescribed Lexapro which is helping me a ton. Also as another reply mentioned, Ws can easily be explained on applications.\n\nTLDR; drop a course/or courses and take the W, it isn\u2019t worth having your mental health and physical health suffer.",

      "text": "Withdrawing from too many classes may effect financial aid ( if that applies to you ), I would definitely talk to your advisor first, since you have already dropped classes in the past. \n\nI withdrew from classes two consecutive semesters after my brother died.  Kept trying to hang in there and do life but I just couldn\u2019t.  Was placed on academic probation and denied financial aid until I did a full time semester with passing grades without financial aid.  Then they reinstated it.  I\u2019ve been back at school for a year and a half now, and I\u2019m still on academic probation even with my lowest grade being a B.",
