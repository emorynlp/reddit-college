  "text": "Started community college after highschool in 2020. Completed fall. Decided I didn\u2019t want to do college in the spring. Came back to the present fall taking a max unit load. I have all A\u2019s except pre-calc which I might fail. I\u2019m scheduled to finish community college and transfer in 2 more years (spring 2023). This has got me thinking, would it be an issue to spread all my classes over 3 years instead of 2? Would I be missing out on anything? I would be at community college for 4 years, and transfer someone for 2 years just for a bachelors. I am struggling with wanting to take it easy and spend an extra year at community college and just develop and mature as a person, and then I also want to hurry quick rush through school to get a job which is already lined up for me when I graduate (construction). Thoughts? Opinions?",
