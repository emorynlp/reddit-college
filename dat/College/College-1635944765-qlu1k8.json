  "title:": "DAE feel uncomfortable around their roommates?",
  "text": "I live off-campus in a room I found off Craigslist, and I\u2019m the only female living with three guys. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re all *very* nice, polite, smart, clean, and overall very pleasant to live with. I have some social anxiety to begin with and I just feel so limited around them. \n\nThey\u2019ve all already established their friendships/have inside jokes (I moved in after they\u2019d all been living there for a while), and I just feel like a stranger that\u2019s living in a house of friends :/ the way they treat is me noticeably different/more reserved even though I try to be very friendly in my interactions. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m afraid to go outside when there are other people out there and just spend most of my time in my room. I\u2019m considering subletting, then moving back with my parents and commuting for the rest of the semester. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? What can be done to improve the situation?",
