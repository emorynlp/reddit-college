  "text": "I'm studying psychology and in 2 months I'll have my first exams. These exams are about all the subjects from beginning to end. So my question is: \u00bfHow do you study 40+ chapters without forgetting what you studied first? I feel like when I get to the last parts I'm going to forget about the beginning of everything so, what do you guys do to remember everything?",

Typically students who get lower than a B isn't interested in the material.\n\nEveryone telling you their study strategy isn't helping out, if you can't remember it you are probably bored out of your mind because deep down, you probably prefer to be somewhere else, but the best advice is study more. If you need flashcards or recall method, it can work, keep in mind that your classmate can use flashcards and recall method too. But how will this help you out with say, mathematics or chemistry or physics or computer programming? Like you have to put it in your long term memory.",

      "text": "If you have a lot of time set aside for this kver the next 2 months, here is the way I would suggest to approach it:\n1) Look at the headers and subsection names of each chapter, and write them down. This will help put the total amout of work that you will have to do into perspective, as well as get the words associated with the main topics in your head early, and serve as a study outline.\n2) Go through each section and only look for the bolded terms. If the textbook doesn't use a system like this, then just skim the first andast sentence of the paragraphs, and note the main ideas.\n3) Now you can finally dive deep. If you have the time, I suggest reading through the chapters thoroughly now while taking notes on ideas not captured in (2).\n4)After a few chapters, look backward to the first chapter's notes and skim them really quickly. Then, moving forward, after you read the next chapter, do this with your chapter 2 notes, and so on. Continue to do this until you have properly read through and reviewed the notes from the book. \n\nRemember, this is only if you have the time, energy, and resources. If you are pressed for time, I would say that (1) is a priority, and then obviously reading through it after the outline is complete, and taking notes on what you learned, is next.\n\nHope this helps! Best of luck!",
