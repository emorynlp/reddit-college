  "text": "I'm a Poli-Sci major on the Pre-Law track right now, but genuinely it's boring the shit out of me. Ideally, I could switch to the Forensic Science path, but my university is smaller and doesn't even have courses over it, much less a degree. Has anyone else changed from a humanities degree to a STEM one? I'm considering Biology, but only because it's one of the few we have.",
