  "text": "I graduated high school in Massachusetts in 2014. I attended a community college for a little under 3 years, I switched my major a lot and ended up dropping out. I\u2019m 25 now and working as a customer service rep for a plumbing and excavation company. I would like to eventually go back and work part time toward an associate business degree, and eventually get a degree in construction management.\n\nI reached out to the community college asking how many classes away I was from an associates, and what classes I had taken, because I have no idea anymore what I took and if I passed them. They told me I have to enroll in the college and then they said I can meet with an advisor and figure this out. I don\u2019t want to do that because I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll be taking classes there should I go back. \n\nShould I find a college I might want to attend part time first and see what they say?",

      "text": "Do you have you\u2019re old college transcripts? If you do some cc\u2019s have their associates requirement online as well as their GE.\n\nSo you might be able to compare and get a ballpark. I say ballpark because some classes might not transfer over. \n\nDoes the application cost money? Because as long as you apply you should be able to meet with a counselor. Lots of people have to meet counselors BEFORE signing up for classes.",
