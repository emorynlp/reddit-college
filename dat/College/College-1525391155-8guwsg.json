I play it in the background when I study at a low volume and man does it help. Idk how or why, but i'm able to sit at my desk for 7-10 hours a day studying (with some breaks in between to workout) Also getting on an exercise schedule has definitely increased my ability to sit still and get a lot of work done than I could normally handle.
