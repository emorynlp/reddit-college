  "text": "God knows why but my community college decided that we all needed to take a standardized ACS exam for our final for elementary chem. It's notoriously hard. \n\nMy professor's exams have been very easy and I've gotten all 90+ (we were told we didn't need to memorize). I also didn't study as much as I should have, which is on me. Then two weeks before the final we're told about the ACS exam. \n\nAnyways it's tomorrow morning and I'm gonna study hard tonight but there's no way I don't do terribly....praying for a huge curve. Wish me luck...",

The organic chemistry tutor on YouTube really helped me out since he went over common chemistry ACS problems. Btw, if you ever have to take chem 2, you will do another ACS exam.",
