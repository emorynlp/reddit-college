  "text": "I found a help article on forcing gradebook sync but I can't find the button to do so. It says there's an options menu in my gradebook but I don't see anything like that and it's been almost 8 hours and my grades haven't synced. Normally they sync within 10 minutes and obviously I'm worried about losing several hundred points off my grade at the end of the semester for a class I don't want to retake. (fuck Cengage)",
