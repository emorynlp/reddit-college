  "text": "I absolutely dread the idea of taking biology. I\u2019m currently working on my associates degree. I may eventually go back for my bachelors, and biology is required to obtain that degree. \n\nDo I take biology now for 6 credits even though I may not go back?\n\nWait to take biology (4 credits at transfer college) and take another class instead this semester that is not necessary. (Some professionalism class needed to complete my degree.)",
