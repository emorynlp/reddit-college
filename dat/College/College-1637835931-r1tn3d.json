  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, I just need some advice regarding new grad job search so if you can hear me out, I\u2019d appreciate it much. \n\nMe and my gf are both graduating seniors for next summer. I already have a job lined up, but for her, who\u2019s a MIS major international student, things are tough and she\u2019s not getting any phone screening requests. She\u2019s trying her best right now by cold messaging recruiters and alumni in at different companies, but I can sense that she\u2019s an inch away from having a mental breakdown. Her friends and myself landing a job offer is only making her more anxious. I\u2019m pretty confident that her resume is ok; we got it checked by multiple alumni and professors at our university. Right now, she\u2019s mainly looking for a new grad PM or BA positions. Having said that, how late is too late? Can she still find a job next semester that sponsors OPT? How can I comfort her a bit better?",

      "text": "If she is the one, then just let her know you will be there for her and support her. Make her smile and happy. Finding a job in a competitive field temporarily for myself is complete BS but i could not have made it this far without my supportive partner. She always tells me i am doing great and shows appreciation when i clean, make dinner, bath the pets and etc. She would rather support us than to have me work as a waiter or anything below a college degree and prefers that i continue studying for medical school. \nIn conclusion, be like that. She will still be down, but not as much with a supportive partner.",

          "text": "Thanks for your comment. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a little more to it than just making her happy. Because she\u2019s international, if she fail to land a job offer after graduation, she has to go back to her home country. I really don\u2019t want things to go this way so I\u2019m trying my best to help her",

Also, you can follow people who have experienced the same thing. There's someone in my network, Basant Shenouda who probably would have done great advice. And lastly, when she messages alumni, have her ask for an informational interview. We all know that means they're going for a referral, but it also shows they're willing to sit down and talk for 30 minutes first, and let you make an evaluation.",
