  "text": "So hey, as the title says.\n\nThis is my last straw, I had to make the most important essay for one of my classes and it was an absolute disaster.\n\nThe girl who I did the project with wanted me to explain every single thing, she copy-pasted all the text and  she didn't know how to make citations or references.\n\nIt wouldn't be a problem if it was a once in a lifetime experience but this happens every single time I have to work with another person. I feel so exhausted because my grade depends on things that are completely out of my control and I'm really starting to think that it is my problem. \n\nMy family says that I should just try to make my best and let others mess up but the teachers take into consideration the project as a whole, what can I do? What do you guys suggest?\n\n*Sadly, making the projects on my own is not an option.",
