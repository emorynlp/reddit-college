  "text": "Im in my second year and it\u2019s all been online so far except one class. Everyday is me sitting in my room, looking at my computer screen, reading textbook material, and trying not to fidget/lose focus/get distracted by social media. Some weeks I follow my schedule accordingly and get shit done, but others I feel so on edge,shaky, and utterly lost and unhappy. I deliberately missed a midterm because of this. \nSometimes I think I can\u2019t get used to the amount of reading material I have to read and studying per week, especially on obligatory subjects that don\u2019t interest me. Forcing myself to focus is counterproductive. I eat one meal a day maybe two, don\u2019t exercise at all, barely see the sunlight, and sleep past 3am. I haven\u2019t really made any friends in college due to my lack of personality. So yeah I\u2019m in the middle of one of my hopeless weeks.",

      "text": "Learning to manage your time, battling procrastination is something most college students have to learn. Online classes have made it worse. \n\nLook for resources online, keep trying until you find the strategies that work for you. It is very easy to fall into a negative thinking spiral. You have to focus on positive things and things that you want from your future. Then work in short bursts and plan small rewards for yourself for completing things you didn't want to do, for e.g. I will read for minimum of 15 minute and I'll reward myself by watching videos on Youtube for 10 minutes etc. \n\nOver time you'll be able to get more and more done, and most importantly you'll develop the positive mindset that will help you focus on the things you can do.",

          "text": "Hmm thanks. However, I can have little self-control. Sometimes I\u2019m successful at reading for 25min and resting for 5min, until I finish a chapter. But sometimes I won\u2019t even make it to 10 and go down a rabbit hole by cycling through Reddit/YouTube/etc for 45min until I realize I\u2019ve been wasting my time. I know seeking a positive outlook is what I should do, but I feel so far from it that it feels foreign to me.",

              "text": "Many people struggle with similar problems. There are good days and bad days, you have to know what works for you. If you notice that you've been spending time on Reddit/YouTube etc stop when you realise it, don't berate yourself. The objective is not to make yourself feel bad. Decide that you will do something productive and then reward yourself. You'll realise that guilt-free entertainment is so much better and you'll learn to negotiate with yourself and plan your time better. \n\nNo one else can give you a fool proof method, you can look up TedTalks on procrastination or find tips on YouTube, but at the end of the day you will have to put them to work.",
