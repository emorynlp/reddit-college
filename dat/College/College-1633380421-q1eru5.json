  "title:": "Should I go to college?",
  "text": "I am 23 years old and I have never gone to college. I dropped out of high school in my junior year and got my GED (the GED tests were extremely simple, mostly multiple choice, but I just lucked out on the math test by guessing.)\n\nI don't know what I should do in my life, the only thing I'm okay at is drawing but I know that Art is almost never a smart career path. I considered going to university to become a Software Engineer because I sort of like computers and software, but I don't really know what that would actually entail. All throughout my time as a student, I never did homework, studied, or paid attention (I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child.) My mathematics level is perhaps that of an elementary school student or worse.\n\nI'm afraid college will be too difficult for someone like me, and I'm afraid i'll end up with nothing but wasted time and massive debt. But I know if I stay on the easy and unremarkable path to a below average life, it will likely only lead to a life of misery and regret. I'm just worried going to college may lead to a life of misery, regret, and debt.\n\nFor someone like me who doesn't know what to do, perhaps trade school is the safest bet for me, except I hate physical labor (I'm very short and scrawny) and I feel like I would just be miserable in a job like that.\n\nI guess my question is, would a computer-related degree be feasible for someone like me, or am I already a lost cause? Should I start even if I don't know what I should do? Should I just be a starving artist? I know only I can answer some of these questions, but any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.",

You probably won't earn as much as a software engineer, but the arts have many lucrative career paths. If your portfolio is competitive, the game design industry is absolutely booming right now. Not to mention animation, traditional illustration routes, architecture, etc.",

      "text": "\nYou might look into technician jobs that are less physical, like becoming a pharmacy tech or a radiographer who does x-rays, etc. Look into what two-year certification programs are offered by the community colleges near you and see if any of them appeal to you. And many offer training in computer-related jobs, too. \n\nYou can also explore their graphic design and arts alternatives, but ask about their job placement record before signing up. You may be able to do those jobs just as well on your own without investing in the classes, depending on your experience.\n\nThe traditional software engineer programs at 4-year colleges usually require quite a bit of math and some are very competitive. If I were you, I would start at community college \u2014 it is lower cost and commitment. You might find you can handle school and math courses better now \u2014 if so, great \u2014 THEN you can transfer to a 4-year program. If not, maybe you can get trained in a solid career as painlessly as possible through one of the community college\u2019s certification or two-year degree programs.",
