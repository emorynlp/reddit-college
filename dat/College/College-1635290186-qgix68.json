  "text": "Right now I'm about to finish up my time at community college and will head to a university next fall. I'm taking a job as a server but the restaurant is pretty upscale. The managers explained that the menu changes with the season so I'm going to have to refresh my knowledge basically every three months. I'm able to take this job because I've been serving for years but this seems alot more involved than what I've done in the past. I don't know if it's a good idea to take a job like this while going through university for a bachelor's in computer science. I want to do it because I know the money will be great if I really apply myself, I also would like a car and to pay off some debt, but it seems like trying to maintain going to school and this job maybe a little too much to handle. I just need a second opinion is all.",
