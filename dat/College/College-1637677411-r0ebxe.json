  "text": "Monday - Friday I have classes, and all of them take attendance for a grade. I also commute everyday. Recently got a really nice job in college (not hard) but I\u2019m just extremely tired from all my classes. \n\nHow do I mentally and physically carry on until the semester is over in about a month.\n\nEdit: the coursework load of my classes does not tire me out, but it\u2019s the feeling of having to go to campus every single day of the week that does. Next semester I have a really nice schedule where I\u2019m only on campus 3x a week. Just wondering how do I finish the current semester off strong.",

      "text": "Yeah I work 24-30 hours a week and commute 30 minutes everyday. My job is right by my school though just about a three minute drive. I have classes Monday wednedsay and Friday and go to class 8-230, work 3-6 and come home and eat and do some homework. I do have a 2.5 hour break between classes so I get a lot done then. Then on tuesdays and Thursday I work 8-6. It really hasn\u2019t been too stressful, I just would like to do better on exams and be able to study more. I think going to campus everyday would be a burden, so next semester will be nice for you. As for this semester, try to talk with your job and see if you can lower your hours. If not, try to really focus on school when you\u2019re not working so you can do as best as you can. Push through it and just find something to look forward to and work towards that",
