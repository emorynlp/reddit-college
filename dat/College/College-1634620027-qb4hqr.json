So I have no idea how to do the homework. \n\nMy only resource is quizlet and chegg. I have no idea how to do them because we\u2019re behind 2 chapters.",

      "text": "Tutor here - I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s too late to drop the class. I suggest going to office hrs and finding out if he\u2019s just incompetent or an ass. There\u2019s a big difference, the incompetent ones can often be talked around and the asses can be paid for help in ego boosts. Sounds cynical but will work. \n\nAlso, try tutoring, if you have the funds. Happy to give you details on it if you\u2019re interested",
