  "text": "i havent partied since coming back to school, mostly because ive been busy but also because my one of my roommates isnt ready/comfortable w it. however a lot of my friends outside of my roommates are partying and ive been feeling so left out. all i do is work and school and clubs (which i do love and have friends in so no harm there) but rarely hang or go out. i just wanna know how other ppl are feeling who are in the same boat, bc the fomo is real for me rn and i feel so isolated like im not even a college student anymore. i also just miss partying ngl it was always super fun :(",

      "text": "I certainly relate to this post a lot. The way you said \"I feel so isolated like im not even a college student anymore\" really resonates with me. I've been feeling like that but was unable to verbally express it.\n\nI feel like I'll never have these kinds of opportunities to socialize with all these people my age again and I'm already a senior.\n\nI have been able to go to a few more parties this semester since I joined the lacrosse club. It's fun for 1 night. I socialize and laugh but the next day I return back to being lonely. The closest thing I have to socializing during the week is just by playing video games with friends on Discord but it doesn't satisfy my extroverted needs. Being isolated as an extrovert has been damaged my mental health. Hopefully things can change at some point.\n\nAre there any clubs that are of interest? That could maybe help the situation.",
