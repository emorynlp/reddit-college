Obviously, it is a bit more time consuming, but if you really want to, it can definitely happen.",

I really don\u2019t think they would care because a summer semester in college is not like summer school in high school. Usually in high school, people go to summer school for a negative reason but in college there is nothing negative about it; it\u2019s just another semester that\u2019s optional. There might be a chance online summer classes are looked at differently but I am really not sure. I would consult College Confidential and the websites of the law schools you want to look in to for more concrete answers. Good luck!",

Before I begin to tell my predicament I need to explain my current situation. So when deciding a college I was given a full scholarship to a university that I saw as a back up. The university is mainly an all girls school, but I was given a full ride to one of their programs which allows only a few men. I don't have an issue with it or anything, but for housing I asked to be placed in a shared dorm with another guy. Alas, with my luck I got placed in a single in the women's housing. \n\nUsually the men's housing will house 12 students all in doubles, but there were only 15 of us in total and I'm assuming I got the short end of the stick and was placed in a single on a different dorm. I felt that if I had a roommate I would have a destined friend to be with. \n\nI'm moving in tomorrow and I'm starting to get anxiety. I usually am alright with making friends and stuff, but I begin to get nervous trying to socialize with girls. I just need advice in trying to make friends/socializing with others in a single dorm room. \n\ntl;dr: I need advice trying to make friends in a single dorm room. Thank you so much for any advice you all can provide!",

          "text": "University scientist here.  With regard to your schedule being good, nobody can answer that but you.  Whether your schedule is \"good\" depends mostly on how interested you are in the classes you're taking.  If you are interested in the subject matter, then once the semester is underway your subjective perception of the schedule is likely to be on the favorable side.  If you decide you hate these subjects, then you will likely perceive your schedule to be tough, tedious, boring, etc.  Take home point: the question isn't whether your schedule is \\*good\\*, but rather whether it's \\*good for you.\\*\n\nOn the more objective side, most universities that work on the semester system consider 15 credits to be a normal load, and most will allow you to register for up to 18 credits without special approval.  Your 16 credits are a completely ordinary load.  If your friends say that 5 classes (which would equal approximately 15 credit hours) \"SUCK,\" then my many years of university experience would lead me to gently suggest to you that your friends need to re-calibrate their perceptions of what a college-level degree program entails.  Most degree programs designed for 4 years cannot be completed in 4 years by regularly taking fewer than 5 classes per semester (i.e., fewer than 15 credit hours).  Of course, some people have life circumstances that make taking a full load of \\~15 credits impossible, but in general, your load of 5 classes is completely typical. \n\nGood luck with your studies!",

Don't focus on what you haven't done or what hasn't gone the way you expected or how much easier a time others appear to be having.  You and thousands of other 18-year-olds are now on your own and semi-independent for likely the first time, and it is a big adjustment for everyone.  The good news is that classes often help people find their place in the college world.  Once classes get going, you'll naturally find some people who at least partially share your interests.  For example, if your major is going to be physics, you're likely to encounter at least a few of the same people in more than one introductory math or science class.  Even something as trivial as forming a homework or study group with them will help break the ice and get you going toward integration into college life.  If your major is going to be French, then you'll meet people with similar interests in your language and literature classes.  And so forth.  \n\n\nAbove all, remember this: College is like the real world in that not everyone you meet will like you, and you will not necessarily like everyone you meet.  The beauty of being a young adult in the wider world of college is that you are now completely free to associate with the people you like and who share your interests and to not associate with anyone you don't like and people who don't share your interests.  So find your niche, and keep in mind that there's no need to worry about how happy/integrated/successful other people appear to be.  You do you, and let them do them.",

Check on campus facilities for labs (accessibility, hours, if they have software required for major, quality and cleanliness of computers etc) to see if there's a space to work without dropping money on a pricey rig first. \n\nIf that's not a good option, wait until you have syllabi to check for your classes or until your first class. In my experience, most profs will make a point of mentioning if/what kind of anything you need to have for class. The LAST thing you want is to drop money on a comp you can't use. \n\nOther tips:\n\n Specifically make sure any software that'd be used has a (preferably legal) inexpensive way to purchase it or a student/school liscense. \n\nIf you do need to buy a machine, consider what your needs are for portability. If you need to take it to the library or class or have a tiny dorm, you're obviously not going to want a huge tower. I personally live in on-campus apartments close to my class building so I use a tower and ferry a portable backup drive to class with work. \n\nCheck for student discounts. A lot of larger companies do discounts for students with valid student id. Check with upperclassmen at your school or a school resource portal to see if your college has any other exclusive deals. \n\nHopefully this helps?",

          "text": "My advice would be to make sure you are prepared to hear the lecture \\*before\\* the lecture.  If you know that Wednesday's lecture is going to be on Chapter 2 in the textbook, then make sure you have read Chapter 2 \\*before\\* the lecture.  And by \"read\", I don't just mean letting the words on the page pass in front of your eyes, I mean reading for comprehension and understanding to the best of your ability.  People who don't do the assigned reading and merely show up to the lecture will have no idea what they are about to hear.  They likely won't take good notes because they don't even know what the general topic is that they're going to hear about.  For them, when the professor launches the lecture, every sentence is new, every fact is unknown, every individual point seems critical, and the relationship between all the facts is probably murky.  Those who read ahead of time already know the gist of what they're going to hear.  For them, the point of the lecture is to allow the professor to emphasize the most important details and explain anything that wasn't clear from the reading.  Those who prepared ahead of time don't need to worry about writing down every word the professor utters; they already know the general outline of the material and can focus on copying down just the most critical bits.\n\nTake home message: remember the old saying, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\"  In this context, doing 60 minutes of reading and preparation before the lecture so that you are generally familiar with the topic might save you hours and hours of frantic studying at a later date when you're trying to decipher the notes you took while the professor was lecturing on a topic you knew nothing about.\n\n  \nGood luck with your classes!",

It did take a couple weeks to join, but it made everything worthwhile. I became the VP for the organization so turn out pretty well.",

I'm dutch so the college system is a little different, but I wanted to drop out of my program because I was stressed and not doing so wel, so rough start and hence not loving it. So after the first period (two months) I wanted to drop out. Decided to suck it up for another period (two months) but took things a little slower focusing on just one course which counted for half of my credits that period. My grades weren't the best, but enough to just pass. Third period I really started to get the hang of things, actually learning HOW to study and doing courses I liked. I ended up doing much better, and I actually love it now. But it took about 5/6 months to get to that point. Ffw another 6 months, I'm doing well and I'm excited to start the new year. So I had rough start, but it ended up being the right fit for me. So I'd say give it a semester. If your grades are really bad and you're not enjoying your classes, than you either need different classes or college just isn't a good fit (right now). But definitely stop after a year if things are still not looking good. Because at that point you're just wasting your money.",

How familiar are you with programming in general?\n\nI think it would be really useful to get a laptop that is UNIX based (such as a Macbook) or just install Linux on a laptop. Getting familiar with a UNIX environment is extremely beneficial when it comes to programming. A lot of others over at /r/programming and /r/csMajors would also recommend learning UNIX. Of course, you don't *have to* use UNIX and instead use Windows, but it's generally recommended.\n\nAlso, depending on what your programming environment is (that is using a full IDE, or just a simple text editor), you can decide how much power you really need. You can really do most of your assignments just by using VSCode (an extremely popular text editor), which is lightweight and not power demanding at all.",

I bought a fairly inexpensive 2 in 1 laptop and hope to use it all 4 years, but really hardly used it for programming as any lab I was in had computers available and my dorm had my PC. Since I didn\u2019t really visit the library or any other study area much my laptop didn\u2019t really see too much use. I think I could have definitely gotten by without one, but it was definitely handy to have around at times. I think a fairly cheap, small machine is definitely worth your time.\n\nOne friend I made in my first computer science class got really distracted by his laptop in class/lab and ultimately dropped out of Computer Science in the second semester. Watching that situation play out definitely taught me that, as a general rule of thumb, keep your laptop for school work and your PC for entertainment.\n\nA little side recommendation is a quiet keyboard for your in dorm PC. My mechanical one drove my roommate crazy at times, and I was forced to figure out a late night alternative to the clackyness of my supposedly quiet mechanical keyboard.",

          "text": "I'm also majoring in CS! I've been programming for a loonggg time before attending college though, so I may be a little biased. However, don't be worried!\n\nProgramming as a whole is really straightforward. It's one of those things that is easy to learn, however, difficult to master. What might also impact your learning experience is the choice of the programming language used in your courses. Usually, this is either Python, C++, C, or Java.\n\nPython is by far the easiest to learn (it's considered a high-level programming language and handles a lot of the nuances commonly found in other languages). \n\nC++ and Java are considered low level as these operate on a more fundamental level. Compare the syntax of these two languages to Python and you will see what I'm talking about. This doesn't mean that it's difficult to learn (it's really not), but they will take more time to understand.\n\nC, on the other hand, is probably the most difficult to learn out of other programming languages I've listed. It's technically on the same level as C++ and Java, but I would list it as one level lower. It's probably not the best choice for beginners, but a lot of the fundamentals of Computer Science can be learned through the C programming language. But again, this doesn't mean that it is impossible to learn!\n\nBut as for tips:\n\n* MAKE YOUR OWN PROJECTS: This is probably my most important tip, hence why it is at the top. But you will learn so much faster when you work on something that interests you. The project doesn't have to be huge (it could even be a simple console calculator), but always be working on something that interests YOU personally. After a while, you might be making desktop software, or mobile apps, or websites! Doing so will get you so far ahead of your classmates, and you will end up enjoying the art of programming!\n\n* Watch YouTube tutorials: seriously, these tutorials will probably explain concepts WAY better than your professors. Just look at the YouTube comments that resemble, \"taught me more in 10 mins than 3 hour lecture\" or \"way better than my university\"\n\n* Don't be afraid to break your code: Failing is part of the learning process. It is extremely unlikely that you will write an entire program in one session. Like an essay, you first have a rough draft, then you revise.\n\n* Use Google and StackOverflow: These websites will save your life.\n\n* Write out your thought process on paper: I find it's easier to visualize a program or a concept if I draw it out on paper.\n\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help: ask classmates or professors, post questions on subreddits, open a StackOverflow thread.\n\n* Visit /r/programmerhumor: the memes will make you feel better\n\n* Problem sets/homework will take a long time: It's inevitable, they are designed to make you think critically about how your program works. Don't get discouraged if you spend hours working on something! Thinking like a programmer takes time, as the mindset to how to approach problems is different than any other field. A programmer will always be thinking through a problem one line of code after another line of code.\n\n* Done is better than perfect: There will be times when you know that you wrote shitty code, *but it works*.\n\n* Take breaks: These seriously help a lot. Go talk to friends, go outside for a walk, eat food or watch something. You might find that the solution to a problem will pop in your head when you're not programming!\n\nAnd just remember this. There is A LOT when it comes to computers. It is nearly impossible to learn EVERYTHING about computation. You can ask yourself \"how does this work?\" and always find some underlying topic/idea. Eventually end up on the TRANSISTOR level of computers.\n\nI hope you enjoy Computer Science as a whole! It's truly a great subject that is extremely in demand right now. If you have any questions, ask away! :D",

When asking a teacher for directions, I usually ask if they could draw a map because visuals help a lot. Today I need to go through a code of conduct and I got bored really fast as it takes forever to grasp the details (tbh books without any plots such as textbooks gets boring too, which is why I rely on videos)\n\nSo any advice to read effectively when you\u2019re a visual learner?",

I have to say that, it's a sub rule to not engage in or advocate for illegal behavior.\n\nSecond of all, assuming you are of age, control your consumption.  That means a few things:\n\n1. Know how many drinks are in your cup.  A filled 16 oz solo cup is 1.25 beers, 4 wines, and a deathsentence of liquor.\n2. Know that your body can only process 1 drink per hour.  A drink is a beer, a glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor.  *Pace yourself.*\n3. Keep track of how many drinks you've had and over what period of time.  Look at your  phone when you start drinking, else you'll have no idea when you started.  Look at it every time you get a new drink, else you'll have no idea how much time has gone by.  *Pace yourself.*  **IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY DRINKS YOU'VE HAD, YOU'VE HAD TOO MANY AND IT'S TIME TO STOP.**\n4. The feeling of inebriation is, in my experienced, a delayed effect.  By the time you feel buzzed, if you're still drinking, you're going to get drunk.  By the time you get drunk, if you're still drinking, you're going to get sick.  *Pace yourself.*\n5. When you've had enough, and someone offers you another, for the love of God **SAY NO THANK YOU**.  If you have to walk away from a game of beer pong, so be it.  *Pace yourself.*\n\n2,000 college students will probably die from alcohol this year.  That's twice as many people as get shot dead by police every year.  This is no fucking joke.  Take care of yourselves.",

      "text": "So, this is a bit of a stupid and vague question but I figured I should ask anyway. I bought a [backpack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B15LDBM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) specifically for college since my old high school one was falling apart. It's nice and has a compartment for my laptop, a main compartment which I can fit about 4 notebooks into with room for a little agenda, and a front compartment that I've put a bunch of random stuff in (stuff like gum, Advil, hand sanitizer, writing utensils, and a portable battery).\n\nMy question: should I be expecting to carry way more stuff for my freshmen year of college? Should I opt for an even bigger backpack? This might depend on classes too. My girlfriend told me that I should've gotten a bigger backpack since my new one, with all the stuff I mentioned, is pretty full now, but she also said to at least use it for the first week before deciding to return it.\n\nShe has a point but I also wanted to point out that there's only one day a week where I have 3 classes. The other days, I usually have one or two classes that are pretty spaced out, so I could leave certain materials in my car and run to get them if I really needed too.\n\nLet me know on what your opinion is regarding backpacks for college. And another question, for the heck of it: what laptop/computer are you rocking for college?",

Also as the year goes on you\u2019ll find that a lot of random stuff you\u2019ve probably got in there for the sake of stuff you won\u2019t need/use enough to justify so that\u2019ll come out saving space too.",

One of my favorite tips and things that I do is the first couple lectures if there's someone sitting next to you that looks like say \"Hey, would you mind exchanging contact information in case either of us miss class and need the notes?\" Pro Tip: As their contact last name, put what class you have with them. \n\nIf you meet someone and they turn out not to be someone you like, slowly stop responding and just be busy if they want to hangout. They'll get the hint. Also, don't give in if they try to peer pressure you into going to parties. I have a whole bunch of tips for handling parties and not drinking if you're interested.",

I spent almost the entire day doing homework every week (sleep at 2-3am finishing one homework then waking up at 8am to start another).\n\nIn my second semester, I took 20 units (max was 18) yet I hung out with friends more often. We did lots of fun activities like karaoke or enter video game tournaments. I\u2019d even get some work done while talking with my friends too. I probably did my work for 3-5 hours a day. I got a 3.87 that semester but it was well worth the fun times.\n\nIf I were to tell anyone about my college experience I\u2019d mostly tell them about my time during my second semester.",

Second semester, I spent way more time with friends, since I made friends in my dorm who obviously lived very close and with whom it was easy to just go out with on a whim. First semester, I definitely still had time with my friends; I went to two concerts til 1am, I threw a huge birthday party for a friend, and was at my bff's apartment more than I was with my dorm, but it wasn't as much time as second semester. I personally wouldn't say that hanging with my friends was why my grades suffered, I would attribute that to taking the wrong combinations of 18 credits (max) and suffering some mental and physical health issues.\n\nIf you want a literal analysis of how much time to myself vs. studying, for my 3.96 semester, I would say: with 15 class hours a week, I was spending about 18-26 hrs on schoolwork vs 13-17 hrs with friends, per week. That's just an estimate, nearly a year after the fact, but I think it feels right. \n\nMy best advice would be find friends with whom you can study. I was lucky to find friends in most of my classes that I really clicked with, so I would hang out with them, which was fun, and do schoolwork. Kept my spirits up.\n\nP.S. I highly highly highly recommend the myHomework app for keeping track of schoolwork (not what you asked but I can't recommend it enough).",

Make sure you at least get their first name and number, and then add which class you have together to their contact in your phone. Even if you don't become friends, you now have three people in every class that you can contact if you need notes, a partner, help with a project, or a study buddy. Some of these people I never contacted again. Some of these people did not become close friends, but we got along well enough and I always had a project group. Some of these people slowly became friends over the semester, as we attended study sessions, TA reviews, and complained about our insanely difficult exams. And one of those people became a best friend right away, and I actually attended her wedding 3 weeks ago with 5 other close friends.\n\nI don't get shy easily most of the time but in some of my higher classes I did, so even if you're shy I'd say still try to do this. You never know who you're going to meet or why you'll need their number, but it's good to have it.\n\nOtherwise, just try to talk to people. In my history class, I made a few good friends through the get-a-number technique, but I also just participated in class, wasn't afraid to disagree, and was always willing to help someone if they didn't understand or had missed a reading. By the end of the class, when we were doing our final TA review, the TA was late and we weren't sure if he was coming, and the class unanimously voted to have me lead it until he got there. I didn't know most of them well, but by interacting with the class and letting people know my face/voice, they all thought well of me and I of them. Now, when I see them in other classes, I can sit with them because we at least feel like we know each other.",

Some of my friends (for example, literally everyone I met on my study abroad), it took a while but I realized they were not as interested in being a good friend to me as I was with them. In every situation, there are people who are friends out of convenience and will leave, and there are people who are friends out of love for you and will stick around. Both are fine, and can be really great and mutually beneficial, but make sure you're on the same page. My study abroad experience got a lot better once I stopped expecting the jerks I was with to treat me the way I felt my friends should and waiting for someone to invite me to something.",

Honestly, after I've introduced myself and had like a 5 min convo before class, sometimes the class will start with little warning and I won't get to ask if I can have the number, so I just show them my screen with a blank \"New Contact\" sheet and mouth \"Number?\" They nod, then I just pass the phone and let them fill it out.

Don't immediatly start partying ( A good portion of freshman drop out after the first semester since they spent all their time partying.)\n2. Don't use up the dyas that you can be absent without getting in trouble since you will regret it later.\n3. Be open and social. This is your time to make friends, have fun and mingle with different cultures. (But don't go out of your way to join every and any club that's remotely interesting.\n4. Look up on the essentials that you will need for college (no need to take all your clothes)\n5. I also recommend buying a caddie to put all your bath products and such.\n6. last but not least ***DONT TAKE ANY*** ***~~USELESS~~*** ***LIBERAL ARTS CLASSES!!***\n\nHave a nice day ;)",

Some professors don\u2019t actually use them at all, other classes you can easily get by without it, and I\u2019ve even had two classes where the professor straight up told us to just buy some cheaper alternative if we wanted.

A majority of the time, professors speed through their powerpoints, so it helps to have the PowerPoint on your screen at the same time, so you can write something down if you didn\u2019t catch what she/he said. DON\u2019T FORGET THE CHARGER!\n\nYou don\u2019t need to go all out, but maybe two colors of pens, or a pencil to take your notes. Notepad, legal pad if you\u2019re feeling special lol. \n\nAnd me being a nursing major, i always carry some medicines just in case (i.e. immodium, cough drops, allergy meds/inhaler). Doesn\u2019t hurt to have that small stuff. \n\nGood luck on your first day, it\u2019s not as intimidating as you think!",

But if you take Chinese you may develop an interest in it as well, you never know. That's just my take on it.\n\nEdit: I was debating whether to take Chinese or Spanish, but decided on Spanish as I had previously taken French in HS.",

          "text": "Hey there! I went out of state and have about an 11 hour drive from home to school. I had really always wanted to go far, but I actually became really scared right before I left. \n\nAcademically, I really don\u2019t think college is that bad. Sure the classes are challenging and it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but it\u2019s really all about time management. If you plan ahead, make the most of your day and take note of what you have coming up, everything\u2019s a lot easier. If you do all this and still struggle, most universities have free tutoring, office hours with a professor or TA, and study groups before exams. All of these can be really useful resources.\n\nSocially, college can be difficult at first. It\u2019s a lot different from high school with how you meet close friends. Some people hit it off with their roommates and people on their hall immediately, but others gotta dig a little deeper. Then you can join clubs, talk to people in the building, try talking to people in your major, etc. \n\nMy best advice to you is for the first couple weeks always say yes to going to eat with people, hanging with them, etc. Once you start saying no people stop asking, so it\u2019s better to always seem interested even if you don\u2019t know exactly who you want to spend all your time with in the long run. I\u2019d also say join a club, ASAP. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s tons out there for you, just do some research. Most schools have some sort of event to introduce new students to clubs. And finally, make sure you leave yourself some time at the end of each night to just relax. If you have an exam the next day it may be tough, but I\u2019ve found that arranging time before bed every night to just play video games, watch TV, whatever has been really good for me mentally cause I can kinda reset and enjoy myself before diving back into school the next morning.",

              "text": "Agree with everything said here.\n\nCollege classes are challenging, engaging, and more intellectually involved than anything you've taken before. It's nothing like AP. But it's not *impossible*. It's not the sort of thing where if you're not smart enough, you can't succeed. The key to success in college is not intelligence, it's time management and self-control. It's learning how to complete all your work on time, gain favor with your professors, get the grades, balance your schedule, make time for studying, and learn important skills for your profession.\n\nSocially, again agree with everything said. My current best friends from college are split between people I met the first day, and people I met the first day but didn't click with til second semester. I took a pre-school seminar where I met 3 of my best friends, one of whom I'm rooming with next year, and that can happen to many people, where you click right away and it sticks. I also met people in that seminar who I love but am not close with, and people who I never clicked with. That happens too.\n\nOn the other side, I met all 36 girls in my dorm as they moved in because I was first in, and I didn't click with ANY of them until a trip we made in December. Sure I hung out with them, and I had fun, but I spent most of first semester with those 3 friends from the seminar. I denied invitations to parties, dinners, trips, etc, because I thought I had already found my girls, and didn't need anyone else. It felt so good to be able to feel like everyone else here was still searching but I already had it. But in December, I wanted to take a trip that my friends couldn't make, so I planned it last minute with 6 other girls in the hall, and we all spent the night together in the city, having an absolute blast. It was in the middle of finals, it was last-minute, it was reckless and unplanned and so much fun. And then we left for break, and it wasn't until we came back that I realized how well we all worked together. We created a group chat just for that trip but we kept using it after, and the night I flew in we all got together and went shopping. We became best friends so fast, and we added one more girl from the hall who was friendly but shy and never asked to be included but always accepted our invitations, so I kept inviting her and eventually she became a mainstay. That's how I met my absolute best friends in the world, with whom I pulled my first ever April Fools prank (involving stealing 13,000 breathmints and hiking a mountain at 5 am), planned 4 different surprise birthday parties, took a week-long roadtrip from Utah to Las Vegas, and flew out to California for one of our friend's weddings. Lol sorry that became way more about me than planned but my point was you can make friends anywhere, and it can suck to feel alone, but everyone I know found someone, even if it was just one person, with whom they clicked, and you can too. Just look for invitations and accept them all, and never stop trying new things.",

I am now going to college on the GI bill at the age of 22. I'm worried that I will have trouble relating to other people. Not just because I'm older, but because I am at a different stage in life. I have a wife and kid. \n\nI'm also worried because of my hobbies. I am kinda unique. I like sports, not a big fan of the huge multiplayer titles that are coming out (I like single player strategy games or RPGs). I like DnD and reading as well. \n\nI am also going to a school in a radically different place. I'm from Texas, but I'm going to school in Hawaii.",

After reading other people's experiences with neuro, I decided to take bio w/ psy (had to fill in an empty slot). Additionally, a focus in bio seemed more \"safer\" in terms of flexibility around the STEM field.\n\nFor the first semester, I will be taking principles of chemistry along with a lab (4), English Comp II (3), Student orientation (1), Intro to Psychology (3), American Government (3), and Human Communication (3). American government and human communication courses are required, so I had no say in those. For the fall semester, I will have 16 credits. Overall, I'm pleased with the times of my schedule. \n\nMy AP credit for AB allows me to take calculus I, but unfortunately the classes are filled and conflicts w/ my schedule, so I will be taking a math course in the spring. Next semester I plan to take bio w/ lab (4) and have my sights on calc I (4), upper level latin (3), psy (3), and phil (2), giving me 16 credits.\n\nThoughts?",

I decided to take intermediate algebra (basically algebra retaught) instead of calculus 1. If I'm planning to major in computer science, and I'm taking a incredibly lower level math class instead of the math class I'm supposed to be taking (all of my classes this year are general education requirements. \n\nIs this realistic enough or at least still possible for me to major in computer science knowing I'm taking a lower level math class? The reason I chose that class is because I know I have a horrible foundation in math in general. In high school I never did well and it traumatized me. I know I can be good at it, but I need to be realistic about me majoring in computer science. Would it take 5 years instead of 4 to get my major? And is that normal for me or am I doing this wrong??",

My first year was phenomenal, best year of my life hands-down\n\nI had a similar situation in high school. I have a near-photographic memory (can't remember literally what I see but if I see notes on a screen I can remember everything as long as I read it) so didn't have to write things down much and always understood the first time things were said. Literally never studied and did pretty good when I tried.\n\nCollege was very different for me. Luckily I was thrown in the deep end right away with a before-school week long honors seminar/class and was forced to figure out what worked for me. Also, I was very successful my first semester (3.96 GPA) and not as successful my second (3.42 GPA) so I've learned a little of what worked for me and what didn't work so well. Here are my tips:\n\n* Notes: I work best on computers, but if you do written notes, just change this to paper and folders.\n   * Before classes start, I create a Google Drive folder for each of my classes. Just helps me feel organized before classes start\n   * Each day in class, **I make a new doc titled with just the date, and at the end of the class, I title it the main idea of the class, ie: 1/16 Archive and the Repertoire.** This way, when exams roll around, the title of each doc makes it easier to find the right notes when filling out the study guide\n   * During class, I take pretty extensive notes. **I like to write down as much as possible unless I feel like it's more of an interactive class/lesson.** What I mean is this: for me, having it written to go over later is generally much better than always paying 100% attention to the prof, however, there are some situations in each class where writing it down will not benefit you as much as being involved right now. Examples of this in my classes include in-class practice of a new language skill (speaking a new language helps you learn much more than writing), on-the-board equations solved as a class in math, and philosophical discussions in my history class. **It won't always be something that requires your participation, and it took me a while to be able to notice the difference, but there are times when notes are not as important as receiving in-class instruction.**\n   * As class goes on, if a prof makes a point to mention something more than once, offer to let you take a pic, or makes any statement like \"this is important\" \"will be on the midterm\" \"pay attention\", **I bold it.** This makes it easier to pinpoint the meaty stuff later when studying.\n   * Formatting: all my notes are just bullet points. I start with a 1st tier bullet point, then every time I feel we're delving further into a topic, I indent to 2nd tier, 3rd tier, etc until I think we've moved on, then I go back one tier. This provides a simple division of topics and minimal structure and doesn't take any extra time in class, just press Tab or Enter. Examples:\n      * American History from 1865-Present:[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUdWqpn0MVhnh\\_DAo55QoVPudqPBQf6p1q-q-hosxME/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUdWqpn0MVhnh_DAo55QoVPudqPBQf6p1q-q-hosxME/edit?usp=sharing)\n      * Environmental Biology:[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/19cIjAyqtRPtCdHGXeO9PUbFGErdJmycHJNIjTQgjgC4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19cIjAyqtRPtCdHGXeO9PUbFGErdJmycHJNIjTQgjgC4/edit?usp=sharing)\n   * I think that's it for how I take notes, other than an important point: **This does NOT apply equally to every class.** My physics class, there was way too much in-class problem-solving so my notes were very short, so instead I took notes in the textbook, highlighting important points in different colors by topic. My CS 224 class, almost everything in the class was complicated grids of 0s and 1s and complicated computer code and so my notes just became lists of that. My Linear Algebra class, I had to completely scrap this and use paper notes, organized completely differently. The point is, and this is true for everything I say in this post: Just because this works for me doesn't mean it'll work for you, and just because this works for most classes, doesn't mean it's always the best way. **Play around with different styles,** look at your friends notes and how they format and organize, ask for other people's notes on days you miss, because you may find a style you like more or several ways that work best in different situations.\n* Groups and friends:\n   * I don't know about you, but I'm a very very friendly person, so for me, making friends in my classes wasn't difficult. **One of the biggest differences** between my first and second semester, and a deciding factor in my success, was my friends.\n   * First semester, on the first day of every class, **I introduced myself to three new people and got their numbers.** Did not do this second semester. Having these people's numbers made such a big difference. Not all of us became amazing friends, though sometimes we did, but it always meant that I had at least three people to ask if I missed a class and needed notes, or needed help with an assignment, a study group, someone to look over my paper, or a partner for a project.\n   * The other thing about having friends meant that **if I wasn't in class, I was missed.** I had so much trouble going to classes second semester, kept skipping, and then missed instruction, so I was behind. If I had had friends in my classes who asked where I was, I would've felt more pressured to go and would've found it harder to skip.\n   * Studying in a group was SO much better for me in nearly every class. Some classes, like Bio, where it's just straight up facts, I was able to study on my own just fine (more on that later) but things like history or theatre where it's more subjective, **hearing multiple people's opinions was incredibly helpful** and really expanded my understanding of a topic, making it much easier to analyze questions on the exams.\n* Studying:\n   * Okay here's the big one. This was SO difficult for me because I'd literally never done it before; I had no clue how. I just made it up as I went along, and I think by now I've figured out what works best for myself:\n   * Each weekend throughout the semester, Friday or Saturday, I sit down and go through each of my classes one by one. **Go over the notes from that week** (which is luckily only 1-3 docs a week, a welcome change from high school) and make sure I understand what was covered in each and the main points. Sometimes I'll also sit with a **syllabus and/or study guide** for the upcoming exam, and make sure I can connect this week's notes to something on the guide/syllabus and know where we are in the class and what's to come. I also try to **get ahead** on the next week's reading, so that I absorb more in classes. (I'm going to start trying to do a larger version of this at the end of each month this semester, though idk how effective that would be since most midterms are about 5 weeks apart anyway).\n   * For finals only: I created a new folder along with all my class folders, titled Finals and colored Red, and then I create a tiny table of each class, date/time, building/room number, whether it's cumulative, topics covered, whether notes are allowed, whether there's a study guide, and then I calculate the grade I need to earn to get the grade I want in the class. Most of the time the grade I calculate for is an A because my final grade is so good, but be reasonable. Don't stress yourself out by trying to get a 98% on an exam in a class you suck at. Again, this is only for finals. This isn't incredibly important, but like the folders for classes, it makes me feel in control. Here's an example:[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALYk3gPqZhc1zRs-PlfIq04i1z8ckQD3RIsMlCjOAuE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALYk3gPqZhc1zRs-PlfIq04i1z8ckQD3RIsMlCjOAuE/edit?usp=sharing)",

              "text": "Part 2: (idk what reddit's problem is, this is def under 10,000 characters but had to split it again)\n\n* **Decide what subjects are most important to you.** This is especially important during midterms and finals, as they often overlap and you will not have enough time for everything. How likely are you to do well? How much can you improve your performance in the time you have? How well have you done in exams in this class in the past? How much will this affect your grade? Do you want to learn these subjects or are you just trying to pass this exam? **Prioritize how you study based on this.** I only needed an 85 on my physics, but I had also been doing really well on exams so far and did not feel like I improved much when I studied. On the flip side, I needed a 95 on my religion exam but my average was only 85% with no chance of improvement (I hated that class, my only A- first semester). Right in the middle was my Bio class, where all I needed was a 92 (high but doable), it was an easy class, and 100 of the 150 questions were reused from old exams, so I decided to focus most of my efforts on Bio.\n   * For each exam, hopefully **your prof will give you a study guide.** If not, see if anyone in your class has made one or is interested in collaborating on one. If you absolutely cannot find anything, see what you can do from your syllabus, your textbook's table of contents, or the titles of your daily notes.\n   * **Go to TA reviews and use TA labs.** I will never not go to a review if it's offered. The reviews in my history class were invaluable, you could not pass the test without it. My environmental bio reviews, they showed us >70 slides, then promised us that every single thing on the test had been mentioned on at least one slide during the review, then let us choose 10 random numbers and they told us the letter answer for that question, which guaranteed as long as I memorized the slides (a high bar, but still a concrete and achievable goal) and the questions + answers, I would get an A. Some reviews aren't as helpful but you never know until you go to at least one, and you never know when they'll break and give you a small but useful hint like \"just skip that, I promise it's not on the exam.\" **I also voice record every TA review** because I found that I would want to remember one specific thing they said and not be able to. This was especially helpful in the Bio one since I hadn't taken photos of each slide. **TA labs are also insanely helpful,** and are the only reason I passed my CS 224 class.\n   * If you really can't understand something, you have three options. Try to figure it out with the textbook, see if studying with a group can clear it up (see below), and if that doesn't work, schedule time with your professor. Most of the time they are eager to assist and love an enthusiastic student (see miscellaneous) and you will rarely get a professor unwilling to help.\n   * **Decide if this is something you can study best for alone or with a group, or both.** For me, generally I ask these questions: Is it subjective? Am I struggling with a topic listed on the study guide? Am I missing notes on a topic listed on the study guide? If the answer to any of these is yes, then a group is better for me. So, for example, American historical philosophy is subjective, I do not understand many parts of linear algebra, and I was missing many notes on Nigerian theatre, so I studied with groups for those classes. However, the list of vocab words in Quichua is very straightforward and factual, I know everything from CS 142 because I already completed the online course, and I never missed notes in environmental biology, so I studied for those on my own. **This is another one that's really up to you.**\n* Group:\n   * Finding a group: Hopefully you already have three people's numbers, and hopefully you've made more friends in 4 months. Maybe you made a groupchat. **Text them and see if any of them have something planned** that you can tag along to or if they're interested. Set something up. If you can't find anything through them, **your class probably has an online group message system.** Don't worry about annoying people, almost no one will be upset by you sending a group message asking for someone to study with, and several people will likely be glad for the invitation. If that doesn't work or isn't an option, **talk to your TAs or professors.** They likely know of someone else who is struggling and could use a partner. A group of around **3-5 generally works best** for me (too big sucks but 2 isn't really enough unless you're close or have worked together before), and if you missed the TA reviews a larger group increases the chances that someone there went to the reviews and can fill you in.\n   * **Have the full study guide printed or in a document where you can edit it** (ie not a pdf). Then share it with your group on Google or bring multiple copies to the group and assign one person to make the master copy. Bring your textbook and all notes.\n   * In your study group, tackle each bullet point on the study guide. Each guide is different, some are lists of topics, some are straight-up copies of the tests, some just mention periods to study. **Figure out how to divide it into small groups to tackle one at a time.**\n   * As you discuss, write down each person's point, no matter how weird or how much you disagree. This won't always be helpful but it could be. Even if you disagree, **hearing everyone's views makes you think differently and gets you more familiar with a topic,** and trying to understand their point may give you new insight into the topic. If it's online, make sure it's shared with everyone so everyone has an opportunity to write whatever they're thinking. If you truly hate it, just ignore it later.\n   * Make sure to **ask any questions** no matter how stupid they sound. Someone else could be wondering the same thing, and different people may have different answers (again, multiple opinions only helps you learn more).\n   * After you finish, **get a picture or electronic copy of the study guide.** I'm always the one who makes it so this is never a problem for me, but what a waste if you don't get the guide you spent so long making!\n   * Here are two examples I have from classes:\n   * American History from 1865-Present: This prof was amazing but insanely difficult. He used to help students study for the LSATs so now he writes exams like the LSATs. He knew they were so hard that even having the questions wouldn't make his exam \"easy to pass\" so he gave us a list of every question, word for word. This was made after attending both TA reviews, in which 30+ students sat and discussed the questions we were most concerned about for 2 hours, talking with the TA and a friend for an extra 2 hours after that, and then spending 4 hrs with two roommates going over the questions we didn't address in review. So 10 hrs at least of group work:[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U3GYUElg6uQvhObuVBiaxm3F0Lg0f9ker6ViJUybr6Y/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U3GYUElg6uQvhObuVBiaxm3F0Lg0f9ker6ViJUybr6Y/edit?usp=sharing)\n   * Drama Performance: Renaissance-Present: This guide was created after 3.5 hrs with complete strangers found through a friend and through the group messaging system:[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD72u13jDz6\\_4lUPNLVqHjm34a7pNfCZ6d12d00jOx0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VD72u13jDz6_4lUPNLVqHjm34a7pNfCZ6d12d00jOx0/edit?usp=sharing)",

                  "text": "* Alone:\n   * This is where I did my best work. After reviewing notes throughout the semester, attending TA reviews, talking to professors, and studying with a group if I thought that necessary, I would study on my own. **This will likely not be the most helpful section of this post,** because what works for me likely doesn't work for most, but I'll tell you anyway since it's my best strategy for success.\n   * Like I said, I have a good memory. This means that no matter how long or big, if I practice something over and over, I can memorize it. This is not true for most of my friends, so I don't know how helpful you'll find it. However, I can utilize this pretty easily with the help of the internet: **I create online quizzes** for my classes with all the information I need, then take them over and over, obsessively, until I can get 100% consistently.\n   * Making quizzes: Until this summer, I didn't know how to use Quizlet, so I used Sporcle, an online quiz website, but now I use Quizlet or Sporcle depending on what I'm trying to accomplish. **These obviously don't work for every topic:** for example, making an online quiz is not the way to study for algebra or history/philosophy, but for those classes, I already knew other ways to study for them (practice problems for algebra, the study guides for history). I used the quizzes when there was **a finite number of things things that needed to be learned:** a list of paintings to memorize, a list of quotes to know the speakers of, 70 slides containing all the information on our final + the answers to 10 random questions. In these situations, it was obvious that memorization was key.\n   * There's not much more to it than this. Once you have a finite list of things to know, make a quiz, then play it until you get 100%. It's the same strategy as flashcards, but quizzes work so much better for me than flashcards ever will.\n   * Here are two quizzes I made:\n   * The Bio quiz. This was a standout because of how much and how diverse the stuff I included was. It's just everything I could think of that might be important from the TA review:[ https://www.sporcle.com/games/optimisms/pws-150-final](https://www.sporcle.com/games/optimisms/pws-150-final)\n   * A more typical example of my quizzes - a list of artwork to know the artist, title, the myth it depicted, and why:[ https://www.sporcle.com/games/optimisms/mastery-mid1](https://www.sporcle.com/games/optimisms/mastery-mid1)\n* Miscellaneous but helpful with grades:\n   * Before each semester, **most profs make their syllabus available somehow. READ IT.** Then **plot each due date** in a calendar somewhere, and check it every day, multiple times a day, to make sure you're on track. I personally use **an app called myHomework,** which I cannot recommend enough. You enter every assignment, due date, and class, and then you get to check them off when you finish. It just worked so well for me.\n   * Make sure you **complete all your other work** (read: not exams) to the best of your ability. It was the best feeling to get to the end of the semester and know that even if I got an 50% on my comp sci final I would still get at least a 93 in the class, or an A. That was because I did all my work before, took advantage of all extra credit, and already had a 99% in the class.\n      * No assignment is too small. Do it all, the **points add up.**\n      * A 20% is better than a 0%, and a 50% is better than a 20%. **Turn in whatever you have** no matter how small. Even if it doesn't meet any points requirements, you may get a few points for trying at all.\n      * **If extra credit is offered, TAKE IT!** I once spent a Saturday walking all over my town, getting muddy, and getting scraped by burrs to take three water samples for my profs research, but the extra 10% on my midterm bumped me up a letter grade. Another class offered a short quiz after every class for 5 extra points, and it got my grade so high that I got an E on the first midterm and still had over 100%. It's not always offered but I can say **it's pretty much always worth it.**\n   * **TALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS.** Another of the biggest differences between my semesters was my relationship with my profs. Luckily second sem I had the best profs ever and they were all really understanding, but having a relationship makes a world of difference. My hist prof bumped me up from an A- (93.6) to an A (94) because I came to his office every week to talk about my grade, our class, and my fascination with his discussions (he was my fave prof so far). My mythology prof was notorious for his insanely difficult papers where no one gets a 10/10. I felt great about my first paper and expected at least an 8, so after I got a 7 I talked to him about why. He cleared up what was needed to improve, and gave me a point back when I explained my confusion with the syllabus, and on the second paper, I worked my ass off and got the only 10 that semester, and at the end of the semester he bumped my grade a whole 6% because he thought I deserved better for my work and got screwed by one grade. My algrebra prof let me resubmit all my overdue hws, bumping me up a full letter grade, because I came to his office all the time for help with assignments. Almost no one takes the time to meet with profs and **they really appreciate when you do.** You don't have to like them, their class, or their subject matter, but talk to them.\n\nWow. That was way more than I ever intended to write here. Hope it helps.",

I also had one semester where my first class wasn\u2019t until 12 and although there were some days when I got up early and went to the gym, there were many others where I stayed in bed way too late. \n\nI think it comes down to personal choice and how tough the classes are. Multiple classes back to back aren\u2019t bad if they aren\u2019t all super challenging and you can snack in between. Also consider how big your campus is and how far you\u2019ll need to travel from one class to the next. If you only have 10 mins between classes but it takes 15 to get from one to the other, well that just won\u2019t work. As far as early vs later start time, consider when you focus best and how you can best use the hours you aren\u2019t in class. I found it was ideal for my classes to start around 9 or 10 so they could end earlier and I could get some homework done as I don\u2019t focus well in the evenings.",

It really depends what you can make yourself do and what works best for your body and sleeping habits. I much prefer being done early in the day to starting late in the day.\n\nFor taking multiple classes in a row, depends how tough they are.

About the most useless thing I'm bringing is stuffed animals, they take up room in my bags but without them I have panic attacks and I can't feel like I'm home, and many of them are just to put on my bed. My parents live 30 minutes away from my school, and my dad works like 10 minutes away, so if I have anything unnecessary it's not too big of a deal to get it home. \n\nI know most of this is bedding, decorations, clothes, cleaning supplies, food, etc that has a specific place in my room, so in the grand scheme of things I won't be keeping a lot of these totes or bags with me. I know I'm basically moving my entire life for about 3-4 months but I can't help feeling guilty for taking stuff I probably really need. For a split second I questioned if I really even needed laundry detergent or towels.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like they're bringing too much, or did they feel like it when they went into freshman year? I don't want to over pack but I don't want to be caught unprepared. Is there a way any of you managed to cut down on stuff you brought, or any advice on how to keep from panicking over the sheer amount of stuff I'm taking?",

I moved across the country so I didn't buy most of my toiletries, bedding, furniture, tech, etc til I was already here and mostly moved in. But moving out I definitely felt this way. I didn't even accumulate that much over the year. I understand the importance of getting rid of things and I got rid of quite a lot, but I'm still not sure I need nearly as much as I have. My only advice would be, if you have the time, go through and give yourself a reason why you need each thing, even if it's as simple as \"it makes it feel like home,\" that's certainly why I have my duffel bag of karate gear even though I really only need my gi and belt. It just feels wrong without it. But having a reason can help you convince yourself you're not overpacked.",

I have two options.\n\n#1: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bWUAwQEzhF6sg0eW8l9B8WLFdrgAEgyY/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nI would take the economics class in the morning and have my classes spaced throughout Tuesdays and Thursdays. The economics professor who teaches this class is rated a 3/5 on RateMyProfessors.com.\n\n#2: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19tLfGJhXo2zei0ZNjLZUY-7RIN8Kwh5i/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nI would have three classes back to back on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The economics professor who teaches this class, however, is one of the top rated professors from my college, with a 4.4/5 on RateMyProfessors.com. This spot just opened up, with the class at the moment having 69/70 people.\n\nAs an incoming dual enrollment freshman, could I get some advice on which option to choose? On one hand, having space in between classes to study would be nice, but on the other hand going with them back to back could be more efficient and also more successful with a highly rated professor. \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "1. Eat breakfast or brunch in your dorm room or on the go if you have early classes or breaks in between them. You can buy Styrofoam (throw away) bowls for cereal, mini cereal boxes, granola bars, or anything that you can heat up in the microwave by just adding some water (minute rice or mac n cheese). It'll really help you in the morning. You also won't have to waste a meal swipe at the dining hall. Also, you should add some food to your college list. Trust me, it helped me in the long run.\n\n2. To save space in your dorm room, only take seasonal clothes when you first come to college. Keep the winter jackets and sweat clothes at home. You can still bring long pants and a light jacket. I learned the hard way by keeping everything from winter until the end of the year. Go back home during the breaks to pick up your winter stuff and then go back home to drop it off whenever the weather gets warmer.\n\n3. At parties, if you don't want to drink, buy Gatorade, Powerade, non alcoholic glass soda bottles, or powdered mixers. You can also pour these drinks into an empty bottle and pretend that you're drinking. Just make sure that you always hold your bottle and don't place it down anywhere. For the glass soda bottles, tear off the labels and no one will know the wiser. I did this at parties with my old roommate and it worked out well for us. Most people will never get curious of you if they see any of these drinks in your hand.\n\nEven if someone does find out, then don't make a big deal about it. Just be honest with them and leave the party if they give you a hard time.\n\n4. Always go to parties with someone else or with a group of people. Never travel alone to parties if you have to walk quite a bit to a party. Even though that you might feel safe, you never know what can happen. Take a DD (designated driver) or the campus bus to a party if it's too far of a walk for you. Remember: DD's are Not only for drunk people. Bad weather, no bus services during that night, etc.\n\nEven if you're not a party person, just go to one for the experience. Apartment (off campus) parties and Frat parties usually have their differences. If you don't like it or feel uncomfortable, then do something else with your roommate(s) or friends. No one is forcing you to go. It's all by choice and personal opinion.\n\n5. To save space and time in the bathroom, buy a 2 in 1 shampoo and body wash bottle so you only have to carry one bottle. Also, bring your comb, tooth brush, shaving stuff, etc. all in your shower caddy. To keep all you stuff organized, buy a travel size bag or two to keep everything together. You can shower, shave, brush your teeth, and comb your hair all in one trip. On an extra note, make sure that you buy a big enough shower caddy to hold everything.\n\nP.S. Buying a tall mirror for your dorm room wouldn't be a bad idea as well.",

You\u2019ll need to put in a lot of work depending on how great of a student you are but you can 100% handle it. The biggest thing I\u2019ve noticed is paying really good attention in class and then taking excellent notes. If you do not know something or get stuck, go to office hours and tutoring and fix it ASAP. With a course load like that, you cannot afford to fall behind or miss a key topic. \n\nHave fun fellow math major! :)",

So if you've already taken one, you have an equivalent score in the other. Only reason why an SAT would improve that is because there is a 30 point range for each ACT score, so for example, if you earned a 29 on the ACT, that could be a 1330-1350 on the SAT, while a 30 becomes a 1360-1380. If you think you can do 30 points better on the SAT than before, because you've maybe taken another math class or practiced your reading comprehension or whatever, then taking the SAT might be worth it.",

I thought I had a passion for strictly neuroscience when entering college last year and then found that I have a passion for philosophy as well, so I decided to pick up philosophy as a second major. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a whimsical decision, though. Try to do some research and see how it affects your four year plan and how many credit hours per semester you would have to take in order to receive degrees in both areas.\n\nAnd what I mean by seeing how it affects your four year plan is comparing the two degree maps (if your school offers them) to see if any classes cross over. Given the different majors, I would doubt there is much crossover in core classes, but no worries! \n\nMeet with your current (or future advisor if you have yet to meet one) advisor to discuss what the future plan may look like with both degrees being tackled at the same time. \n\nIf you are applying to professional/grad school or are thinking of doing so one day then it is definitely nice for adcomms to see well-rounded individuals tackling majors in different areas of interest. \n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to post them here or PM me.

A good chunk of people (I think the majority?) change majors freshman year at least once. I started as a psychology major but took intro to sociology per my advisor's recommendation and loved it so much I changed my major.

                  "text": "Honestly, meeting new people happens naturally in college. My school is largely comprised of out of state students, so most people came to campus without friends and had to seek them out.\n\nI would suggest just taking chances and talking to anyone who sits near you in all of your classes. I felt stupid doing it, but everyone feels a little silly and out of place. Most people are receptive because they\u2019re also freshman without a lot of friends in a new place. Also: ask people to study/agree to study with anyone that asks you. That\u2019s a great bonding experience that\u2019s also very casual, so if the two (or however many) of you don\u2019t click as friends you still have a reason to be around each other and it doesn\u2019t become awkward. A lot of socializing in college is just taking chances and being willing to feel a little dumb for doing so; as a person with social anxiety, that wasn\u2019t easy for me, but you\u2019ll have plenty of chances every semester, so even if your first semester goes as poorly as mine did you\u2019ll still have another to try again (and another and another...).",

          "text": "It's definitely different. My university isn't huge, but it's above 12,000 students so it's quite an adjustment from my class of 99 back home.\n\nI think the #1 thing to remember your freshman year is that everything is going to be okay. That's my advice for basically any question. The transition could very well suck and you may look up two months in and realize you don't really have any friends (this pretty much happened to me). But with the benefit of hindsight, it doesn't even look that bad because I know how my story ends and I know that eventually I would find a small, but close-knit friend group. So many things change in your first year of college that some things are bound to go really poorly, whether that's socially or academically. Please, please, remember that there's still plenty of time to smooth things out.\n\nAs far as things specific to going from a small high school to a big college, the thing I suffered the most from is no longer feeling special - not in the sense of being better than others, but in the sense of mattering. I was an overachiever in high school, but it wasn't just going from the front of the class to the middle of the pack that was the problem. In a small community, provided you had a good experience growing up, you really feel like you *are* something to other people. I felt like I had an identity in high school -- not only being \"smart\", but other things, too. I was pretty good at tennis. I played baseball and loved that sport. I was one of the most spirited people in the pep block cheering on the football and basketball teams. If things don't go right at first in college, you can really lose that feeling of mattering to the people around you. You're just one of thousands in your graduating class. Everyone has their own activities they used to do, and no one cares about yours. Instead of hanging out with the same dozen people you used to hang out with since kindergarten who know you, your parents, your grandparents, and everyone in the small farm town you grew up in, you have brief interactions with a couple hundred people every day who you might want to be friends with but don't really know anything about. It can be jarring to your sense of self-worth when you suddenly feel so disposable.\n\nI hope you avoid ever feeling that way, but there's a decent chance that you will at some point. Just remember that just because things have changed doesn't mean *you* have become any less important. Your roommate may not care about where you're from or your high school stories, but you should still care about them. It may not matter to anyone else that you were the leader on your high school wrestling team, but it matters to who you are. You're still the person who was beloved in your hometown. You're still the person who was confident enough to perform a solo in front of the whole town. You're still the one who made the homecoming court. Or, maybe you were none of those things back in high school, but you're still the person who cut through all the bullshit and drama, made it through anyway, and did well enough to make it into a college. \n\nCollege is so different from high school, especially a small high school, but it's not an adjustment you can't handle. Stay positive and remember that you earned your spot just like everyone else.",

          "text": "Graduated with 120 people (so a little over your limit, haha) and then moved out of state to go to Arizona State (student body of about 50,000). It was *weird*. I\u2019ve been going to school with 60 of the same people from when I was 5 until I was 17, and starting over completely was something I\u2019d never done before. The classes with 300 people in them felt uncomfortable and impersonal, and I found it difficult to understand lectures because I was used to classes where I could easily voice to my teacher that I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nIf you can take at least one or two small classes, I\u2019d recommend doing that ASAP because it\u2019s probably a lot more comfortable for you. I know that everyone ALWAYS tells freshmen to join clubs, and the advice is so redundant that I mostly ignored it, but clubs were where I was able to thrive and finally meet and connect with people. If you do have to take a ton of lectures, reach out to your prof for help if you need it and ask your TAs! I feel like TA\u2019s were an insanely underutilized resource in my classes, but there\u2019s always a ton of them that no one\u2019s asking for help so they\u2019re a lot more reachable than your prof. Also, they\u2019re younger and a lot more chill and approachable. Keep in mind that they themselves are students, so they can\u2019t give you as much help as your prof can and they need to work on their assignments as well, but they took the same classes you\u2019re taking pretty recently and they\u2019re knowledgeable in their fields. Plus, they\u2019ve got good relationships with professors in their departments (usually), can tell you who to take for what, and can help you a lot with getting research positions. I had some less than stellar TA\u2019s, but I also had a LOT of really cool ones (one of whom basically gave me a template for asking for research positions and then put in a good word with his principal investigator so I got placed in a good lab \ud83d\ude4f )\n\nI think the most surprising thing was how much I ran into people I knew. The school is so massive that I figured I wouldn\u2019t ever see anyone I knew unless I sought them out, but the bigger classes make run-ins more likely than I would\u2019ve thought. You\u2019re going to have a LOT of classes with the other freshman in your major, and you\u2019ll probably be able to find people with the same schedule as you if you pay attention to the other people in your lectures enough. Realizing that really helped make the class sizes feel more manageable, and once I got the nerve to go seek out interactions with those 20 or so students, I had people to sit with during lectures and solid study partners. Even if people aren\u2019t in the exact same classes and time slots, almost all freshmen in your major are going to have to take the same classes and subjects, so it\u2019s really easy to find study partners (which I think is a great way to make friends).",

At least compared to my floormates.) Almost anything you forget can easily be bought in-store or online nearby.\n\nThe only exceptions to this are personal paperwork and IDs -- I had a problem freshman year because my college needed either my social security card or my passport to employee me, and I didn't have either. I'm not even sure I would recommend this though because of theft and how easily things can get lost, especially when you share a space with a roommate.\n\nI guess related to that are: personal pictures/meaningful letters and the like if you're the sentimental type. And books! I left most of my books at home but a few times in class we'd have a research assignment and I'd want to cite a book I'd left at home. But again, consider if your library has said book before you take it. If they do, it's not worth it. Books are heavy.\n\nEDIT: Also, an air mattress! It's a huuuge help when hosting friends or traveling to others' places.",

I brought the fridge (given to me for free by a family friend) and my room mate got the microwave. buy these during black friday senior year so you get those extra savings. alternatively, you can get these for really cheap at the end of the year when everyone is moving out of dorms. check your uni groupmes for sales.\n\n***EXTENSION CORDS***: the people who plan dorms have the worst outlet placement ever. I had multiple surge protectors in my room. life hack: get a really long extension cord that's not bulky and loop it to the rails of your loft bed. that way, you don't need a 10ft phone charger and you can charge your laptop in your bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe Bring:\n\n***Steamer/Iron:*** I needed one because a lot of my clothes wrinkle easily and I need to wear a lot of business attire, but if you aren't wearing these clothes, you can get away with it by hanging your clothes in the shower and letting the hot steam do it's job. alternatively, you can use a hair dryer or my favorite, a flat iron/straightener to do the job.\n\n***Printer:*** it really depends on your major. if you're gonna be printing things a lot for class (I guess you English Majors??) BRING ONE. if not, then you can get away with using campus printing or bumming one of a friend. \n\n***A FAN***: I go to UGA and the older dorms have one of the worst HVAC ever. if you're going somewhere in the south, PLEASEEEE get a fan. the dorms don't get that cold in the summer, and the HVAC is really wonky at the start of every term. \n\n***CONDOMS***: please don't get an sti/std. even if you aren't sexually active, a good chunk of people have sex in college. an accidentally pregnancy can make your life hell. most universities offer free condoms, so check those out too. better safe than sorry\n\n***TV:*** are you really gonna have time to watch tv/play games? it's nice to have an all, but could your laptop suffice? most of the time, they're a pain to move in/out and to set up. don't bring it if it's gonna be neglected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't Bring:\n\n***Too many decorations***: you're dorm might not be as big as you think. you might not use all the decorations or you might not like how it looks. I recommend you bring what decorations you're SURE to use and like, and then buy things after you move in. that way. you can get dimensions correct.\n\n***Way too many clothes***: you won't have space for them. you won't wear all of them. bring your staple wardrobe. I got away with this because I don't have that many clothes, but definitely split your clothes by weather. go home for thanksgiving and swap out summer styles for your winter wardrobe. \n\n***Hecka stationary***: you'll forget about it and won't use it. it'll clutter your desk. just bring the basics. I recommend getting an iPad and an apple pencil (the 309$ one with student discount) and taking your notes on that because it saves so much space it's really convenient.",

          "text": "I had a  rug in my  dorm last  year, and oh my goodness it made a huge difference! I actually laid on the floor a couple of times because of that rug lol. I would also say to limit how many clothes you  take. I took way  too  many clothes last year. I would say, pick out what you think you need, then half each  clothing type (except   undergarments), and take that. For the Fall semester, start with clothes comfortable in the summer/fall transition, plus  1-2 hoodies,  then  switch  your   clothes out  for winter clothes during Fall  break or  Thanksgiving break,  and  vice versa in the  spring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReusable water bottles! Your campus likely has water fountains everywhere, and  those  are  easier  to  come by than purchasing water bottles, you  save money, and  you save  the environment. I am  not sure  about  other states, but in Florida, the  first half of the Fall semester can get  pretty rainy, so carrying a small umbrella or rain jacket is useful (this is a good reminder for me, because I stopped carrying one after the rain slowed down lol.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not obsess too much over room decor. Wait  until you see how much space you have before doing that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFridge and microwave are lifesavers if you are tired of on campus food. Especially if your fridge has a freezer (ICE CREAM WOOT WOOT). Have at least 2 back packs with you. One for school books and classes, and one for recreational trips, clubs, or anything other than school. If you want to really go crazy, you could have 2 separate back packs for MWF and TR classes, but that is a little extreme.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't try to \"get your money's worth\" in the cafeteria. It will be there all 4 years, and the foods available will show up again. Unless it is your favorite food item and only shows up once a week or every couple weeks, try not to pig out. BUT bring a zip lock bag with you  to the cafeteria to smuggle  out cereal, salt, pepper, cookies, said favorite food, etc. My school lets  students buy reusable to-go containers for $5, but technically has rules surrounding it, so I stopped  using it and just went with the  ziplock bag system lol. It was useful on chocolate  chip cookie day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo  not be afraid to socialize  with  people.  The  Fall semester is  known  to be the time  of year where everyone is  friendly  and  trying to make friends. People will welcome you  being outgoing, even  if you force  yourself to be or are awkward in the  process.  People  at college are very forgiving of that, because we have  all been there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDON'T WEAR YOUR  STUDENT  ID  ON A  LANYARD  AROUND YOUR NECK!!!! That is  the number  #1 way to  point out a freshman in the crowd. It  is totally fine  to keep your student ID  in the lanywrd,  as long as it  isn't on your neck. Keep it in your pocket, tie it around your wrist, keep  it in a wallet you carry, in your  phone case, phone case  wallet, anything but  your  neck. If  you must keep it around your  neck,  hide  it  under clothes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile freshmen packs are a  real thing  (groups  of freshmen walking around together  and never walking alone), I wouldn't worry  about that stigma as long as you  enjoy being in  a  group. If you find being in a  group  of  freshmen fun,  then don't  worry  about this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not sure how it is at other colleges, but at my school, nobody except faculty, visitors, parents, and freshmen use the food trays in our  cafeteria. For whatever  reason, nobody uses the food trays,  and it is  a surefire way  to  spot someone  who doesn't  go to our  school or  is  new. I don't  know why that  trend started or  what  happened to make it that way, but  it has  been  like  that for years before I  even  showed   up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know  a lot  of this advice is  not  about dorm rooms, but  once I started typing, thoughts just started  coming up. (Plus  it is like 1 am  for me right now lol.)",

      "text": "We see a lot of posts this time of year with people wondering how to study/work/time manage in general better. I thought it would be useful to go over some ideas that can be lost in the shuffle. \n\nThis is especially useful for young students looking to develop good habits going into their first/second years. This will be long so I have **Bolded** the most important pieces. Some important ideas that don't appear because I felt like they are discussed a lot, but I could explain:\n\n**Time Management**\n\n**Studying**\n\n**Honesty**\n\n**Being Able to Say No**\n\n**Sleeping** Please sleep adequately it is detrimental to your body not to. **7-9 Hours** (3)\n\n\n**1: Diet/Fitness** - Your diet and fitness levels do no only change how you perform in sports situations. The stomach and diet related factors have been shown to influence mental health including depression and anxiety (1 and 2). \n\nWhat does this mean? You should be strict about what you eat if you want to perform at your best. Whatever diet you follow, it should be one that **makes you feel energized and healthy**. If you are constantly sick or under the weather or under energized these are signs of improper nutrition and fitness. \n\nFor fitness, incorporating moderate/heavy exercise into 4-5 days of your week can make a world of difference. Your body is much more resilient than a lot of people give themselves credit for. **This is a valuable lifelong endeavor and college is a great time to develop lifelong fitness habits.**\n\nSome big pitfalls can be lack of preparation for meals, lack of discipline with workout programs, and falling under negative peer influences. All of these issues are avoidable with proper planning and commitment, you answer to yourself with this topic. \n\n**2: Study Groups and Social Studying** - If you are going to spend 2-4 hours a day **studying this time will be much more enjoyable if there is a social element to at least part of it**. Forming peer groups of an appropriate size ideally within your major, especially once you've started with major specific classes. This group can be flexible and not everyone has to be at every session, but you should always have people you can rely on. \n\nIf you were to miss a class, you'll want to have people who can share notes/assignments/information from that class. The teaching/learning skills that you build in a group study team are incredibly important as well. It is quite common to realize that you don't fully understand something once you try and teach it to someone else and now you have a chance to brush up and get a more complete understanding. You may also find that **your friends are better at explaining certain ideas than the professor**, you can get a different view into a complex topic.  \n\nYour performances in classes is important and enjoying the studying is definitely possible. \n\n**3: Mentors and Confidants** - College can be a new and exciting, but also frightening world. Even the most mature young adults can benefit from insights from those who are more experienced in certain fields and experiences than they are. I wouldn't just limit this to class. **You should seek out advisors in each aspect of your career whether it be professional/research/social/classroom/leadership related.** I have found my experience with professors mentoring me through my major that it is a great feeling to just discuss everything that you are doing and take stock of the future. As a mentor myself, it is incredible to meet young people who are interested in something you are passionate about. I have found that my advisors/supervisors/mentors have always been incredible receptive to my questions/concerns/musing and I can't see myself where I am without them. \n\n**4: Accountability** - At the end of the day you have to answer to yourself for what you have done. Part of being able to reflect positively on your accomplishments is to recognize areas where you are coming up short and improve on them. I personally have had a lot of issues with expecting too much of myself sometimes, it can be difficult to find a balance. \n\nYou are the only person who's expectations matter, **improving on your past self** is a great marker for progress. **Superiority to others and perceived in-superiority cause fleeting happiness and lasting suffering**, neither of which are solid goals. You should have realistic expectations of how you want your present and future to go and adjust them as you go. **You have to decide when to hunker down and put in maximum effort.** What can you do now that will provide you with lasting fulfillment and satisfaction? \n\n**End** \n\nI am going to be doing some presentations in the fall at my university for students and I will probably post similar stuff on productivity/scheduling/networking and getting jobs and research positions if you guys are interested. Thanks for reading \n\n**CITATIONS**\n\n\n1:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166223613000088\n\n2:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nmo.12378\n\n3:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352721815000157",

Ultimately, the professors you interact with on a regular basis like that will come to see you as a pupil worth going out of their way to help (from what I've observed).",

I don't think a 4.0 has to be your goal, but you should still aim high... while being realistic and taking care of yourself.",

Do you have enough time to get from band practice to your first class? 1 hour to change (if needed), get to campus, find parking (if you drove/carpooled), and get to class can be rough depending on how far away your college campus is from your high school practice area. From personal experience, 11am is prime \"there is no parking at all\" time. If you're reliant on any buses does the bus schedule work with that?\n\n2. T/Th is a pretty long day, starting at 8am and getting out at 5pm. Are you used to that length of day? The hour and a half break between Pol and US Hist will help break it up, but I'd consider swapping US Hist to M/W if it works in your schedule. Three college level classes in one day can be intense (depending on the class, person). \n\n3. Are you required to take that many politics/history courses? Are each of them meeting a separate GE or Degree requirement? I'm only asking because from personal experience it's pretty rare for people to need to take that many politics-centered classes. Not saying it's a bad idea, it's just different than I'm used to seeing and I want to make sure you're on the right track. \n\nAnd then not really a concern, but a note: You're probably going to have to take 1-2 classes over summer and winter breaks if your goal is to get an AA/AS in 2 years. While 12 units per semester is considered full time, 15 is needed to be done in 2 years.",

My high school requires me to take US History so I\u2019m stuck at that time.\n\n3. I\u2019m taking two politics classes because the topic interests me and it fulfills different (and required) areas of Liberal Education needed for me to get my associate\u2019s degree. Also, another class my high school requires is American Politics.\n\nSince I\u2019ve taken 2 AP classes and (hopefully) will be getting 5\u2019s, that will get me an additional 12 credits at the college I\u2019m attending which would set me up well to get the 64 credits needed for an associate\u2019s degree.",

But with more time also comes more responsibility: getting your stuff done, not eating too much, not drinking and goofing off too much. Once you join clubs, im sports, student gov you will quickly find your time filled up again",

If I take that class, I don't think I will take Linear Algebra at the same time, mainly because I don't wan't to overload myself with difficult math classes in freshmen year itself. In addition, I am also trying to finish my general education requirements as soon as possible. In fact, my 4th class will be an Art History class that fulfills a gen ed requirement. However I also have a natural science requirement in both my major(s?) and my gen eds. Thus should I take a 5th class starting a science sequence or should I wait till second semester of freshmen year to start taking my science class?",

Typically, a science class will be 4 credits (3 lecture hours, 1 lab), which can be maybe 6 hours of classroom work a week. I would personally look to fulfilling a different gen-ed your first semester, but that's up to you. Calc III should be 4 credits, I think, so you'll already probably be at 13; 17 is beyond what I would recommend for a first-semester student, especially with a lab.\n\nAs for L.A.: it's honestly a very different kind of math than calculus is. Calculus is mostly applying the plug-and-chug computation-heavy arithmetic you did as an underclassman in high school. (Calc III changes this up a bit to be more visually focused, but it's still mostly computation.) Linear algebra is more about manipulating data, understanding structures, writing and proving things. FWIW, I took differential equations, abstract algebra, and linear algebra at the same time -- and since they were quite different, I was able to compartmentalize everything. But if that's not something you want to commit to right now, that's okay.\n\nI'm also a math major (though not CS) - so feel free to ask me anything else.",

I'm a little behind in math and haven't had a real math class in almost a decade, but I've been studying using things like khan academy and I tested into the pre-calc/trig level of classes. Does anyone know if having to take both pre-calc and trig (I am pretty sure they are both required pre-reqs to Calc at my school) will mess me up a lot with my major? I knew I'd have to take at least one class before Calc and I thought maybe I'd be able to make it up over the summer, but two classes worries me a little. \n\nAlso, since Calc 1 is recommended for the first semester, I'm worried that the rest of my classes might be hard or impossible without that math knowledge already.

If you find yourself struggling, find people who are doing well (they usually can be found at the front of class or sucking up in office hours, but they usually agree to studying). If you\u2019re doing well (by the time you get past the aforementioned basics), try to find some people who are struggling and \u201ctutor\u201d them. Each time you meet, go over new material (review everything over the week before a test). Teaching is a great way to learn! Try to work with acquaintances if possible; you\u2019ll end up slacking off around friends and it can be awkward to approach/schedule meetings with total strangers. Accountability for studying is one of the key benefits of a group.\n\nPractice problems are good, my prof gave us tons of study materials and like fourteen sets of flash cards (which I can post if anyone\u2019s interested). Flash cards are great because you can mix and match the order AND do them backwards for practice with retrosynthesis. Remember to write out mechanisms, don\u2019t just skip straight to the answer. Also, try to make up your own problems, because this can help you think creatively around hard mechanisms (a valuable skill in many science classes that isn\u2019t often taught). \n\nAnd finally, a list of things you probably already know: talk to your prof (and lab instructors, TAs, other students, Chem majors, etc.), keep up with the material (and go to class ready to learn literally every day- DO NOT SKIP if you want to do well), check out other explanations online if you don\u2019t understand your prof\u2019s (masterorganicchemistry.com), ask for help when you need it and help others when you don\u2019t, keep a positive attitude about both the class and your ability to learn, and cultivate a study plan the both works for you and keeps you accountable.\n\nGood luck, good skill, and have fun!",

Everyone liked him, but for sure your interests are going to be a little different. Freshmen are interested in hanging out drunk, going out, talking about their high school, etc. etc. So, In all likelihood, you will feel a little different. I would suggest to try and find people in similar situations, or make friends from classes/tutorials/clubs/gym/mutual friends. If you know anyone who is attending atm, any year, feel free to try and get to know some people through them.\n\nIn the end though, you have to realize that you may have different goals than most of these kids. You've worked a long time, and although you're still super young in the grand scheme of things, you're still a fair bit more experienced than a freshman. Really make the most of your time at college though, it's super fun and the best time to try things out.",

But my main reason to go in person to a University is to be in a supportive, educational environment where I feel encouraged to learn. \n\nI think just reaching out to other classmates and coworkers will be a good start to start talking to people. I'd also make it a goal to join at least one club or organization that peaks your interest. Try not to judge younger people to harshly based solely on their age. I've talked to some younger people that are actually pretty cool. They like learning from older people, so sometimes I feel wise and helpful. Just be open and honest about your situation, not everyone has followed the straight path and you will find good people eventually, just takes trial and error!",

Honestly, as  long  as  you don't  make a  huge deal about  it  or don't  care about the age  difference, nobody else will. Your study habits and lifestyle will definitely be more matured and possibly mellow than the 18 year old freshmen, but you can have just  as much fun as everyone  else on campus. Not many people really care about age  in college.  I  know a 25-year old who is either a  junior or senior, and some people between his age and mine who are  around  the junior level, and while  they live off campus, they seem to still enjoy being on campus. Yes, there  are  plenty  of 17-19 year  olds,  but there are tons of 20-26  year olds as well. You will probably  find  more  freshmen  and sophomores  at the parties, while the juniors  and  seniors  are at  the clubs, organizations, and  studying. Nobody  cares about age  though,  so  just have fun! (You  will definitely feel like  age affects your  experience  if  you spend all  your time in your dorm, apartment, house, etc. So get out and socialize lol.)",

I spent my Saturday nights working on homework or studying.

You will be required to use certain mathematics in your Circuits class before it's covered in Calc 2, possibly many weeks before. The Circuits class will assume that you are perfectly proficient in Calc 2 and do not need to be taught it, regardless of whether they're listed as co-reqs or not. And if you don't know the content from Calc 2 *before it is taught* then you will fail Circuits.",

Make sure you also wipe down the outside of the toilet, like with the Clorox wipes. You'll probably need to mop the floors but more rarely than the other stuff. Make sure you put a small trash can (you can just use plastic shopping bags for trash bags) in the bathroom and empty it when you clean. Make sure you and your roommates understand who is supposed to do it, by when, and make sure wet/dirty towels and clothes don't build up in there, with the humility it'll get gross.",

Doesn't have to be a long conversation or anything, just make an observation to someone sitting next to you in class, for example. It gets easier and easier and soon enough you can confidently talk to basically anyone.",

Just talk about assignments with them and offer to study with them. I ended up working together with classmates by helping with online quizzes and assignments.\n\nAsk to eat meals with people. Classmates that you have started to become acquaintances with? \"Hey, can I eat lunch/dinner with you?\"\n\nYou have to remember that most freshmen are in the same boat as you and are probably wanting to make friends just like you!\n\nI wish you the best of luck! :)",

                  "text": "> would a classless Friday be feasible ?\n\nMaybe - only now do I realize you have math 5 days a week so it'd be hard to move that. But if a 12:30-1:45 CIS110 option exists on T/Th, I'd consider moving to that to try out how a 1 class Friday feels.\n\n> What makes it exactly intense ?\n\nJust a lot of different physical class attendance on top of what is already a difficult major. I realize it's probably not more than 15-18 credits but spread out over 5 full days really adds up on auxiliary, non-class front - walking to class, eating lunch, trying to find something to do on campus for your 70 minute gap instead of spending 20-30 minutes round trip to get back to your dorm, etc. There's only so much studying you can do in a library, and it's not everyone's cup of tea. \n\nYou're gonna spend 15 hours a week sitting in a classroom , and that's more or less inescapable unless you take online classes - which I forgot to mention.\n\nBut you do have a choice on how you'll spend your other time. Personally I would prefer to minimize the time I spent on campus idling between classes (like your three gaps on Wednesday) and time spent going to and from class. \n\nA class that meets twice a week for 75 minutes each and takes 15 minutes to get there takes up 180 minutes a week, or about 3 hours. A class that meets three times a week for 50 minutes each and takes 15 minutes to get there takes up 210 minutes a week, or 3.5 hours. That adds up to three-quarters of a day over the course of a semester spent walking (which is not without its health benefits, but that's not wholly pertinent to the conversation).\n\nSimilarly, you've got lots of 70 minute windows over the course of the week where you'll probably end up finding that they're too short to go home and back (since that eats up almost half of the window) but too long to just walk to class. You'll probably end up studying in the library for these gaps, but - depending on your study habits - the efficiency of that drops after a while. I hated having such a gap once a week, let alone 4-6 times a week (since one of those gaps on Monday/Wednesday will be partially spent on lunch).\n\nThe TLDR of my rambling nonsense is that you may find yourself quasi-wasting a lot of time over the course of the week and wanting to reclaim it. A classless Friday would help a lot with that, or even just moving the CIS.\n\nLikewise, unless the state of Kentucky/Kansas require you to be in a non-online lab science course (either for your major or for just general education requirements) I'd try to see if I could get my science credit fulfilled by an online class - something like astronomy(?) instead of going twice a week to chem. If that's somehow in your major (which is doubtful) then disregard.\n\nSorry if this is long, it's kinda stream-of-consciousness.",

One thing to remember is that the 16 hours is instruction and lab time. In college much of your work is done outside of the classroom (studying, writing papers, research, etc...). A rule of thumb I always use is multiply your credit hours by 2 and that's how much work to budget outside of the classroom. so 16 x 2 is 32, plus the original 16 and you get 48.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said it all depends on you as a student. Good at math? Well then you may spend less time there, but that number is a good starting point when budgeting time especially if you are going to be working too.",

          "text": "I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re getting 17 hours? But this schedule is definitely doable if you\u2019re interested in the classes and make sure to do all the assignments. Here\u2019s my few notes:\n\n1. Always start your assignments early; many times it\u2019ll seem like a problem is straight forward, but, when working through it, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s not, and it\u2019s a lot nicer to catch it a week before it\u2019s due than the night before it\u2019s due. Plus, if it is straight forward, then you don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore. \n\n2. A lot of early math and CS classes will base exams on assignment/homework questions, and I\u2019ve even had professors allow notes during exams or pull exam questions straight out of the homework. So, make sure to keep up, go to class, and (again) do the assignments. \n\n3. If you liked algebra in high school, linear algebra is great. It\u2019s been one of my favorite math classes in college. Also super useful if you\u2019re interested in understanding some concepts in machine learning, statistics, and big data/data analytics. So, if you\u2019re interest in those, know that it\u2019ll eventually all connect back. \n\n4. Intro programming II should be pretty straight forward since it looks like you\u2019ve already claimed credit for the first one. Just try not to forget anything in the semester you\u2019re not taking a programming class. Even better, start some independent programming projects. They\u2019ll keep you fresh and can look great on a college resume.\n\n5. Follow the instructions to a T. So many people lost LOTS of points in my programming classes because the format of their print statements were just slightly off and the TA\u2019s grader script counted the whole thing as wrong. Math exams tend to be short (as in only a few questions) so every answer has a pretty high point value. I once lost 20 points on a linear algebra exam because I missed a \u201cnot\u201d in a question. \n\n6. Be VERY careful about sharing code. Even if your friend really needs help and it\u2019s due in an hour. I\u2019ve seen multiple people reported to the dean and even kicked out of CS because they either shared or used someone else\u2019s code. You can change the comments and the formatting all you want, but they\u2019ll probably catch you eventually. \n\n7. It looks like you didn\u2019t give yourself much free time around lunch time M/T for your first semester. Make sure to bring snacks or a small lunch if you can get away with eating in class so you\u2019re not distracted by hunger. \n\n8+. Try to have fun. Take classes you enjoy. Get experience outside of the classroom (research, internships, independent projects) related to the field you\u2019re interested in*. Talk to people on the first day so it\u2019s not awkward all year. Make connections so you have other people to work with on problems (and have partners for any pair programming or the occasional take-home exam). Don\u2019t be afraid to go to office hours. Mark when and where they are in your calendar so you don\u2019t have an excuse to avoid them. \n\nI can\u2019t say much for your other classes, although I\u2019ve heard some horror stories about diff. eq. and discreet math, but I\u2019ve heard German is a great language/culture class.  Hope everything works out! \n\n*ones outside your interest are also good and could lead to better opportunities too.",

There are a lot of objectively harmful diets like the cabbage soup diet or that tapeworm one (which is just plain recklessness, I wouldn't call it a diet).\n\nA lot of diets do have merit... if done properly with the appropriate body type. Each of the diets like keto, veganism, and vegetarianism can be beneficial but they can also be harmful. It entirely depends on the person's state (bp, fat content, etc.), their genetics and any risk for certain health issues, the goals of the person, and the activity level of the person. For example: keto is suitable for initial short term weight loss in heavier people, but due to the lack of carbs it would be bad for high performance athletes who need a carb source.\n\nIn addition, many people misinterpret these diets or do not follow them as the creator(s) intended. Keto people sometimes ignore types of fat and just eat bacon all day without touching a good fat like avocado. Vegan dieters sometimes eat 3 vegan muffins a day which may be vegan but have a ton of sugar in them. In both of these cases they would be following the diet but eating pretty bad.\n\nBottom line, knowing the fundamentals of biology and learning about food from a scientific perspective will help you more than knowing a few diets. Either way, the human body is very adaptive. There's really no one diet you have to pick if you want one, your body will adapt to thousands of them quite easily. The most important thing is just eating the foods that your body can best use as energy and leading an active stress free lifestyle.\n\nNot just talking to \"dieters\" here. It's worth noting that everyone reading this is technically on a diet. A diet, in it's true definition, is the typical food consumption trend of an animal. Because humans hunt in supermarkets, the term simply equates to what a person regularly buys/eats. Humans actually have the most diverse diet out of all animals because of industrialism and consumerism.\n\nDiversity is important. Society can find a way to make any specific food sound unhealthy if they truly wanted to, it's impossible to follow each person's crazy \"this food will give you cancer\" claims. If you actually did, you would probably have no food available to eat because there are enough crazies out there that each food item has probably already been bashed in some way. If you practice a diverse diet, things like this really don't matter.\n\nJust my two cents, I am passionate about this issue. I know this is going off topic though so I will keep it to this post!",

You  will either  want to bring snacks  with you, drink coffee in the middle, or something. A 3 hour class is already a long class to endure, but  you have  a class right  before it. Also, on Tuesday  and Thursday, you have  to leave at latest around 8:30 am, which is kind of early. On top of that, you are going non-stop till 1:15. Unless  you are a big breakfast eater, you might find  yourself  starving or  exhausted by the end of those days. I am guessing you don't want to show up 5 days  in a row, or have a single class on Fridays based on that schedule, so I would just say to be prepared for the long school days.",

I\u2019ll make this nice and neat and easy to respond to.\n\nI\u2019m going to the University of North Dakota and majoring in mechanical engineering if you\u2019re curious. \n\nThis is my schedule:\n\nIntro to music(fml) (9am-9:50am, M,W,F)\nChemistry lecture(11am-11:50am, M,W,F)\nCalculus(12pm-12:50pm, M,T,TH,F)\nChemistry lab(12pm-2:50pm, W)\nMechanical Engineering(3pm-4:50pm, M,W)\nAnother Chem lecture(7pm-8:30pm, M)\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. What should I bring to college? I went to target a few days ago for school supply shopping and the mindset for college is completely different than high school. I had no idea what I\u2019d need. This question goes for school supplies, dorm appliances, everything you can think of.\n\n2. Best way to meet new people? I want to meet as many new people as I can this year. Before this I\u2019ve never felt the need to meet new people so this would be pretty new to me.\n\n3. How much should I work per week? I want to have enough time to study, have a social life, be in a club or 2. Other than that, I want to spend the rest of my time working.\n\n4. I\u2019m having trouble contacting my roommate so I can ask him want he\u2019s bringing and what I should bring. I\u2019ve tried contacting him via school email and Facebook and no response.",

Bathroom supplies - bathroom caddy (if communal bathrooms), soap/shower supplies, shower shoes, and large enough towels and dish rags. Also cold medicine and toothpaste.\n3. \"Kitchen\" - if you're in the dorms, probably don't have a real kitchen. So just microwaveable plates, bowls and mugs. Silverware, icetray, ziploc bags. A coffee maker if you like coffee. Reusable coffee filter. Food storage. And when you get to your college town, buy a bunch of snacks and easy microwaveable food.\n4. Housecleaning items - laundry basket, laundry detergent, dryer sheets, disinfectant wipes, windex, broom/cheap vaccuum, trash bags, dish soap ((also buying these while I'm moving in))\n5. Electronics - extension cords, surge protectors, ethernet hub, computer/laptop, game system, TV, and a lamp\n\nSo you obviously don't need a lot of this to survive, but I think these are the essentials to live with ease and comfort while you're away from home.",

It's been a while now, but I guess I organically met people through work, classes, clubs, and events around campus. Just try to be as open as possible to spontaneous stuff and getting out of your room to try new things. You will probably find some people, but be patient cause it can take time. I met a lot of my future close friends freshman fall, but it took us some time to get close.\n3. Idk, work load and depends on your own needs. See how you're feeling and adjust as you need to. Also, prioritizing things is great. Like big project from hard class > quiz > small readings. Seems obvious but sometimes trying to do everything perfectly is impossible. \n4. I would maybe give him some time? Honestly there's not much else you can do there.\n\nI would also like to point out that you have class on Monday and Wednesday from like 9 am to 4:50 pm with minimal breaks in between (and then that lab on Monday night? Gross). I've had a similar schedule before and if you can, I recommend trying to change it. It's a lot. If not, bring food and a water bottle with you and be prepared to feel wiped out af on Mondays.",

Some internships prioritize rising juniors because they\u2019ve had more time to learn relevant material. \n\nBut either way, the ideal time to start looking for a summer internship is fall of the previous year. This gives you plenty of time to get out there, apply to many positions, and see what your options are. Go to your school\u2019s career fairs (mine has career fairs in fall and spring) and networking events/conferences, find and apply to positions online, also talk to profs about opportunities early on. In any case, it\u2019s good to get to know your profs so they can be references for you if needed. \n\nGood luck to you!",

Topics include past and present microbial impact on humans and society, ecology and diversity of microbes, biotechnology and microbial impact on the biosphere. \n\nThe class has no lab, and it would raise my credit load to 21. My animal science courses and Honors seminars should be relatively easy (adds up to 5 credits) and not require a ton of studying. My question is, is adding Micro 101 to chem, bio, and pre-calc asking for disaster? I am a strong student and have taken lots of high school science, but I know I will struggle with pre-calc.  Does anyone have an experience with an intro micro class? How much time should I expect to put into it? Are the concepts difficult/new?",

          "text": "Hello! Junior majoring in Animal Sciences here. It sounds like you are an incoming freshman (correct me if I am wrong). The above schedule you posted, at 18 credits is plenty. To address your questions:\n\n>My question is, is adding Micro 101 to chem, bio, and pre-calc asking for disaster? I am a string student and have taken lots of high school science, but know I will struggle with pre-calc.\n\nI would not recommend it. Biology and Chemistry both have labs, and most pre-calc classes have weekly homework. Work from the labs, homework, and studying can become a lot and pile up quickly. If you anticipate that a class will be difficult for you, it is far better to have time that you can dedicate to the class.\n\n>Does anyone have an experience with an intro micro class? How much time should I expect to put into it? Are the concepts difficult/new?\n\nI took Intro to Microbiology at my university, which was a 4 credit class with a lab that met twice a week for two hours each time, every week. It covered exactly the same concepts in your course description. These concepts were all new ideas and built on information from previous biology courses. The course was difficult because of the huge amount of information covered and all the time I put into it to study (4 to 8 hours a week outside of class and labs). I will say it was the most enjoyable class I have taken so far. Hope that answers your questions.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that your advisor is there to help point you in the right direction. Part of that includes helping you to create good a schedule for the semester. It sounds to me like he is suggesting the intro to micro class as a class that you would enjoy (in addition to being required for your minor). I would stay with the 18 credits you have right now and take the time to adjust to college. Classes that you expect to be easy may not be that way. Regardless, a planner and good time management skills will be your best friend. If you have any more questions, please reach out and ask! Hope this helps!",

Philosophy and the technical presentation classes are gen ed's. I am considering adding a 6th class, Logic and Proof in Mathematics, which would increase my credits to 17 for my first freshman semester. I want to list why the pros and cons of this and to see if any of you have any strong opinions about whether I should add that 6th class.\n\nPros:\n\n* I already have programming experience; from my understanding, the programming class I am taking assumes that students have zero coding experience.\n* I already know a bit about Matrix and Linear Algebra, plus it seems very interesting to me (note: this course focuses on computation rather than proofs; the latter is a different course I would take later on). I should be able to skip Calculus I and II because of AP credit.\n* From my understanding the symposium class does not have a lot of work associated with it.\n* Honors classes (which applies to all courses I would take except for this class I am adding) are capped at 20 students, which I think will make learning easier.\n* I consider myself to be a good student.\n\nCons:\n\n* First semester at college, obviously I don't want to overwhelm myself.\n* The Programming teacher is known for giving a lot of work, which would mean I would have less time to handle a 6th class (although I also hear that he is a very good professor too).\n* The Logic and Proof class would be 10 minutes after Matrix and Linear Algebra. My concern is whether that is enough time (the classes are in the same building so transportation is not an issue).\n\nI go to orientation in a few days where I can ask an adviser at the school, however I though I ought to ask here too (I will also post on my school's subreddit).\n\nAny opinions would be welcome.

Try not to get yourself so focused on one thing to where you'll be extremely devastated when something doesn't work out, because that really hurt me.

You're a student with a name, and you're a blank canvas when you start college. You get to define who you are and what you truly want out of college and in life. And yeah, idk how your college works but 19 credits is way too many starting out, and for most people in general. I would check into that. Also, have you already taken gen chem 1 and 2?",

I also found it harder to make friends--people say in universities, its easier to make friends. I pretty much glided through high school without much studying. In college, I really had to learn how to buckle down and study. Some never-studiers still do well in college though.\n\nAnother thing is that you're kind of on your own and have to figure things out yourself. As someone who was the first person in their family to go to college, I struggled with that a lot. Most instructors don't care if you show up, do the work, or not because you're the one paying to be there. There's no dedicated \"meet with your school counselor day\" and you have to schedule it yourself if you want one. Just really no hand holding from off the bat like in high school but if you do need help, there are resources. People with helicopter parents tend to love college because of freedom like this.\n\nSome classes will have less than 10 people left by the end of the semester. Its ironic because you'll remember how on the 1st day of class, there was a dozen other people hoping the teacher will give them a waitlist code to get in and most of them if not all didn't get it.\n\nThere's a lot of free time because even if you're a full time student, your classes have the possibility of being like 2 to 4 days a week, a few hours per class, with your choice of what days and what time. Compared to 6am to 3pm/5 days a week+extracurriculars like in high school, it opens up a lot of your schedule.",

I took a poli sci course on the constitution last semester and it was prob my favorite course I've taken in college yet. Im going to do a poli sci minor only because I want to take more classes with that professor and its not exceptionally hard. In contrast the semester before I took a course on cyber security and it was the worst professor I've ever had which made it the worst class I've ever had.   \n\n\nSO yh get some perspective on what might be some hidden gems your school might offer as well as a list of professors/classes not to take.",

The vast majority of students end up changing their major at least once (the three campuses I've worked with had students change majors an average of about 2.5 times).  \n\nThe best way (IMHO) to find out what you want to major in is to take a broad array of introductory courses to find out what you like and what you're good at.  \n\nIt is 100% OK not to know what you're majoring in -- much less what your career will be -- at age 18.  You should, however, have an inkling of what you'd like to try and immediately begin actively exploring and trying things out.",

My biggest tip with chemistry is to do practice problems, even if your professor doesn't assign much homework (but most do assign a lot). Practice is the best way to get the hang of chem rather than simply reading the textbook. And don't procrastinate with your lab reports -- I did them ASAP after lab while everything was still fresh on my mind and it helped immensely.\n\nJust an overall tip going into college: I had to repeat the phrase \"one day at a time\" to myself over and over again freshman year because I often got overwhelmed looking at all the work that I'd have to complete by the end of the semester. Seriously, just take it one day at a time. It's not as bad as it looks when you first see the homework/presentations/tests/quizzes/reading/essays on the syllabi. As long as you manage your time properly, it's not that hard. Good luck!! :)",

I need to take my placement test to try to move up classes)\n\nTues- \n\u00b7Into into Psychology from 1:15-2:30pm\n\u00b7Fundamentals of Math V from 2:45-3:35pm (changing hopefully)\n\u00b7Mythology of Ancient Greece from 5:45-7pm (planning on changing as it doesnt really fit well)\n\nWed- \n\u00b7English Comp 1 from 1:15-2:30pm\n\nThur- \n\u00b7Into into Psychology from 1:15-2:30pm\n\u00b7Fundamentals of Math V from 2:45-3:35pm (changing hopefully)\n\u00b7Mythology of Ancient Greece from 5:45-7pm (planning on changing)\n\nFri-\n\u00b7College Experience 101 from 10:15-11:55am\n\nMy question is, should I switch my Mythology class to Into into Ethics? Mythology sounds interesting ig but its late in the afternoon (5:45-7) while all of my other classes are basically from 1-3:30. Into into Ethics would be at 10:15-11:30 Tues/Thur. Theyre both 3 credits and I need one for my humanities credit and these are the only ones available. \nOne problem is, Im planning on switching my math class and Im not sure what times are available for the class Im trying to get into. \n\n\nMy second question is, does anyone have recommendations for a laptop for college? I dont want anything huge but also not something tiny that can only handle notes.",

Ethics is awful. I took two philosophy classes in one semester (Ethics and Aesthetic Theory) and they were the most boring classes in the world. You will not be awake at 10:15 in a philosophy class, even if you are a morning person. Plus, you would get to sleep in a bit :)\n\nTip: If you are worried about eating dinner at a later time, bring a granola bar or another small snack to hold you over until mealtime.",

Get familiar with the campus.\n\nTry to meet people in your hall as they're moving in. Never know who you'll click with.\n\nIf you wanna get really nerdy, see if any classes have work available that you can start now.

          "text": "I would wait until your drop deadline to make a decision. It's a lot easier to drop a class then it is to add it. I agree that this is doable, but as a first-semester freshman, it's usually best to err on the lighter side, in my opinion. You want time to get involved and make connections that will get you social support and opportunities once you're an upperclassman.\n\nIn my experience, I've taken 21 credits in a semester and been fine, and I've taken 15 credits in a semester and struggled. It all depends on each course's load. It sounds like you have a good mix of STEM and humanities which is good - the rough 15 credit semester I had was all upper-level reading-heavy classes, which is part of what made it difficult, but having a mix is helpful. \n\nAre there 100 or 200 level electives that you can get out of the way first instead of the 300? That's probably preferable. I took two 300-level classes my freshman year and found it quite difficult, but again, it all depends on the professor and the course load. Ask upperclassmen if you can (or check RateMyProfessors) and see if they're notoriously hard or easy-going. Take everything on RMP with a biiiig grain of salt, but also, if you see that a lot of your professors are known for being difficult, it's probably best to drop a class.\n\nAlso, make sure that dropping a class won't set you back too far. If you're planning to double major, you may want to take the extra class just so you're on track to graduate on time.",

My advice is to make sure you manage your time well so that you have enough time to both socialize and study. \n\nCalculus 2 (based on your description) may be your hardest class, but I would wait to see how the class is like before you switch it for Philosophy. Personally I think Arabic would be the hardest, but you'll probably be alright since you've studied it for a few years. Good luck on your first year!",

So no, taking engineering math won\u2019t benefit you if you graduate and pursue another degree that uses that course.\n\nFor double majoring, look at all the classes you need for both majors, see what overlaps, talk to an advisor, and build a mock-plan for if you decided to double major. After doing that, see if you are taking 16 credits a semester or 22; that might help you decide. \n\nAlso, what do you want to do after college? Will a double major help you enough to do it? Is engineering math going to help you?(look at course description). Why do your parents insist you take that class if it is not used for your major or your career? Have you told them that? Have conversations with them. If it is their opinion that it is just good knowledge to know, but you won\u2019t need or use, them why would you take the course. It steals money, time, and focus from the courses that you actually need to be learning from for your future career. \n\nIf you think you can handle the class along your others and just want to do it to appease your parents, that is fine. You know your situation best.\n\nIt seems like you have some things to research, ask, and decide before you settle on taking that class.\n\nBest of luck! :)",

Should I not double major and just by Spanish+French instead? I'm more interested in that than biology tbh. I want to volunteer as well and get involved in some clubs like thrifting club, hispanic club, etc. But I'm not sure if double majoring, working part-time (10-20 hours a week), and volunteer/clubs would be too much to handle. Should I just stick to one major and work/volunteer/clubs or would double majoring not be so bad?\n\nThank you yee yee <3",

          "text": "Whether you major in biology or not, you will be exposed to a lot of it for your prereqs and MCAT studies. Honestly, there is PLENTY of time to learn everything about everything in human biology during medical school. IMO study Spanish/French in undergrad. UG is a time to do things you won't ever really get a chance to do. It is a time to study what you really want to study. So long as you complete your prereqs, medical schools won't care one iota what you major in. Also, they don't care at all about double majors either. Save yourself the headache and choose the major you like the most. Plus, the more interested in a subject you are, the better you will perform academically. That is really the most important aspect for medical admissions.\n\nAs for your plan to volunteer/join clubs/work part-time, that is honestly the week-to-week for most pre medical students. The key is not to spread yourself too thin, though. Explore a bunch of clubs, but really dedicate yourself to only one or two. Volunteer whenever convenient. I tended to volunteer after classes and on weekends. A lot of student oriented jobs (at least on my campus) are very conscious of student schedules, so most of these employers can work with you to find hours that work. Definitely doable, but you should take it easy the first semester or two. Ease yourself into the college lifestyle. Make some friends. Then, when you have a handle on it all, start to ramp it up. Good luck!",

Now college arrives and I have to get the specialization but everything looks too similar and too different at the same time and I just dont know what to choose .Is there any advice I could get? Some of my goals/hobbys meanwhile I have to make the final decision are engiering for fun (my arduino kit is at 20cm from me rn),wanted to do item recreation from videogames/films (looking forward to make Jhin's gun from league of legends this summer) and just building cool machines from scratch!  from the smallest to the biggest scale,im a big passionate with what technology can do .One of my options was software but seems like it lacks practice in the way....I mean,anyone knows of a study combining Software+Hardware in general?  \nSome of my options till now where (All in Madrid, probably UPM or UCM . Money and travel /mark isnt a problem)  \nAerospacial engineering(probably aimed too high with this one,but I kinda like it),Software,Telecomunications,Informatics,etc...there are just too many things to choose from...  \nThank you for anyone who reads this long!",

You don't have to be close with your roommate, or even friends at all! You just need to be cordial and respectful.\n\nIt's not important if you don't find your friend group right away. For me, I didn't really meet the right people until sophomore year. Never stop trying to make friends-- you'll find potential friends literally everywhere.",

This can be kinda hectic, but also is a kinda efficient use of your time.\n\n* When you have a lot of time between classes, you have the ability to do other things. Between the end of PHIL and start of POLS you'll be able to walk to your dorm (15 minutes), take a an hour and a half-long nap (90 minutes), grab groceries for dinner in the evening (15 minutes), run through some prep materials for your upcoming POLS quiz (30 minutes), and head to POLS class (15 minutes).\n\nBut what about those windows of 45 and 70 minutes between classes, like HLTH and BIOL, BIOL and Yoga, or PHIL and PACE? You'll be on campus with either just enough time to get home but not do much, or a decent amount of time but constrained to what you can do on campus. \n\nSome people are able to study/work at the library, sometimes you can meet with friends, for your Monday gap you could grab lunch - but not everyone *can* easily study in a crowded library (I needed my dorm for that), friends aren't at all guaranteed to have intermeshing schedules, and there are only so many lunches you can eat in a day. \n\nYou may find yourself not using these blocks as well as you'd want to and wanting to shift stuff up to spend time more efficiently. Try it out this semester - see how studying at the library goes - but keep in mind this issue when registering for classes in the future if you don't like it. I had just one such gap my first freshman semester, and I hated it.\n\nOther things to explore:\n\n* Try to get a feel about if you like having one class on Friday in exchange for more packed M-Th classes, and possibly prioritize a free day in your schedule (zero classes) in future semesters. \n\n* See if you can shift any classes online, to free up time physically spent in lecture halls.",

By the time I get feedback via grades, it's really too late for those students, I can only improve it for the next students.  \n\nThe other thing I dislike about taking online courses as a student is the 24/7 nature of them.  When a course is in person, I know that I go to it the 3 hours a week or whatever and all the interaction happens there.

I am very passionate about math and science and plan to be studious, but I still would like to have a social life. I don't plan on having a job until the second semester so I can get antiquated with school.\n\nHere are my current classes I'm currently planning to take:\n\nCalculus 3 (5 credits)\n\nLinear Algebra (3 credits)\n\n1st Year Writing and Rhetoric (3 credits)\n\nWar and Society with a focus on the Vietnam Wars (3 credits)\n\nGeneral Physics 1 for majors (4 credits)\n\n\\*Most first semester freshman at my school take around 15 credits\\*\n\nHere's my dilemma: In high school, I was already exposed to Calc 3, Linear Algebra, and calculus based physics in my high school classes, but I know it is going to be a lot more vigorous and difficult in college. At first, I was comfortable because I thought that because I already taken some of the courses, I'd be fine. But my family and friends keep warning me that this may be too much and stressed me out a bit. I never really experienced college courses outside of AP classes or very stress free versions of college math courses, so I'm not sure how much time and energy goes into each class. Linear algebra is not required and some people are recommending I take it later, but I really loved it in high school, and it would allow me to take differential equations next year. I'm pretty anxious that I might get overworked, but I also find the classes incredibly enticing.\n\nAm I being reasonable? Will I collapse from exhaustion? Will I become a library studying hermit?",

The only problem is that you're in college now and those assignments from professors can add up very quickly if you're not organized. Do you know how many credits in total you are taking? My english class freshmen year was a 3 credit and I also had 5 and 2 credit classes. My advisor told me to not take more than 18 credits a semester because it would be too much, whether classes were easy or hard. I would just assume by looking that you'd probably have around 16 credits.",

Do I have to physically do anything to get financial aid or do I just sit and wait for an offer to show up on my student portal? I have already filled out the Fafsa and submitted it. Is it just a waiting game now? How did your financial aid go? When I went back in 2011, I submitted my fafsa and the school application and I don't remember what happened after that.\n\nThanks guys!",

Totally understand if you want to take it again but I took AP Calc both years in school so I know what's in each class and I would say if you just took AP Calc AB you should be able to skip MATH 100. I'm Comp Sci too, entering 2nd year, and Intro to Comp Sci was super easy after taking Comp Sci in high school. If you didn't then ignore. I've never taken a Language class in college yet but everything I've heard says they're so much harder than high school (not impossible just a step up), so be prepared. Good luck!",

Mine definitely wasn't designed for people with coding experience.  Do you know what the class entails/what language you'll be using?\n\nIf it were my schedule, adding a 3hr class on TTh wouldn't be that much worse for me, but I tend to do better the more work I have, which I've found isn't true for most. Do you have a peer mentor in your department or any older friends, like siblings of friends or family friends' kids, that have taken the class? I would ask around and see what the load is, or check ratemyprofessors to see if you can get an idea of the difficulty level. Social Psychology sounds like it would be a lighter class than, say, Physics/Newtonian Mechanics, but it's really up to you. **For a straight answer: Personally, I would add it.**",
