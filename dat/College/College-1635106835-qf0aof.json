  "text": "Honestly the highlight of my day is going for a walk in the dark for an hour with music. I'm getting antsy just thinking about it. Maybe I'll go walk right now. \n\nI guess I'm going through the college blues. I do have some friends or acquaintances, but they're mainly from my sports team. I'm actually lucky in that my situation could be a lot worse (without my sports team I may not have anybody as friends). Yet I'm still not happy. I'm definitely an introvert so I love alone time but I don't really get asked to do things a whole lot. Everyone else seems to be having a grand old time and posting about it all over social media. My roommate's always out with friends. Some of my so-called friends and I don't really hang out anymore. I only have one close friend from back home who I stay in touch with. \n\nI'm constantly stressed about work. I have this paper due for a science lab and I have no clue what to write about. I'm not really looking forward to anything. I wasn't homesick until now. I don't know what's going on. \n\nI just want to delete social media. I waste too much time looking through apps and viewing things I'm not even a part of. \n\nDoes it get better?",

      "text": "Walks are big brain energy.  If you feel antsy, just go for a walk and clear your mind.  Just getting out of the house or your dorm is a step in the right direction.  Go study in the library or a study hall where there are other people.  Making friends is always hard if you\u2019re introverted, but just make an honest effort to spend time with people on your team or clubs or whatever else.  They don\u2019t need to be your best friends but socializing helps.\n\nAs for getting stuck on your work, utilize those walks to unplug and let your mind wander a bit.  Try to do it without the music and brainstorm a bit.  You\u2019ll be surprised at what will pop into your mind when you unplug and get some time to reflect.\n\nThat said, to your last point, check out the \u201cdigital minimalism\u201d movement and the book by Cal Newport and that might help you cut down the time you waste online.  It\u2019s a big problem with people our age.",

      "text": "At least youre already going for walks, thats a very good habit to do to relieve stress or thoughts.\n\nAnd yeah with social media its easy to get caught up in that bullshit and comparing yourself to others. I dont use social media at all anymore but in your situation i would just limit how often you use it, you dont have to completely delete the apps and everything. Maybe check it twice a day, once in the morning and later on in the day, its what i used to do before i eventually got rid of them all.\n\nI cant say it gets better for everyone but some people do become more social or just the right moments come and they make some friends and are more social. I cant say too much else about the social aspect of things since im an introvert too but yeah.",

Today my roommate (who is my only few people that I can call a friend) went outside campus so I'm alone in my dorm. Can't stand that at all so I rather be out in the pouring rain with an umbrella to go for a walk rather than staying a single second in that depressing dorm room. If you wanna chat or something during one of your night time walk you can DM me anytime. If you wanted to that is.",
