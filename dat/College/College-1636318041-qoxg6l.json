  "text": "i was shocked when my mom told me that i'd stop school, i mean,  who wouldn't be? i wasn't involved nor informed in making the decision,  then one day she just straight-up told me that, \"you're not going to college yet\"\n\ni know my capabilities. i am willing to work for high grades and always loved the thought of learning. i know what i want to do and what i'm good at. last year, i struggled a lot in school, but i still managed to graduate and i was so motivated to get into a good university, but then i my mom didn't let me go to college this year. at first, i really hated her for that, but she's already such an abusive and toxic parent to me, so that's something she'd likely do.\n\ni told her several times about how i badly want to take fine arts as my course, but she always tells me to take architecture or another instead. my aunt told me to take a course i know i want, but the other day,  she said, \"choose another course, since that course u want is only for rich people.\" (contradicting her first statement). also, lately my mom keeps on convincing me to choose another college than the uni i had in mind.  \n\nnow i don't know what to do in my life anymore. i feel like i lost myself. i don't think i'm even gonna pursue college. i don't want to think about my future anymore since doing so makes me more stressed and anxious. i'm starting to even think that i really have no future. i'm crying as i type this. i have never felt so unmotivated in my life.",

That situation would not change if you were going to college, entering a certain career, or looking to get married.  You need to take positive steps to move forward with your life, regardless of whether or not your mother approves.",

      "text": "When I first when to college (fall of 2016) I was a music major and failed all my classes except beginner piano and my violin lessons (those were easy enough for me). But I had a motivation problem, somewhere around the first third of the semester I just stopped going to my classes, none of them felt impactful on my life, I didn't see how studying music (as much as I personally loved it and still love it although I admit its hard for me to keep up with while im finishing my last semester of school) would create a meaningful impact on my life. Even after reaching my final semester I still do not feel my major and what Im studying and even the idea of job security is what pushing me forward. Every assignment I try to do I have to ignore the fact I hate it and just think if I get it done then I have nothing to complain about. I would have completely failed and given up on my future if it weren't for one thing. Instead of asking what I would like to do I asked myself what is the way I want to live. I can't explain to you my experience to you so that it will change your life the way it has mine but as soon as I stopped limiting my options based on what I thought would be the most stereotypical way to achieve success I started becoming interested in actually getting through school even though I hated it and still do. In fact I would be lying if said I still haven't failed around atleast 1 course a year still after that. After I failed that first semester I felt devastated. It is was like I just didn't know anyway forward after that, I wasn't even embarrassed I just never contemplated failing that hard. I wondered aimlessly a little after that I went back home and tried out a few different majors at my local state college while living with my parents. In fact one of them was architecture. But eventually I found a way I could continue to keep pushing forward and actually have something I cared about. All those majors I tried, none of them interested me. Im a double major now  in economics and sociology but I chose these majors not for a job later but for maybe a way I can actually influence the world, something that would maybe make it worth it.\n\nThe way I was able to move forward from my failure was because I started to think about my priorities. I started to ask myself why it was I should even care about college. My answer lied in what way I wanted to live rather than any specific thing I wanted to do. Now I wake up everyday and even though things are still not all pretty I can take satisfaction in the way things are and they way they are headed.\n\nit was the pure satisfaction of knowing that the me that failed my first semester of college cause I was aimless in life is now actually going to graduate at the beginning of this December is what has kept me going. That I can actually work against being a person I don't want to be, this aimless person. In fact it wouldn't matter where I would be or where I go I can be satisfied that I am trying not to be the person I saw fail several years ago. No matter how tumultuous my college experience has been and no matter how anxious I got I would always remember that I was able to make it yesterday so I can make it today. I focused on being a person that wouldn't let myself fail even though sometimes it would have been easier and in that way I took solace in the fact that I knew I wouldn't let myself fail that hard again.  My priorities are now more focused on a way of living than any specific thing I want do to.\n\nYou said,\n\n\"i know my capabilities. i am willing to work for high grades and always loved the thought of learning. i know what i want to do and what i'm good at. last year, i struggled a lot in school, but i still managed to graduate and i was so motivated to get into a good university\"\n\nIt might be hard and I don't know the path before you, you might be thinking to yourself how it is you can deal with your situation but if humans never tried to figure out or dive head first into unknowns then we would still be living in caves.\n\nI don't know if any of this can help, nobody is going to come and fix your problems for you in real life so this social media post certainly isn't going to help you in any practical manner but I hope maybe some of my own experience and mental attitude towards trying to make it through college can do something for you to.\n\np.s. my bad if they're typos but I've spent too much time typing this when I should be browsing reddit as a part of one of my school assignments. Also just to be clear you don't need college for success the only reason I'm still doing it is because it has to do with the way I want to live, I can't just give up just because I feel like I must finish (also it is the only way to become an officer in the military which is my new found goal, the only one I've ever actually cared about doing merely because the challenge required in achieving it). Don't be afraid to think otherwise about college, again with the thing about sometimes you will have to deal with unknowns.",

What do you mean she \u201cdidn\u2019t let you go to college\u201d? If you\u2019re 18 she can\u2019t stop you. If money is the problem, maybe get a job and save money for community college and then transfer to the school you want.\n\nYou\u2019re an adult right? Then she can\u2019t stop you unless you let her. You can\u2019t let her or your aunt dictate your life forever. Ignore her BS and do whatever you can to make your life go in the direction that YOU want it to go. I wish you the best of luck! :)",

If you are legally capable (as in you are an adult and you do not need your parent\u2019s permission to make decisions), you can make your own choices. Stop listening to her. Tell her no. Ignore her. Get a job and start doing your own thing. She literally cannot physically stop you from getting a job, packing your shit, and leaving her. Do it. \n\nIt sucks that this is normalized where you live, but sometimes you have to go against what society is telling you to do and do what is best for you. That\u2019s part of adulting. My toxic father didn\u2019t want time to move across the country for college (he wanted to me to go school at the college he works at and live at home like my brother) but I did it anyway. My dad didn\u2019t want me to get my own bank account so he could no longer see or access my money, but I did it anyway. I took my life into my own hands bc I was sick of his shit and you need to do the same. You will never get away from her and succeed if you don\u2019t stop letting these invisible barriers get in the way of you making your own life choices.",
