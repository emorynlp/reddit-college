  "text": "**Tier S++ (Super Target)**\n\nHarvard / Yale / Princeton -\u00a0*HYP*\n\nWharton -\u00a0*UPenn's undergrad business school - 4yrs*\n\nStanford -\u00a0*The most prestigious western school*\n\n**Tier S+ (Target)**\n\nUPenn / Dartmouth / Columbia -\u00a0*Mid-tier Ivies. Non-Wharton UPenn is still a target school*\n\nMIT\n\nThis is from a post this year and was just wondering from anyone who is a recruiter for IB or quant whether being in S+ would be a disadvantage. I know that it is not a big disadvantage however, I would just like to know what else I could do when attending a tier S+ college that would put me in the same ranks as someone from HYP for example. This goes for quant and IB. Also whether the VC and entrepreneurial side of the colleges is strong in tier S+",
