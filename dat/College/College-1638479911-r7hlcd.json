  "text": "The title is a bit clickbaity because I'm technically taking 6 classes for spring semester + 1 short-term class over winter break (but it counts for the spring semester.)\n\nWhy am I doing this to myself? Well, this semester was hell for me and I ended up dropping all but 2 of my classes....And I'm doing quite poorly in them. In order to renew my scholarship, you must take a certain number of credit hours, so I need to jampack my schedule to reach the requirement. And I need to earn an A in all 7 of these classes...Wish me luck.\n\nI'm taking Intermediate Korean 2, Statistics in Psychological Research, Social Psychology, Introduction to Oceanography(online course over winter break), Anthropology,  Bowling, and Design Lecture Series\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56fniia747381.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac061b8271114285d9fb481eb9b6506ea35abdc4\n\nI'm not sure if I'm going to survive. Is $1200 for a whole year really worth the stress of trying to get an A in all 8 of these classes? Idk. But maybe it can be done.",
