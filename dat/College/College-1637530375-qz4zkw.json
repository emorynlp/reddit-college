  "text": "I apologize if I sound a bit panicked. \nAfter not being able to graduate on time at my 4 year college, my college has given me the option to take online courses to transfer over in order to earn my degree. 2 of the credits I need are in Calculus 3 (also called multi variable calculus) and any high level physics class. Rest are just filler easy classes.\n\nI am looking for a college to take online classes in starting 2022 but I am absolutely overwhelmed with where to apply and if it\u2019s even the right choice. I was about to apply to Devry University but found out they don\u2019t even have math courses which is one of the classes I need. Does anyone know about a good accredited college starting classes in 2022 that has a good amount of courses including a calculus and physics class? Please anything will help thanks!",
