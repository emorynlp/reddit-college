  "text": " As someone who lives in a dorm, it can be really hard to live in an eco-friendly way. It\u2019s easy to fall back into old habits- throwing all recyclables away, getting disposable dishes and silverware, and using a ton of plastic water bottles. However, it\u2019s not impossible to live sustainably on-campus! Here are some tips I can offer. Please drop some more if you have any!\n\n1. **Drinking-Water** \\- I live in an area with very poor water quality, so I try to avoid many of the drinking fountains and sinks on campus. This makes plastic throw-away water bottles very attractive. \n   1. Locate any filtered water/water-bottle filling stations that you can hit up in a day. Many campuses have started installing them in every building. \n   2. Get a filtered water bottle. It can be a bit of an investment, but you can get a Brita water bottle from $17, which is only a few $$ more than a metal bottle. \n   3. Get a filtered pitcher. I keep a filtered pitcher in my room, and I use it all the time. It\u2019s especially nice for rooms that don\u2019t have sinks. \n   4. REUSE PLASTIC BOTTLES. If you have to use disposable bottles, reuse them! On the occasion that I do buy water, I try to reuse the same bottle for a couple of days, refilling with drinking water or even water for my plants.\n2. **Reusable dining ware -** It\u2019s really convenient to use paper plates, plastic cups, and plastic silverware all the time in a dorm rather than washing your dishes, especially if the nearest kitchenette is floors away. It is, however, A LOT of unnecessary waste. Buying a cheap set of reusable plates/bowls/silverware will save you money in the long run, too!\n   1. You can use plates/bowls/silverware more than once. I try to use mine at least all day if they\u2019re not too dirty, especially cups/mugs I use for water. Doing this, too, saves you on trips to wash them- just wash everything at the end of the day.\n   2. I find it helps to make washing my dishes part of my daily routine. I have a gap between classes in which I like to clean up, so I always do it then. \n   3. Almost all of the waste in our room previously was plates and bowls. Reusable plates and bowls save tremendously on the amounts of trips to take the garbage out!\n3. **Recycling** \\- My campus offers no recycling service. \n   1. If you can commute reasonably, one thing to try is locating your nearest recycling center, collecting your recycling and the recycling of any interested friends/neighbors, and making a trip once a week/month. I collect my recycling in the trunk of my car and take it every two weeks.\n   2. See if your state offers any can/bottle return services. In my state, we get $0.10 for every can or bottle we return to return sites in Walmart or other supermarkets. If you have a friend who drinks sodas religiously, or if you have time to collect beer cans/bottles after party nights, you can make a couple extra dollars just from recycling. \n\nDo you have any other tips for living on campus responsibly?
