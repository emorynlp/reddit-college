      "text": "You're probably looking for a vocational school or trade school or some sort, which are often housed in community colleges. Traditional degrees are two years (for an associates, which has almost zero market value) or four years (for a bachelors, which has a lot more market value but it's four years so not what you want). If it's exclusively online, though, that means that you won't be able to get a certification/credential in a more \"hands-on\" area. \n\nMy thinking is that maybe you're interested in something like IT certifications? Most or these are short term, relatively affordable, can be done online, and may be able to land you a job. You can probably have success finding these at most community colleges-- I'd suggest this route because it's cheaper than other schools, and because if you decide you want more education afterwards it's more likely the credits you earn at community college will apply to a degree if you decide to seek it out later. Imo, you should avoid expensive private schools, which seem to do a lot of IT degree advertising. They're there just to suck all your money out of you.\n\nEdit: Unfortunately I can't think of any other courses/paths that fit your criteria, but if you have an AP classes from high school or are interested in taking CLEP exams, you may be able to finish a traditional associates degree in one year, if you're interested in that route.",
