  "text": "So next semester I signed up for a public speaking class. It says it\u2019s online/virtual, but the time says TBA. I know this means to be announced, but what does it really mean? Will it get in the way of my other classes? Is it asynchronous? I genuinely have no idea. I have two classes like this next semester so I\u2019m lost",

But please don\u2019t quote me on that. Your prof could add a time.\n\nYou could always send a polite email asking if there will be class times.",

It requires more discipline on your part to actually read the textbook or use the materials given and learn. I like them better though. If it\u2019s an easy course, you don\u2019t have to waste time sitting in class",
