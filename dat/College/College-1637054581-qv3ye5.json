  "text": "My philosophy final (a presentation on a Utopia) is due on Wednesday. The teacher has specifically encouraged us to present what we actually believe, rather than playing devil's advocate or whatever. A few months ago when we started, I thought my topic was cool. Today, I realize that I don't agree with 90% of what I've written. I don't want whatever dumb shit I say in class to be held against me by people who disagree (like I do) with my presentation. On the other hand, there is no fucking way I can rewrite this in two days, especially because I have finals coming up (my college is on the trimester system) and I need to be studying for them. Should I just suck it up and peddle my bullshit?",

      "text": "Unfortunately, some assignments are ones you just have to get through in any way you can do so. We've all been there. That includes saying things we don't necessarily agree with or have strong feelings about personally.\n\nFor the most part, your classmates are probably people you won't have close, long-term, meaningful relationships with after this class. If you do have such relationships with anyone in it, then you should be able to rectify this situation with them if necessary as, again, it's a relatable one.\n\nI know that I've heard some of the things my classmates have said, and I didn't like how they said it or what it was for some reason. The most I ever did was avoid them for the rest of the semester, and I vaguely remember those people now. I probably don't even remember all of them.\n\nSo, when you say you can't rewrite this assignment in two days, I'd just leave it at that. That's a pretty clear statement that, even if you want to change things, it's not realistic to do so, and it'll be a significant source of stress that can hurt other areas of your education if you try to change things after all.\n\nMaybe you can even learn from this in that, in the future, you should be more mindful of what you're writing along the way so that you can sort out your stance on it and make significant changes in time if necessary.",

      "text": "Ha, this is funny. \n\nYa know, once you graduate and get a job, you're going to have even more opportunities like this. There will be more things you're required to present in a stance that you don't personally believe. You'll have a boss who thinks everything they touch is gold and they'll make you present their half-witted ideas like they're fact. It's a worthy skill to have.",
