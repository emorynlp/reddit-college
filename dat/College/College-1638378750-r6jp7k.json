  "text": "I started my first year of college and was excepting it to be be so much more like intriguing and different but it\u2019s the opposite it feels just like high school all over again it\u2019s just not working at all but being stressful  I can\u2019t really learn anything no matter how many notes I take  they really want you to learn a new lesson every class  period and remember it till your final exam which is madness to me .even my professors say even with your college degree it\u2019s still really difficult to get a job you actually wanted since thousand\u2019s of people go for the same degree . Sounds like a high school diploma to Me .anyways i been skipping my algebra class cause I just stopped caring  and been failing it\u2019s been on my mind to dropout  since I\u2019m just waisting money and time I work at Walmart  so I do have  an income to pay my bills and rent but is there any alternatives I Thought about trade school but I\u2019m just curious I know a lot of people ask this but everyone\u2019s story is different",
