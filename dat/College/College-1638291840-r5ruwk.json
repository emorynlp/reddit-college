  "text": "Heya, I\u2019m just looking for some insight into this situation. I\u2019m a biochemistry major in my sophomore year, and I\u2019m considering applying to the chemistry minor program. I will admit that it\u2019s mostly out of personal interest. I was a chemistry major before but I ended up changing to biochem since that fits my career goals more closely. However, I still REALLY enjoy chemistry and I\u2019m wondering if a minor in chemistry could help job prospects or grad school applications. I know that unrelated minors usually don\u2019t help much, but I figured since biochemistry and chemistry are very much related, maybe it would lend more credibility. Does anyone have any sort of experience with this?",

      "text": "Related minors are fine! Honestly, unrelated minors are fine too, more on that in a second.\n\nRemember that for grad school specifically (and employment more generally, but that\u2019s a lot harder to generalize about), you\u2019re competing against both a basic standard *and the rest of the applicants.* On your transcript/resume, a minor helps set you apart from the crowd (maybe not a lot, but at first you just need to make it to the interview round). In the essay/interview, it gives you the opportunity to say \u201cI went deeper into this aspect of my field because X, and here\u2019s a cool project I worked on that is relevant in Z ways to why I want to attend this school/work with this prof/focus on this research.\u201d The ideal cohort of grad students has people with complimentary skills sets, so that all of you bolster each other\u2019s weaknesses. \n\nLess-obviously-related minors (I shouldn\u2019t say unrelated, because part of the point is that everything is as related as you\u2019d like it to be) also help you. In a similar way, they give you something to talk about, but now the angle is a little different. How does this field make you a well-rounded candidate for this program/job? *What skills do you bring to the table that people who studied* only *the main field would not have?* Again, how does a class or project or skill learned for your minor tie into your future plans? The classic example here is a STEM major who also took an English minor - it\u2019s harder than you might think to find an engineer who can write coherently, and you better believe that when I\u2019m on admissions committees I look for people like this. \n\nIf you took a minor completely for fun that has nothing to do with your main field, that\u2019s okay too! Soft skills are important too, and having interests outside your day-to-day work doesn\u2019t make you less of a candidate.",

In fact, they probably won't care about your major, either, so long as you meet the course prerequisites and core requirements they expect for their incoming graduate students.\n\n> In the essay/interview, it gives you the opportunity to say \u201cI went deeper into this aspect of my field because X, and here\u2019s a cool project I worked on that is relevant in Z ways to why I want to attend this school/work with this prof/focus on this research.\u201d\n\nThis is really the most important part for graduate school: convince me you need to study WITH MY DEPARTMENT because of YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS. \n\nIf you want to take on a minor, do it. That's all there really is to it.",

      "text": "Like all things, it depends. The knowledge gained by doing the minor may help more than the resume/CV line that lists your minor.\n\nIn my opinion, I think it's great to pair a major in one area and a minor in a different area.\n\nFor example, Biochem major with an English minor, or the reverse.\n\nIf I was looking to hire a biochem major and I saw that an applicant also knew how to write/read, I'd go with them. It might also indicate to me that they are flexible thinkers since the areas are so different.",

      "text": "Long answer long: not really.\nIn my opinion there are a few minors that are generally useful, and those are things like Business (if you're in a technical role or want to start your own business), computer science (because programming is a generally useful skill to have, and then possibly some sort of specialty that enhances your major. For example, a chemistry minor is great for an education major, it gives them an advantage over other teachers who want to teach science.\n\nSo there's a fine line between too closely related and too distantly related, and somewhere in the middle is where good minors live. Overall, I'd save yourself the time and effort of a minor, especially if you have to stay extra semesters, and just start getting experience.",
