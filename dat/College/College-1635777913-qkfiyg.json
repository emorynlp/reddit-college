  "text": "I\u2019m a third year student and I recently transferred to a more academically rigorous school. At my old school, I was doing fine. I got good grades, kept my mental health up, and got plenty of sleep. Now, I\u2019m barely keeping up, my grades are dropping, and I\u2019m barely getting more than four hours of sleep. I feel like it\u2019s constantly taking a toll on my mental health and I just want to give up. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve never experienced this type of problem before. I want to seek help, but I don\u2019t know where to start. I just know it\u2019s getting worse each day.",

      "text": "This. I\u2019m also a third year student and this is objectively the easiest year I\u2019ve had so far in terms of classes, but there\u2019s just ALWAYS something else left to do. I gave myself this past Saturday off (literally my first \u201coff\u201d day in 3 weeks) and now that it\u2019s Monday I\u2019m feeling the consequences of that choice \ud83d\ude05 so you\u2019re definitely not alone. As for the mental health\u2026sleep makes such an incomprehensible difference to your baseline level of existing, and there really is no work-around to getting an adequate amount of sleep. As someone who also doesn\u2019t get enough, I feel like I just spend all my days reminding myself that the way I\u2019m feeling right now/the person that I am right now is solely because of the lack of sleep and not an actual reflection of my emotional or intellectual capabilities. Not the healthiest, but there\u2019s just literally no solution if I\u2019m not willing to sacrifice my grades :( \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a night person but I have 8ams/9ams this semester so I end up getting tired earlier and sleeping from 12/1am to 4/5am more often, and I was skeptical at first but I actually do prefer it to staying up until 4am and sleeping from 4-8am. Whatever schedule you\u2019re working on, make sure it\u2019s consistent (even if it\u2019s consistently horrible lol) And seconding the other commenter about playing an instrument (I\u2019m part of a singing group and it\u2019s one of the only not-terrible parts of my week) or doing something creative. Working out regularly is also important, but ik I literally can\u2019t find the time to do that either so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nif you can\u2019t find a counseling appointment at your school, maybe see if there\u2019s a practice nearby that fits your needs? My school also has an academic/life coaching thing to help with time management, planning, etc. so maybe you can see if that\u2019ll help?\n\nBut either way, good luck!! We made it this far\u20263.5 semesters left!",
