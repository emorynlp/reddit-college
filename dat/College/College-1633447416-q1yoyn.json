  "title:": "New Admissions Counselor Here; Wanted to 'Feel the Room' About the State of Modern College",
  "text": "I recently started a pretty excellent job in the Admissions office of my alma mater.  The most striking thing, so far, has been how relatively out-of-touch I felt many on the academic side of things are regarding what it is students are looking for in a four-year education after high school.  In the department meetings I've been auditing, it sounds like the age-old issue of growing older and forgetting altogether what youth felt like.  As I started to dig into the issue, I realized that I wasn't the most in-touch, myself, despite only graduating a couple years ago.\n\nI'm not the kind of person who wants to have such a glaring blind spot.  Why not ask someone?  \n\nI specifically have a focus on Performing Arts students, but I don't want to self-limit the discussion.  I also don't want to turn this into an advertisement for my institution.  \n\nWhat I do want, is for you to lay it all out for me.  What did you/do you feel like a college should offer you in order to create an environment where you're capable of achieving your ambitions?  What, in your opinion, are aspects of the college hunt that leave you wanting more or better options?  Like Plato's description of his ideal Republic, what does your ideal college/university look like?  Obviously it looks a magnitude-and-a-half different than the ideal college at the birth of the university system.  We are all well aware it looks NOTHING like it did for the \"I-worked-my-way-through-my-ten-dollar-a-semester-degree-and-then-pounded-pavement-until-I-found-a-job\" crowd just a generation or two ago.  This may not be an official study, but I don't want my alma mater (and place of financial security) to lag behind a curve we can't see.\n\nThis is a 'no wrong answers' kind of deal.  I want to chew on any answers I'm (graciously) given.  If you aren't comfortable in the open forum setting, don't hesitate to PM me.  \n\nThe Virtual Town Hall on the State of the University begins here:",

      "text": "\nThe role of the university is to provide an education.  \nThe university is technically not a job placement agency, but it needs to effectively become one.  \n\nUniversity in the US is just as a simple statement of fact too damned expensive for there to be a single student on the property who doesn't know why they are there.  \n\nThe dream of university as an establishment who empowers self-discovery is currently dead. Cost of attendance killed it. It might be able to be resurrected in the future, but today, it's dead.  \n\nEvery single student enrolled in your institution is there to be provided knowledge and skills to help them get a better job than they could with a HS diploma alone.  \n\nAny crusty old geezer on your Academic or Administrative Faculty who doesn't understand this reality is a dinosaur and should be replaced.  \n\nIMO: There should be a required class for every student receiving FinAid in the form of loans on the details of how those loans work, and how repayment is going to work, the whole shebang.  /r/StudentLoans  is loaded with horror stories of kids who have seriously injured their financial futures with student loans. Structure it as a 1 credit class and make it an attractive GPA inflator by making it super easy for anyone to add.  \n\nThis isn't what university is supposed to be. This isn't the best use of university. But this is what it has become due to cost of attendance.  \n\n\nEvery non-teaching member of faculty also needs to be reminded as often as possible that they are dead weight.  \nYou are administrative overhead that is dragging the cost efficiency of the institution down.  \nSo you need to deliver value to the institution, and more importantly value to the students, else your position should be eliminated.  \n\nFaculty should be making sure that the academic foundation they are providing students align with employer expectations.  \n\nI see way too damned many universities in my area who are not doing this.  \nAnd not in niche, boutique degree programs with 30 enrolled students.  \nBig, well-funded universities are failing to provide Computer Science students with all of the skills we want them to have.  \nComputer Science these days is usually one of the most heavily populated degree programs.  \nIf you don't have your eye on that ball, how are the other degree programs supposed to keep pace?  \n\nAs a matter of human nature, your instinctive reaction to that statement will be to defend your school and say/thing: *\"We already do that.\"*  \n\nI challenge you to confirm that, because I don't think that you do.  \n\nSeek out whatever roundtable or gathering of academic minds & relevant employers is on your school and see how active it is.  \n\nMaybe your school isn't big enough to pull Steven Spielberg in to help you understand what he wants graduates to have or know.  \nBut it feels like the SAG or a SAG-affiliated casting agency ought to be able to cough up a person to join a WebEx/Zoom session to talk about the current state of affairs.  \n\nRepeat that concept for the major academic segments. You don't have to reinvent entire curricula to keep pace with change. But to help a professor / department chair understand that a chapter or section that helps students understand an ancient technology or outdated practice might be due for replacement with something more useful.  \n\nThis should be an easy sale to Administration.  \nYou are building a platform for CEOs to tell you how important they are, and for you to cater to their penchant for feeling important.  \nThe school benefits from a little wisdom, and every now and then a CEO cracks open a charitable giving checkbook and throws money at the institution for making them feel important.  \n\nIt will take a whole lot of alumni $50 donations to match one significant corporate donation.  \n\n-----  \n\nInternships and Co-Op working opportunities are critical to the students to help them test-drive the career they think they want.  \n\n\nForced, mandatory, unpaid internships as a for-credit class is a disgusting practice and should be eliminated.  \nMaking students borrow money to pay the university so they can go and work an unpaid job for 10-20 hours a week is outrageous.  \n\n\nA couple of more practical recommendations:  \n\nLook at this:  \n\nhttp://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/undergraduatecomputerscience/#bscurriculumtextcontainer  \n\nEvery single degree program in every single university should have one of those course requirement breakdowns readily, and easily available to the general public on their website.  \n\nPlease observe how a full, simple name of each required class is provided.  \n\nThis breakdown is useless without those complete titles of each class.  \nIf I am trying to figure out what I might learn if I enroll at your institution, in this degree program, it does me no good to see ENG131, MTH117, BIO188 or whatever system of abbreviation your institution uses.  \n\nWhy is this so important?  \n\nA whole lot of young people are searching far and wide for a degree with the perfect name that speaks to their dream for their future.  \n\nThey want to find that boutique degree program that tickles their jimmys just right.  \n\nThey want a degree in \"Robotics\" or \"Mechatronics\" even though they would be perfectly well educated and made ready for employment with a Mechanical Engineering degree, with a couple of elective classes in electronics and logic programming.  \n\nBut they will search far and wide to find schools with these boutique degree programs because it is almost impossible for us to convince them - visually - that the contents of a Mechatronics degree really does look really, really similar to MechE, plus some electives.  \n\nMechE is available damned near everywhere. There are probably only 20 universities in the US with a Mechatronics program.  \n\nRepeat this problem for every academic focus area imaginable.  \n\nI want a degree in \"Broadway Performance Stage Management\".  But that's just a \"Music Performance Management\" degree, with a couple of electives in Stage Prop Management (or whatever)  \n\nWhat is the difference between a Business Administration degree, and an Applied Economics degree?  \nThe answer is that we can't really know without seeing exactly what courses each degree contains.  \n\nSo make sure we can see - as a prospective student or employer - what is inside every degree.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nRekindle your debate teams.  \nGive them a little boost of funding and a little marketing love.  \n\nThis generation **CLEARLY** needs more members who know how to conduct a civilized disagreement.",

          "text": "> The university is technically not a job placement agency, but it needs to effectively become one.\n\nThank you. The years of going to college just for fun to learn something new or to make extra money are long gone. And for the price that college is now, we need to STOP treating it as such. Most people go to college for the opportunity to find a better job as you said and universities need to begin keeping up with the times. I\u2019m really surprised that someone as yourself, a faculty in academia, has admitted this because even other college students don\u2019t agree with this.",
