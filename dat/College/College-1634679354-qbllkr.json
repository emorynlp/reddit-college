  "text": "Hello all. \n\nI have over like 50 missing assignments for all of my classes, combined. Had a lot of starts and stops since beginning college, but I'm really trying to get into gear to make transferring in three semesters happen. Been dealing with a lot of housing insecurity, couch surfing among family, and living in my car. I wish I could stop being so fucking lazy and find some inner drive to get all this work done.  But I feel so unmotivated and hopeless, so much so that I almost just want to give up and drop out permanently. \n\nMy teachers are giving me a little bit of grace, and I should feel a lot more lucky than I do. But I'm still so sensitive to rejection/fear of failure that I can't. 10th week of semester, midterms are near, and I have a high F or low D in all of my classes. Can someone give me motivation/reasons why completing all the work won't be futile, and why I should persevere through college anyway? It would be nice to remember why I wanted to go in the first place, since for the last year or so I've kind of just been contemplating whether or not I should just work instead.   \n\nHope I don't sound annoying and lazy. Thanks.",
