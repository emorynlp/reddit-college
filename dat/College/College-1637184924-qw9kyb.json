  "text": "I\u2019ve been with my gf for 2 years and I\u2019m a junior and shes a freshman. Our relationship is really well, however, I\u2019m just a short white boy and my blonde gf seems to be unsafe when going with me, and i also feel unsecure when walking w her among bigger guys. The transition from high school makes her realize I\u2019m not her real man. Therefore, I just want to ask if it\u2019s weird if I allow my gf to have sex with some black guys on campus, i wont consider that cheating since i will watch them do that. Thanks",
