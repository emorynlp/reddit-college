  "text": "Hello reddit world. So I am taking 5 classes, all online, which I hate. I am just not suited for online, and doing it for the past year and a half has been a drag. I dont know why, but I feel this semester was the first time where it really took a toll on me. I started doing a job where I am almost working full time (35 hrs a week on certain weeks) and ive fell behind in a few classes. Ive spoken to professors, and have done all quizzes (all English classes) but I still dont feel as strong as I normally do. Anyways, there's one class in which ive completely ignored as being async. Looking back on the topics, it seems like an actual interesting class I would like to actually take again next semester and pay attention to it. I spoke to the professor and he recommended withdrawing, or doing all the work but its going to be hard (watching 13 PowerPoints and writing thoughts and comments, full blown responses to it, not including the two essays that need to be done). So should I withdraw and take next semester. If I do, it doesn't show in my GPA (but it does show as a W on my transcript) but I dont lose any money, nor do I get left behind since I only need 4 classes anyways.",
