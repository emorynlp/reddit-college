  "text": "I transferred from community to university & the price jumped. I was able to take 6 classes for around $2,000 in community college. $1,920 seems like a lot for just two classes. I transferred to southern New Hampshire university if that matters.",

I'd be wary about it, and the fact Southern New Hampshire University has a reputation as a diploma mill, meaning not everyone will respect a degree from there, I would be especially cautious.",
