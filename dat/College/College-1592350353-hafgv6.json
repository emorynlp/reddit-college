  "text": "I\u2019m sick of the stereotype that all teens and college students prefer to stay up to 3am and wake up at noon. I literally just quit a job where they expected me to work until 11pm/midnight every night. Why does everyone assume people my age stay up late?????\n\nI LIKE waking up early. I LIKE going to bed at 10 pm. I LIKE morning workouts. I LIKE morning classes. I genuinely find myself most productive in the morning hours. And I can\u2019t be the only one. \n\nPlease tell me I\u2019m not the only one.",

I usually wake up around 7 or 8 and go to bed around 11pm or 12am. 8 is actually sleeping in for me but I'm on summer break so it's fine. While my internship is stalled rn, I started it last summer and had to be there at 8am which meant getting up around 5:30 if I wanted to shower and have a light breakfast and coffee before my hour drive there (thanks traffic) and I actually liked getting up early to get there. The location is on the beach so getting there early was nice and the beach was empty and the sun was rising. I really miss it right now. I can't get up that early anymore because COVID lockdown ruined my whole schedule and I'm going to sleep at 12am now when I used to sleep at around 10 to 11. The hour really makes a difference. \n\nAnyway, I love being an early bird and waking up early and just enjoying that morning peace. I'm glad I didn't completely lose it after starting grad school where most of my classes were from 7pm to 10pm and I wouldn't get home until 11pm.",

I never had a bedtime as a kid so I'd always stay up until 11 or 12, and sometimes as late as 3 a.m. if I had a particularly hard time falling asleep.\n\nEven now as an adult, it's nearly impossible for me to fall asleep before 11 pm. I just can't do it unless I'm physically exhausted and about to collapse. I only wake up early, around 6:30-6:45, because I work 8-5. Still, I wake up, sit around for about an hour, get ready for work, then leave. Work, come home, chill for an hour or two, eat around 8 or 9, shower, then bed by 12. If I get in bed by 11:30, I'm doing good. Most times, it's hard to do that though. I hate it because I'm constantly tired but idk how to change it. My body is just naturally more inclined to be active later in the day than it is in the morning",

Tbh all I need in the morning to really wake up is to stand up for 5 minutes.  I still drink coffee because I like having a warm morning drink, but it's not needed.

      "text": "You\u2019re not the only one, but I think I can sympathize a lot with people in the replies here.\n\nFirst two years of college I was like a lot of people here. My entire life I had slept in until 10 or 11AM without fail. Sometimes it was because I went to bed at 2 or 3AM, sometimes I just wanted 12-13 hours of sleep. Waking up has always been the difficult part for me and until my third year of college I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. How on Earth would someone wake up at 6, maybe 7, AM and be okay with that? I had done it for high school and 8AM college classes but I absolutely hated it.\n\nThe answer seems trivial now, but it boiled down to 2 things for me: going to bed earlier and self-discipline. It\u2019s really easy to roll over and hit that snooze button or shut off the 5 alarms you set for yourself. It\u2019s much harder to let the alarms ring, turn then off, and then get out of bed. That part just takes time and discipline. You won\u2019t develop that skill overnight.\n\nSecond part was the hardest part for me though: going to bed earlier. I HATE losing time in my evenings, and having spent a lot of my life staying up late with friends on Discord or Teamspeak it was hard to let that go. However, the math is pretty simple. Most people need 8 hours of sleep to feel rested when they wake up. I found out that I need 9 to really feel rested. If I want to get up at 6:30, that means I should go to bed at 9:30 to feel awake and rested in the morning. And as much as it sucks to go to bed so early, I found out that as much as people talk about sleep being \u201cfor the weak\u201d and whatnot, if I DON\u2019T get that sleep, I feel terrible. So I bit the bullet and now go to bed around 10:00PM so I can wake up at 7:00AM,\n\nI\u2019m not perfect in the slightest, and I hope people understand that it\u2019s okay to stay up late sometimes and sleep in. It\u2019s just not okay to make that a habit when you want to sleep and wake up at earlier times. Your body needs to get into a rhythm, but once it does it\u2019ll be a lot easier to get up early in the morning, and sleeping in will feel more like a treat than a curse when it does happen.",

If it is past the time you want to go to sleep and you don't have anything important the next day stay up for as long as possible but also set multiple alarms at your desired time to wake up all with different sounds to prevent getting used to the alarm. Make sure that these alarms are as loud as they can be to wake you up. If you do this right you'll be up at the time you want to be and you will be exhausted. Fight the urge to sleep as much as possible until it is the time you want to go to bed. You will sleep really well until your alarms wake you up. Continue this until it becomes your sleep schedule.",

What bugs me more tho is the morning traffic. \n\nSo if you are not an early to bed, early to rise person you kind of become one in the process, at least that's what I feel happened to me during some college terms when I got to the point of sleeping at 8 - 9 pm and waking up at 4 am. xD",

While I've never been a morning person in the first place, that job put a really bad taste in my mouth, and I've had a lot of trouble waking up that early since I left. I think I like the idea of night shift, but I don't think it would realistically be better for me than just a 9-5 would be. I know a few people my age who are morning people, but I couldn't ever personally do it. A lot of it comes down to not having the motivation to get out of bed, but that's a much bigger problem that can't just be solved with a change in routine",

      "text": "For those looking to change their sleep schedule, I used to be the worst at it. In high school I would sleep around 3-4 hours a night (ex. 3AM-6AM), take a nap when I got back home, and stay up late. It fucked with my mental and physical health, and I can easily say that my lifestyle in college has been a lot better, especially due to setting a sleep time (usually 11:30AM-7AM).\n\nWhat works for me in college:\n- I have a friend who lives to sleep. So she has definitely had a positive influence on me.\n- Make a \"goal\" to get out of bed. For me that was working out.\n- Work out in some way. My past year at college I was consistently getting 15000+ steps a day and I would work out 2-3 times a week. I used to hate working out but being able to work out in the morning helps clear my mind of frustrations and it's a rare alone time I have at college.\n- I used to see sleep as a obstacle and hindrance between me and doing activities. But sleep is so important, I would say more than studying. Sleep is the time for your brain to process the day's information and for your body to rest. So try to be kind to your body and let it get it's reward for doing all the amazing things you did that day.\n- I love food, and my favorite meal is breakfast. In high school I would sometimes do 10PM-3AM, then have \"breakfast,\" take a short nap, then eat another breakfast. Food shouldn't be something to keep you awake but something to satisfy your hunger.\n- Again, I love breakfast but I began intermittent fasting. I got really lazy trying to eat breakfast before class and it wasn't worth the time crunch, so I would either eat very little before class or not eat at all. Now I fast from around 8 or 9PM to 11:30AM, and I have lunch and dinner with 2 snacks in between.\n- Don't push back homework. I love procrastinating (I work a lot more effectively) but your mind will be much more alert on test day if you divide your work.",

You either break it by getting up early, or wait for it to crumble by sleeping until the afternoon, the feeling of breaking it is refreshing. However, if you are forced to get up early then that's a different story. You will feel compelled to break the wall only to not notice any refreshment at all. If you don't then you get punished since you will miss a class, but after a while of constant mornings you will start to see the light, and only then will you have conquered the college life.",

Feed my cat and pet it \n\n3. Do a light workout like pushups since I am too poor to get a gym membership\n\n4. Take a shower and bathroom grooming\n\n5. Eat breakfast at 6-7 am \n\n6. Prepare for my first class at 8 am\n\n\nI DO NOT like to rely on coffee to wake myself up. I saw many friends struggle to function without coffee and that is a big NO for me. I drink coffee at the most twice a month but I never use it to wake up. A light workout will work much better than caffeine in my experience. \n\nMy advice to anyone that wants to wake up early is to ensure you sleep at least 8 hours. After that, your body will wake up on its own and it becomes a habit for your body.",

I like that every day there are possibilities to do whatever I want.  Yes, I have school and a full-time job and commitments, but that doesn't erase the possibility of cool shit happening.\n\nFor instance, on Saturday's I still wake up at 630/7 am because I love the silence that comes with walking the dog early on a weekend morning.  I love making a nice breakfast and watching an HGTV show with my wife while we don't worry about anything other than what we will fill our day with. \n\nI've been depressed so I get how foreign this idea is.  Luckily, I don't have depression and when I do have the symptoms of depression, I can fend them off.  Not everyone has this privilege, though, including my wife.  So I get it.",

Just look for a typical \u201ccoffee\u201d dose.\n\nMakes you feel awake and *want* to get out of bed because you\u2019re not tired anymore.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re gonna feel like shit if you wake up to a beeping/noisy alarm anyway because it\u2019ll wake you up in deep sleep. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you sleep, if you\u2019re woken up in the deep stage you\u2019ll feel awful. So look into wristband or light alarms instead. Wristband can track your sleep cycle (think Fitbit) and light alarms will gradually turn brighter up until your alarm time, bringing you out of deep sleep more gently.",

Going to the gym, riding my bike several miles, or just having a long day of classes and walking several miles on my hilly campus. And finally, I have to do all work due the next day AT THE MINIMUM.

If you keep your mental health in check by prioritizing what is important to you (for me it\u2019s keeping myself as stress-free as possible), you\u2019ll be freed from a lot of the demons that plague your sleep.

To get there, slowly walk your times back. Wake up 15 mins earlier then go to bed 15 mins earlier. Get used to that, then walk it back some more. Also, make the room dark, quiet, and cool, because that\u2019ll help facilitate sleep\n\nFor the morning, set the coffee pot to start brewing so it\u2019s fresh when your alarm goes off. Immediately get out of bed and stretch. If you stay lying there, you\u2019re more likely to crash again. Bonus points if you walk barefoot on cold tile. Go to sunlight first thing, since that\u2019s the easiest way to get your body into rhythm. More bonus points if you go for a walk or jog first thing to get the blood pumping.

If you want to do this sustainably for a long period of time there's just no getting around it, you need a full 8 hours of sleep.\n\nAs for actually making the switch, the hardest part is falling asleep on time, but there are two main ways you can do it.\n\n\n\n1. If you have a week or two where you don't need to be up at a specific time it's pretty easy, just slowly push your bedtime back 1 or 2 hours every night (and day) until you cycle around to whatever bedtime you want. Like I said, going to bed early is the hardest part, so just going to bed a bit later is way easier.\n\n2. The quick way: Pick a day where you don't have anything important to do (and don't have to drive) because you'll be pretty much useless during this time. Sleep in as late as you can, then take a shitload of caffeine throughout the night and following day, only stopping a few hours before your desired bedtime. You'll be able to crash instantly when it's time.\n\nAlso, for about a month when you start doing this I strongly recommend melatonin before bed. You can get a 3-month supply at the grocery store for like $15. This will help your body stick to the new bedtime instead of just drifting back into your old routine.",

Instantly awake once the sun rises. I can't sleep with any light in my face, so it's pretty easy for me and staring out the window instantly makes me feel wide awake, there's some science behind that actually! Natural lights tell your body to create aweky hormones! It's wild how effective that is. It does take a few days to get adjusted to a new sleep schedule tho, so don't feel bad if you \"mess it up\" the first few days. \n\nMy work usually starts at 9.30am so waking up at 6 to 7 am and doing nothing for 2 hours felt like a waste.\nThat is why I started stretching in the morning and let me tell you it was a game changer. \nMorning work outs make you feel soooo good. Even if it's just light. \n\nMy philosophy in live is make every step of your day special and reward yourself! I love waking up in the morning because I know I will have my favourite breakfast to eat and sunshine and birds! Everything is waiting for me to embrace it.  (we are ignoring about 50% of the time where my depression hits and I end up a suicidal lump on my bed, only happy thoughts here) \n\nTo go to bed I just read a bunch until I fall asleep. Working out a lot throughout the day and being stressed af with uni work usually does the rest to tire me out. \n\nBut with this routine it's important to take a day of every time you feel super stressed and do absolutely nothing. Take a bath, go for a walk, meditate do whatever. \n\n\nI hope that was at least somewhat helpful. \nKeep in mind that I'm high-functioning depressed, so it's easier for me to keep in my routine during episodes. \n\nAlso! Don't take it too hard on yourself, everyone has a different sleep schedule and naturak clock. Everyone works differently, I get exited easy so my life motto might not be for you. \nRoutine happens once you force yourself to follow your schedule for a month, after that it's automatic. \n\nI BELIEVE IN YOU!!!",

The reason literally everyone is struggling with this is because of our current environment. We have too much artificial light, too little exposure to natural light. It sounds too simple but that's really fucking it, that's all it is. It's not even mainly the blue light from screens thing, that's a very small component. They've done studies where they put people with sleep issues out camping in the wilderness for a couple weeks. Their circadian rhythms adapt and they start sleeping when it's dark and waking up when it's light outside. \n\nSo to fix my sleep schedule, finally, I only had to do one thing. I moved to a place with a huge amount of natural light, opened all the blinds and never closed them. Now I can't change my sleep schedule to dysfunctional even when I try, even when I attempt to stay up late playing video games or watching a movie. I still end up falling asleep when it gets dark and waking up again at the crack of dawn. Don't bother fighting your body, just work with it. You are designed to sleep like this.",
