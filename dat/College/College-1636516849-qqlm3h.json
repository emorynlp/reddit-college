      "text": "In terms of getting accepted into law school, it can literally be any major. The most unusual/unique ones might even give you a better chance of getting in since you \"stand out\" more, but mostly the law schools care about your GPA and LSAT.\n\nAs for what prepares you for law itself, I heard History, English, Political Science, and Philosophy are the most popular ones, especially since you'd be doing a lot of critical analysis and writing in those classes. I think Philosophy is the most useful, however, since it also helps you get used to the Socratic Method that law schools use. That being said, law school itself would prepare you way better for a law career than anything an undergraduate degree will do.",

Don\u2019t fully rule out a stem major, getting a stem degree and going to law school is the textbook formula for becoming a patent attorney ;)",

      "text": "I would say to do what you are interested in. The specifics of law school will be what you want to practice, they are only looking for you to be capable of critical thinking for general law tracks.\n\nNow the caveat is if you are looking to do specific things in law. If you want to be an environmental lawyer for example, you really need some experience prior to law school, a lot of environmental law is covered in environmental undergraduate programs and is done over the course of all 4 years. All in all, I think that around 60 of my 120 undergrad credits had at least 3-4 lectures on law regarding the environment and interpretations and applications in specific scenarios. \n\nThen again, environmental law is widely known as one of the most difficult fields due to the fact that it is largely ambiguous and highly technical compared to other legal codes.",
