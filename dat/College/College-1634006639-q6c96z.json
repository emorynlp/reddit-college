  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in college. I\u2019ll be graduating in December and things are going great\u2026 except I feel like I missed something. Because I did. \n\nI\u2019ve been a full time student of a regional campus since 2018 and I love it. I transferred here from a private college after some bad experiences so I did have issues settling into the community. I didn\u2019t get involved right away. I had some trust issues. Once I did start feeling comfortable and getting involved around 2019-2020 disaster struck\u2026 I\u2019m sure you can see where this is going. \n\nThus my only real college experience is an internship I\u2019m doing this semester. I didn\u2019t get involved in clubs or the community or anything interesting really. I know I would have because I was starting to in February of last year. But now it\u2019s too late for any of that. I have a full semester and this is my last one anyway. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve lost some valuable college experiences and it just makes me feel sad. And I wonder, is there anyway to gain this back?",

We just have to move forward. \n\nBut here's the good thing, you're young. You'll hopefully get a job soon and then you'll have the financial freedom to live the life you want how you want. You have plenty of time to make memories and have amazing experiences post College.",
