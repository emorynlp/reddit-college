  "title:": "Decision on transferring/question on university prestige",
  "text": "I am currently in community college and plan to transfer to a university and major in computer science. I have a couple schools in mind most notably CU Boulder and UCLA. I would love to go to both schools and I think I would enjoy my time at both of them, however I could transfer to Boulder next year whereas it would take me another year of community college to go to UCLA. My question is, how much weight should I give university prestige in this decision? UCLA is one of the top schools in the nation and I feel like the opportunities and connections I could make there could be very well worth missing out on one more year of the fun I would have in university, but I also feel like Boulder is a not a bad school and I would still be able to do well for myself going there.  Also, my community college is part of the TAP program for UCLA so the admission rate is somewhere around 80% which is something I feel like I should be taking advantage of. \n\nI want to maximize the amount of fun I have while I am young and I also want to do the best I can to set myself up for the future. I know that the tech industry is less dependent on university prestige and more dependent on your skills and value as an employee but there is no denying the advantage of going to a school of UCLA's caliber.\n\nAlso, any recommendations for schools that have a good CS program and would also be very fun? I love to snowboard and do things in the outdoors which is why I think I would enjoy boulder and I've heard UCLA is fun and not too far from both mountains and surfing which would be great.\n\nTLDR; I could transfer to Boulder after this year or transfer to UCLA after next year; would the renowned academics of UCLA be worth missing out on one more year?",

      "text": "UCLA CS placements are among the best in the nation. Tech is very meritorious, so it matters less than say business- but since this is a rather stark difference in schools, I think waiting for UCLA is worth it.\n\nThat said, do you have what it takes to get into UCLA? Have you completed the TAP program in its entirety and have a good GPA? TAP admissions rate is closer to 60% IIRC, but this is still CS. CS is the most competitive major in CA and there\u2019s almost nothing you can do to guarantee a CS acceptance to UCLA or Cal. But if you think you have a shot, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it. That being said, also apply to Cal, as Berkeley basically reigns supreme over CS with the other big 4 CS schools.\n\nCal Poly SLO also has a top tier CS program. UCI, UCSD, and UCD are also great. SJSU is very good.",

          "text": "Yes I do believe I have what it takes to get into UCLA. I want to enjoy my time of being young and in college but I also want to do the best I can to set myself up for the future. Tech being meritorious as you said is the reason I am contemplating going somewhere else after only one year, I think that because of this I could go into a less prestigious school next year and still get to where I want to be career-wise. It's just a question of do I give up that extra year of experiences I would have in university for the potential benefits of the prestige of UCLA.",
