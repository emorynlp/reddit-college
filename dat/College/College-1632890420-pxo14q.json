  "text": "Heard my roommate crying last night (I was in the next room, they had the door shut, thin walls). We\u2019re friendly enough, but I know I\u2019m not the person they go to for comfort, and also I\u2019m bad at giving emotional support. Do I leave them be, and mention that I\u2019m here for them when I see them next? Do I send them a text? Do I just pretend it never happened? I want to be a good friend but I don\u2019t know how.",

Grab her some water so she isn\u2019t dehydrated, grab some snacks so she is eating, and sit there with her and ask what\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s all. Just listen to her and show her you are there for her.",
