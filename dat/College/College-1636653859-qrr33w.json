  "text": "Im a junior at a university majoring in economics and I already have an associates degree in Business Administration. Its kinda popped into my head that I would like to pursue engineering as i like the hands on aspect of it. Would it be worth it to switch or could I still pursue a career in that field with my degree? Would a minor help?",

If you are able to find the money for it, the better option is to just switch majors now. \n\nBe mindful that engineering has high fail rates, so an extra 3 years could easily turn into an extra 4 years so weigh the risks appropriately.",

              "text": "Gonna be honest a minor in engineer (if that even exists) is gonna be useless. Nobody will hire you with that at least for an engineering role. Also is it the hands on aspect you like or the problem solving? \n\nIf it\u2019s hands on id look into getting certifications that allow you to work as a technician. Stuff like welders, machinists, CNC, mechanic, etc. If your school offers these sort of classes then take a couple there. If not almost all community colleges or tech schools have some form of weekend or night classes, so you take a course  there without it interfering with your university classes. It would let you work in a hands on setting and while your degree wouldn\u2019t be helpful currently, In the future if you wanted to move to a management/office job a business degree would beneficial.\n\nIf it\u2019s really the problem solving engineering aspect, the really weight your options. Engineering is a lot harder if a degree than business and it\u2019s quite common to see people switch to easier majors or dropout all together. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t do it, but be realistic and know this is at least 3 more years of schooling. Best of luck man!",
