  "text": "Guys 100% hit on my significant other at her college when I\u2019m not there (LDR except I see her 3/4 weekends per month). It makes me feel shitty when she goes out even though I trust her. These dudes are coming up and trying to make her \u2018dance\u2019 with them, giving her nicknames. I am very uncomfortable with the whole situation.",

He told me once that he felt he wanted to do more to help me be safe, it was a good talk about what I was doing to be more safe and calming to him to know how I knew I could be safe. But we also have had very serious talks about where we see ourselves, our commitment, our future goals, etc; so we are on the same page of trust as much as we can. \n\nIf it is the party aspect itself that worries you, you should have both conversations; it\u2019s not abnormal to worry about your partner and their safety. However, if you don\u2019t fully trust your girlfriend then there needs to be a conversation about that; jealousy breaks the best of relationships. Also make sure to look at your girlfriend\u2019s perspective too. Don\u2019t be controlling of what she does with her time and understand that she probably worries about you too :)",
