  "text": "Do they believe that they will need that Earthly knowledge in their afterlife?\n\nWouldn't there be a chance that their afterlife would make them omniscient because some divine power would download the sum of all knowledge into them instantaneously? Therefore, they would not have needed college courses the entire time?",

Some want to feel like a \u201cnormal\u201d kid their age, others want something to keep their mind off of being sick, some may just want the achievement before they pass away as they won\u2019t get to see other life milestones (buying a house, getting married, having kids, etc).",

      "text": "People just want to do things for themselves, regardless of dying or not. Heck if you really think about it everything is meaningless because eventually you and everyone you know and love will die. Generations will pass and eventually most are entirely forgotten, blipped out forever despite living a full life. People with terminal disease are just living on a faster timeline to oblivion.\n\nAlso wouldn't bet on the last thing happening. No one has any concrete idea of what happens when you die so thinking you'll be endowed with infinite knowledge is wishful thinking. Just do what you like to do now no matter what time you have left.",
