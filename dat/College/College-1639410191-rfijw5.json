  "text": "I knew I wanted to attend college during my junior year of high school. My GPA was 2.5, I used to cut class and take very little to no notes, and at times I told myself I'd be satisfied with working a 9 to 5. \n\nAfter I graduated, I decided to go for my Bachelors, It was like a sign of honor and commitment to me, something to brag about to my family. Well, I'm in Healthcare Administration, 4.0 for one term. I'm going to retake English because I'm not satisfied with my overall. But it's acknowledging my mistakes and wanting to improve that has shaped me. I found something that makes me happy, something I'm passionate about that I don't pay attention to the \"it's a lot of years of schooling\" but it should be. I'm aiming to become a Surgeon, I'll graduate at 26, go into plastic or neurological residency and graduate between 31~32 and retire In my 60s",
