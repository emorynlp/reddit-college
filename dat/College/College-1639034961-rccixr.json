  "text": "As usual, this sub is pretty depressing right now. Lots of people are going through hard times or are just stressed, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with expressing that online. \n\nThat being said, it can also be discouraging to see so many negative posts. So in the hopes of bringing in a little positivity: Is anybody having a good time? Any good things happen? Anybody in a good mood? I\u2019d love to hear about it. \n\nNote: I\u2019d love it if everyone could do their best to keep the replies at least somewhat positive. There\u2019s so much value in posting about your issues and I strongly encourage it, but this post isn\u2019t an ideal place for that.",
