  "text": "exactly what the title says. i\u2019m a freshman (female) and i just want to go home. i\u2019m secretly praying that the covid cases go up here with this new variant so i can be home next semester, which i know is awful to even think, but i\u2019m so depressed and anxious here all the time. the only good thing here is my friends. i miss my bed, i miss my family, i miss my dog, i miss eating food that i actually like and doesn\u2019t make me feel sick (i have ibs). i really did enjoy being here until about the middle of november. i\u2019m burnt out and have no motivation to do anything. i keep telling myself \u201conly 3 weeks until winter break\u201d but there\u2019s still so much work to do and finals and it\u2019s still 18 days before i go home and i don\u2019t think i can do it. to top it off, i have to move out of my room this week because i cannot stand my roommate and that\u2019s a whole process i need to do with actually finalizing the switch then moving all my stuff out and into another room. i\u2019m just over everything.",

      "text": "I think its totally valid that you feel that way, I'm in college too but I live at home and take classes online, I don't know why your parents sent you off to a 4 year college from the start I thought basically everybody knew that its better to get your associate's  from a close community college while living at home then transfer to a 4 year school. That's what I did and I don't regret it at all. 18 is still really young I dont blame you for being overwhelmed.",

          "text": "Sorry for the tangent but I have to disagree about that bring the best option. If you have scholarships and feel confident you'll keep them, it's worth going straight to a 4 year college. Also, networking and career opportunities may be better. I interned with a large engineering company after my sophomore year, but they only recruit from a handful of schools. If you know exactly what you want to major in and/or have lots of dual credit/AP credit from high school, it can be better to go straight to the 4 year. As well, my degree program has 6 semesters of sequential classes, so doing the first 2 somewhere else, I would still have to do 3 years at a 4 year university anyway, so that's extra time and money to pay for 5 years instead of 4.\n\nThere are a lot of situations where a 2 yr college might make sense first, but there are advantages to a 4 yr college beyond just the fact that you get a better piece of paper at the end of it.",

              "text": "You dont get a better piece of paper at the end of going to a 4 year school from the start. You get the same diploma whether you start off at a 4 year or transfer into it after 2 years of cc. Getting a full ride from the start at a 4 year is an unusual circumstance, most people have to pay at least half of their tuition and getting an associate's at a cc is much cheaper. Plus you don't have to live on campus for a year at a cc. The classes at my community college were the same quality as at my state college.",
