My advice would be to take classes (when you can) just to see if it\u2019s something you may like or even love. I couldn\u2019t ever go to school just for a job that\u2019s practical, there\u2019s got to be some sort of passion in it for me to take it seriously but that\u2019s just me.",

I think it can be a great place to make friends, but for me, I have always made more friends in a work environment where we bond over the ups and downs of a job.

Its easier in that theres a lot of people, most people are starting fresh, and you see a lot of people all the time. Easy to break ice since you're all sharing the school experience. Harder because you actually have to put in effort, and a lot of people have an expectation that friends magically appear the second you set foot. Have to keep working at relationships if you want them, and want them to stay.",

Some assignments were not fun, and even some classes I was glad to finish, but still enjoyed it.\n\nFor me, I went to college simply to learn. And learn I did! High school felt like memorization whereas in college I actually could think. Anything I could imagine, no matter how esoteric, I could learn the ins-and-outs of. Post-Keynesian economics? There are people interested in that! Nuclear physics? There was a reactor on campus! History of Ptolemaic Egypt? There were 3 professors who studied it! Nuclear Weapon Policy? There was a who on-campus research institute devoted to it! The list went on. Whatever I wanted to learn about, I had access to world-class professors (and I didn't even go to a super-selective university).\n\nYes, socially I was lonely and bored often, but I loved my classes. I went to college to learn, and it exceeded my expectations.",
