  "text": "I had taken college classes at a local community college in my high school. By the time I graduated I was basically a sophomore for college. I was always a great student but last semester I failed 2 of My classes. I honestly don\u2019t know how I failed one but I guess it was because it was connected. However I\u2019ve been having troubles with school. I\u2019m on academic probation but I\u2019m going to be out of it by the time I\u2019m done with the semester but not only that I didn\u2019t reach the SAP requirements for FAFSA so I\u2019m struggling and I missed the deadline to appeal for it. I never knew about this until yesterday. I feel so horrible about myself and I could not sleep. I cannot bare to let my parents pay my tuition it\u2019s all my fault. I\u2019m trying my best now but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to pay out of pocket. I don\u2019t have 3690 bucks to pay because of my bad. I don\u2019t know what to do with myself and my friend tries to cheer me up but I know that I won\u2019t be lucky enough to get my FAFSA this semester",
