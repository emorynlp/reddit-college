  "text": "Currently I\u2019m writing this because it\u2019s 2am and I\u2019m still up even thought it\u2019s a Saturday night. I had intended to go to bed at 10:30 because I had a busy week both school and sports wise and wanted to catch up on sleep. But that clearly didn\u2019t happen and now I\u2019m past the point of tiredness and just consumed 4000+ calories of crap in 2 hours. \n\nAnyways I had a math test and research project I\u2019ve been worried about this weekend so I turned down an invite to a sports game and basically went to the library after practice. People are out and about having fun at parties and going out with friends and hanging out in the common space. \n\nI try to socialize every once in a while but I end up getting frustrated that I\u2019m still awake. My teamates are meanwhile getting very drunk and clearly not worried about effect on sleep schedule, so why can\u2019t I just have a good time (not meaning partying, not quite my thing) with friends or other teammates? Is there anyone else like me at college?",

You can't just sacrifice your time for a few hours of fun instead of studying for your math test which could have an impact on your future. So if you have something important to do, do that first. You will always get the opportunity to socialize and have fun every here and then.",
