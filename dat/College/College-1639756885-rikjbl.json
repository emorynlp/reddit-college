  "title:": "Failed in one class, in the first semester of the college - I'm thinking about changing my major",
  "text": "Software engineering's student, here.\n\nOur grade system here is based on 10 to 0, zero being the lowest grade possible and you need a six to be approved on the class, I've reached 5.7 in Algorithms 1 and I did talk with the professor but they will not give me a second chance, now I have to attend the same class in the next semester, while my friends are in Algorithms 2, I will only be able to fix it in the 4 period, cuz I have to get approved in Algorithms 1 to be able to attend Algorithms 2, then I must have Algorithms 2 to be able to attend other 2 classes...\n\nI feel a little bit destroyed right now, I have social anxiety and I will have to attend the class alone with the new \"freshman\", I don't know if it has something to do with the fail or I'm truly honest, but I feel like this major is not for me, too much math and logic problems, I'm really thinking about trying another thing like Environmental engineering, that was my second option but I discarded because I thought software would give me more opportunities and money in general. \n\nDoes anyone have gone through that too?",

I\u2019m a sophomore in my 30s. It\u2019s not about who you\u2019re around in class, it\u2019s about your own learning. Good luck next time around!",

Just out of curiosity, why do you think that software engineering will be difficult in long run? Of course, other than the nature of problem solving that is the main theme in the course",

I think the concept is relatable to failing a class and driving on to take it again and use it as a learning experience on your path to becoming an engineer",
