  "text": "I took a medical leave of absence from a private university in the US due to challenging mental health diagnoses and issues for 1 and a half years. After treatment, I have stood back on my feet and am ready to back into learning in college again. I applied to a couple of other colleges for a different major as I discovered that the major that I was originally studying was not something that I was interested in. However, I am rejected by all of them to which I assume it's because of the sudden grade fall before my medical leave. I am not sure if it's a thing where students that have taken medical leave will not be likely be admitted into other colleges or it's just my grade suck towards the end. I had great grades before I had the mental health issues but I feel like the sudden dive really affect my future. I am also an international student with which my country is not ideal for me to stay. I am also considering if I should work or study in other countries but it is also something that is an absolute stranger to me and I'm not sure where to start. I feel really lost and I'm really afraid that I've ruined my future. Thanks!",
