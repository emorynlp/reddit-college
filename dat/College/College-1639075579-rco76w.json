  "text": "Well, I did online classes and got my dates mixed up for a final that was due yesterday. \n\nI had a lot of homework, as per usual, and other finals to worry about and tried to go in and do the final the day before it was posted. I did one of my test, somehow thinking I did it.\n\nMy professor emailed me today asking if I could take it and to ask if I needed help submitting it. I emailed her about an hour ago and haven\u2019t got a response yet. This is where I suddenly turn to the worse. I mentally understand she has things to do, yet I\u2019m scared and anxious. All grades are due by midnight tonight and I can\u2019t see the post. Let\u2019s hope I\u2019m not screwed. \n\nIf there are any upcoming or new college students, please don\u2019t become a train wreck like me. Keep yourself on track and stay organized.",
