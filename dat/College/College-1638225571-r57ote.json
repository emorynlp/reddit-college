I\u2019m unsure what degree best suits me. \n\nI already have a bachelors degree in early childhood education and I am thinking about going back to the college I graduated from. \n\nIf that is the case, the only available majors are Information studies, management information systems, computer engineering, computer science, and information science & technology. \n\nPlease tell me about these majors, and other available majors you know about, and possible jobs they lead to. \n\nThank you!!!!!! -a lost teacher with little to no time to research",

      "text": "Comp E major. You can do a few things with this degree. \n\nEmbedded design focuses on devices that do a strict job. WiFi modules, microcontrollers, etc. You'd design the system, or a specific part of it, and produce any additional packages to go with it.\n\nVLSI is the process of chip design. A lot of Boolean Algebra and discrete math with this, so if you're good with that or feel comfortable learning it. You'd be designing processing units, RAM, ROM, or other logic devices.\n\nAlot of topics related to cryptography. Im not very good with any of that, but designing systems to be secure in various forms. \n\nAnd then theres quantom computing. I'm not gonna put my foot in there due to the complexity, but it is... Well its something.",
