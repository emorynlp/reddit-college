  "text": "I'm 24 years old with a degree in environmental engineering. I decided to go back to school to pursue a second degree in Fashion Design. All was going well my first semester until I checked my grade for my sewing class. Despite getting all A's and B's I failed the course because I didn't properly utilize studio time. I did majority of my work at home and not in class.. well I did do work in class but mostly just cutting and pinning stuff. I did majority of the sewing at home because I prefer my sewing machine.\n\nApparently working in class is a big percentage of our grade. I didnt really know that but here we are. Looking to hear similar stories.",

      "text": "Was your professor's grading criteria unclear? It *should* have been included in their syllabus (which would have been on you to read and understand, tediously boring as syllabi can be). If it's *not* in the syllabus, you can try to appeal the grade. If it was, you're stuck and might have to re-do it again.",
