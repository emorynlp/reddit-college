  "text": "College is a wild and stressful time for everyone and the last thing people need is to be feeling alone, discluded, or not surrounded by good people. Please get out there and talk to your classmates, anything simple really: how their day is going, if they wanna grab lunch, what their major is, etc. TRUST ME this makes a big difference, I will forever be thankful to the people who came up to talk to me,, I even became friends with a lot of them but even if you don't become BFFs people will appreciate it some way.",
