  "text": "So I managed to rack up 10 W's. The last W I got was from last semester. Barley have a 3.0 GPA.  I don't care to go to private school. I just want to go to a state school, get my degree, and finally stress about other stuff like a mortgage or what color I should paint the damn fence. I already applied for transfer but as I wait for a response I can't help but stress out about the amount of W's I have. I'm going in for engineering but I'm not seeing a light at the end of this tunnel. I feel like I really dug myself a deep hole.",

It\u2019s no Ivy League but it\u2019s a great state school. Keep your head up, I bet you\u2019re better off than you realize. :)",
