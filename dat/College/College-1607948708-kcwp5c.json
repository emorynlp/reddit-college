  "text": "You guys are all doing great things, but I\u2019m concerned at how frequently you seem to want to one up one another with disadvantages you face. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong - I\u2019m genuinely proud of you for overcoming whatever you\u2019ve overcome.  But I encourage you to consider a couple of things:\n\n1. Virtually everyone is dealing with something. \n2. Don\u2019t let your difficulties define your identity.  Let your strengths define your identity.\n\nIf a mod removes your sad post, don\u2019t take it personally.  We\u2019re trying to curate a community with a positive tone. \n\nGood luck on finals and happy holidays!",

Wonderful. You know, I\u2019m struggling not to snap right now, but this making it very difficult. Honestly, this intellectual dishonesty, here of all places?   \n\n\nPlease, tell me why I am wrong.",

I had already been having some motivation problems last semester, but covid has made me question whether or not I really want to finish my degree at all. College is rough and not everyone can succeed, even if everything seems to be easy on paper.\n\nTake some time to congratulate yourself for trying, and then think about what you need to do from here. For me, that meant taking a gap semester in the Spring so I can reevaluate my path. I hope you all can reach your own conclusions as well, best of luck to my fellow students.",
