  "text": "I\u2019m thinking of deferring my placement for 6 months due to COVID as well as the classes I want to take are no longer available for the Spring semester in January, but would open up in Fall 2022 again. I\u2019m 23 now and would start studying my Bachelor in Criminal Justice then. My only concern really is, wouldn\u2019t that be too old? I know I can defer it as my university confirmed but I\u2019m thinking of a classmate point of view now. Thanks.",

      "text": "You old fart. Why would you want to go to school when you plan to retire and take social security in 2023? These kids in college spend all of their time on their cell phones, computers, and other electric devices. They don't understand what it was like back in your day walking 15 miles to school in 5-ft of snow drifts only to realize you forgot your quill back at home. I honestly do not know why you think you would have anything in common with them. You will certainly stick out like a sore thumb. /s",

It\u2019s never too old to start something new. You will find all ages in college. Also, your classmates don\u2019t need to be your age to find something in common. Good luck! You\u2019ll do great!",

      "text": "Noooo!!! You are not too old, you are super young. Also, starting later might indicate that you set a path for your future, whereas, a lot of students who started at 18/19.. had zero idea and graduate with an insane amount of debt and no job. Even if they have a job, the job responsibilities could be irrelevant to the degree. Guess what happens? They hate their job or end up enrolling in graduate school for a career change.  However, I suggest researching the **return on investment** for Criminal Justice. If you decide to take that path, just remember, there are not a ton of jobs relevant to CJ. You may be put into a position of continuing your education (Masters/Law) because of the limited job opportunities for a Bachelor's degree which is OK. I'm in graduate school to expand my opportunities too, there is nothing wrong with that. It's a good idea to reach out to former/current CJ majors and grasp an idea of their experience and their job. Just like my path (politics), everything is about networking. Network. Network. Network! Undergrads tend to underestimate the importance of networking so don't make the same mistake I did in undergrad. Finally, really narrow down your 5 year plan and start researching job opportunities now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck!",
