  "text": "I\u2019m thinking of deferring my placement for 6 months due to COVID as well as the classes I want to take are no longer available for the Spring semester in January, but would open up in Fall 2022 again. I\u2019m 23 now and would start studying my Bachelor in Criminal Justice then. My only concern really is, wouldn\u2019t that be too old? I know I can defer it as my university confirmed but I\u2019m thinking of a classmate point of view now. Thanks.",

      "text": "You old fart. Why would you want to go to school when you plan to retire and take social security in 2023? These kids in college spend all of their time on their cell phones, computers, and other electric devices. They don't understand what it was like back in your day walking 15 miles to school in 5-ft of snow drifts only to realize you forgot your quill back at home. I honestly do not know why you think you would have anything in common with them. You will certainly stick out like a sore thumb. /s",

It\u2019s never too old to start something new. You will find all ages in college. Also, your classmates don\u2019t need to be your age to find something in common. Good luck! You\u2019ll do great!",

Plenty of people start late, whether it be because they were in the military or whatever reason it\u2019s fine. Just don\u2019t make it awkward and it won\u2019t be.",
