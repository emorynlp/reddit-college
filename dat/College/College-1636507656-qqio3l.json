  "text": "I have to take this class next semester and there is only one professor for that class and I'm really hesitant to sign up for that because there is only one person available for the class for the entire school/department and according to the rate my professor, his ratings aren't even that good and my friend who is taking him says he sucks too.  As much as I want to wait for other choices to show up I don't think there is going to be another choice (he was also the only person for the class during the fall semester too). Has anyone else had to take a class with a bad professor because that was the only choice and there was no other choice for another professor when signing up for classes?",

      "text": "yes. we just *deal* with it. a bad professor is never the sole cause of someone failing a course, otherwise everyone would fail (and the department would notice because they track this sort of thing).\n\nwhy deal with it? because at a certain point it is financially wasteful to hire two professors to teach a grand total of 20-80 students, so inevitably there will be a bad professor. dealing with sucky people is a part of life.",
