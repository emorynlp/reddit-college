  "text": "Hi, it's my first semester in person so I don't really know how to handle this situation. So in my one of my classes, we have oral presentations that will be finished by next week. However, since finals week is right around the corner, many people have stopped attending these classes since we're not learning anything, we're just listening to the students talking.\n\nI went to class today and my teacher got angry that there was barely anyone present (\\~10 out of 30). She said that she's going to make attendance mandatory for our next class, but the course outline indicates that participation is neither graded nor completely mandatory (the first six absences are excused).\n\nOn one hand, I have a pretty hectic schedule atm and I feel like I can be a lot more productive by studying during my class period for my upcoming finals. On the other hand, I don't want to disrespect my teacher and the students who will be presenting, but I feel like she's being a tad dramatic. I have a pretty good grade in this course so I'm not worried about having to raise it. What should I do in this case?",

      "text": "Just go. Not worth skipping for a potentially lowered grade. Professors don\u2019t have to adhere strictly to their syllabus and there\u2019s typically a note about that in that, that they reserve the right to change it. \n\nIn addition, if your prof is in any way vindictive they could grade your oral presentation more harshly since it\u2019s something that\u2019s up to their judgement rather than just a multiple choice exam where they can\u2019t take a few points here or there for no real reason other than disliking how you presented the informations.",

If you can\u2019t make it to class because of your schedule, talk or email your professor and explain why it\u2019s difficult for you. Most professors would appreciate you speaking with them and would give you some leeway",
