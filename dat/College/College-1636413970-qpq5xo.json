They didn\u2019t show up \ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m so confused what happened and I know it\u2019s not going to be a big deal considering it wasn\u2019t my fault. However, I feel like so many things have already been happening and I was already so nervous for it. I called and the school was closed. I then emailed them and now I wait. I know it\u2019s not my error because I received a reminder yesterday. I waited on the page (which I was directed to from my email reminder) until the timer finished and clicked on the link that popped up. I waited for 30 minutes. Was already a red flag when it said \u201cstarts at 9:00 a.m HOLD Music Interviews\u201d. I\u2019m a Drama major\u2026 has anyone else experienced this \ud83d\ude2d I know it happens for jobs, but didn\u2019t realize it\u2019d happen for college too",
