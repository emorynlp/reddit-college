  "text": "**PLEASE DON'T BE A DICK! I Just need a civil wholehearted conversation to at least know what to expect next and try to leave these beind without reprecussion. I made a mistake. I overreacted. I apoligize. Here's the info you needed.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S I don't need sympathy. I just need a civil truth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE ASSIGHMENT:\n\nAttached is the link to our class session today! Please watch!\n\nWe will be creating graphics for Social Media - so you must join our class FACEBOOK group to post.\n\nIf you don't have a Facebook - you will have to get one just for this class.\n\nThe group is PRIVATE - so no one can see what you post but the class.\n\nFacebook is a MAJOR advertising arena because it has MANY demographics (not just 12-20 year olds like TikTok) \n\nClients will want to use Facebook \u00a0and so will we.\n\nLINK TO OUR GROUP:\u00a0 \n\nAsk to joint the group - I will approve you and then you can post.\n\n\u00a0If you want to get full credit for this assignment - I would watch the video\n\n\u00b7  Look at the Principles of Design/Crapu\u00a0Power point\u00a0again.\n\n\u00b7  Log in to Spark [https://spark.adobe.com/sp/](https://spark.adobe.com/sp/)\n\n\u00b7  CLICK PHOTO COLLAGE\n\n\u00b7  Next CHOSE FACEBOOK POST\u00a0\n\n\u00b7  DO NOT Chose a TEMPLATE! *(I CAN SEE THOSE YOU KNOW!)*\n\n\u00b7  GO to LAYOUT\n\n\u00b7  Chose a LAYOUT with AT LEAST *4 PHOTOS*!!!\n\n\u00b7  The photos are the BACKGROUND.\u00a0\n\n\u00b7  **FONT should be the main thing I see! (watch video for clarification!)**\n\n\u00b7  **REMEMBER TO USE THE PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND CRAPU!**\n\n\u00b7  Make a separate graphic\u00a0each topic below.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00b7  Women's issues.\n\n\u00b7  Education.\n\n\u00b7  Climate Change\n\n\u00b7  Racial Issues\n\n\u00b7  Registering to VOTE and Voting\n\n\u00b7  CLick\u00a0SHARE - publish in the upper right\n\n\u00b7  Copy the URL \n\n\u00b7  Create a new post in our private group.\n\n\u00b7  Paste the URL into the post.\n\n\u00b7  After you paste the link in Facebook - delete the Link and **WRITE SOMETHING** to support your message!\n\n\u00b7  YOU MUST Include at least\u00a02 hashtags!\n\no  YOU MUST write a tagline to support your message (at least one sentence - no more than 3)\n\nPLEASE MAKE A SEPERATE POST FOR EACH GRAPHIC!!!\n\nHit submit\u00a0when you are done for grading\n\nMe SENT THIS:\n\nHey,\n\nI just want to talk about the assigment where I do posters on Spark about racial issues etc. This is me being civil talking to you trying to find a solution.\n\nI will apoligize for one thing: that I might been a little pushy. Or demanding. Or offensive. I might been too pushy and trying to fight. THAT is the only thing I will apoligize. I WILL NOT APOLIGIZE for the view I\u2019m making and the beliefs I believe in. I am not going nutural then to the left side because that is what I don\u2019t believe. I don\u2019t like to be forced to believe what others believe witch is what I don\u2019t believe.\n\nAll this can be searched up if you look besides the main companys and media for proof.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe that, fine. I will listen to your beliefs respectfuly. I\u2019m not going to hurt/argue you because you\u2019re a liberal. But I should have a right to say my opinion/beliefs like you/other students do. And that goes to grading.\n\nI\u2019m now banned from Facebook (smh) because of my beliefs (where Facebook wants the socialist way) and with that, I feel disappointed that you gave me a zero (its better if its a 50 so I know that I might offended someone or be too pushy or being to blend on my creativity) for the assighment. But you \\*possibly\\* gave a BLM poster an 100 for sharing BLM. Or someone with climate change showing what will not happen an 100. THAT\u2019S NOT FAIR! You gave all for a BLM/climate change poster, but you wouldn\u2019t give at least 1% on me because of my views (and maybe not being too creative, with that, I apoligize).\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t feel that I have the freedom of speach to express my beliefs in a safe way like you or the other students where you graded me a zero. See above for my apology.\u00a0\n\nIf you don\u2019t like what I have to say, it\u2019s ok. But I have every right to share my beliefs like your other students and you. And that the grading shouldn\u2019t base on political views, but the message and the creativity.\u00a0\n\nSo here is my solution: if possible, can you exempt me for this and any future projects where it involves Facebook. So that the grade will be acceptable. Adding to that, I would like an apoligy for not allowing me to share my beliefs without discrimation.\n\nI\u2019m writing this email with civility. I don\u2019t want to take this further. Please understand what I\u2019m saying.\n\nWHAT MY TEACHER SAID: \n\nFirst and foremost, you didn't submit it correctly. That is why you got a zero. I said in the recording to submit through the assignment that you were done so I would know to grade it. So, you are attacking me before checking that you submitted correctly. You should have asked me why you got a zero before attacking me. Since you no longer have Facebook, submit the assignment through Blackboard so I can grade it accordingly.\u00a0 Make sure to follow the instructions in order to get a fair grade. You are not graded on your political view, but on how it is presented by\u00a0how you apply design aspects you learned from class.\u00a0\n\nSecondly, I am going to forward your email to John because you accused me of some things that needs to be on the record. You accused me of giving people with a specific political view a 100% and those who are opposing a 0. I am open to everyone's point of view. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and I am not one to judge anyone for those beliefs. I will only get upset if I am accused of things that are not true. Especially when there is no valid proof of the accusations.\u00a0You want to talk about fairness? Re-assess your own email.\u00a0\n\nBefore attacking me, you need to proofread your email.\u00a0 You want people to consider your beliefs, make sure you present them in a professional way instead of just attacking someone for what YOU perceive is their beliefs.\u00a0\n\nI will reach back out once I had a chance to talk with John about this incident.\n\nWHAT I REPLIED: \n\nOk.\u00a0\n\nI deeply apoligize for that accusing email. Impulsivly, I tought you gave me the zero for the political view and that\u2019s the reason why I reseave the grade due to the world today, so I apoligize for that.\u00a0\n\nI apoligize for accusing you for unfairness and acusing you of not allowing me to share my beliefs. I was doing this impulsively, and thought the email is good without evidence. I also apoligize for not doing the assighment correctly and should\u2019ve watch the video. And to John for dealing with this situation. I tried to make it civil, but it turn into an attack, so I will take the blame for all causes.\n\nWith that, I\u2019ll take the failing grade and will do better next time. And any actions you or John would take.\n\nThis is how I should not act in a situation like this (nor will a conservitive/Jesus follower would) and I will make thing better next time.\n\nPlease forgive me for my mistakes and I will make it better.",

      "text": "Okay, so I\u2019ll admit that it was hard to understand what was going on here, but this is absolutely not how you talk to a professor.  You screwed yourself from the get-go based on the accusations and anger you showed your professor.  Your apology even comes off as you trying to get out of what you said as easily as possible, but that\u2019s not going to work.  I agree with what the professor said; next time, rationally go to the professor with the mindset of fixing things rather than an accusatory, angry, and blame mindset.  This mess could have been avoided if you just asked what was wrong and didn\u2019t immediately head to finding things to blame other than yourself.  If you didn\u2019t submit the assignment correctly, then there\u2019s no one else to blame.\n\nI don\u2019t think any amount of \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201ds or \u201cI\u2019ll be better\u201ds are going to fix this.  This is now a documented report.  If you really care about improving from this experience, show that to your professors instead of cheap and quick apologies.",
