      "text": "This is a weird time to be in college. As a senior, I've noticed that everyone on campus is incredibly standoff-ish. I don't know if it is because people are de-socialized(?) from COVID-19, if they're simply scared to talk to people, or if there are other reasons. People aren't talking to each other in the same way. \n\nMy professor gives us a 10 minute break in the middle of class and the room remains completely silent. Totally bizarre. So things are definitely weird right now.",

I was strongly against the idea of joining clubs since i though that i will just be joining a group of people who are already friends and will just shut me out of their friend group. But i was completely wrong, everyone was so welcoming and i had such a great time during our first meetup and made me feel like i belonged. You wont instantly make friends and thats totally fine i wouldnt say i have friends too and its been a 3 weeks since ive been on campus but joining any club will put you on the track lf getting friends. I know it may be hard having no friends but you just have to be hopeful and everything will be better",

This subreddit is littered with extreme posts asking if not making a friend after the first day or first week means they should just drop out. *PATIENCE* is something much of our generation isn't great at. Relationships take time. A lot of it involves going through several people before you find friends you actually connect with.\n\nYou should not expect to have any solid friendships at this point. Most of your first few months are going to be about meeting tons of people through orgs and events. Eventually you'll end up having a few groups or people you spend a lot of time with.",

If personal anecdotes are valid, I never had any strong friends during college. I eventually did form a small group of friends due to living in the same quad for 3 years.\n\nHowever, one thing that I don't see people really say is that college is a proper good time to start **networking**. That means finding people that you can reliably connect with later in life for jobs, professional advice, etc. These may be friends... or maybe they aren't really friends.  BUT in the end finding people that can help you after college is perhaps one of the important benefits of college hard to find elsewhere. That means you'll inevitably have to exit your comfort zone one way or another.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you HAVE to be friends with the people you network with. Separating professional life and personal life is another thing you have to learn at college.\n\nFor the time being, don't be afraid about not having friends! Pass the time how you personally feel. It's only been a week - you have plenty of time. Later on though, try to find courage and the opportunities to network when they come up. This is perhaps the most dreaded obstacle in most college people's lives - everyone has to overcome the hurdle at some point.",
