If you like ethics and philosophy then looking into computer science and then ethics of that is interesting. Also genetics for that one. If you like reading then maybe something with research since that apparently require reading lots of stuff. That one might be a stretch. If you like the environment or nature then you can study a lot in stern about that and get a job where you can go out in the field. If you like graphic design work or film or photography then you can maybe apply that to computer science and computational things or just photograph, film, and write about science. Lots of good journalists with knowledge in Science are needed. We can\u2019t have polarized America on science when a deadlier pandemic comes along. Media must help people fully understand and trust.

Their happiness won't matter then and you will be left alone and miserable. You will probably end up blaming them after they are gone and despising them. Remember, assuming they are good parents they do actually want you to be happy. \n\nIsn't that the reason why they want you to do stem in the first place? The alternative is not necessarily being financially dependent on them. You have lots of options. They will warm up to the idea soon enough and your relationship with them will probably be better off if you do what you want in this situation since there will be less bitterness later on in life towards them.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Are they paying for tuition? If so, then prepare to either have to have multiple discussions/ arguments over you switching majors. And you should also expect them to say, \"I'm not paying for a bullshit degree. If you want it then pay for it yourself\".\n\nSo you might be paying out of pocket or get into debt if you switch. But if you have a scholarship then study whatever the fuck you want, they got no say in what academic path you choose. They should help and guide, not demand.\n\nThere's also a third option, you don't say anything at all. When you graduate you'll have the degree you want and they won't know until you're done. But I wouldn't advise this, I'm not a fan of lying and it could ruin your relationship with them.\n\nDo you perhaps have an older sibling, cousin, aunt or uncle that could help you sit your parents down and articulate a good explanation and reason behind your decision to switch? Preferably someone in the same field, and if not then someone that's attended college.",

I don't see how graduating in a field you're good at and have a talent for would burden them.  If you mean that the only way you can feed yourself is innthe science field and you may well end up back at home if you pursue another degree? That is more likely if you fail out of a rigorous stem program or graduate at the bottom of your class and are competing for jobs with people who actually like the field. I'd suggest pursuing a field that you have an aptitude for and ignoring all these hypothetical scenarios in your head.",
