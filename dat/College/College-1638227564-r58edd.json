      "text": "Exercise Science. You will get specialized knowledge in the field itself to run a rehab/clinic/gym.\n\nHealthcare Management would be better if you want to work in an established hospital or clinic and work with a variety of patients, medical staff, and organizational challenges like laws, grants, and regulations. If you just want to start your own business or join one, you do not need this degree. If you really want to scale up your business self later, get an MBA.",
