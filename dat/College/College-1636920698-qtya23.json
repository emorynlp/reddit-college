  "text": "So far this college has already made me not like it. I  have a very busy month this week and all my weeks are filled with school and other stuff for different colleges. I have everything on a specific day that I worked out with everyone else. \n\nOn the 3rd of November a college I applied to wanted me to schedule an interview so I scheduled it for the  17 of November. I had nothing that day so\u2026So one week before their interview on the 12th I check the website and i tells me that my interview expired!! What?? It\u2019s the 12th and my interview is on the 17th what do you mean it passed? And it marked my interview application red\u2026.uh oh.\n\nI never put the interview on the 12th I  put it for the 17th! so when I checked it told me my interview has expired l I\u2019m thinking this college really moved my interview date without telling me?? that\u2019s so unprofessional. \n\n\nSo now I had to change my schedule. A different college wanted me to meet with them and I scheduled it on the 17th since apparently my interview date wasnt that day anymore. \n\nAnd now I get a notification from the first college saying that my interview is on the 17th. Are you kidding me??? I already do not like this college. AND I already scheduled a meeting with a different college day on the day of my newly switched interview date\u2026. And I\u2019m not thrilled with this interview because well it ruined my schedule and it causing me so much stress. \n\nI don\u2019t even feel welcomed with that college anyways",
