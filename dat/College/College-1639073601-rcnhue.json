You can join clubs, watch YouTube videos, take independent online courses, etc to learn things that you want to know without it affecting your GPA, your schedule, your stress levels, etc. You even run the risk of having to do it as a class taking the enjoyment out of it for you.\n\nBut then again, I'm not super familiar with your minor field. What do you think would be the benefit of taking college classes in it, especially if you plan to take your career another way.",

I was considering having it as a minor because I can\u2019t choose between the two I\u2019ve heard double major could be very stressful. I was considering having it as my career in the future, but I\u2019m not sure. I guess my first year is kind of like my experimentation year. My family advised I have it as a minor mainly because it\u2019s more of an artistic field. Thank you for the advice",

      "text": "I was a double major, double minor, with very little overlap amongst the four. A major/minor combo is absolutely possible (at small colleges it may be more difficult just because of scheduling and availability of classes - plan ahead!) and an \u201cunrelated\u201d minor could turn out to be really useful! \n\nI put \u201cunrelated\u201d in quotes because you\u2019ll hear a lot of \u201cif your minor isn\u2019t relevant to your career don\u2019t bother\u201d and I disagree *hard* with that for a couple of reasons. One is that if you\u2019ve got the time and the financial resources for a couple extra classes in something you love, go for it - not everything in your life has to be part of one single-minded goal. The other important thing to note is that not everything has to have a straight-line connection to your primary field of study to be of long-term, practical career use. Soft skills are important too, and it\u2019s usually not the classes for your major that teach you those. Maybe your minor spins directly into your field (underwater filming skills?) and maybe the connections are less obvious, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less *valuable.*",

          "text": "You bring up fair points but I think that it's important to differentiate between skills and a minor, and also I usually try to operate under the assumption that most people at college don't have the time and financial resources, otherwise they'd just do whatever the heck they want instead if being concerned about doing the \"right\" way. People extend their schooling, make schedule accomodations, might sacrifice time to work or network with peers and professors for a second piece of paper that means very little. The classes are valuable and fit a few in if you get the chance, but feeling like you have to get a minor is unnecessary stress.\n\nIn my personal experience as a chemical engineer I could have graduated with 2 minors by taking 9 extra credits. That either would have given me 3, 18-credit semesters, or I would have paid for an extra semester, or I would have taken summer classes instead of working internships that allowed me to graduate debt free and figure out what field in my career I really wanted to go toward. All 3 of those sound like poor decisions to me.\n\nI'd be curious to know what your majors/minors were and what all the pros and cons are from your perspective.",
