  "text": "I thought I would have made some friends in college. Part of the issue is I don\u2019t live on campus and never did.  I\u2019ve never been to a party or really been out and I want to. Everyone already has a friend group and I spend my week nights and weekends doing nothing. I do try to make the effort but nothing ever comes of it. I am a very nice person and fun I just don\u2019t get why people don\u2019t like me",
