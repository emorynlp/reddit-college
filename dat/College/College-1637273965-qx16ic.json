  "title:": "UPDATE: My teacher has reported my supposed cheating to the Academic Honor Board",
  "text": "[Read the first part of my situation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qwial9/my_teacher_accused_me_of_cheating_on_a_test/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSo I just got an email from the Academic Honor Board that my teacher reported my violation, which leads me to believe that I did not do good enough on my retake of that part of the test to convince him that I was not looking at answers during the original test.\n\nSo now I have 2 options:\n\n1. Admit that I cheated (which I did not) and have an individual meeting with the Dean of the College as a learning experience and I get an automatic F on one of 4 tests in the course\n2. Dispute the claim, and have to go through a hearing with the board to evaluate my professor's report, supporting documentation, and allow me to share my account. If the hearing decides I'm innocent there are no further consequences but if it decides I'm guilty (remember, still not) I either still get an F on the test and get to stay, or more likely I get expelled from the course and there is an F on my transcript.\n\nThe obvious choice would be to go with the hearing, but I feel like the evidence is piling up against me and if they decide that I'm guilty after the hearing where I supposedly lied about not cheating my punishment is going to be even more severe. What should I do?",

The allegation that the professor made against you is serious and can derail your career. If I were in your shoes I'd: \n\n1.) Get a doctors note that documents that you have anxiety. People who have been falsely accused fail polygraphs all the time, it makes sense that you would be nervous under duress. \n\n2.) Demand to have all future exams proctored by a neutral 3rd party. If he accused you once because you moved a chair, he'll do it again. \n\n3.) Explain your situation to the dean and anyone who asks. If he thought you were cheating during the exam, he should've come up to you and asked to see what was in your lap/pocket/etc. \"Acting nervous/guilty/etc.\" isn't a valid reason to accuse anyone.",

      "text": "Professor here - I deal with A LOT of academic dishonesty.  I surprising amount.  So, when I see \u201canother case,\u201d I follow the university process.  It can be super frustrating.  Here is the thing, though.  Once in while - I make a mistake by assessing something as a violation that wasn\u2019t.  I try hard not to make mistakes because of how shattering it can be to be falsely accused. Still, I am human and, sometimes, I\u2019m wrong.\n\nWhen I am wrong, then I go to the university to explain my mistake and to clean up the student\u2019s record.  Of course, I also apologize to the student.  My advice below assumes that you are dealing with a reasonable instructor. \n\nIf you have not already made your case to your professor, do so now. Explain your position and explain how you got to the exam answers without cheating. If you do this in person, also follow up with a summary email. \n\nIf the violation stands, then it is necessary to go with option 2. A violation of the university\u2018s academic integrity policy has to be provable. I\u2019ve had many cases where I suspected that a student was violating the policy. I did not report these because I had nothing provable. Thinking that someone saw a phone or that someone was looking at notes is different than something that is provable.\n\nOne of the reasons why it\u2019s so important to challenge this is that most universities operate on a sliding scale for disciplining academic integrity violations. Often, a first violation is an F on the assignment. A second violation might be something like an F in the course and a third violation is expulsion from the University. So, as you can imagine, it\u2019s best to avoid even one violation if this is possible.\n\nOf course, if you go through the hearing process, and things are still unfavorable, then there probably is also an appeal process. Be sure to take the process all the way to the end as much as you can.",
