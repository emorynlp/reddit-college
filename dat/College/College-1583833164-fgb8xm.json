  "title:": "MEGATHREAD: Colleges announcing cancellations due to COVID-19",
  "text": "**CHANGES**: Due to more and more colleges cancelling, which is good because that was the point of this post, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up. Starting now, **I will not add your university unless your comment specifically includes all of the info for me to add, in the format of Name, From, Until, and a source.** Date announced is assumed to be the date you made your post, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThought it'd be nice to consolidate them somewhere. The below list is fairly close to chronological order. I suspect that the shutdowns announced on Monday have essentially forced a lot of colleges' hands into shutting down: any school that hasn't announced a shutdown by the end of today will just look bad. Here's the list of schools so far that have cancelled classes in some major capacity:\n\nVacate dorms means the school has asked all students to move out of dorms. Extended means the school had originally announced cancellations, but added more dates or restrictions following it.\n\n|*School*|*Date announced*|*In effect from*|*Effective

The reason is that waiting for something to happen is reactive and not proactive, which can be really dangerous. For us, they won\u2019t cancel classes until one case is identified among students; but they also refuse to test students. In LA we now have community spread, and classes are 300ish people. Basically, waiting for someone to get tested and get confirmed means that there are almost absolutely other people who have already gotten it through community spread. By then, it\u2019s too late and cancelling classes means a mass exodus back to hometowns, and the unfortunate few who are sick may transmit the disease further. This is an extreme situation but it\u2019s not an unlikely one.",

The rest of Winter Quarter (the rest of this week, and next week), attendance is not required for a grade, and some professors are doing online sessions. Idk how this will impact Finals though, as Finals week is next week.\n\nWhat is crazy, is they announced ALL of Spring Quarter will be online classes. Courses that are defined as \"Studio\" (Art classes like painting and stuff) and \"Lab\" classes still have to come. But 80-90% of the classes next quarter will be online through Zoom. Its pretty wild, as UCSD has never really done online courses before.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, any event more than 100 people will be canceled, and sports events will be \"fanless\" for the time being. I am graduating in June, so Idk how this all affects Graduation but I guess we will see",

It's human nature to think that avoiding something makes it go away but it just doesn't. When classes are ready to start in the fall people will still have the Corona virus. Does this mean that were just going to shut down college? \n\nPeople are scared of this because it has a name attached to it. If this was another strand of the flu, it would be business as usual and we would just hear people talking about being careful to wash your hands and what not. \n\nClosing down campuses only compounds the fear mongering as now people are convinced that it is even worse. I have even heard people use this as an argument. \"They are closing down schools so it must be bad!\"",

Also, I live on an on-campus apartment and my housemates went away for break. We are all in our last year. And we need to eventually move out fully, even if they cancel classes, but that again raises the question of putting people at greater risk. Then figuring out graduation too. So, I think there is a lot of stuff that needs to be figured out, hence why schools have temporarily closed. I think most schools are going to cancel it\u2019s just a matter of dealing with these consequences.",

Classes transferred to online pretty much flawlessly yesterday, and we've been using Zoom for most of our classes, or webcasted otherwise. If this is your school's first experience with online, I would probably expect some hitches with the switch, but otherwise we're learning many of the same things as we would in normal classes.",

Stanford is also the de facto care center of Santa Clara Valley county (and we all rotate at SCVMC too, which is the safety net of the area), where there have been [43 cases of COVID-19, including one death](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/news/Pages/order-health-officer-03092020.aspx) in that single county alone, and this rate is basically accelerating (10+ new cases in the last 48 hours).\n\nWhere do you think these people have been getting care at?",

Many people believe it would be in our best interest to move classes online now before our next quarter starts March 31. We want to mitigate risk because if any of us got the virus and brought it home for spring break and gave it to a grandparent or immunocompromised family member that would be terrible. We are also in Washington state at \u201cground zero\u201d of the outbreak in the US. I\u2019m sure some people just want classes canceled for fun but I believe most of us are wanting to control this before something worse happens. Many people are upset about not having a graduation ceremony but they also understand that if at-risk groups attend and catch the virus in the big crowd that would be much worse. Many people\u2019s families would also be coming to graduation directly from the Seattle area. Try to think of it not as a selfish thing but as a community-oriented precaution.",
