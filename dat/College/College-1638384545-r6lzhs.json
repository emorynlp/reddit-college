  "text": "Hey all,\n\nI'm a freshman in college working towards a Computer Science degree. The only problem with that is my CSC-110 is an absolute pain with the amount of work, lack of comprehensive notes and the professor has an extremely thick accent that I cant understand most of the time, this actually lead to like 7 people dropping the course lmao. Now here comes the question, as of now I would pass but barely, feeling like I've learned nothing and I would be absolutely not ready for the next course. So I'm asking if it's possible/smart to retake a course I've already passed? Like, would it look bad on my transcript or anything? Of course, if I end up failing the final really badly and failing the class my decision is already made for me lmao. Sorry if this was confusing to read, I'm on very minimal sleep with a pounding headache and my meds are wearing off lol.\n\nThanks in advance!",
