  "text": "We got have a meeting with our program director and they didn\u2019t say what for but my friend did some digging and they realized they submitted my work instead of their own. I had sent them my assignment for them to look over and I guess they accidentally submitted my work instead- they didn\u2019t change the name or student number (they didn\u2019t try to pass it off as their own). \n\nI\u2019m so nervous about how the meeting is going to go. Has anyone been in a similar position or familiar with what happens next?\n\nThe thing is, they have the assignment they were supposed to submit saved on their laptop and the last day it was modified can still be seen. Also I had submitted my assignment a week before they accidentally submitted my file in their Dropbox.",

If it's a paper or writing assignment and your friend didn't directly copy you I don't think it'll be much of an issue to explain to the director that you were bouncing ideas or formats off of each other. If it's something with questions to answer you likely have a problem.",
