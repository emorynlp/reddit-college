  "text": "I\u2019m a commuter student who did informal recruitment during my third year and I\u2019m so glad that I did. I was a bit nervous since I was in my third year and never really thought I\u2019d join, but I was getting kind of desperate for friends. I figured, hey, I\u2019ll try it for one semester and if I don\u2019t like it then I can always quit.. From the moment that I accepted a bid, I have not been short of people to talk to or hangout with. It has become the best decision that I have ever made. \n\nI also had so many stereotypes that ended up being wrong - including the actual cost! \n\nJoining greek life is something that I highly recommend to everyone feeling lonely in college. I know it certainly isn\u2019t for everyone especially depending on the college, but every chapter is different. You\u2019ll never know if it\u2019s worth it until you give it a try",

          "text": "I think it heavily depends on the chapter you get into. My school has one chapter that definitely fits the typical frat stereotype, so much so that all of the sororities refuse to associate with the guys because they\u2019re way too creepy. But then another chapter has some of the sweetest and kindest guys I\u2019ve ever met. We also used to have a sorority full of girls who played DnD and they definitely broke every stereotype possible (they were eventually dropped due to low numbers tho). You really just have to meet people in each chapter and see how they talk about their own members and organization. \n\nAlso hazing is pretty much nonexistent if you do go to a school with an anti-hazing policy (which is a majority of schools). I can\u2019t even hold the door open for members until I\u2019m initiated because it can be classified as hazing.",
