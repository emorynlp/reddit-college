  "text": "This semester I wasn't able to apply due to financial aid ( over 1.5 million students couldn't in Tennessee college due to financial aid)\nHowever spring semester is coming soon and I have to reapply and Re-admissions back into the campus again and my parents are upset with me over not be in this semester. It's not my fault the school email every student about the financial aid situation and my parents still thinks it's my fault for it even tho I haven't had any problems till now. \n\nNow my father is making me major change to nursing cuz he sees money but nurses are at a all time low now and I don't feel like it's me. Im thinking of changing it to Physical therapy assistant.\n\n(Srry if this the wrong subreddit)",
