  "text": "My top choice is a private uni in Washington, the acceptance rate is pretty high (over 90 percent) but I'm still a little worried about whether or not this will affect my chances of getting in. I was going to apply by the early action deadline but I kept putting it off because I felt overwhelmed for some reason.\n\nI suppose this goes for the same for the other universities I'm applying to. Some of them are public and some are private. Most of them have decent acceptance rates but does the time that you submit your application have any affect?",

      "text": "I applied regular admission to over 10 universities, which had an average acceptance rate of 30-45%. Had a 4.0 GPA but my SAT score was mediocre and I had no extracurricular and I still got accepted to all of them. \n\nM point is, you have nothing to worry about, especially if the acceptance rate is over 90%.",
