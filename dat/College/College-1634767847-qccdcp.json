Halfway through my first semester I realized that the friends I had made were just like my high school friends (in a bad way), so I dropped them. Soon after that, I worked on a group project with the people who became my best friends that year. It will eventually happen, so don't get too discouraged.\n\nStudy groups are a great place to start because it gives you a reason to get together and then naturally get to know each other over time.",

As of late, with midterms and doldrums setting in, things have gone incredibly quiet. I often find myself shuffling from class to home just like I did in high school and I feel very unhappy.",
