  "text": "I go to UBC Okanagan and there isn't really good support for students who want internships unless you're a 3rd or 4th year student on Co-op. I'm a second year Data Science Major and I've taken a few 3rd year classes that I feel qualify me for an internship but I'm not sure where to look. Looking on places like Indeed I have a lot of skills they ask for but they're generally tailored to graduates or professionals in the field\u2014not undergraduates. Any suggestions? I'm good to work anywhere in Canada and this would be for the summer.",
