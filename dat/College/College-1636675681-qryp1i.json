  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m going to be an undergraduate TA next semester (*super excited*) and I\u2019ve got to have office hours. I know I can\u2019t schedule when I\u2019m *in a class* but I wanted to know (from the community perspective), what the *best* office hours are. \nEarly morning? \nLate night? \nLater afternoon? \nIn your experience, what seems to benefit you all more? When would you all be more likely to chime in / when would you typically need them most? Or if you TA\u2019d before, when were your hours and when did students seem more likely to engage?",

I also shifted then to the end part of the begining and end of the week so students had a chance to see me right at the begining and end of the week in case they wanted to start early or try to get in questions before the weekend.\n\nMake sure to also set boundaries, or else students will cross them.",
