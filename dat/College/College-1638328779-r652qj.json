  "title:": "Is it normal to get waitlisted for everything?",
  "text": "I'm 2nd year, I normally take 3 classes per semester (12 credits) but this coming semester I got waitlisted for 2 of the 3 classes I wanted and *all* of my backup classes, not even just short waitlists, long ones, there are more people on the waitlist than there are in the class. I got \"in\" to one class but couldn't actually register because they decided to put me in a section that's at the same time as the one class I got even though that's not what I signed up for, now I'm being put back at the bottom of the waitlist for that class.\n\nI ended up just signing up for the waitlist for every class i could. I've contacted the registration office and department head and they were unhelpful.\n\nI've never had this happen before. Maybe I'm not understanding something but I don't understand how this happens, the school should know how many people are registering for the next semester in my major, why are there not enough seats? Is this normal? I'm pretty annoyed that I'm paying money to go to this school and they don't have enough classes for everyone.",

          "text": "I've declared my major, a good chunk of the seats in these classes are held for bio majors (though idk why you'd take 2nd year bio classes if you weren't), and these classes are requirements for all bio majors regardless of their concentration, except one which is a 3rd year course required for my concentration (also declared) that I have the prereqs for.\n\nI definitely got waitlisted for Gen eds in first year but it wasn't a big deal since I had a lot of options. Right now I'm legit on a waitlist for every single 2nd year course that I haven't taken plus some electives just in case :(",

Award more graduate assistantships and let PhD candidates try to teach extra sections. They can\u2019t just not let you graduate because there weren\u2019t enough seats in the classes.",
