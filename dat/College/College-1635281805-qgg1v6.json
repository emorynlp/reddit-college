  "text": "What do you think of professors who like to yell at students and other professors? I have one(now the chair of his department) that literally yells almost every day at people in his office for the stupidest things. You can literally hear him down the hall screaming. He yelled at someone for peeking their head in his office to see if he was available. He also freaked out on a newer Professor for reasons that were completely out of their control. I\u2019m of the opinion that this is unprofessional and I wrote on an evaluation to the whole department saying so. I\u2019m hoping someone will actually deal with this once and for all cause it\u2019s stressing people out and making for a hostile environment. \n\nI also asked them to address the importance of mental health in school cause I don\u2019t think they are taking it seriously enough. The freshman/sophomores are really going through it this year and I don\u2019t think they get just how bad it is. Do you think this will fall on deaf ears or from your experience, do you think they\u2019ll actually say something. I literally have nothing to gain from this as I\u2019m graduating this semester, so I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll recognize that and take it seriously.",

      "text": "> I\u2019m of the opinion that this is unprofessional\n\nI agree. Respectful adults don't yell at other people, full stop. Yelling at stupid shit you see on TV or read on the internet or yelling at the air while you're driving and no one can hear you is totally acceptable, though, lol, but that's because you're not actually yelling directly *at* anybody. \n\nThey probably know the guy is an asshole, but chances are he's not *enough* of an asshole that they can do anything about it. It's possible that someone will say something, but many people don't want to stir the pot and say things like \"that's just the way he is.\" \n\nIf he's yelling at other professors I *assure* you that professors are just as annoyed by him as you are.\n\nEdit: I should add that I'm a grad student and not a professor, but I used to work in k-12 education (there are more yellers there but it's just as unprofessional) and have taught undergrads, so I feel that maybe that is \"good enough\" that I'm allowed to share my opinion.",

          "text": "I think you qualify enough lol. I had sent the evaluation to a professor that is reading through all of them first before sending them off to faculty members. I think she\u2019ll be the best person to address everything. They don\u2019t have enough people at this school to take any serious action against him, but I\u2019m really just looking for him to recognize what an issue it\u2019s causing. And maybe understand what it\u2019s like for people to be on the opposite end of his misplaced anger. There have been moments in the past where he was called out, but some time has passed now and I think he needs to be talked to again. It\u2019s just disappointing that a central figure in this program can\u2019t learn respect. It puts a cloud on the whole program.",
