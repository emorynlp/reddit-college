  "text": "After this year is over, I\u2019m dropping out to take a break. This year, our PLUS loan was denied, so I had to take out a Sallie Mae loan. After seeing how much it\u2019s going to cost me to pay it off, I definitely can\u2019t afford this.\n\nI\u2019ve been given a hotdog stand. 6 figure salary potential and free experience in learning to run a business. I\u2019m gonna work it for a while, pay off my loans, and save up to open a business. With a major in finance, my goal was to eventually open a business, anyway.",

Prices and menu yet to be concretely determined, but I have a few good ideas. If you\u2019re wanting to get into business, a hotdog stand is a great place to start!! Very little overhead and the cart itself isn\u2019t super expensive!! [This](https://hotdogcartstore.com/product/the-big-dog-cart/) is this one I\u2019m using!",

So he\u2019s giving it to my dad and my dad\u2019s letting me run the business since he\u2019s also too busy to do it. Hotdog stands generally can give 6 figure salaries and even more. I might not make exactly that much, but the potential is definitely there. And thanks!!",

          "text": "That\u2019s freaking nice. Pick apart your uncle\u2019s and dad\u2019s brain about running the hotdog business. And quite honestly, if this goes well, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll even need to go back into college to major finance. You\u2019d already have the experience in the real world dealing with business/finance.\n\nI saw your other post of scalability, and I\u2019d recommend giving this book a read/listen - Crushing It! by Gary Vaynerchuk . It gives a different perspective to scaling a business using social media. For example, documenting your process of running and starting the hot dog business. I\u2019d watch something like that on YouTube. There was this one dude I watched where he sold snacks/candy in school and had a YouTube channel about. He built a bit of a following just by running a business so simple as selling snacks. I ended up selling snacks too in high school because of him! Just my 2 cents.",
