I would be able to go to events on campus and hang out with friends on weekends.\u201d Etc. Mentioning the social aspect and making friends would help them understand if that\u2019s the reason why you want to be on campus more often. If it\u2019s just to get used to being on campus or something then mention that. Just tell them what\u2019s up. They\u2019re your parents, so this conversation shouldn\u2019t be that hard to have. They should be able to understand your perspective and respect your feelings.",

If you feel bad you can always say that you'll visit again next weekend and will cook for them while you're there.\n\nThese are the times when you have to show that you can be an independent adult, which includes starting value your private time as your own.",
