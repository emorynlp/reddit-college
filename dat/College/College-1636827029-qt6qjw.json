  "text": "I got an email a couple weeks ago saying I missed 3 homeworks in my linguistics class. I was super mad at myself, but there was nothing I could do because the syllabus said there\u2019s absolutely no late homework. \n\nYesterday, I missed another homework. I was super stressed and I was studying hard for a test in a different class and it just slipped my mind.\n\nHow badly is this gonna fuck up my GPA? What are the chances I fail this class? I\u2019m really mad at myself.",
