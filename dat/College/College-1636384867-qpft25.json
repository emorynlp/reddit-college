  "title:": "I\u2019m a graduating senior and no one is helping me ensure I will graduate",
  "text": "I am a first gen college student and the oldest child in my family so it\u2019s kinda confusing to navigate school stuff in general. My advisor is alright but in the past 3 years she has gained A LOT of additional responsibilities at my college. For example, she used to be just a professor and head of my department, but she has now become professor, department head, chair of my college\u2019s chemistry department, and also does research. Basically, she is very busy. She is also ~70 years old. I don\u2019t particularly have full trust in her when it comes to details of my graduation requirements. \n\nI made an appointment with the person at my college who basically approves degrees to graduate. I woke up early to meet with him and our meeting lasted approximately 2 minutes because he insisted that my advisor knew best. \n\nI went to enroll in my classes for next semester and 4/7 showed error messages when I tried to enroll. I am currently in an email frenzy with administration for the past 3 days trying to just get into all my\nClasses. I am going to have a breakdown. I just want to fucking graduate and no one is helping me.\n\nI\u2019ve completed 3.5 years of a bachelors in science and I can\u2019t even have a conversation with one competent person who actually pays attention when I ask a question. \n\nCovid has made administration so picky and lazy it\u2019s a complete joke.",

Then cross out or put a checkmark next to each clas syou\u2019ve already taken (or are currently taking) This should give you an idea of what you\u2019ve already taken and what coures come next.",

          "text": "I know what I have taken and what comes next, but my issue is that this course plansheet we have online is out of date. My advisor is basically the person who makes our curriculum and also does the final approval. Since she is so busy all the time it is difficult to get a clear or quick answer when I have any urgent questions that stray from what we speak about in in-person meetings.",

      "text": "1. Find a list of all the classes and requirements you must meet in order to graduate. This would be available in a course catalog online. Most schools have some kind of program that shows you your degree process, my school used degreeworks. \n\n2. Check what you have left to complete. Make sure you are getting all of your requirements done by the time you want to graduate. \n\n3. I had to apply for graduation my junior year. Reach out to the registrars office or look on their website to see if that is something you must do. \n\n4. Know exactly what you need from the administration or what information you need to learn and stay on top of them. If possible go to the registrars office in person. Go to your advisor in person, see if you can meet with another professor in the department that advises other students. \n\n5. If you are told anything about your graduation or requirements, get it in writing. \n\nAnd as far as registering for classes goes - you are doing the right thing. Make sure your advisor knows exactly what the problem is and keep in touch with her until it is resolved. \n\nAnd most importantly, take a deep breath, drink some water, and know that it will work out. You are doing everything in your power to make this work and if you keep bugging people they will eventually solve it so you\u2019ll leave them alone lol\n\nGood luck friend, I know it\u2019s a stressful time but you can do it!",
