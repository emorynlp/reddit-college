  "text": "There's alot of controversy that college and education is a scam. I can see where that is coming from. College degrees do not garuntee you a job, success, nor a happy life. Also, why doesn't high school teach you the basic necessities of life such as doing taxes or actual tasks that you will need to survive in the United States?? On my side, tbh, I believe education isn't a scam, but bullshit. Why spend almost 100k on a degree that you are passionate about (let's say a liberal arts such as Criminal Justice or Psychology) and have a possibility of coming out with an 20-40k job compared to STEM degrees like Computer Science or Information Technology with the possibility of 50k-70k jobs? Why do they not have the same chance of success? I literally have family that got degrees in Culinary Arts or Psychology, and didn't get into what they wanted to do because they were in debt DUE to the bs they were told of college being needed. The education realm is just a business at the end of the day. They got me messed up, paying 100k for a CHANCE to have a successful career. Either way, what do you think? Some may not have agreed and I respect that, but keep it mature please.",

      "text": "Not everyone is gonna share my opinions, but since you've asked:\n\n\nI think the main issue is that we've been sold college as the only option, and the automatic ticket to a high-salary job. Neither of those things are true.  Schools need to show students that there are other options and actually present those options as equally respectable careers instead of treating college as the default. There also needs to be more of an effort to show students how to turn various degrees into viable careers, instead of letting them assume a degree will mean a job or pushing them towards career paths that don't fit. I think both of those things would help clear the \"college is a scam\" mindset. Along with that, nudging students towards less expensive options (ie, transferring to a 4-year from a CC) would be nice.\n\n\nThat being said, I don't think college is bullshit.\n\n\nI know that, being first gen from a very poor community, even the opportunities I've gotten while being a student were better than anything I would have gotten without a degree. Having professional mentors and being exposed to new opportunities through college helped a ton, both in figuring out what I *want* to do career-wise and in building skills to do that. College really opened up the world for me. While I have friends and family who I wouldn't push towards college, it's been great for me.",

      "text": "People paying 100K without a guarantee of employment and well out of their means of affordability are uninformed idiots. Why are you putting yourself in debt for an 'experience' when you can go a cheaper route and get to the same finish line with the same degree? Sure you have to work harder to network but that's easy. I am about to complete my masters with no debt, and at the very least I have a job placement that is way more than my parents ever made and more comfortable.  People have to plan and be strategic of their future.",

      "text": "I think a lot of it has to do with the demand for those degrees. If there are 100 people, and 80 get a degree in criminal justice but only 20 get it in computer science, businesses have a harder time finding computer science people to fill their jobs. Because companies hiring criminal justice majors have a lot more options, supply and demand means they can pay less since they have so many options of people to chose from. The higher paying jobs are simply because the demand is higher (among many other things, including the skills are different).\n\nAlso, getting a school loan for $100k doesn't mean someone will pay that off in 1 year. It should be paid off over many years. Like - if you get a car loan, you don't pay it off in 1 year. You pay it off in usually 5-7 years. Mortgages - same thing - typically 30 years, but sometimes 15 years. Loans are just a way for you to spend money now that you don't have, but will pay off gradually in the future. You have to pay interest or what would the benefit be for the bank/financial institution to lend you anything? They are a business, and use that interest because it is always a risk to lend money. \n\nI think there is a LOT of misrepresentation when it comes to school loans that we are guaranteed a higher paying job just because we will have a degree. Yes - degrees to help in some professions, but doesn't mean you need one to be successful. But in reality, there are so many different variables, and they don't tell us how the real world works in paying off these debts. \n\nIn the 1980's and before (maybe the 90s? - not sure, I'm too young to know haha), high schools actually did have classes on financing and other real-world topics. My high school didn't have any of that. I think testing has a lot to do with that as well, but what we learn in school today is different than decades ago, and it really does a disservice to students. I wish I knew all about loans and taxes before I got screwed as an adult either trying to figure it out or learning the hard way.",
