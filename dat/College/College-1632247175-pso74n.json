  "text": "I've made it a point to say hi and ask how the janitors at my college are doing when I see them. Too many students and professors ignore them. Everytime I get a bright smile and they stand a little taller. They keep us from living and learning in our own filthy messes. I feel like that deserves so much respect. Whoever feels motivated or confident please start doing the same to you janitors. Let's show them we see them as people and respect what they do for us.",
