  "text": "So I'm taking finals right now as a freshman and instead of studying for the last hour, I've been calculating my grades. If I do as well as possible on my finals as I hope, I'm going to end my first semester with a 3.53 GPA. This seems low because I came out of HS with a 3.9 GPA, but I know they weigh things differently in college so I just kind of want a feel for how I did this semester.\n\nI'm currently in a chemical engineering program if that matters.",

It really just depends what you want to do after college. If you want to just get a job then gpa doesn't matter as much. If you want to keep going up in academia then it matters more. \n\nIn general though, 3.5 is really good.",

You've spent a couple semesters in college and still don't know what a good GPA for college is? I wonder if you just posted this question here to try and get validation. Keep it up though, 3.5's great.",
