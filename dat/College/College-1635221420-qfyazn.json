  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in computer engineering at SJSU. This is my second semester in college on campus. I cannot understand the lectures at all for about half my classes. My peers report the same at least in my area of study. How common is it to get a terrible professor or a professor you can\u2019t understand at all? Self study is often sufficient but sometimes the subject is difficult or the expectations unclear. \u201cSelf study\u201d usually means hundreds of hours spent studying for a course with no guarantee of even passing.\n\nHaving one of those days that makes me question why the fuck I\u2019m here.",
