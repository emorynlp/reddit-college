  "title:": "Impossible Transcript Due-Dates Need Help!",
  "text": "I am currently in a semester at a community college and am trying to get enrolled for spring semester 2022 at the 4 year university. I just got accepted into the university but there was a new hold for registration. The university wants the transcript with this semesters grades on it but I can only get the updated transcript on December 28th when of course, the transcript is finalized. The University has set a due date for the transcript on the 22nd making it impossible to submit an updated transcript on time. Before getting into a lengthy conversation with both colleges, I want to know what they could in order to accept the transcript in a timely manner. Would it be unreasonable to ask for the Community college to expedite my transcript because all my classes are finish for the semester? Also, the university administration closes on the 23rd for Christmas break hence the due date for transcript submission. I don't want to wait till the 3rd when they open back up because it'll be too late for me to get good professors. Obviously, this is in the pursuit to have good professors the next semester, all good ones will probably be taken up if it goes at this pace. Even if I had done all registration earlier this semester, I would assume the holdup on the transcript would still be an issue.",
