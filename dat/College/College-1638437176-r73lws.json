  "text": "Sophomore in college. I took calc 2 a couple semesters ago, failed and then decided to re-take it again this semester. It's a requirement for me to graduate, but I ended up failing again. It's just so fucking hard on top of all of the shit I've been through this semester.\n\nMy father finally died of cancer.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD and now have *part* of the answer as to why I'm so incredibly, unfathomably awful at studying.\n\nI was out from COVID for 2 weeks, and took two of the exams for this class only a couple of days after I came back, with no resources for learning during those two weeks while I was also trying to catch up with all of the other classes I'd missed...\n\nI'm at a loss now. I'm not sure if this will further destroy my GPA, or if it will just keep the higher grade? I'm completely fucked, and I hate it. I'm mad at myself, and I'm mad at the world for this cursed semester.",

      "text": "I'm a math instructor and calculus 2 is indeed a hard class. Some schools let you retake a class twice and replace the passing grade. Take it again next semester while it's fresh. Go to office hours, the tutoring center, any resource you have. \n\nAs someone who also struggles with ADHD I feel your pain. It's really fucking hard to study something you don't want to study when you have ADHD. \n\nAnd be open with your professor about your struggles. We're human too (at least most of us). Sometimes there's some \"fixing\" we can do. If you're not an engineer that's going to be building bridges I have to drive over, maybe I'll make typo and enter a C for your final grade if it's close enough. Clearly if your total grade is like a 15%, you're probably not passing. \n\nI mean if a student told me their dad died from cancer, I'd tear up a little. That's so sad. I'm sorry you've had a such a rough year. Maybe your professor will understand.",
