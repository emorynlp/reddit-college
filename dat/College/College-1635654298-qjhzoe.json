      "text": "Yea I do, it feels impossible to study because the readings are incredibly long and over complicated. Not to mention written in very very old English\n\nThe challenge for me is trying to decipher what the philosophers are just trying to say instead of what philosophical point they\u2019re trying to get across. It\u2019s annoying because I literally cannot understand them, I always have to stop and do a ton of dictionary searches and it\u2019s very tedious",

And the formatting is kinda crazy bc the required readings are in the written lecture (no videos) so it\u2019s like 30 pages of things I don\u2019t understand and I don\u2019t even know what to tell my professor I don\u2019t understand bc it\u2019s all of the class!!",

      "text": "Philosophy is one of those really annoying subjects in the sense that you never win. Most professors who teach the subject do it from THEIR take of the readings and not what the readings literally say. So, when you\u2019re tested, you fall flat on your face unless you wrote every word they said.\n\nThen, on the other hand, the class can just be painfully difficult and overly technical. Philosophy is, generally, a no-go unless you have to take it. It\u2019s too easy to underestimate and fall victim to.",

      "text": "i took a more niche type of philosophy class that focused on hinduism and buddhism, but while it was tough at first, i eventually focused on trying to understand how to think and not to take everything in the texts as pure fact. Just try to think outside of the box when you read the texts and question \"why\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr... you just have an unlucky class :( . Sometimes bad luck just happens",
