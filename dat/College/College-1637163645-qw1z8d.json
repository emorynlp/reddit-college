  "text": "I (19f) am a college student. In my statistics class, we have a group project, but I have not connected with the two guys I am working on it with. We have had a few days in class dedicated to working on this project, but on the first day, we all had to meet I had a severe anxiety attack in class and have not been back since. In class, their body language was closed off and they were seated in an area where I could not physically join them either. It's been a week and I'm stressing about it since I really need a high grade in order to pass. However, my depression and anxiety are becoming increasingly difficult to deal with and my actions aren't making it any better. I am in therapy for all of this and have been doing better, but my social anxiety is debilitating. At this point, I know I should talk to the professor, but I'm not sure how honest I should be about everything. Any advice on where to go from here?",
