  "text": "Someone in my class emailed me about our take home exam, in it they have one sentence about how they are approaching a part of it and include a one sentence summary of their answer. They are al student that is frequently confused on the course and there is something else in the course that encourages collaboration, but this is not one of them. Do I ignore their email, respond saying I can't help them and that they should refrain from contacting me again about the exam, or tell the professor?  Any tips would be appreciated, the final option feels too extreme and although I glanced over their email and can't recall what answer they gave me, they did give me an answer so I fear this is just as much about me recieving help (which I don't intend to take) as it is about them asking for it.",
