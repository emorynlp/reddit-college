Also, my teacher gives you partial credit as long as you attempt the problem. So while studying for tests and quizzes I betted a lot on getting partial credit. As long as I got halfway through the problem I would get credit. Do that for all the problems and I realized I could pull it off. Now that I think about it, my teacher is really lenient when it comes to grading.\n\nThe thing I struggle the most on is integrals and manipulating the equations so you could integrate it. \n\n",
