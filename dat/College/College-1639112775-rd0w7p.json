  "text": "Thinking of pass failing my Calc class because I don\u2019t want a C+ (might get a B if I do REALLY well on the final), but I didn\u2019t really want to stress over it. It\u2019s my first semester. Wouldn\u2019t pursue mathematics in grad school but maybe something that is math-adjacent (something in stem, economics, or statistics). Is the P/F worth it or should I just take the bad grade?",
