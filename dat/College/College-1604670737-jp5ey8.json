If you are sufficiently qualified to teach a college class, learn how to read a damn clock. \n\nA few years ago I taught in a classroom immediately after a habitual late-ending professor. There were 10 minutes between classes. I routinely had to enter the room when he was five minutes over and start getting out my notes, organizing handouts, etc. My students loitering in the hallway would take my entrance as their cue that it was ok to enter and start taking seats. It was hilarious to watch the other professor try to figure out how to finish his endless thoughts when his class was getting up to leave and I was literally taking over the teaching area. \n\nDon\u2019t be that guy. If you ever teach, end your damn class on time!",

It can feel like an uphill battle if students blatantly disrespect your efforts; however, the majority of students are attentive, excited, and engaged in elementary music or high school band class.\nIf you need to leave class, leave class without feeling guilty. You are an adult that has priorities and expectations outside of the classroom. Unless you consistently disrupt and leave during class time, you do not owe them an explanation. At that point, extend a small courtesy and let them know what is up--just to be nice.\n\nEDIT: It is perfectly okay for you to leave class time or a Zoom meeting if the professor holds you over. They need to respect YOUR time, just as you respect their time.",

I think profs that go over in time don't respect their students and it pisses me off.  So log off if you want or need to.  If they announce things outside of your class period because they routinely go late, I would complain to the chair (not that I am a big fan of students complaining to the chairpersons as they are getting it from loads of students right now).",

The report tracks the log in and log out times and I can sort by student. \n\nAs to the OP, I think a short email to the professor letting them know that you have another commitment after the scheduled class ending time and is there a way to obtain the homework assignment by the scheduled ending time so you can ensure you are able to complete the assignment js appropriate.   I start and finish my classes on time - at times they go over of students have questions but I do acknowledge the end time of the class and tell students they are free to stay on or leave.  I remain until the last student leaves the session which is why it is obvious which students just log in and then leave to do something else.  I do not understand why students do this as they certainly are not learning anything by logging in and doing something else and I do not take attendance.  It is up to the student if they want to learn.  I care as much about the success of the student as they do.",

So it was usually easier for students to navigate issues if they built rapport with faculty leadership, as it actually led to significant policy changes.",
