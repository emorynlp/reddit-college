  "text": "First of all, I'd like to apologize if this isn't the right place to post.\n\nI'm a sophomore student, really interested in Literary Studies. I try my best and study really hard, since I want to join the Academia at some point. I got straight A's last semester and was trying to get a 3.7-3.8 GPA, but after a bunch of team projects I'm really struggling. One subject was always an A+ for me, but we got a D because another group member didn't do much. I tried not to care, because we were friends so I just thought 'bad luck, s\\*\\*t happens'.\n\nToday, we had another group presentation. We split the work between 5 people. I read 5 papers and explained my part (we had to record the audio, so the teacher only had to press 'play'). Expected same from the rest (you know, I don't want to bother other people telling them what to do, it wouldn't be nice). The teacher asked a question to another member and nobody answered (camera off, micro off). This person was online, talking with us on another chat and suddenly shut up. Like, pretending we wouldn't notice. So the teacher said like 'OK, you're 5 people, who can answer my question?' And the other 3 said (privately) they didn't know what to say, since they didn't even look at that part of the project. I had, so I offered myself and improvised something, while browsing Wikipedia as quick as I could.\n\nOverall, I feel tired and a bit sad. I worked a lot, and today it was a complete disaster (other projects were much better and people answered perfectly). Have you ever been in a similar situation? What can I do next time I have to cope with this? Would appreciate any advice or tricks...\n\n(I don't want you to believe I'm the *i-know-everything* person, I like group projects and being able to work with others is such a basic skill, but it sometimes is a bit difficult...)",

For college purposes, I foudn out that you have to be assertive you must tell people what you need from them and make yourself available on what you are willing to do. You cannot leave it to somebody else, you must be on top of a group constantly, and don't become the person who does everything either that will not help you later in life.\n\nFor me, I do team contracts for group projects, and I send the team contract to all the members and the professor, and make my teams sign the contract so they all know what is expected from them and I spell out the consequences of not doing your part. \n\nI like group projects now because I am assertive, so my recommendation literally is to be assertive. Use tools at your disposal to make them do their part, and be unforgiving when they miss a due date otherwise you end up doing it all on your own and become bitter.",

      "text": "Sounds like your going about group projects all wrong. \n\nSo say you're given a group project and a group of 4 people. The total amount of work required will be about 4 times the work for one person. So yeah, you split the work. But you need a team leader, and everyone on the team should have some knowledge about what the other people are doing. And everyone needs to review everyone else's work and make suggestions, make sure all of the work is \"up to snuff\" and that the different parts will flow well together, whether it's a group paper or group presentation. \n\nAnd yeah, sometimes, everyone just wants to do \"their share\" or not even their share. And both of those cases suck. But yeah, a presentation/project that's compartmentalized to the point where everyone just does their part is likely worthy of a 'D'. If you want an 'A' project, you have to make sure everyone is completing everything properly, with good flow, and make sure that if someone drops out at the last second, their \"part\" will still be covered (that goes for being able to answer questions as well.) \n\nIt sucks that that's what you have to do to get a good grade on a project, cause I always end up doing WAY more than my share of the work, but I don't want the group project to hurt my grade, so that's what I gotta do.",

      "text": "Group work can suck but it does teach you how to CYA and cordinate a group which is a useful skill in the workplace. My advise is to #BeTheAssHole. Make a schedule come up suggest milestones, assign people slices of the project to do and make a record of that. Then follow up and try to hold them accountable. Set clear reasonable expectations (i.e. attend every group meeting or communicate confilts ahead of time, complete you work to the best of your ability or reach out to group members for help if you struggling). Don't be unreasonable or dictatoral but get people to commit to deadlines and document if they meet them or not . Get people to commit to meetings and document of they attened or not. Don't assume people keep up with their work unprompted, ask for updates at meetings.\n\nThen at the end it you project you have evidence if a group member didn't pull there weight or ghosted you,etc. \n\nAlso communicate with your prof early if you're have issues with a group member so it doesn't luck like your just throwing people under the bus at the end.\n\nTLDR take initiative and organize the group, don't be mean but bring the receipts.",

      "text": "First of all I want to say that it sucks that you have a bad group and I know how frustrating that can be. I currently study hospitality management and as you might guess almost all of our assignments are group project and reports. They are 10,000+ words long sometimes which makes them very difficult to do by yourself if you have a horrible group. However, I've got a few tips if you need to continue working with them or have bad groups in the future!\n\n1. Sign a contract with them that enables you to kick them out if they are not pulling their weight (this is a common practice in my uni). Sometimes threatening (especially with really lazy free riders)  group members with being kicked out motivates them.\n\n2. Meet together as a team before working on the assignment to discuss what each of you are aiming for (grade wise) and how you can adapt to each others aims, what your strengths and weaknesses are, ground rules and a schedule of deadlines that you all agree on(this is especially helpful for rigorous assignments)\n\n3. Try and sit down with them and discuss problems that you are seeing, please document meetings in some sort of way so you have evidence of what happened in case they are rude or uncooperative \n\n4. Talk to your professor in charge, the likelihood that they have encountered a group problem before is high and if not they may still be able to help you (maybe even assign you a new group)\n\n5. If all else fails you might have to do it by yourself/with the absence of one or more group members and sometimes you just need to do the work because it is your grade. (I know this sucks but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do)\n\n6. Remember it's okay to be frustrated and make sure to take care of yourself!",

      "text": "My grandson is now a junior in college, and until this semester group projects were always a problem for him.  That includes in high school.  He is a serious student, and often wound up doing the vast majority of work on group projects himself.  Of course, the group goof-offs received just as high a grade as he did.\n\nThis semester he had 4 group projects. He just took over as the unofficial leader of each group.  The results were surprising.  With my grandson gently prodding everyone and ensuring deadlines were met with time to spare, 2 of the 4 projects went very well.  That was despite normally unmotivated students as group members.  The 3rd group featured extreme goof-offs, who required my grandson to assume a management style closer to that of King Joffrey.   The final group had (thankfully) all good students who worked on time and efficiently.  \n\nThe bottom line is good students should adapt a management style for group projects.  Its good practice for a career, and it prevents the bad students from lowering the grades of serious students.",

Instead of working as a group, you've each just done independent work that's hurriedly frankensteined together at the end.\n\nSometimes, if the group is full of people who are interested and motivated to do the work then no one has to be \"bossy\" and you can all just work together, everyone putting in the effort, everyone giving feedback on all the other parts, everyone equally skilled at the subject.\n\nBut most of the time you're going to need a leader. Someone (or a couple of people) has to assign work, organise meetings, follow up on things, help the stragglers, and generally make sure you're going to hit your targets. And if you're the person with the highest standards then you are the one who has to be the manager and tutor. You can't expect the others to do A-level work all on their own if they're happy to take a D or C.\n\nYou have to work *with* people, not just adjacent to them. And that means being bossy sometimes, and *not* just \"if needed\". By the time you figure it's needed, it's going to be way too late to get everyone organised. It has to be sorted out on the very first meeting, which should be immediately after you form the group.",

Well, here\u2019s thing, if you are striving for a perfect GPA, you are going to have to take the lead and delegate the group work.

Some people are willing to do the bare minimum required for the degree and that is their choice. But if you are striving for a great GPA, in order for group work to not damage your grade, you have to tell the others what you expect them to do.

Even if you are working with your friends. \n\nTake into consideration their work ethic and whatever situations that are going on that may inhibit them to be able to do the A quality work you need them to for your grade and provide their assignments accordingly.

If they fail to respond or go back on what they said then you have a paper trail that you can present to the professor. A reasonable professor will hear you out. But not all professors are reasonable, so sometimes you're justified in being \"that guy\" in your group. It's the only way to save your grade sometimes.",

I know you don\u2019t want to be the person who dictates, but if you care about your grade at all you\u2019ll take the reigns. \n\nOn the next project, take the lead. Assign your group members their sections and follow up with them every other day to see where they are at, what issues they are facing, what their timelines are looking like. You can\u2019t expect to just evenly divide up work and not check in on people until the day it\u2019s due. You need to be the one holding people accountable, and if they aren\u2019t pulling their weight you need to correct them or report them.\n\nMy best advice to you would be to stop believing people are going to do the work of their own accord. You\u2019ll find in both your school projects and work projects in your future career that other people will almost always let you down in one way or another. It\u2019s up to you to demonstrate leadership ability and hold people accountable.\n\nGood luck!",

I tried to loop my professor in separately by email and fortunately now we are doing team member ratings. I hate involving authority because I would rather settle things myself, but sometimes you just have to to save your grade.

All this is to ensure it gets done on time and done well. \nI\u2019ve had multiple group projects and in two I\u2019ve had to go beyond privately messaging the student and looped the professor in on what\u2019s going on. Ultimately, in a group project the team is responsible for the final product, so that means someone else will have to pick up the slack. If they\u2019re not doing their part, let the professor know. Most of mine have had a peer review form to submit afterwards where you can grade everyone\u2019s effort and contribution. I have no qualms about throwing another student under the bus for lack of contribution.",
