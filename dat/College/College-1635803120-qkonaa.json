  "text": "Currently a senior standing in my first semester. Going to graduate in may of 2022 with a bachelors in social sciences. Looking forward to getting into some type of Human Resources or social working and quite frankly whatever job pays well.\n\nCreating this post simply to ask, \u201cis there anything I could be doing outside of school right now to make that next chapter of my life (post graduation) less stressful or easy?\u201d\n\nFinancials, planning, budgeting, searching, etc.\n\nJust looking for some pointers!\nThank you!",

      "text": "1. Start networking, adding alums on your linkedin working in the same field as you\n\n2. start looking at neighborhoods for whatever city you are looking at working in to find median rent prices so you can take that into account when negotiating your salary \n\n3. start looking at the amount of jobs listed for what you want in your area, my job only has postings when someone leaves as it\u2019s a high density field with little positions (also social sciences) so be sure to start checking things like this out sooner rather than later. \n\n4. expect little and be happy when you get more. A lot of people graduate and think it will be rainbows and butterflies but are hit with relocating for a job, being alone and having to \u201cfully\u201d be an adult. You are started a new chapter so be excited, bc it IS exciting but don\u2019t go into thinking now that you are done with school life will be perfect. This is just settling yourself up for failure.",
