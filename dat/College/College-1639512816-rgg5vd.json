  "text": "And doesn\u2019t know what to do. Her Professor commented on two of her\nanswers and said it was plagiarized straight from Wikipedia.\n\nShe told me she didn\u2019t plagiarize, and even showed me her notes she used for the exam from different websites, in her own words, and then told me she uses Wikipedia as her main source \u2014 the same source her Professor accused her of plagiarizing from. I put her answers through one of those plagiarism scanner\u2019s online, and found nothing that showed she plagiarized. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 and I really don\u2019t want to give wrong advice that could make things worse\u2026 any advice?",
