That means it's *loaded* with pesticides and you get a free trip to the hospital if you fall in. It used to be known as the Ganges because of how polluted it is, but they try not to call it that anymore. The craziest part is that there's a family of ducks that swim in there. I guess they've got some sort of resistance to pesticides and manure.",

I woul recommend if they have a great humanities/History department from what I hear. \n\n2. I'm STEM so it just rough and a POC in a PWI. It doesn't deter from the experience but I can confidently say they need a little more support for STEM majors rn. \n\n3. My overall concerns, mostly the mental health, it's hard to get a Counseling session because we don't have a lot. Some department need some professor and most professor don't have PhDs and just masters so they are the best at teaching, it's mainly stem. The last two semesters feel like we have been drowning in work. I mean an unnatural amount of work. I'm concerned that we aren't going to get breaks (we skipped spring break last semester and it was hell then this semester we had a fall break but I had a boat load of work to accomplish during it, then most student I talk to would love to have fall start early so we are back for finals because this week was hell week and I'm still sleep deprived.)this is off the top of my head but I usually have more concerns. Also as I said before only three options of food and you get a lot of on campus money to spend there but I'm allergic to one restaurant and subway, Starbuck, and our other coffee Place is  not enough for me to spend 400 dollars by the end of the semester.",

I find the academics really challenging and I feel like I have learned a lot. I really have enjoyed all of my classes and I feel like the professors genuinely care about the students. The food can be a hit or miss, but I personally am content with the Dining Hall food although some people dislike it. For me, I think the one negative thing about Berry is the dorm situation. Not terrible, but I feel like for the cost of Berry the freshman dorm community bathrooms could be kept a lot cleaner and it better shape. Overall, I\u2019ve enjoyed my first semester and I think Berry was the right school for me, but Berry is not perfect and other people do have different experiences.",

Lots of kids have said that they have seen the ghosts of nuns walking around. \n\nThey even brought in a paranormal group at one point for entertainment but the school shut off their mics when they started to read the building because they didn't want the freshman to be scared. \n\nBesides the nuns, it's a navigation nightmare thanks to the 1970s addition. It is shaped like a U but the flat side of the U is three inches lower than the rest, so the second floor on up is not all the same height. One side of the U is never-ending and only houses offices, boiler rooms, and pink tile bathrooms. The other is a death trap with only one stairwell out and classrooms. The basement has a gymnasium and a ramp that leads to leads literally to a set of stairs. It is also built on a hill which makes matters even worse. \n\n(Coming in a close second for navigation nightmare, are the two buildings that connect BUT not on every floor. If you go in the front door and want to get to the 5th floor, you have to go up the elevator to the fourth, run to the other side, and take the elevator in that building up the last flight. The 6th is all one floor again BUT a cubicle maze. there is a map. for cubicles. because it is so bad.)",

Theres cool stuff in the museum in general, but theres 2 little walk in displays that are an ode to PLASTIC\n\nIts basically 2 little walk in closets with stuff all over the walls and a plastic frame over it. Mentos container, CD, a windbreaker that is turquoise and fuscia. It has aged absolutely awfully, and you know that they know because the lights in these 2 rooms have been broken for at least 4 years now, but you could still walk in and look. The other room is a plastic shed display, plastic snowboard, plastic lawn equipment(90% plastic not 100% obviously) but everything in there is simultaneously museum level taken care of, in flawless condition, but still just TRASH. Theres also... nothing good in there. No, IV tubing, single use syringes, no polycarbonate glasses lenses or anything that IS actually a valid argument for plastic.\n\nOh I forgot, we also have a little butchershop in our ag building where you can get meat that was raised and slaughtered on campus, in one of the education buildings. And right next to it is a little breakfast burrito place that uses their bacon sausage and chorizo",

We take that day off of classes and have remembrance in an attempt to never let it happen again. Oh, also, we invented LCD screens or something we do good with clothing.\n\nThird: Drama school, we have a theatre in an old church. There was a basement graveyard and supposedly they removed all of the bodies but it's sketch and absolutely haunted.",

Students and clubs can sign up to paint it to advertise different events and stuff. The current design was done by the cheer team and says \"cheering you on for finals\" but it started raining right after they finished painting it so everyone is making jokes about how the rick looks like it's sobbing for us.\n\nAlso we have a small shrine to Martin Luther King Jr in our science center because this was the last place he spoke before he was assassinated.",

It is known to have been used  by soldiers and civilians to hide during the second world war when we were invaded by the japanese, although parts of the tunnel were built when we were still a colony of spain. I used to be a student of that said highschool and I visited the entrance a few times. Its been blocked by cement though since some students in the 90s used that tunnel to attempt sneak out of school lmao.",
