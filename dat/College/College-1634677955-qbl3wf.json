  "text": "I received a job offer from company A. \n\nCompany B was interviewing me for two different positions in different groups. \nI haven\u2019t heard back in some time but they\u2019re very slow on the next round of interviews and offers (usually go out Nov./Dec.) according to current employees who previously held the roles. Still it has been ten days in one case since I was told I will hopefully hear back in the next week and a month since my interview in the other case. \nShould I let them know I have an offer?",
