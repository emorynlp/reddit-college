  "title:": "Is it pointless to take a class that\u2019s not accepted as credit towards my degree?",
  "text": "I am an undergraduate student doing a BSc in math and was hoping to take an intro to statistics class at my university. I took a different class with the prof teaching the stats class and liked his way of teaching so I wanted to take another class of his.\n\nI was aware that this particular stat course is not intended for math majors, but I thought I could take it as an elective. When I contacted my academic advisor they told me that the intro to statistics course is not accepted as credit towards my BSc. \n\nHave you ever taken a course even though you didn\u2019t get credit for it towards your degree? I know I should switch into something that actually counts towards my degree but I\u2019d still like to take this class even if it\u2019s just for fun at this point. Please let me know if I would be shooting myself in the foot or if you\u2019ve done this and still got something out of a class (not taken for credit).",

      "text": "If you enjoy the class and get some knowledge out of and can afford it (or can afford taking on more loans), why not? Just keep in mind that if youre otherwise taking regular course loads this may extend your graduation by a semester. You can get around that by taking a summer class or taking a bigger courseload in another semestet, or you could accept taking that extra semester and space your hard classes out more",
