  "text": "I\u2019m currently planning on being a psych major and the beginning of the year(first year in) was confusing for me so I tried my best in finding classes that I thought would give me prerequisites for psychology. Now nearing the end of the semester, I\u2019ve realized ONE of my classes are not required at all and it points out more as an elective? I think? I was planning to graduate in 4 years but will this one mistake change that? I\u2019m really anxious about this because I wanted to be sure that I graduate on time for private reasons and I don\u2019t want to change that.\n\nEdit: yes I did come to realize that I had an assigned advisor but I didn\u2019t realize it would\u2019ve been helpful back then. I would email them but I want to hear from your experience if you\u2019ve faced something like this and to give advice. Thank you!",

      "text": "The way that it affects when you graduate will depend on how many classes you\u2019re required to take. Many colleges have this information available online, could you try looking for that? Searching \u201c[college] psychology major\u201d will probably bring it up. And don\u2019t forget about general graduation requirements that your college has for every student regardless of major. \n\nFor me, I found what I need to take for my major online and wrote it all down, including the prerequisites for each class. I also wrote down my school\u2019s general graduation requirements. Using this information, I mapped out a POTENTIAL 4-year plan for my classes, and then just started following the plan. Things have come up that have altered the plan, but each time that\u2019s happen, I\u2019ve just adjusted the plan. \n\nIf all the info you need is online, you won\u2019t even need to talk to an advisor (although it\u2019s probably a good idea).",

Thank you for that",

My college requires around 40 credits for psychology(partly the reason why I took it, little classes required XD) and it\u2019s 120? Or 124 to graduate. Thank you once again. Nerves have been calmed and will certainly talk to my advisor again just to be sure",
