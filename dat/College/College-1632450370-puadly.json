      "text": "It be like that sometimes because life itself can be very draining or overwhelming to a point we're you just need a break to collect yourself. Even though your having a burnout you should try to not let it affect your grades, physically, emotionally and mental health. What your feeling is normal. For example I play on a sport team for my college but kast semester I felt burnout but after taking some time away from it I was able to gain that motivation and love for the sport agian because I had to step away from it to figure out if I needed a break or if it was time for me to do something new. So my advice to you is don't stress yourself to much your burnout won't last forever so just take a small break from whatever is making you feel this way and figure out if you need to find something new or if you need a break from it. I hope everything works out for you!",
