  "text": "Hello, I finished my first quarter of college, and it was a rollercoaster!!! It was the longest 10 weeks ever. I have guaranteed As in all of my classes except for Chemistry (I am not sure about my grade yet). I just hope I did well (I most likely passed, but I hope I still have a B). I really enjoyed the class, but the final was challenging (other students said the same). I would just like some motivation and advice regarding grades in college. Thank you. This quarter has been so rocky for me (not just academic).",
