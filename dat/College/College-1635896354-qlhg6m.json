  "text": "I\u2019m a 20 year old barber college student 700+ hours into it and my parents have paid for every penny of it but being here in this environment legitimately makes me want to kill myself. \n\nI feel horrible saying this because I know that a lot of kids aren\u2019t as blessed as I am with my parents willing to pay for me to go to school. They\u2019re paying $8,000 and my grandparents bought me a $500 barber chair for an \u201cearly graduation gift\u201d but this is the last thing I wanna do with my life.\n\nEven if I wanted to be a barber, I\u2019m failing!!! I\u2019m failing it like I failed every grade in my life. I have depression and ADHD and I lived my whole life without being diagnosed with either until recently and medication doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t even know what I wanna do!!!! I never thought about it!!\n\nI feel like an awful person for this and all I think about now is ways to end it. Maybe my teacher will give my parents their money back i do that, you know? Not only that but I just feel like I messed up and I wanna just throw it all away and either start over or whatever the afterlife has to offer. \n\nWhat else can I do? I\u2019m seriously asking. What can I do instead of dying? I need a reason! I need a plan!",
