  "text": "Has anyone taken an accelerated version of Oral Communication for Gen Ed? The semester lasts for the entirety of the upcoming winter break (4-5 weeks) and I was considering taking it since it's online, and I can get it over with quickly. \n\nIn a regular semester, I would have to take it with other courses and since I get a lot of anxiety doing presentations and also spend a lot of time writing essays/speeches, I figured it would be better to take it when it wouldn't interfere with other courses.\n\nI was curious what other people's experiences were. Is it manageable, or do you have to devote huge amounts of time to it? What is the online version of the course like compared to on-ground?",
