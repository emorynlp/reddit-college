You need to have some to validate your argument or statement, but too much and you're filling up your paper with the work of others even if it is cited correctly. \n\nI worried about it too when I first started college, but a few years in and I had learned what was expected. Once your papers start hitting the 10 to 20 page count, you should know what you are doing, ie, proper citations (MLA, ALA), proper formats without looking up how to do it. There isn't time to be looking that shit up and worrying about plagiarism. It will become second nature.",

      "text": "As someone who used to help other students bugcheck programming assignments (I spent years programming in C/C++ before I went to school for it), it's blatantly obvious when someone copy-pasted code they found on the internet if you have a good handle on the language.  Formatting, variable naming conventions, how they convert between the chunks of code and other signs make any copied work stand out.  It's like looking at a lego house where random parts are all different colors.  If you reference code but then write the work yourself, any competent teacher will see the flow is all the same and not question it even if the plagiarism check flags it.  And that's an expected process anyway when you're learning CS, looking at code and understanding it enough to be able to write it yourself.  \n\n\nOne assignment stands out in my mind, where we were tasked with multithreading data processing.  It was a very straightforward assignment, where any good student would have done it with a fairly simple and direct process.  Five people in that class got flagged because we all had very similar solutions.  However, the signs of plagarism that usually come up were absent, and the teacher knew we were the students who worked through the problem till we found the ideal solution.  He had no issue with the similarities and we all aced it.  \n\n\nAlso, stupid little things that might get flagged (ex. Copying code to clear an input buffer)  teachers really don't care about.  They are concerned about whether you understand the material, vs just being able to complete the assignment using outside code.  Especially where some schools will even check against your own code, if little things like that get flagged the teacher won't care.  I was flagged several times for plagiarizing my own code because I reused stuff constantly, and it was never brought up.  Which is often good programming practice anyway- if you find an ideal process for a particular problem the best thing to do is reuse it rather than write it from scratch each time.  In the real world, employers care about you doing it right every time.  Not that you wrote it from scratch every time.\n\n\nEven so (because I too worried about it quite a bit,) as a precautionary measure I always wrote my code in steps, and once one part worked I'd start a new project to continue the work.  That way, I had a series of progressive steps to show how I ended up with the final solution.  If anyone ever questioned if the code was mine, they could look through the direct progression of how I came to the solution.  Over the entirety of my education I never needed to show it.",

Unless your college is more up to date than mine is, I can tell you right now that even if you copy/pasted most programs from somewhere (but wrote your own documentation), they\u2019re not going to catch it. My school used a plagiarism checker intended for English papers. You need a different checker for programming languages, but a lot of universities don\u2019t invest in one.\n\nI found this out when I started to TA. I tried to make sure my students didn\u2019t plagiarize code by using Google to look, but that\u2019s not a guarantee. I\u2019m sure some plagiarized, I just could never prove it (e.g. poor class performance and grades, except for work from home programs).\n\nBut I see it this way: if you plagiarize, you\u2019re just cheating yourself. What will you do at a job when you graduate? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, boss, I can\u2019t do the task you gave me because I cheated on that stuff in college.\u201d So I never got worked up about cheaters in school.
