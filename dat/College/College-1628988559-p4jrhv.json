  "text": "I'm in a computer class, and I've been getting the feeling my professor isn't actually looking at our work. The reason I feel this way is because I felt in the past I turned in work that didn't deserve a perfect score and I got a perfect score.\n\nSo I recently had an assignment with 25 different steps each step was worth 2 points for a max of 50 points. I intentionally skipped 5 steps to see if the professor would notice. Had the professor noticed my score should have been no more then 40/50. However the professor gave me 50/50.\n\nSo I'm torn\n\nDo I just shut up and take my perfect grade and have a nice boost to my GPA\n\nOr do I say something?\n\n**Edit**\n\nIts a very basic course I know the course material inside and out already, I'm not complaining I'll take my free A and keep it moving.",

      "text": "I would definitely be concerned about receiving a lacking education. Of course getting a perfect score is great and will help you, alas, if only it wasn't only about grades. The teacher is either lazy or just really overwork and who knows how well he's teaching you. You could say something to someone, who knows if the outcome will be so beneficial. If it's an option, think of finishing the degree somewhere else. Where I'm from, the education system is unfairly structured around grades, but we do have advanced methods and knowledgeable staff. For computer science some places develop custom tester programs to give an initial grade based on compilation time, runtime, outputs and other programmable stuff. In more advanced courses the professors do a manual check to grade for more advanced efficiency and proper code usage. Could be that this course is just introductory and the professor doesn't think it's too important but then why give passing grades to poor work. Not saying your work is poor, you seem like you know your stuff. But ask the classmates that turned in garbage work and see what they got, that could give you an idea.\n\nIf leaving is not an option, then just go with it and if the stuff interests you, keep learning on your own and discover new challenges. Experience is the greatest teacher.",

She made these half-assed tests and quizzes and told us NOT to cheat. However, the questions were ripped out of PowerPoint and the textbook, MISSING information that was supposed to carry from other questions. (Example: Question 1-B, which used data from Question 1-A). So, you had to cheat in order to pass. (Or you could have asked the teacher, but no one did that). Sometimes the pictures she would use to visualize the question already had the answers written on them. Obviously, you didn't need to have your mic or camera on. Just needed to be on the call.\n\nAgain, most of my professors did something like this. It was weird too because Physics 1 was the hardest class I have ever taken so far.
