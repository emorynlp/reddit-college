  "title:": "I need suggestions of subreddits for a paper",
  "text": "I was assigned to write a paper for a class regarding social groups in the digital world. I am a first-year bachelor's student so all of this is new to me. I am in the program Online Culture. It's a group paper and my teammates and I made a list of a few social groups. One of the social groups is Redditors but I am unsure of how to go about it. I feel like Reddit would be an interesting social group as some subreddits have developed their own culture but I don't know enough information on subreddits. I was thinking of taking the angle of 1 subreddit instead of the entirety of Reddit but I am having trouble finding a good subreddit. The subreddit has to behave as if it is a social group. Having rules for welcoming members, teaching discourse strategies, self-presenting, breaking social norms, etc. Additionally, having a few research papers about this topic would be helpful but I am unsure of how to find that. Any suggestions would be appreciated!",
