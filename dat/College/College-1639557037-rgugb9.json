      "text": "I took the Accuplacer for my college in order to skip college algebra entirely. It\u2019s very easy high school math that most could figure out. For example, you have a mixture of 220 apples and 400 oranges in one bag. How many apples would you have if there were 600 oranges? Believe me, I studied for it when I really didn\u2019t need to.",
