  "text": "Long post, and idk if anyone will even be able to help, but any advice is helpful!\n\nI am currently living at home with my parents, commuting about an hour each way via train to my university. My parents are divorced, and it makes it hard to really focus on my studies and hobbies due to the fact I will sometimes forget stuff, stuff can\u2019t be transported, or can\u2019t afford to have two of everything at each house. My ADHD makes it worse. And the idea of spreading my wings and moving out seems fun and exciting to me. I am also projected to finish college after my 11th semester (community college transfer issues) and I feel as tho they shouldn\u2019t have to support me through 5.5 years of college. We aren\u2019t exactly rich. My parents always tell me they are happy to keep me at home, but they are just being too good. I know they struggle with finances. I also DREAD the commute.\n\nSeems like the obvious choice is to move out, however like I said, we aren\u2019t that wealthy and I can\u2019t really afford to live there, I would most likely need some additional loans. I find it difficult enough to successfully study for Mech. engineering without a job at home, and I would NEED one to be able to live there. However I would save so much living at home. I also go to school in a not so nice part of North Philadelphia, and I hate the city, this was my last school on my list (again CC transfer issues). It is crazy expensive to live anywhere safe. I also don\u2019t have friends as I just transferred and I commute. Finding roommates has been hard. Any advice helps lol.",
