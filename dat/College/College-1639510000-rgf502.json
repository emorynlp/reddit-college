  "text": "I have taken quite a few tests via Examity, I do not normally have issues. Today the screen share wouldn't pop up, it kept telling my to refresh. I am in chrome, I have adblock (and all my 3rd party extensions) disabled, pop-ups allowed. I can't get through to customer service and my exam was supposed to start 30 minutes ago. Anything else I can do on my end?!",
