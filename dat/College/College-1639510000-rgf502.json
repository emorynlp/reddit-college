  "text": "I have taken quite a few tests via Examity, I do not normally have issues. Today the screen share wouldn't pop up, it kept telling my to refresh. I am in chrome, I have adblock (and all my 3rd party extensions) disabled, pop-ups allowed. I can't get through to customer service and my exam was supposed to start 30 minutes ago. Anything else I can do on my end?!",

      "text": "Update: It never got fixed but finally I got through and they set me up with a live proctor. It took about an hour for it all to work out, they kept saying \"a couple more minutes\", I just sat there, ate some snacks and reviewed my notes in the mean time. The proctor was weird he made me go through everything under my desk, like wires and my extra keyboard and stuff, but they had me take the test through a recorded video call and I got an A!\n\nAlso I have Windows 11 - that's the only real difference between my PC and my laptop, I wonder if that caused it all? I asked but they weren't sure.\n\nThe person in the chat never actually got back to me though lol.",
