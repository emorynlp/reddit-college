  "title:": "Professor meeting times conflict with my jobs, what should I do?",
  "text": "I work two jobs, one that is half-remote/half-on campus, and an internship that is a requirement for my degree and a practicum course I am currently enrolled in. The professor of the practicum course has been trying to schedule a meeting with me to talk about it, get feedback on how it's going, usual stuff. However, even after both sending her my internship and work schedule and reminding her of the exact times I am available, she keeps trying to schedule the meeting while I'm either at work or at the internship.\n\nIs this normal? She hasn't communicated with me much beyond asking my availability last month and sending a plain meeting invite email. I can't really take personal meetings at my internship, and I do too much while on the clock at my other job to have a meeting. The way my schedules work, M/W/Th I work 11 AM to 5 PM, Tuesday 10 AM to 5 PM, and Fridays 9 AM to 3 PM. I have offered to meet with her before 11 M/W/The, before 10 on Tuesdays. and before 9 on Fridays, as well as after 5 or 3 each day after work, but this latest meeting invite was at 11:30. Do I just try to have a secret meeting with her during work hours or keep trying to schedule the meeting when it works for me? She doesn't have listed office hours and only does Zoom meetings.",
