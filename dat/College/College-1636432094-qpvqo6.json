  "text": "Hi y'all. I was looking for others who have failed Cornerstone Experience, which is a college introductory course, but I didn't find any discussion online about what had happened, and frankly I'm too embarrassed to ask my student advisor what happens now.\n\nA month is left in the course and I'm currently sitting at 34% in the class (and passing all my other classes easily lol). All I will say is that I kinda just *forgot* about the class because I was taking it online rather than in person.\n\nHas anyone else managed to fail this class and what happens if you do?",
