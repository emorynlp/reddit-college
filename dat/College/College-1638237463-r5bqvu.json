  "text": "I\u2019m F23, about to turn 24, and I\u2019ve no idea what to major in. I want to go to college, I really do, but everyone keeps telling me their opinions on what would make a good career and what wouldn\u2019t. (I\u2019ve already gotten my associates, but it took me five years to finally decide on GS) I\u2019ve also heard the whole \u201cdo what you love and the money will follow\u201d types of comments. To be completely honest, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m interested in anymore. I just want to find my way and be able to support myself. Has anyone else had this trouble? And what did you do about it? I feel like I\u2019m trapped.",
