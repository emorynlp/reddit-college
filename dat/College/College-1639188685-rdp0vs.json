  "text": "I\u2019m going to a community college at the moment and i\u2019ll be getting my aa this summer. I\u2019m hoping to become a history or philosophy professor, and i am in love with university of chicago. i\u2019ve got a 4.0, i work in healthcare, i have an internship with my colleges newspaper-i hate that i feel like those are the only things going for me, but it feels like those are the things colleges look for and im flying blind here. neither of my parents went to college and i feel like such a failure for not getting into the same schools as my friends after high school. I went through a lot of personal issues in high school and I thought that by finishing strong and writing some good essays, maybe i could get colleges to look past my freshman sophomore gpa. They did not. I\u2019ll need a full ride, ive been pretty poor my whole life. can anybody tell me what my chances are and if i have one?",

      "text": "Community College transfers to universities of that caliber are really difficult, not to mention UChicago's infamous reputation as expensive. While you can certainly apply, I would recommend keeping your options open. If you are seriously interested in pursuing grad school, it will most likely be easier for you to get into UChicago for grad school than for undergrad transfer. Something I have realized, as a CC grad myself, is that if you can get into a decent state school for undergrad and prove yourself there, for grad school you suddenly have a decent chance at an Ivy+ school. Sadly, few such highly-ranked private universities accept many transfer students, and when they do they tend to come from other highly-ranked private universities like Ivy as well as Johns Hopkins, Stanford, etc.\n\nAlso, an internship at a college newspaper will look great on a transfer application, no matter where you apply. As history and philosophy (coincidentally my favorite fields! I'm trying to get into grad school to be a history professor this year actually!) both utilize a lot of writing, proving you can write and edit is a huge plus! Double that plus if you have any published articles, especially at least partially related to your interests. And if you like editing/writing, there are plenty of non-academic jobs as editors available. I interned with an academic journal my senior year and, after graduating, found a ton of jobs, content-editor, copy-editor, acquisitions-editor, even in large publishing houses. Editing apparently is quite an in-demand field.",
