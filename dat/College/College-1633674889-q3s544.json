  "text": "I just finished my second week and I\u2019m back to in-person lectures. I\u2019m struggling trying to fit all my work in, basically I have just enough time to complete my assignments. I haven\u2019t finished all the chapters or had a moment to really sit down and study. I feel like I haven\u2019t retained a thing. I am usually an A student and I\u2019ve never experienced this sort of struggle. I still have motivation and want to learn, but I just feel\u2026 slower? Any input on why I am experiencing this? Or advice ?\nEDIT: I\u2019m not in high school, I\u2019m just about to get by bachelors",

      "text": "Highschool wants everyone to pass reasonably well because it affects how much funding you get. No matter what high school you went to there was likely a lot of hand holding even if you didn't see it. Now the college doesn't need you to be successful to be paid. It is all on you. If you are feeling overwhelmed I would recommend reaching out to campus services (mental health, tutoring). Even if you were an A student and have never needed a tutor before, there is no shame in finding a tutor or study group so you can better understand. This is about your success. You are now responsible for your education and you will likely keep the same workload or get even more. It is important that you find a way to help yourself be successful.",
