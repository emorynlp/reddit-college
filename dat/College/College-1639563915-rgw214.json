  "title:": "Need help structuring my research paper",
  "text": "sooo I haven't written a proper research paper in a few months and it feels like I've forgotten everything???? \n\nI'm writing a paper for a literature course and considering the topic I'm doing, I need to give a bit of historical perspective, then situate the texts I'm using within that time. And I also need to fit in Laura mulvey's male gaze theory (and how it relates with my topic/thesis), and all this needs to go in the start of my paper. And I have no idea how to structure it\n\nShould it be:\n- historical perspective\n- situate the novels\n- my thesis\n- mulvey's male gaze theory\n\nOrr:\n- historical perspective\n- situate the novels\n- mulvey's male gaze theory\n- my thesis\n\nOr:\n- mulvey's male gaze theory\n- my thesis\n- historical perspective\n- situation the novels",

      "text": "Sounds like a book report, if you have a thesis like what you are describing. \nTypically my research reports are structured as the following:\n\nIntroduction-explanation/description of case study and relevance. (1-2 para.) \n\nTopic/problem - what the paper will be explain or analyze and why (1-2 paragraphs)\n\nBackground/History- 1-2 pages\n\nModern assessment/situations that support or oppose and why. (1-2 pages)\n\nInspiration/future/furthering the development of the research (2-3 paragraphs)\n\nConclusion- personal opinions/thoughts and results, maybe a breift summary ( 2-3 paragraphs) \n\nI am a STEM student.",
