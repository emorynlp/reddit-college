  "text": "Hello all! Typical mid college crisis here. I thought I could just get a pre med degree for the prestige and cause my parents always wanted me to cure cancer but I am a wuss and I don't see anything (like I can't see my future self doing this). I have been thinking that I should be in pre-med just to prove I can (which is dumb and kind of rude to the passionate ppl who love it). I have taken about two full semesters and I will probably have another 2 by this spring. I also entered college with credit hours from AP. How fucked am I in terms of money? Should I just drop out and get a job? (I also live with my parents so I just feel suffocated am I over reacting? Should I try to tough it out at this point? Am I just wasting everyone's time?)\n\nFun fact: I dislike classes gauged specifically for pre med (Calc for life science) because I feel like I am missing out on full calculus =<=)",

          "text": "Uh, I like art, writing, studying music theory, chemistry, reading/analyzing data, growing plants, and making/designing fantasy robots and monsters. I will probably change majors again (fml) and try some computer classes as well. Or specialize in fungi research maybe. \n\nNote that design, engineering, and computer science are a bit if a stretch from My current concentration and I would have to go straight into my core classes...which worries me a bit.\n\n\n\nBonus info on weaknesses if you need more info before you make a suggestion:\n[To add I suck at stuff that requires sustained attention and pressure (those complicated math problems that lead to an amalgamation of numbers, letters, radicals, etc. And it takes like 15-20 minutes to get to that point @_@) they aren't hard I just get tired)]",
