  "text": "Due to 5% not understanding the classes and 95% my own negligence and feeling lazy to do some individual studying, I now have to pass an Econometrics midterm tomorrow I absolutely am not prepared for. I\u2019ve been studying notes and it\u2019s just not sticking, save for a few bits here and there.\n\nI know for sure there\u2019s someone reading this that\u2019s been in a similar situation. Did you manage to ace the exam, and if so, how?",

Take the L my brother. Try to watch some yt videos take a break and study again.",

      "text": "It only happened for one test, but I was able to pass with an 83 because I did understand the material. It was just a lack of studying. \n\nHow much you know now is a big indication of whether you\u2019ll fail or not tomorrow. That\u2019s just reality. You most likely won\u2019t ace it. \n\nJust focus on at least trying to get the minimum passing grade. Learn from your mistakes and do better for the next take so this doesn\u2019t happen again.",

Often the process of determining what\u2019s important and then physically writing it down in a way that can be referenced easily will solidify the information in your head and will also give you something to review right before the test to refresh your memory.",
