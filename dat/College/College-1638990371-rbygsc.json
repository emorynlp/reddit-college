  "text": "i\u2019ve taken this class three times now. The first time I withdrew the second time I just got a D, this was during covid and a lot of mental health issues. Now i\u2019m taking it again and I\u2019ve been doing great, I have almost a B, but finals week really got to me and I started studying more for other classes. I only needed a 44 and I don\u2019t even know if i got that. I cannot fail again, I have a job offer. I don\u2019t even know what to say to her i\u2019m so embarrassed and there\u2019s no guarantee of a curve and I just feel helpless",
