  "text": "So recently I've noticed increasingly that classmates I have or people in various online communities have been ridiculing or mocking others and myself for having a major that isn't STEM, or a \"soft science\". \n\nI think it's frustrating and it's annoying when people think you'll be a failure or doomed to never find a job if you major in something that isn't biochem or computer science. \n\nI know it's my passion and the job outlook for my degree and some others is great, but explaining this is hard. \n\nHow do you discuss this with people?",

Tell them how you feel, and what they're doing to make you feel that way. Don't be rude about it, of course, but there's no point in trying to tiptoe around their feelings when you're the one that's upset. Then, once you've explained, end it there. Let it go, and move on from it. If you're happy and passionate about what you do, then stick to it. Don't let other's opinions discourage you from what you enjoy doing. Ultimately, it's your life.

      "text": "One thing I wish I was told when I was in high school is that unless you want to do something specific as a job, such as becoming a chemical engineer, it doesn\u2019t really matter what you major in as long as you get a degree. \n\nIf you want to work in a big firm you can do so if you get a sociology or gender studies or art history major. Employers don\u2019t usually care about that at all as long as you show experience on your resume and sell yourself well. There\u2019s tons and tons of people who got \u201cgood\u201d degrees like marketing or commerce that struggle to find a job after graduation because they didn\u2019t do anything during college except get the degree that made them look good to employers. \n\nThe reason people associate certain degrees with lack of job opportunities in my opinion is because if your only goal was to make a lot of money, something random like sociology or English probably didn\u2019t stick out to you when you declared a major. People who really want a good job over anything else are more likely to do commerce, marketing, math, Econ, etc. But by no means does that mean that you can\u2019t get the kind of jobs those people get with a different degree as long as you\u2019re able to stick out to an employer and show them why they should hire you. \n\nAlso if you get a PhD in any field I think that\u2019s an extremely cool degree. I\u2019ve always been envious of those working in research and getting to learn for a living. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s shortsighted when people automatically think soci majors are going to struggle, like what if they wanted to go into research? You can make decent money and earn a lot of prestige and respect in your field if you\u2019re good enough. \n\nThe people who point to certain majors and make fun of them for not being able to get jobs later are completely speaking out of their asses. They have no clue what they\u2019re talking about and assume a business degree means a big firm is going to hand them a 6 figure salary. Experience is everything, the degree is just a signal that you\u2019re smart enough to make it through years of stressful school, it doesn\u2019t matter what the major is. This is different if you want to do something very specialized, but that should be obvious. \n\nI know this because I went to an academic advisor saying that I was considering switching out of economics for psychology but was worried about job prospects if I did so. He told me what I wrote above. This advice was corroborated by another advisor, my councillor, and my dad, who works at a big firm. \n\nI would just ignore those people because they\u2019re a lot less smart and gifted than they think. \n\nTLDR: get a degree in whatever you want, get real-life job experience to show employers you\u2019re capable. The degree doesn\u2019t matter, it just matters that you have one. People who say the things that bother you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.",

Life sucked for awhile but man did I have a lot of fun.  Now I have kids and different fun, but damn, college, man.\n\nI think if I had to do it all over again I'd ignore STEM, go straight to a business major and stay for my MBA so that I could party and still get a 3.5.\n\nCollege was a fucking blast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWait, what was your question?",

Because the moment you feel the need to defend, explain, or justify, you're giving them authority that they don't have or deserve.\n\nThe reality is this. Capitalism has evolved to the point that knowledge production is increasingly constrained by practicality, utilitarianism, \"innovation\", and so on. Disciplines that result in aerospace manufacture or sophisticated machinery match this description. Sociology and anthropology do not. But they offer us other things. Today I taught a group of second years key critical sociological concepts by having them do an activity and then reflecting on them, and they said really smart things that made me proud that *I* was the one to got them to put those pieces together. They did all the work, I just guided them. And once they're done the course there are 60 people who can use that sociological vocabulary to help shape the world around them, re-shape connections, do important things, and so on. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, critical thinking about society and the structures that produce inequality is just as important as the machines that engineers and whoever else produce, because (and this is hard for people to believe), capitalism isn't always going to be around. This obsession we have with \"practical value\" will fade just like every other zeitgeist in human history. It's inevitable. And these are the facts that I relish when I see some STEM moron saying \"hurr durr do u want fries with that lol\"",

I have a degree in Mathematics and Statistics and I have friends that graduated with me who got the same degree (barely passing) and don't even use it. Degrees in and of themselves are a financial shit decision (even STEM degrees): it's up to you to make it worth it.\n\nIt's worth noting that if you fall into the category of not understanding the expected value of your degree, then people ridiculing it could be looking out for your best interest by at least urging you to become aware because the reality is this: \"do what you love\" is a bullshit concept. The stress of a poverty-level salary will far outweigh most people's \"love\" for something, and that doesn't even take into consideration the loss of interest in something once it becomes a profession.\n\nBut, as already stated, if you're fully aware of your degree's market value, keep doing what you love.",

      "text": " I'm an Applied Math major and Math majors get mocked all the time by engineering/computer science/physics/other STEM majors.  Why? Because people think Math majors have no  skills other than to do math problems.  I've been mocked in the sense that some people have said that my major is easy. Yet, majority, if not all, of the systems that govern society is based of math?  Computer science, engineering, physics, and all the other sciences is based off of math.  When you do a graduate degree in one of these areas, it becomes really abstract and more about the math.  \n\nAnyways, I'm interested in working as an Embedded Software engineer because that's where my passion is.  But, most employers don't favorable on my degree because they typical hire engineering/comp sci majors so I have a rough road ahead of me trying to land that job.  Went on certain subreddits asking for advice and were met with a few responses coming from miserable engineers that got angry that I'm trying to get into their field without their degree.  Several people have been very supported and said I should keep doing what I'm doing so that's what I'm doing.  \n\nOP, keep following your major since its your passion.  I am sick of this comparison bullshit that society imposes on everyone.  At your very core, you're a person with your own interests that make you happy.  Do what makes you happy.  \n\nAs far as discussing it with other people, it depends.  Are they just ignorant but also open-minded?  Then you can discuss with them that theres plenty of successful people with your major.  Are they depressed/unhappy people who decided to follow the money and are projecting their insecurities onto you?  Don't listen and don't waste your time discussing it with them.  I'm honestly jealous of people who have passions in areas that aren't STEM because theres so many career paths you can build.  In contrast, many STEM majors are so closed minded in the sense that people think you \"need\" X degree to have a career in Z (you really don't, experience > a stupid piece of paper).",

By all means it\u2019s your life but understand their are consequences both positive and negative to your choices made in life. I just don\u2019t like when people complain about having $100k student loan debt and chose a career they only pays $30-45k and don\u2019t save/budget accordingly. That\u2019s just not smart financially but if you are happy who cares! \n\nIs tuition stupid cost wise...absolutely but my degree after all is done will only have a loan of $8000 give or take.

I can maybe also teach classes on e.g. programming or stats or whatever, which should hopefully make me a decent prospective hire. \n\nYeah, networking hasn't ever been my strong suit -- I know *some* people at different institutions, but I'll also be pretty geographically limited as to where I can apply (i.e., to one city, wherever the residency match plops my partner), so there'll be a small pool of places I look at and that's that. Maybe something at the high school level could work, too, or freelance tutoring at all levels.\n\nIn this case I think I'd have an above-average amount of teaching experience exiting grad school (instructing 6 quarters, TAing another 6, and various workshops and such), so hopefully that should work in my favor. I've been told it's barely a consideration for many other of the sorts of positions I'm looking at, but if it counts for something in this career track that'd certainly be nice! \n\nI've considered interspersing more of the hands-on stuff into the lectures themselves, but in larger lecture halls it's tricky :[ esp. when they assign me to a room that's 15 minutes' walk from where the skeletal collections are kept, or enrollment is in the 50-100 range. Have you adapted any particular materials / activities you've found online that you can recommend, or has it been mostly inherited from your predecessors or invented whole cloth?\n\nIf it's not too private, would you mind sharing any details about your compensation package relative to the local CoL? I've heard lots of stories of e.g. adjuncts receiving pittance, and while I do quite enjoy teaching... money, healthcare, etc. are certainly nontrivial considerations.",

I didn't find myself especially employable after graduation, especially after realizing my primary desire for initially choosing those fields -- the opportunity to do lots of fieldwork -- was definitely not something I cared for.

I went to a liberal arts school so the mocking among peers wasn't bad, but there is a definitely a running joke/meme about unemployed philosophy majors. The thing is, philosophy is essentially just critical thinking, and it turns out critical thinking is a pretty great skill to have in the work place. I work in higher ed administration now, have a very solid salary with great benefits, I love my job, and I use my critical thinking skills every damn day. My boss comments that I think of things others don't, work through problems logically, and express myself clearly. I have these skills thanks to my philosophy and English majors. \n\nTL;DR: I'm very happy with the \"soft\" majors I chose!",

I can see based on your posting that you're (likely) a brand new grad student (chem phd at UMinn).  I don't know for certain how far along you are, but I imagine youre not quite to the point where you're frequently interacting with colleagues from other disciplines. Let me tell you that your general belief that your field is somehow \"harder\" than  other fields is not going to be well received --mostly because it reeks of the kind of self-satisfied smugness an undergrad relies on to impress idiots, but also because it makes very little sense in the context of academia. Allow me to explain.\n\nMastery of your field and chosen subfield(s) is a BASIC requirement of any graduate program (qualifying/comprehensive examinations), not some sort of special achievement.  If a grad student struggles with the material, if it is truly difficult for them at this phase, it is highly unlikely that any grad student so burdened  will successfully transition to phd candidacy. Attrition rates among grads is >50% for a reason, after all.   Now add to this the requirements of dissertation completion.  Now add to that requirements for hiring and then tenure -- in an environment in which only 25% of professor positions are now TT.   \n\nAnyone who makes it not only had to have easily mastered the material of their chosen subfield, but they had to go BEYOND IT -- to be innovative enough to publish.  The measure of their true ability is theirCV length, but even still... are they savvy enough to persist through an insanely competitive market AND political enough to win the respect of their colleagues?   Maybe back in the old days you could 'gut out' a TT track slot with good old fashioned elbow grease, but today, you've got to be innately talented in your field on top of working hard and, frankly, sort of fortunate to get some lucky bounces.  At this level, every field is equally difficult.  When you're fighting for limited slots,  it's not good enough to be just be good enough.  Every field requires elite skill sets along with frankly insane levels of work ethic to achieve the bare minimum, let alone achieve anything of note.   \n\nBut sure, grad student, I am very certain your field is the very hardest that exists. Good luck.",

The people who get into funded Ph.Ds in those programs have heaps of other experiences that DO speak for their skills. \n\nRegardless of that, I don\u2019t plan to stay in academia.

The humanities in particular have taken an immense pounding.  The requirements for one of their grad students to 'make it' is just inhuman, and just to get in (even to middling programs) is like, 1 out of 200 make it.   But as hard as it is, I think it's harder for STEM grads, but not because they have harder fields necessarily.  The dirty secret in academia is that STEM fields over-admit grad students because they need lab workers on the cheap. It's actually tougher to successfully make it through in STEM precisely because they let in relatively marginal performers.\n\nAll that to say, grad school is a different ball game entirely.  You need each other now more than ever, and focusing on who is \"smarter\" based on field really just misses the point (but it sounds like you get that).",

People say qualified coders are in demand, but that doesn't mean you are guaranteed a good job after you graduate. *Qualified* is the keyword a lot of people miss. Yes, demand is high, but it is only high for people that are really good at it.\n\nI've heard some struggles with bio-related majors but I am not sure how widespread it is.\n\nOverall IMO the issue is mostly with people that have no plan or clear path. I have seen people graduate with the oddest majors and get jobs in them, but only because they had a plan and knew what they needed to do to be really competitive. Realistically, most majors are completely fine *IF* you think it through and have reasonable goals. I try to avoid judging people based on a major but can get judgy if the person has no plan (regardless of their major, they need one).",

However, even if it did come from a place of concern, there are ways to have this conversation without immediately assuming that the person you're talking to hasn't done their due diligence and research and made a cost-benefit analysis. Phrasing is important. Don't jump to conclusions - what makes you think you know more about a field than someone who is actually majoring in it? It's probably better to ask people who probably know better than you and see if your impressions are right, rather than assume you're correct from the get-go.",

However, I think both of the things you mentioned fall into the better prospects of employment category. The first example you gave is literally just an example of a better prospect of employment, and the second is a pathway to a better prospect of employment. Why get a PhD if you're not going to employ yourself with it? To go 200k into debt and have no way to pay it off?",

The rest of society has a vested interest in improving the state of human knowledge because every now and then a new discovery can be profitable, so that's why they offer scholarships to promising students who want to become scientists and researchers. But it's rarely profitable for the ones doing the science. Their entire lives are dedicated to research while they get paid nickels and dimes, while the businesspeople make the big bucks. But they couldn't be happier because their entire purpose in life is to learn and to further knowledge. This is one of the major purposes of universities and colleges. Not just churning out degrees. That's just how universities stay afloat.\n\nDon't make the mistake of assuming that just because employment is your motivation, that it's the motivation of every student. And some people spend a lot of money simply for the growth they'll experience. After all, you can't take it with you, so why not spend it doing something you enjoy?",

Getting a scholarship to pay for the expense of having increased opportunity to do what you love is just another example of how the system works. Additionally, the vast majority of people don't get scholarships. I don't see how scholarships are even pertinent. Of course there are going to be people who love what they do who will get to do it for free because other people want to pay them to do what they're good at. It doesn't relate to most of us. \n\nI'm not saying it's the motivation of every student, clearly people here don't use college for making money. I've seen tons of people go into debt because they're too idealistic about what colleges are usually really about, which is making money off students. What I'm saying is that, for most, they wouldn't do it if there weren't a prospect of making money off of it.",

The social science/liberal arts majors tend to be very free-form, so you have two people majoring in the same thing who took entirely different routes. \n\nFor example, the physics major at my university only has 4 electives, because everything else is considered a core requirement. The history major has 14 electives and only 2 core intro classes. There's a lot more freedom to do an \"easier\" degree when you're able to choose whatever you want. The challenge of the degree is more up to the person than the major in liberal arts degrees.",

A lot of engineering/CS students don't have the interpersonal skills for management \n\n>Also, as an aside, there are thousands of engineers working at Google/Facebook/Other big tech corps making more than 99% of middle managers in this country.\n\nThat's comparing the best of the US engineers to all of middle management.

It's that the ladder is shorter for most students because STEM students are incredibly specalized in their careers. Most STEM students are not Mark Zuckerberg or Google engineers.

Some job growth in the motion picture and video industry is expected to stem from strong demand from the public for movies and television shows, as well as an increased demand from foreign audiences for U.S.-produced films.\n    \n    Producers and directors face intense competition for jobs because there are more people who want to work in this field than there are jobs available.

This lead to me landing my one internship in my junior year.\n\nI would say GPA isn\u2019t that important but definitely keep it above 3.0 at the very least as you may run into some companies that do check. I would say internships and projects are the most important things you should work for in college. \n\nThe internship will help you stand out against your peers as you\u2019d have actual industry experience and that gives you a leg up against those who do not. The projects help you learn new skills and also shows recruiters you\u2019re interested in your field and provides interviewers something to question you on. \nBetter to be questioned on something you\u2019ve built and understand than some arbitrary technical problem lol.\n\nYour priorities should go like this, Internships > Projects > Networking > GPA\n\nNow to give you perspective of what it\u2019s like job hunting after college and already been working in the field, because I didn\u2019t have this knowledge in college.\n\nYou won\u2019t actually have to search hard for a job, they\u2019ll actually come to you. I regularly have recruiters reach out to me on LinkedIn, which is how I came in contact with one of the Big N. I got an interview within a week, interviewed (felt like I bombed it), and then got an offer anyways. It\u2019s much easier to get a job once you\u2019re working and jumping jobs will typically be your best way to get higher pay faster. \n\nLet me know if you have more questions :)\n\nI don\u2019t mind answering questions as I didn\u2019t have anyone to get insight from when I was in college so I want to help as many as I can.",

I\u2019d also take all those stats with a grain of salt, it can be inaccurate and it does change frequently. Remember how being a lawyer used to be a coveted job? Look at it now, only growing 6 percent, the bubble busted. Growth also means more competition, if you\u2019re not good at what you do you\u2019re easily replaceable. If you\u2019re shy and awkward during your interview you\u2019ll be replaced by someone who can look their boss in the eye with confidence. I don\u2019t doubt that computer software developers are in need though. \n\nIf you want to go into a job field because it pays decent but you hate the work, it\u2019ll make you hate life. Remember, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time working, you need to make it something you enjoy. I\u2019m not saying every person in CS hates their job, but I doubt every one of them love it. Even people in my degree probably hate their job, but my parent hates his job and I don\u2019t want that to be me.",

I'd be more open to accepting college as a true establishment of learning rather than an industry made to churn out degrees that say you're good enough to work at x places if college weren't so expensive here.

Being involved and active in your interests makes you almost more employable than the almighty STEM degree. In my experience people with Biology or Chemistry degrees are just as unemployable as people with Sociology or Gender Studies degrees if they don\u2019t have a good resume. Employers want to see work experience and references; making connections through jobs, activities and clubs makes that easier. \n\nI would suggest going to career fairs and talking to the employers there. See what is out there and practice talking to recruiters. One complaint I hear from recruiters is that students at career fairs don\u2019t know how to talk to them and seem really uncomfortable and awkward; those who are comfortable talking about jobs and opportunities stand out, regardless of their major. \n\nIf you are a good student who connects with your teachers and forms relationships through clubs and organizations you will have tons of opportunities regardless of your major",

The recruiter asked her to join him for dinner with the other students he had talked to. They were all engineers. She said it was the most awkward and uncomfortable dinner she\u2019s ever had because the engineers could not socialize and had no idea how to have a conversation with this guy.

Although I found my lab through a third year psych class (the prof mentioned another faculty member was looking for a volunteer), I know people who cold email and it\u2019s totally fine.\nAlso, sometimes faculty will have a little \u201cGet Involved\u201d page on their specific lab website, and they\u2019ll either have an application or general information there. \n\nAlternatively, don\u2019t email asking to volunteer, read some of their research and ask if they would be willing to meet with you and discuss it with you. Unless they\u2019re crazy busy, most researchers are excited to tell you what they\u2019re doing and that way you\u2019ve started making a connection with them.",
