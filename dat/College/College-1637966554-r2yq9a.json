  "title:": "Is this inappropriate behavior for a professor and should I report him for this?",
  "text": "My professor has been really nice this semester and at first I thought he was just a very helpful person. I'm thinking now that maybe this isn't the case. \n\nI'm in his remote asynchronous class so we don't meet in person or have classtime. Recently, he told me that he would be on campus and wanted to meet up with me for a short time. I couldn't do that so he then said I should invite him to one of my performances on campus in the future (I'm a music major). That's a 3hr drive, and a very odd thing to go see your student for (he has no involvement in my performances and isn't even a music professor)... He also said to let him know if I pass by the area he lives in which is also very sus. \n\nAnother student also said he was very persistent in getting her phone number to communicate on Whatsapp and said he'd \"be available anytime, even at 3am\". She also noticed he grades the female students much more leniently than males in his class. He would make male students do their work over and over and she would do an entire assignment wrong and still get 100.\n\nI don't know what to do but I feel like something is wrong. Can/should I report him for this?",

You can look at your student handbook to see if anything he has said or written is against policy but it seems doubtful. \n\nOf course, grading students unfairly is definitely not in accordance with university policy \u2014 but I\u2019m not exactly sure how you prove that. Maybe gather women who can provide proof that the grades they have are higher than what they actually earned?",

I say do what makes YOU most comfortable and most safe, but imo it\u2019s not normal",
