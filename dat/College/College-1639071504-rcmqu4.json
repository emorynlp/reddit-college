  "text": "Hey! So I just finished my semester. I\u2019m so happy this semester really hit hard but now I get to enjoy some time for myself. I only have one final left in English literature next week but that\u2019s gonna be easy. I still have to go to end of semester party and my friend\u2019s one but after that I have literally nothing planned. I think I\u2019m just gonna sleep until on don\u2019t feel tired anymore. \n\nI wish good luck to all of you doing your finals rn and happy vacations for those who finished ! Merry Christmas in advance and congratulations!",
