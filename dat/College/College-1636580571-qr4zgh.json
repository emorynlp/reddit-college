The main difference to the US is that for the majority of courses the grade is determined 100% by one single exam that takes place some time after the semester ended. In my Uni for example I have 4-6 weeks to prepare for exams after the semester during winter and 8-12 weeks during summer. I think failing rates are much higher here aswell.\n\nThe physics exam I mentioned for example was for a year long course, physics 1 and 2 combined. So the grade for a two semester long  course was determined by a single 3 hour exam. That exam was quite heavily curved but still ended up having a failing grade as average as far as I can remember.",
