  "text": "Hello, I'm a sophomore (will be a junior by Fall 2022 semester) majoring in computer science. I took Programming I last semester and really enjoyed it; the feeling when your code actually runs is just \\*chefs kiss\\*. Now I'm in Programming II, which started out slow, but it's quickly proving to be a beast of its own. \n\nNow I understand that CS is not easy, and I didn't go into it believing it would be. But now I'm wondering: is this something I want to always be dealing with in the future? Sitting at a computer all day, struggling with this sort of thing? I'm not sure anymore. I keep comparing what I do now to my last (part-time) job; where I got to work with customers, operate heavy machinery (I drove a tractor lol), and bond with coworkers. I feel like I may be missing out on that if I pursue a CS-related career :(.\n\nBecause of this train of thought, I've been looking into health care careers. I used to be really interested in studying medicine, but the crippling debt from med school and amount of schooling put me off; now I'm looking into it all over again. I mean, I always wanted to have a job where it feels like I'm really making a difference and helping someone. Additionally, I could always program on the side. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Any jobs/majors come to mind when you read this? Any advice is appreciated.\n\ntldr// I'm a CS major that likes programming, but I'm not sure I want to sit at a computer all day in the future. I like the idea of helping people and not having every day be monotonous. Been looking into health care specifically. Thoughts?",
