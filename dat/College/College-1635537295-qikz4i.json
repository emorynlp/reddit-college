  "title:": "Questions about Computer science program accreditations",
  "text": "I am looking into the computer science program at Eastern Michigan University and also at Central Michigan University.\n\nCMU's program is ABET accredited, EMU's program is not, it is ISTE accredited. I tried researching the ABET accreditation and it looks like ABET may not be a must for a computer science degree, but I don't see anything regarding ISTE accreditation. Can anyone give me any feedback on what accreditations are important for computer science?",
