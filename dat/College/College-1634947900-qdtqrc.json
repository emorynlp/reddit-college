  "text": "So I wanted to know if Community college is more difficult than university. I see a lot of people in university that have a lot of time to do other things. With community college I feel like the people who go to it always seem to complain that they don\u2019t have time and they get loads of assignments. I have a friend who is in the same boat and is taking less credits than me but has no time for anything else but school. Even with gen ed I\u2019ve heard of this. Or is it just online cc? Thanks y\u2019all.",

      "text": "What u/No-Heart-5871 said is 100% true, so I want to second it. That being said, if we want to generalize, it's more likely CC is easier than university. This is because 1) CC's don't offer the more advanced, typically harder courses that universities offer, and 2) often CC students come from weaker academic backgrounds, which sometimes causes some professors to water down their classes so that more students can pass. That being said, there are aspects to CC that may make it harder for the typical student there than university is for the typical student at university. \n\n1) See above-- students often come in with weaker backgrounds, so they have to work harder to catch up\n\n2) CC students are more likely to have a job or have life obligations outside of school. This means less time for school or anything else\n\n3) Though the first two years are \"easier\" in an objective sense, they tend to seem harder because you're newer to the college student lifestyle, so you haven't figured out how to get things done efficiently yet\n\nIn the end, though, how hard school is depends *way* more on your major and your individual professors than any of that stuff I mentioned. What I'm mentioning are small nuances that affect general trends, but often won't play out for any given individual. \n\nChances are you just happen to have hard professors and/or a hard major and the people you talk to from university just happen to have easy professors and/or easy majors.",

      "text": "Prof here who has taught at both places. The classes are likely the same or slightly easier depending on the type of university you\u2019d compare it to. What can make a difference is that someone who went away to school and has funding or parents paying for it may not have anything else going on in their lives except school (yes, some work, but many students going away freshman year do not). \n\nCC students usually have a lot going on. They may be working one or more jobs, they may have obligations at home or even just many distractions at home, and then also still understandably want a social life (or time for tv/games). So, you may have more time eaten up by things that you aren\u2019t noticing, where someone who\u2019s entire life is dorm room + classes might have more free time. \n\nThe other thing I\u2019ve noticed is that CC students are more likely to overload their credit load (sometimes unreasonably so), since they are more focused on getting through faster. \n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t to say that some university students aren\u2019t out there busting their butts, but that I\u2019ve seen more freshman at universities take 12-15 credits, while I\u2019ve seen a lot of CC students too many classes (or taking accelerated half-semester online classes and not realize that\u2019s still going to feel like an 18-20 credit semester even if you\u2019re doing it as two 9 credit half-semesters).",

      "text": "At CC my physics and calc courses were harder than some of my junior level engineering courses. But beginning physics and calc generally are just harder. Compared to my peers though, I generally understand the physics and calc material better and learned more than they did, but that could also be down to universities holding those courses with open book tests through covid, while at CC, we were still required to take in person exams after that initial winter when everything shut down.\n\nOnline classes when taught poorly can be very draining.\n\nAny pre-covid online/asynch class at community college was 1000% easier than any of my gen eds I took at university. Most people who do poorly in those have trouble remembering to do the work.\n\nBut like other people here said, a lot of community college students have other things going on in their life that adds a layer of difficulty.They're parents. Older students who've been out of school for a while. People who really struggled through high school. People working full-time jobs.",
