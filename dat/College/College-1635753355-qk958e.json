  "text": "hi, im a nyc college undergraduate freshman as of fall 2021, will be a sophomore next year. i am currently under undecided but aim to pursue a computer science degree. i am not taking nor do i have any experience in computer science (currently taking core classes). in my first year, i only received financial aid from fafsa and tap and nothing else. i need more scholarships for my coming years. paying off tuition is hard and i cannot take on any loans. loans are not an option for me, so i have to pay when payments are due. what are some ways i can get money from scholarships? i recall applying to scholarships in my high school (when i was applying to colleges), but i did not receive any money. please help! i am very desperate as a full-time student. i need help from other college students (or graduates) who have any advice or have been in my situation.",
