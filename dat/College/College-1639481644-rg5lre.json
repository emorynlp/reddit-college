  "text": "I have an engineering final in 3.5 hours and I haven\u2019t been able to sleep at all because I\u2019m so anxious about it :(. I left some last minute studying for the morning so at this point with it being 5:30 am and my final beginning at 9 am I\u2019d likely only get about 1.5-2 hours of sleep. I\u2019m worried at this point that if I sleep I\u2019ll feel horrible when my alarm goes off. Do I get up and go to campus and study for the exam and then take a giant nap after the test?? My brain feels so fuzzy and I know I need sleep but I\u2019m worried such little sleep may just end up making me feel worse. Help!!!",
