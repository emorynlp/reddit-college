  "text": "Want to do engineering, Data Science, or applied mathematics but\nProblem is I was placed in a Math class (Intermediate Algebra) 2-3 levels under Calculus I (should\u2019ve been in College Algebra)\n\nMy first thought is bang out a CLEP course this winter break for college algebra, take a Pre-Calc course in the spring, spend time to prepare for Calculus in the summer, and than take it next year.\n\nPlease help. I love math and I\u2019d rather do that than anything else.",
