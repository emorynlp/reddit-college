  "title:": "can I still transfer to my preferred college if I failed five classes and retook them with better grades?",
  "text": "I'm kind of losing my mind here so please bare with me-\n\nI started my first semester with pretty good grades but slowly lost my motivation because of some environmental issues. \nI ended up having a very bad fall semester where I completely failed, recovered and failed 2 more classes in two separate semesters \nI managed to retake 2 of those classes and plan to take the other 3 next semester. \nthroughout that period I also managed to get my requirements for transfer pertaining to my major in order (1 science class, above 2.5 GPA, and not one but both Calc classes with passing grades)\n\nI still have 3 more classes to retake to fix those grades but I already feel like I ruined my chances with the fact that I failed them in the first place. would retaking them even do anything? one of those classes was even a requirement for my major and I know I retook it and got an A but the fact I failed it might look so bad for me anyway. do I still have a chance?\nplease help",
