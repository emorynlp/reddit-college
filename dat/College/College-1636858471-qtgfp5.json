  "text": "       My mother side of the family always fights and are all into drugs and alcohol. I\u2019m the weird one out because my mom hit hard with the academic value and \u2018not being like her in her youth\u2019. Her words. She\u2019s proud but is critical on me and my brother is drastically favored. I don\u2019t blame him though, we were compared a lot as kids at it\u2019s neither of our faults. Shes\n \n        My dads side of the family is crazy Catholics and never stop arguing over politics. My little sister is favored over my little brother and I but mostly my little brother. I stand up for him because my little sister is a bit of a witch. Tantrums, gets what she wants, dad yells at littler brother but not her, cdt\u2026 my dad gets my brother and I stuff for Christmas we haven\u2019t played with in years, clearly out of our age range. He gets me really girly stuff that my little sister likes. I don\u2019t care much for lots of gifts or even valuable gifts but I would like a dad that knew his own children.\n\nMom also is very emotional manipulative but my cat is with her so I can\u2019t cut contact with her.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not going home for college. I live 5 hours away. My sister moved into my old bedroom when she had her wedlock baby, and now she has some random guy over a lot that the kid calls dad. Hysterical. My little brother is fine though, I\u2019m just worried he\u2019ll be stuck in that house longer than need be. My entire family is extremely religious, catholic out the ass. So my existence as a whole goes against their religion because I\u2019m athiest for the most part and don\u2019t play into their catholic cult crap. It makes me sad seeing all my friends talk about being excited about going home and seeing friends and family, but I\u2019d rather be stuck in a desolate college town after everyone leaves than ever spend the night at my parents house again.",
