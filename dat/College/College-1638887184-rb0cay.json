  "text": "Today was my first final exam which was biology and I completely failed it. I'm doing all online, first during the pre check before the test my camera stopped working and I had to do a full restart of my computer, then my dog starts going haywire. I get into the test only to discover nothing on the study guide we were provided which I had studied for the last week and a half everyday was on the test. Needless to say I got a 44 and it doesn't feel good. I'm really trying to keep my GPA up so I can transfer schools and I'm worried this just put the nail in the coffin on my transferring next year",

      "text": "Never hesitate to reach out to your professor! The worst they will do is say no. I just reached out to professors for my next semester and asked what I can do to prepare for the class as I am also trying to transfer down the line. \n\nIs taking tests in a different environment an option in the future to ensure a more focused environment - school library, empty classroom on campus, secluded home office? \n\nSide note - teaching my dog a place command really helps when I need her to be calm and quiet for a length of time. She hangs out in her bed with a bone or sleeps. \n\nBest of luck with the test, hope it works out",

I emailed my professor to see what I can do. I really wanna transfer sooner rather than later as my current University doesn't offer the major I want to study",
