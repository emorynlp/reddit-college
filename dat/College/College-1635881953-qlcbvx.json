  "text": "I\u2019m stuck between deciding between an MBA, General Business (MSB), or Health Information Management (HMIM) ( which is only offered at a few schools). HMIM has  2 concentrations - health informatics and data analytics; and information management \n\nI\u2019m asking this because I\u2019m unsure of my career path. I originally wanted to go into medical sales, then eventually move into tech sales. Now I\u2019m thinking about supply chain management. I also am really interested in combining technology and medicine. \n\n\nSince all 3 of these combine business and can all apply to the medical and business world and all 3 of these are careers i wouldn\u2019t mind switching between if i wasn\u2019t happy in one field of work or got tired of it for awhile. But, grad school is really expensive and kinda finalizes your career choice. I\u2019m not sure if I can get into a great MBA school without having exceptional test scores so it would take a really long time to study for it. \n\nI would just hate to waste my time and money on a major that\u2019s useless in any other field which would be like a useless undergraduate degree except its a masters instead\n\nthanks for any advice.",
