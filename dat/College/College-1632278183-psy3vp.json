  "text": "Dear Reddit,\n\nIn about one year I will, hopefully, be in university. However, I don\u2019t really know what I want to do with my life. Actually, I don\u2019t want to do much with my life. I had a subject I wanted to study in mind (math) because I was decent at it and I could do well in it, but it doesn\u2019t excite me much. Rather, it doesn\u2019t give me much fulfillment. On top of that, I don\u2019t want to stay in my city or with my family. My parents were never physically abusive but I have never felt like a real person with them. Ideally I\u2019d want to be pretty far but I\u2019m more than fine with living some hours away from my current city.\n\nI do have some things that I\u2019d really like to spend my time now and in the future doing, writing and music. I\u2019m not really good at either but that\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t need to be talented. My point is, I don\u2019t know what to do about university and it\u2019s mostly about how to confront my parents. They have made it very clear that they want me to go to a local university but I don't want to do that of course. I\u2019ve thought that the worst they could do to me is not give me the information I need for financial aid which I couldn\u2019t go to any university without. I doubt it would come to that but if it really does, I\u2019m fine with not going to university or delaying it.\n\nI guess I just need advice, any thoughts people have on this. How should I go about confronting my parents? Any philosophical insights on how ideal education is the only value in a teenagers life? Any ideas on how I can survive on the off-chance I don\u2019t go to uni? I really just need life advice.",

      "text": "So basically you want to go to college but could also go without it, right? I\u2019d maybe suggest taking a gap year, getting a job, and using that time to maybe sort out goals, wants, priorities. Or you could jump into college and experiment. Go to classes and figure out what interests you and doesn\u2019t. Both choices are valid, it just depends on what you want, you can be successful either way. As for the local college part, I get that going out of the area is an adventure, but just be aware of costs. Out of state financial aid or financial aid in general isn\u2019t as great as it should be. Whatever you choose, good luck. I wish you the best, you\u2019ll be great whatever you decide on.",
