  "text": "Hello!\nI\u2019m currently a sophomore at a community college because of Covid I chose to stay home. But since I can\u2019t stay at community college forever it\u2019s time for me to go to a university. The one that I picked is 900 miles away (because it\u2019s through WUE so we can afford it). However I\u2019m nervous to leave my 12 year old dog. I have ASD and my dog is truthfully my best friend. I\u2019m worried about leaving only because of my dog. No I can\u2019t take her with me. But how do you cope with leaving pets behind? It\u2019s making me so nervous but I need to leave this town. I love my dog. If you have any tips please say some, thank you so much!",
