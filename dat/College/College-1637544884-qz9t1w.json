      "text": "Unless you plan to go to grad school, then you should be fine as long as you can stay above 3.0. If you have scholarships/financial aid, there may also be a GPA you have to maintain to keep those. But other than that, perfect grades aren't compulsory, and aren't worth it when it's at the expense of your health. \n\nI also go through what you're going through. Last semester, I worked myself to the bone to maintain not only A grades, but 100% in all of my classes despite an A being at 95%. It's stupid, because the only thing I get out of that is being able to say I had a perfect 100%, nothing else. Even if I dropped 5%, I would still get the same A grade on my transcript. It's nonsensical, but obsession with achieving perfection will do that to you. At the end of the day, as people say, C's get degrees. Don't wear yourself out, it's not worth it.",

For recent college graduates and those will little professional experience, this requirement has been in place at every employer I have worked for.\n\nLooking over their resume, it is obvious they struggled in many core courses related to their major as they requested P/F in those courses instead of the standard grading procedure. As a result, their resume was placed to the side and we moved on to the next candidate.\n\nGrades matter. You do not need perfect marks, but you are expected to do well. If you try to game the system as this person did, it will only hurt you. With that said, some employers have low standards and hire those who match their expectations. So you will likely find a job with any GPA, but it may not be the job you want.",

              "text": "From early 2020 through present day. The student's school allowed them to choose between their actual grade or P/F for each course, so the transcript looked something like ...\n\n* Math:   A\n* English:   A\n* History:   B+\n* Accounting:   P\n* Business:   P\n\nThis is just an example, of course. I am not sure how you would interpret those marks, but it certainly raised questions around what happened in those last two subjects. If this occurred only in one semester (e.g. Spring 2020), it very likely would have been overlooked. Unfortunately, the student chose to do the P/F option every semester and only for the courses related to their major.\n\nStick to one grading method. If you mix and match them like this, it causes people to make assumptions that may not be accurate. As u/PonchoHung mentioned, it is not worth the risk when there are other applicants whose background is much clearer to evaluate.",
