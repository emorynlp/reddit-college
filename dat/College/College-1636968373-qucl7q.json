  "title:": "Turned in an assignment a few minutes late due to a very stressful experience, should I try for partial credit?",
  "text": "There was this big assignment due at 11:59pm, but I ended up turning it in around at around 12:10 am\u2013I have never turned in a late assignment before and I do very well in the class, so this is unusual for me. Unfortunately, a minute late means you get an automatic 75 or lower on that assignment. This will likely destroy my grade from an A to a low B or high C. It is just that later that day I found out I have a jugular vein aneurysm that has not yet ruptured (obviously), and as an 18 year old naturally I started crying for the rest of the day and forgot about everything until it was too late. Do you think if I explained the circumstances, my professor might be lenient? Obviously this depends on the class, but I am a part of this huge lecture and don't know her personally so I am not sure if it is even worth it. A deadline is a deadline, I get that, but students are human too. I'd just hate to see all those hours I wasted studying for a good midterm grade go to waste because of one incident. I could provide proof of my diagnosis easily, but I also don't want to seem like I am just making excuses (because I am).",
