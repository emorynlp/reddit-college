The only thing I enjoy is my minor but at this point I can\u2019t change majors. College is hard and especially for us with learning disabilities going from Covid Online School and losing every studying habit I have and cheating on everything because no one cared to back in person and I don\u2019t know a single thing from my prerequisites. All I can say is you got this, use your resources and find help before you did a deeper hole. People want to help you just have to ask.\n\n\nI BELIEVE IN YOU!!",

      "text": "Well, from experience, I can tell you that college without ADHD literally feels the exact same. ADHD isn't the problem here, college is. I'm sure ADHD doesn't help but what you've said is the 100% normal college experience.\n\nCollege is new to you. It's not going to make sense yet. You're adjusting from High School and now you're in something completely new. It'll take time to get used to it. \n\nYour study habits probably need to change. Not getting things done on time is a surefire way to kill your GPA. Start making a calendar or something and move up all your due dates a few days so you can actually stay ahead.  Staying ahead will reduce overall stress too. It's crazy how much stress comes from those assignments nagging at you to get finished. \n\nTrust me, because I'm an internet stranger with unknown intent, that getting ahead and staying diligent improves the experience ten-fold. Mental health issues subside and academic drive becomes a little clearer.",

              "text": "Ha, it's not changing my quality of life and I've gotten used to it. \n\nNone of this is pointed at anybody, including you OP. Young adults in their early 20's don't generally like being told that their mental illness is the *result* of their behavior, not the *cause* of it. Stick around this forum to see all the victims of mental health blaming their depression and anxiety for their poor college performance. It doesn't seem like it's possible for anybody to accept the responsibility of their success. I've been seeing more and more, here and on campus, this idea of victimhood complex. I see signs on campus about a victim meet up and shit. It's crazy. We've gotten to a point that people who have depression are 'victims' of people who are saying that they are pussies for being depressed regardless if it's ever happened to them. \n\nReddit typically leans really far left anyways. It seems as though the leftist propaganda has gotten the best of young adults. It's almost as if people start making up the oppression they feel. Depression is the perfect example. I've never in my adult life, which is 32 whole years, heard anybody down talk depression or talk negatively about the subject. Now, I get it that I'm only one guy and others have different experiences. It's hard for me to fathom that there is this huge roaming group of assholes who point out that depression is for pussies. Yet, we still have that behavior like there is and if you pay attention enough (mainly on the internet) you'll find people referencing this all the time like it happens daily. \n\nThe irony of college being an open safe place for people is a scam. Most kids on college want to shut down any conservative motion altogether. They don't want freedom of speech, they want freedom of THEIR speech. It's good stuff. I don't think most young adults see how far left and how influential reddit can be on their real life outside of the internet.",
