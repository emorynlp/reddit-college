When you graduate you don't have to say the timeframe that you went to college either for your resume, just matters that you got the Bachelors.",

The important thing is to make use of networking opportunities, co-op programs, teaching or research assistantships during your degree. Your grades and degree completion time don\u2019t dominate your future. You should demonstrate personal development and improvement.",
