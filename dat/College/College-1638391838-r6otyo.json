  "title:": "Does retaking classes look bad on your transcript?",
  "text": "I'm supposed to be graduating this year but due to a lot of reasons I'm nearly 2 years behind in school. I've retake quite a few classes to fix my GPA. So far I've gotten my GPA from a 1.73 to a 3.51. I was looking at my unofficial transcript and noticed that all the classes I had retaken were there and I started panicking since I really want to transfer to a good university. I know it's too late to ask but does it look bad if you have repeated classes on your transcript? I also have 2 sub-1100 or 101 classes that I've taken and either withdrew from or failed. Would those show up on my transcript too? I know they're not calculated in my GPA but would they be a major factor in me not getting accepted to the schools I apply to?",
