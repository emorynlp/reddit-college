Most people in college already have their friend group so you have to really work hard to be part of it and so far I haven't really met anyone that I've considered \"worth\" the effort. There was this one dude who I had respect for since we are both studying robotics and I felt I could learn a lot from him. I lost all respect for him after he showed up to one of our robotics meetings and ate food the entire time and just told us what to do.",

It is definitely tough as I\u2019m more introverted and it takes a while for me to open up. What helped me is focusing on getting close to one person at a time. Then you can meet their friends or just take time getting to know them. A lot of my friends are ppl I sat next to in class and I just invite them to study in the library or get dinner. And eventually you will form a routine and naturally become friends!",

If you\u2019re putting yourself out there to meet people but not taking it any further, then you can\u2019t expect to turn circunstancial relationships into friendships.\n\nDo you get their number/instagram/snapchat? Do you hang out with them or make an effort to hangout with them outside of your usual meeting spot? Do y\u2019all actually get along well in person? Answer to all of these needs to be yes for it to be a problem that\u2019s outside of your control.\n\nIf you\u2019re in clubs, make a groupchat with the people you talk to in the club. Same concept with people you meet in class or in your dorms. As long as you get along well and y\u2019all enjoy each other\u2019s company, make sure you can communicate with them through your phone. Then, whenever you\u2019re doing something random like studying, going to the gym, grabbing lunch, seeing a movie\u2026 INVITE THEM. Invite everyone until a few people say yes. \n\nRepeat this process multiple times a week and then boom a friend group forma",

I still have friends I met my first day of freshmen year in college, All the way up to my last year and grad school. I was actually just the best man and a friends wedding who I met my junior year, and we are in our 30\u2019s now.\n\nThe key, is that making/staying friends takes effort. Sounds like you are putting yourself out there and meeting people, which is a great first step. The key to turning people from acquaintances to friends is follow-up. When you vibe with someone, get their number, invite them places, invite them to do things, keep inviting them, all the time. When they invite you, make a good effort to go. Eventually you both will decide if each other are worth the effort, if you both decide you are\u2026 congratz you made a friend. But remember, it still requires effort to keep that friend.",
