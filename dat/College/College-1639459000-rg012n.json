Most people in college already have their friend group so you have to really work hard to be part of it and so far I haven't really met anyone that I've considered \"worth\" the effort. There was this one dude who I had respect for since we are both studying robotics and I felt I could learn a lot from him. I lost all respect for him after he showed up to one of our robotics meetings and ate food the entire time and just told us what to do.",

It is definitely tough as I\u2019m more introverted and it takes a while for me to open up. What helped me is focusing on getting close to one person at a time. Then you can meet their friends or just take time getting to know them. A lot of my friends are ppl I sat next to in class and I just invite them to study in the library or get dinner. And eventually you will form a routine and naturally become friends!",

If you\u2019re putting yourself out there to meet people but not taking it any further, then you can\u2019t expect to turn circunstancial relationships into friendships.\n\nDo you get their number/instagram/snapchat? Do you hang out with them or make an effort to hangout with them outside of your usual meeting spot? Do y\u2019all actually get along well in person? Answer to all of these needs to be yes for it to be a problem that\u2019s outside of your control.\n\nIf you\u2019re in clubs, make a groupchat with the people you talk to in the club. Same concept with people you meet in class or in your dorms. As long as you get along well and y\u2019all enjoy each other\u2019s company, make sure you can communicate with them through your phone. Then, whenever you\u2019re doing something random like studying, going to the gym, grabbing lunch, seeing a movie\u2026 INVITE THEM. Invite everyone until a few people say yes. \n\nRepeat this process multiple times a week and then boom a friend group forma",

I was actually just the best man and a friends wedding who I met my junior year, and we are in our 30\u2019s now.\n\nThe key, is that making/staying friends takes effort. Sounds like you are putting yourself out there and meeting people, which is a great first step. The key to turning people from acquaintances to friends is follow-up. When you vibe with someone, get their number, invite them places, invite them to do things, keep inviting them, all the time. When they invite you, make a good effort to go. Eventually you both will decide if each other are worth the effort, if you both decide you are\u2026 congratz you made a friend. But remember, it still requires effort to keep that friend.",

I teach a first year seminar and always have my students read this article and we discuss/\n\n[Advice From a Formerly Lonely College Student](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/well/family/advice-from-a-formerly-lonely-college-student.amp.html?referringSource=articleShare)\n\nShe made a video about having trouble making friends in college that accidentally went viral! She then circled back and gave advice and perspective about her experience. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy, but it will happen.  The most important advice I can offer is that you aren\u2019t alone, EVERYBODY struggles with this to some extent. Especially in the first semester, people are just starting to figure out who they are outside of high school, outside of their hometowns, outside of their families.  Some are trying to replicate their high school friend groups.  And to some extent they are feeling lonely, because social media isn\u2019t real life. \n\nI give my students 4 challenges throughout the semester and they all have been grateful for them forcing them out of their comfort zone. \nThe challenges are \n1. talk to a professor, \n2. go to a campus event, \n3. talk to a classmate, and \n4. try a new study strategy. \n\nThe point of all of these things is to bury the inner anxiety, fear of rejection, fear of the unknown, and just jump in, with the convenient excuse that their professor made them do it.\n\nLast note, give yourself a little grace. Your class went from largely online high school to largely in person college. The normally abrupt and rocky transition was amplified 10 fold by this.  You will find your people. Everybody does. And it might be how you least expect it!",
