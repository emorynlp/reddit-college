      "text": "I\u2019ve had tinnitus for about 4 years now. At first it was incredibly hard to pay attention because all i could really hear is the ringing. This is probably terrible advice, but what helps me concentrate is by listening to music with headphones not earbuds. I try not to have it too loud. Making sure you\u2019re not further damaging your hearing if that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the tinnitus is the best. Being somewhere louder helps me as well. Having a fan on in the background in my room helps concentration for me personally too.",

      "text": "Not a college student \u2014 I\u2019m also a high school senior with tinnitus (I developed it around 1 year ago) and I was super worried about how I\u2019d get through the rest of high school or even college with this but you actually get used to it after a while believe it or not. When it first started, the first few weeks were hella rough not gonna lie but eventually, your brain habituates and the sound stops bothering you. Trust me on that and don\u2019t stress. Just go on with your day as usual and make sure to wear hearing protection in loud places from now on (you don\u2019t want that sound getting any louder). Also, you should check out r/tinnitus for more info but also beware of the posts since some of the people in that sub r newbies who haven\u2019t gotten used to the sound so they\u2019re spewing lots of sad/discouraging messages. \n\nFor studying, put some white noise or lofi music in the background. I\u2019ve reached the point where I no longer need background noise but when you\u2019re first starting out this could help.",
