  "text": "not to be dramatic, but this year college is feeling more overwhelming than last year. my course load last year was more, but having classes scattered across campus, having hour long breaks in-between, interacting with so many new faces every day is totally overwhelming to me since my first year in college (last year) was totally virtual. how are y'all feeling about this? and how long does it take to get used to it?",

There's no good reason for classes to be done in person unless it's something you need to be there for like using needles, most trade work, etc. But for lectures that students just listen to, it is a huge waste of resources to have them in person. In an age where so many people are concerned with the climate you'd think we'd want to reduce the number of people commuting. Sorry for my rant, I don't really have advice for you. I hope it gets easier. Maybe you could slip the suggestion to the right people that they should consider embracing a hybrid learning model.",

And as a TA helping with some online labs and some in person labs, I prefer in-person from that perspective too. I definitely missed in-person classes. I feel much more connected with everything and everyone. \n\nI definitely understand why some people might prefer online classes, but I don't think it's fair at all to call in-person classes a waste of resources or to say there's no good reason for them, even if you're just listening.",
