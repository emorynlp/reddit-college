In my experience, they\u2019re very inaccurate. \n\nThey\u2019re just estimates of what your parents would be able to pay according to their income and assets. But they don\u2019t take into account that fact parents will already have a fixed amount they are willing to contribute. Or that most won't provide any money towards college at all.",

      "text": "EFC is pretty much just what FAFSA says is leftover after they decide how much Grant money you deserve. It honestly feels pretty arbitrary. \nMy husband and I made together about 40K (not sure what that was after taxes) together in 2020, also the year we got married. We're both student this 2021-22 school year and fafsa gave me (part time) $350/semester and him (full time) $0. That left our EFC at 22k/year for EACH of us. We are our family. Tell me how that makes sense. We make less than fafsa thinks we should he able to contribute. \nIt's stupid.",
