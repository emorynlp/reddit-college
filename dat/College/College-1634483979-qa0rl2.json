  "text": "Background - I'm a science major, currently in my first year. I'm also a music producer side by side though, I produce for record companies and for radios. Hence, my time's mostly spent on studying or producing music. In this case, I hardly have any time for college clubs. Are clubs important in this case?",

      "text": "Clubs aren't an important part of your resume, if that's what you're asking. Prospective employers care more about your relevant skills and work experience than whether you were a member of student organizations/ clubs. Your music production work might be something interesting about you that comes up in an interview, but I wouldn't make your music production skills or experience a big part of your resume if you are applying for unrelated jobs.",
