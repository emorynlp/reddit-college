  "title:": "My Roommate Keeps bringing over a guy and it\u2019s too much now..",
  "text": "Okay so to basically sum up how this started, the first time she brought him over was apparently to do some kind of interview thing for one of her classes and she had asked me to leave, but it was more along the lines of \u201cyeah, you\u2019re going to have to get out soon\u201d. I didn\u2019t care at first since I was going out to eat with some kids on my floor in my dorm, but when I got back to the room at 2am he was still there..asleep on her bed. \n\nI didn\u2019t exactly shrug it off and expressed my concerns hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to have another situation like that...until the next day when she brings him over again while I\u2019m trying to help a friend with some chemistry work and guess what, he slept over again. This is two times she\u2019s brought him over without letting me know and with no time to prepare I couldn\u2019t find the right time to go shower or get changed. I told her once again if she could let me know when she is bringing people over. She said ok.\n\nTonight though.. I walk in and see him shirtless getting a massage from one of her friends while they talk about having a threesome but she said she wouldn\u2019t because she\u2019s una loyal relationship. I was hoping they would leave after watching the movie so I could finish my work but..they\u2019re sleeping over and this is now the 3rd time in a row that she has let this happen without telling me ahead of time that she was having people over, sleeping over at that. And now there is a shirtless guy that I\u2019m not exactly comfortable with because I don\u2019t know him in our shared room and another girl in the room as well. I\u2019m fed up with it and I don\u2019t know where to go from here. \n\ntl;dr: Roommate brings random guy over 3rd time in a row without telling me in advance. He always ends up sleeping over.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for giving me some advice on to what I should do. I\u2019ll start talking to her about it.",

Immediately tell the RA right now; either by texting or banging on her door. I had the same issues with my previous roommates; except she was bringing different boys on different nights and bringing drugs/alcohol into the room AND smoking in the room. I had spoken to her several times, but she didn\u2019t listen so I immediately involved my RA and the housing manager. It resulted in her leaving voluntarily because I kept arguing with her. Tell the RA. Don\u2019t put up with any \u201clet\u2019s talk this out with our feelings\u201d bullshit. Fuck that. Have it in writing that she keeps violating your space and wishes, and if she keeps it up just go straight to the Dean of the School and the Housing manager. Don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s escalating anything; it\u2019s not. You have as much right to privacy and comfortable living as she does. Otherwise, two can play that game. How about you bring over friends to sleep over? Have them sleep over on the floors and next to her bed. Get them half-naked. Do this for a week straight. But first and foremost talk to the RA IMMEDIATELY AND MAKE SURE SHE/HE DOES THEIR JOBS BECAUSE MINES SURE AS HELL DIDN\u2019T.",

The RA should be able to help out any of their residents with any concerns that arise especially those to roommate problems.\n\nYou may also need to talk to higher authority if your RA also just shrugs it off, but I only suggest that as a last resort. It sucks that you are currently in this situation, but at least you want to do something about it and that\u2019s a good start. I wish you the best of luck cause you got this!",
