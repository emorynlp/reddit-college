If I want to go JUST for the trade of being an Electrician will I only be taking one credit? Or will I be taking the whole college-class-extravaganza? Or do I choose closer to the school year?",

      "text": "If it's like the CC I went to for trades years ago, you choose whether you want a certificate or associate degree in the subject. Associate degree isn't worth much in the trade world so stick to the certificate. The certificate program will have you take multiple credits but all related to your trade. You'll probably take about a year of classes give or take. The associate program will have you take gen eds in addition to those trade classes.",
