  "text": "I get homework assignments for my physics and multivariable calculus classes weekly and I can hardly get the answers on my own. For nearly every assignment since the beginning of the semester, I find myself going to office hours and/or asking for help from my classmates. Whenever I can do something on my own, everyone else I know spends less time than me doing it. I do semi-decently on the midterms, but I feel like I otherwise can't do anything on my own in the classes. I take notes but I hardly get a chance to study the content of the class because I'm busy trying to figure out the homework otherwise. Is there anything that I could do to change this.",
