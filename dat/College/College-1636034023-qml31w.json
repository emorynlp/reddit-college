  "text": "I plan of going to grad school but idk if i can now. Grad schools seem to what research experience and proof you \"got involved\". Im only a freshman rn but im really antisocial and talking to people I dont know nearly brings me to tears sometimes so stepping onside of what is required and being forced to make connections myself to find research work is so scary to me. Im not in any clubs and keep to myself as well so idk how ill ever be able to join some with personality i have. I prefer keeping to myself and joining a club is not appealing to me. I just want to get college over with and get good enough grades to pass. Isnt this what college is about anyways?",

Making connections is *essential* in grad school. You'll have to present at conferences, mingle with other academics, work in a lab, do extensive research with others. You will have to work on the elements of your personality that are holding you back. you can talk to a therapist; that might help. These things can be overcome. You can do it.",

      "text": "You remind me of myself when I was a freshmen. I was (still am) very introverted and socially anxious, but experiences outside of going to class are crucial. There are thousands and thousands of students who graduate every year with excellent GPAs. Getting good grades is not enough to distinguish yourself. You can\u2019t let your antisocialness be the reason you don\u2019t go to grad school. That would be a ridiculous reason especially because you can do it! My third year of college I joined a research lab and was scared to death because I\u2019d be working with professors and other students. Long story short, it was not nearly as bad as I imagined. It\u2019s like starting a new job; it\u2019s scary but not for very long and you also have no choice but to do it. I honestly never joined any clubs and just participated in research, tutoring, and volunteering. It just matters that you are doing things outside of class (that hopefully are relevant to your study) and research is one of the best ways to get involved because it shows what you can contribute. You can do other things in addition to research: internships, volunteering opportunities, maybe you can start your own club, maybe you tutor students, maybe you do a thesis project your senior year, etc. There are endless opportunities outside of clubs, but yes, this is all essential. Your grad school dreams are not doomed. You have just encountered one challenge that you are completely capable of overcoming.",
