You can take various classes to see what you are interested in and if you end up deciding that you want to go to a 4 year university, then you can earn an associates, saving money and time because you now know what you want to major in. Or, you might chose to go to trade school, in which case, you would be glad that you didn\u2019t toil away at a 4 year university only to realize that it wasn\u2019t for you.",

              "text": "I\u2019d advise against business as a whole (while there are some gems in the business-realm, it\u2019s riddled with a multitude of underpaying jobs, and the market is over saturated), particularly business marketing or general business, as they are the most popular degree and also have high unemployment rates. The job fields that typically open up to them don\u2019t typically require a bachelors degree and equate to lower salary overall. Business is an easy degree that doesn\u2019t require much studying or dedication, and the students on average spend less time studying, writing, or reading. This is further backed up when business majors score the lowest of all majors on the GMAT exam for MBA programs. \nIf you want a well paying job, your best shot is taking up a STEM degree field (according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, 23 out of 25 of the best paying degrees are in STEM fields). The only two that aren\u2019t are business economics and economics. If you\u2019re dead set on a business degree, accounting and economics are the top 2 I\u2019d go for. It\u2019s math intensive but it will payout in the long run when you\u2019re employed and making more than the average generic business degree holder. All cases considered, if you don\u2019t know what you want to do, do not rush into a public university. The community college route can be hit or miss, as I know plenty of people who did not have a good experience with it, but who are pleased having gone through it with all the money they saved. It\u2019s a good intermediate phase to attempt to figure out what you\u2019d like to do before committing to a school that\u2019s more expensive and brings more debt.",

                          "text": "Funny, my first FT job was as a junior systems analyst. Good plan but shoot higher. 5 years is too long to get into consulting. Do research on what they are hiring for, get certified, work on a few side projects building stuff, post to LinkedIn, update LinkedIn and resume, go for FT consulting jobs straight out of college. \n\nI'm very involved with the tech org of my alma mater and there was a few years around 2017\\~ where Power BI was so hot, I told students \"Get this cert, build two dashboards, post to your LinkedIn and I will get you a job.\" Only a few people took me up on it.\n\nThere's always a need for good entry/junior level data analysts. If what you are looking for is interesting work and great career opportunities, definitely start building your analytics skills and brand. Even 2-4 weeks worth of solid study for each of SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel (just cause so many teams are entrenched and there's a lack of competent Excel power users also) will make you extremely marketable. Since you are in your first few years at college you have plenty of time. If software engineering is more your thing over analytics, that's a great career path too. I went with analytics and have had a great career so far ($61k > $240k annual comp in 4 years), but if I could redo I might go into SWE instead.\n\nA few consulting companies off the top of my head that I know hire college students for tech/analytics roles: Pariveda, West Monroe, Avanade, Capgemini, Sogeti, Accenture (might be hard if you don't go to a target school), Slalom. There's a ton of them out there to be honest, and if you can only get a job at a small and not well known or well regarded body shop (lower tier consulting work), that's fine too. Get a year under your belt while continuing to develop your skills and you can jump to a better company. I've exited to a tech company, but what I love most about tech consulting is that technical skills will carry you really hard even if your interpersonal skills are not the best.",

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all, because a degree allows you to have opportunities that you may not previously have had, even if they are not 100% related to your degree. So knowing you want a degree because you want certain kinds of opportunities (rather than just a highly specific career path) is just as important too. I\u2019d suggest looking into jobs that require a degree versus ones that don\u2019t (rather than a very specific type of degree), to help you evaluate whether college is the direction you want to go.",

These are useful skills in multiple jobs and in life in general.\n\nPeople seem a bit negative about college education, it seems.

Then I got bored (I have ADHD), and now I\u2019m a full time bartender. The hours are long and some days really suck (like really suck), but I\u2019m making *a lot* more than I ever thought I could and *love* my job. Like, love it. I have no plans of leaving hospitality now and am working on supervisor training. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, you don\u2019t need to have a degree to be happy or even make a lot. Sure, bartending can be ball-busting. But dammit I\u2019m making more than most of the people my age (lower earner than my friends but they\u2019re the exception not the standard), but I actually enjoy going to work. Do what makes you happy basically",

Try something in the middle that you like to learn about or are good at, most degrees are in the good middle ground and you qualify for any area that just need a degree + the degree you got. Good middle ground degrees should also be flexible so look into things like English with a lot of soft skills but obviously look into your skills, English was just an example but good choice if you are into it!",
