  "text": "I am twenty years old. I'm desperate to get out there and do something with myself. And It's always been a dream to study in japan. . . however, I have no money. (Though I recently found out that all expenses such as plane ticket, transportation, room and board, rent, tuition, etc is taken care of by FAFSA.) - and I have mental disabilities such as obsessive compulsive disorder and ADHD and I am having a hard time getting together a simplified checklist for dummies on where to start to get my passport (and its cost) - how to exactly get my student visa (researched many times but answers are somewhat unclear and I am afraid of doing it wrong. I don't know if you apply for the university FIRST and THEN apply for the visa, or. . .)\n\nI am just afraid of messing up. The university I am desperate to attend is Sophia University of Japan. It is perfect to me and I really want to go. I just want someone who's transferred to Japan from america to help me go through the steps.\n\nOr if you attend this specific university it would be the biggest help.",

      "text": "As someone else mentioned, travel expenses will not be covered by FAFSA. If you're still up for the journey, start by obtaining a passport then proceed to look into the expenses it will cost you to begin your academic life over there and start saving.\n\nRemember that studying abroad is an amazing experience but it comes with a lot of financial costs. How long do you plan on studying there? You will need to find a way to financially support yourself too which will likely require at least some level of Japanese language (which could be an amazing gateway to learning an amazing language). Do you plan on staying in Japan afterwards or coming back to the states?",
