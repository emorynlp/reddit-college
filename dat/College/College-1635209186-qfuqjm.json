  "text": "Sorry if this is a dumb question or anything but I don't want to make any assumptions.\n\nI'm part of my schools dual enrollment program and I'm currently taking ASL 1 and the course only lasts for a single semester. Would me taking ASL 2 count as another \"year\" of this class like it does in high school language classes, or would I need to take the classes until ASL 4 for it to count? Thank you for any help in advance!",

          "text": "I'm confused on whether a college semester is equal to a high school year, because in college you take \\[course name\\] 1 for a single semester and next semester you take \\[course name\\] 2. Does that mean they're equivalent to a \"year\" of taking that class- or do 2 semesters equal a year?\n\nSorry if it didn't make sense what I was trying to ask in my post, this is all really confusing to me lol",
