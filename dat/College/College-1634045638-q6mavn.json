  "text": "Long story short I have a decent GPA.  When covid hit, coupled with my anxiety and depression I had to withdrawal from a few classes, as they were all moved to online and it disrupted my performance greatly.  I also got in a really bad spot and had to regularly meet with my psychiatrist.  I failed to show up to class and received two F's. \n\nSince then I have completed the failed classes, and my GPA is roughly a 3.3.  \n\nDo I have any options?  Are there any things colleges can be lenient about regarding proper diagnosis/documentation and transcripts?  I've honestly debated transferring to another college to get a fresh start on the transcript history, but I just don't know.  \n\nI've been stressed about it as there isn't much I can do.",

      "text": "a 3.3 isn\u2019t an extremely low gpa. I would reach out to disability services to see if you can get an accommodation for your depression/anxiety moving forward. I would also reach out to your advisor as they will be able to help you more than we can since we don\u2019t know your school. When you transfer some schools restart your GPA and others don\u2019t. Your school may keep your Fs on your transcript or they may replace them if retake the classes and pass. It all varies institution to institution.",
