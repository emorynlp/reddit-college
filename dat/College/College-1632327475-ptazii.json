But sometimes paying x dollars for tuition is about the same as paying thousands of dollars for a dorm room you have to share with no bathroom. At the end of the day colleges are going to charge you as much as possible and give as little in return.",

It\u2019s inexcusable (barring an emergency) to persistently take more than a week to respond to emails, so it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to expect more responsiveness (within 48-72 business hours is generally appropriate).\n\nAs for office hours being accessible, that\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s never going to work for everyone. As long as the professor holds the required number of hours, and as long as they\u2019re within business hours, then that\u2019s all that can be expected. If you have a conflict with those hours, the next best option is to request a one on one appointment outside of those hours if the need requires such a meeting. Hopefully, the professor would be willing to meet with you outside of office hours. If not, this would be something to include in the student opinion survey at the end of the term.",

I\u2019m taking a 300 level accounting course with a professor who is a lifelong academic and takes pride in \u201cnever working outside a university\u201d.  He doesn\u2019t lecture and instead takes 20-30 minutes to take attendance and talk about whatever irrelevant topics are on his mind.  When you ask a question about the problem, no matter how direct the question is he has to start the problem from the very beginning.  That sounds helpful until you realize these are questions involving 7-8 steps and he can only cover 1.5 in a class period.  To make matters worse the homework is electronically graded and doesn\u2019t tell you what you got wrong or why.  \n\nI\u2019ve never felt more taken advantage of than this class.  If I withdraw I lose my money, if I stay I\u2019m spending 20+ hours working on this class every weekend and have no idea if I\u2019m making progress. My other classes are starting to suffer as a result.",

              "text": "Run, don't  walk to the Department chair office or your academic advisor...or both make an appointment! Take the following approach...  \"I am really struggling in this class, and I am seeking your advice as to how I should deal with the situation.\"  Have your syllabus (and know it backwards and forward!) And when they suggest you do impossible things like call a TA or see the prof during office hours...  empathize with your poor overworked professor.  Show the emails that are taking longer than a week to respond... and attribute it to him having so many students...  stand up for the guy/gal ..  If you want to get action,  reverse psychology is often a best bet... \n\nA lot of faculty administrators have the attitude,  rightly or wrongly of 'Quit whining, and don't  come to me with a problem without a solution.' \n\nSo don't whine!!!  (And though I don't think you are whining  AT ALL!!!)  A lot of faculty/administrators will use that as a way to dismiss you.--DON'T LET THEM!   The more super reasonable you are in your approach,  the more help you will likely receive!  \n\nHave the solutions that you are using and ask for coaching on how you could, 'fine tune' your solutions...  as a guy who did this in several 'screwed up situations that were just a fixin' to be made all my fault...'  this backhanded but truthful approach saved my ass repeatedly in undergrad with crazy situations with crazy, unprofessional faculty.  \n\nDo not embellish or talk about your monetary investment,  as this will typically not win folk over. (It is a valid argument in real life... but you aren't working in real life you are at college)  Talk instead about how important doing well is for your progress in the program and how much you love the subject! \n\nGood luck and dm if you have questions about what I mean.\n\nBtw.... most faculty in my 350+ semester hours of graduate and undergraduate education,  are AMAZING scholars and really good people who work hard and are a credit to the profession of professor. TAs are a more  mixed bag, but usually  human...  and often willing to help, if you can get to them.",
