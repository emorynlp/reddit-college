  "text": "My employer has a partnership through Guild Education where they can offer all of their employees tuition reimbursement. Thankfully, I am eligible for the benefit, and the best part about it is that my tuition and other expenses would be covered in full. \n\nHowever, after making the difficult decision to transfer out of my current university into the Guild network, I\u2019ve been feeling even more overwhelmed because I have to decide which online university would be the best option for my studies, and all of the schools seem promising. Also, just so you\u2019re all aware, I\u2019ve been working toward my BS in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing, so I\u2019m looking for a school that has a good online business program, along with an AACSB accreditation (or some other significant accreditation). By the time I\u2019m done with my fall semester this year, I should have about 46 credits to transfer over to any one of the universities listed below, so transfer credits aren\u2019t really an issue either. \n\nI\u2019ve narrowed it down to 4 choices: Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), Louisiana State University-Online, University of Arizona, and Purdue Global. \n\nHas anyone attended one of these colleges, or was thinking to attend one? If so, what was your experience like? Which one do you think would offer the best benefits for a business degree-seeking student?",
