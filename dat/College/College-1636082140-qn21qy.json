  "text": "I feel dumb asking this question, but I\u2019m quite lost at the moment. I seem to be having a hard time figuring out what to major in. I started community college when I was 17 and had just graduated high school. Back then I still had no idea what I wanted to major in. My parents really wanted me to go to college and get into a well paying career, they especially wanted me to do something in the medical field. I\u2019m their only child so lots of pressure is on me. I tried discussing with them about taking a gap year to think this through and explore other options, but they didn\u2019t let me. Back then not knowing better, I enrolled in some classes to become a medical assistant. I did a semester of that and I wasn\u2019t enjoying it, so I stopped. At that point I still wasn\u2019t sure what else to major in. I came across an early childhood program that didn\u2019t sound too bad and decided to try it out. I thought it was okay, except it was getting to a point where apparently they required us to have some kind of \u2018experience\u2019 with kids..? Something I don\u2019t have, and had to stop, for now at least. Right now I\u2019m not taking any classes, just working at a job, because I feel like I was just taking classes aimlessly without not knowing what I want to do.\n\nI\u2019ve heard of trade schools, and in high school I took some workshop classes which I enjoyed. The only issue is that these schools are on the other side of the state and in my current home situation, I can\u2019t move out yet. I also just turned 19. There are some nursing homes near me in need of cna and staffing, and my parents told me I should look into becoming one in the meantime. I would greatly appreciate some advice at this point.",

      "text": "You're suppose to be lost, in a good way. You won't be working at the same place nor the same industry, in however long that may be. I would even say school won't even get you halfway there. So the only option is to throw yourself out there and see what you would like to learn. \nTldr - keep trying, you'll find it through failure and luck",

      "text": "I actually didn't choose my major. It kind of chose me.\n\nI also didn't know what I wanted to major in. So, what did I do? I googled what to major in. What did a bunch of out-of-touch and paid-off journalists say to do? Nursing.\n\nI wasted three years waiting to get into nursing school and finally came to the conclusion that nursing was not for me. I transferred to the only major I could with my hours, and I am very happy with it (Health Science.)\n\nPart of the reason I went to nursing was bad experiences and a desire to learn lead me to pursue something I wasn't already good at or passionate about. I was also too insecure to take on a major like architecture because I didn't think I could do the math. Well, turns out i can do chemistry and if you work hard enough you will learn the material.\n\nIf cna sounds interesting to you, look into the medical associate's degrees your local community college may offer. I wish I would have considered them! Many of them are in-demand jobs with great salaries that aren't considered options solely because they aren't gained through four-year universities. If you find out you do want to do a four-year or CNA, you'll have great prerequisites for both paths. However, this may not be for you--or any medical path--if your experience with medical assistant put you off or if you don't like working with little humans. In healthcare settings, adults and kids often have the same behavior.",

At one point I realized maybe there was something to why I liked videos about reviewing, discussing, and making films, and there was. You said you might like woodworking? Is there any way to do anything with that right now to see if its someone you want to pursue?",
