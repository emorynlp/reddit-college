  "title:": "Going back to school to turn a minor into a major",
  "text": "I'm about to graduate with my major and a minor. I wasn't sure if I wanted to major in the minor subject due to stress and career options. Though it could open up some doors, those doors are super rare and i didn't find the stress of a double major worth it. If i find that I want to make a major down the road (like a year or two when I have the money), could I do so? I have taken the lower div perquisites already and have an a few upper div classes done. I should have about 2-3 semesters left of work to do with what I have already done.",

      "text": "If you already have a bachelor's degree, then most schools will bar you from coming back to study a subject you've already studied. They'll push you to get a master's instead, which is typically better in the job market anyway, so you should probably go that route instead of just tacking on another bachelor's degree.",

      "text": "You would be earning a second baccalaureate. Totally doable, people do it all the time. Your first degree will remain as is - there\u2019s no changing it once its conferred. You\u2019ll be earning an entirely new one, though it\u2019ll go much quicker since the credits/classes you already have can apply to the new one as well.",
