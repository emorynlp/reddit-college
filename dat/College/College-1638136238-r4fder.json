The shelter in my college town upped the adoption age required to 22 because college kids kept buying cats and returned them after a couple weeks or when they graduated. \n\nAll pets are expensive and have a commitment of 5-20 years. If you miss animals and have the time volunteer at your local shelter or apply to be a short term foster.",

      "text": "Tarantulas or jumping spiders make perfect pets! Especially if you get a tarantula that's older than a juvenile. They don't need to eat very often, can be kept in relatively small enclosures, and there are a lot of really docile species. I find them quite cute. I have jumping spider, but he's small so I need to feed him pretty often. They're far more active than tarantulas so he's always jumping around and checking everything out\n\nI know a lot of people don't like arachnids so I'll at least caution against some pets that I know are really tough that people often think are easy. I personally ruled out the following:\nGuinea pigs - adorable, but require a lot of space, a companion, are prone to health issues that aren't treatable by a regular vet, and are quite messy\nFish - optimum care truly does take quite a bit of monitoring. I found that I was always obsessing about water conditions. Fish tend to be sensitive and I felt like I'd prefer to be settled into a place before getting them because I didn't want to stress them with the moving involved with college and early adulthood",

For instance, If you live in a dorm you don\u2019t have much space for a pet and something like a dog would be out of the question. Honestly having a pet is a huge responsibility and pets are affordable until they aren\u2019t. All pets cost money. The best thing you can do is wait until you can comfortably afford a pet and are in a stable environment for a pet.",
