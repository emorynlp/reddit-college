  "text": "I\u2019m currently finishing up my first semester as an Information Technology student at CC planning to go to Uni. I enjoy the programming classes so far, and if I continue in this program I will graduate on time(4 years) and I am pretty confident I will be able to get through and have no issues getting internships and what not. However, I\u2019ve heard more and more that IT degrees aren\u2019t very good and it\u2019s way better to get a Computer Science degree for working in tech. Now I\u2019m struggling to decide whether I should switch. I\u2019m 25 and not getting any younger. CS is more rigorous and would add roughly an additional year of schooling and living costs to my plan, and that\u2019s if I never fail anything. Im not entirely sure of how difficult the higher level maths and physics would be for me. it would be better for my overall career I believe. But I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s worth the extra investment/risk",

      "text": "You could continue your current path but add/replace a class next semester with one of these rigorous courses to get a better feel. I don't know your programs, but computer engineering where I'm from takes a lot of the same coding classes as information systems majors so they'd transfer to both while you evaluated your options.",

      "text": "IS is so much faster to get through. Right now, you have no experience, but retirement is 6 years closer than for an 18 year old. You need to get into the pool sooner rather than later, and IS has an excellent return on investment. Plunge ahead and get out the door with your IS degree. After your first job, it's all about what you've done, not what degree you have.",
