  "text": "There\u2019s a party happening tonight nearby but i don\u2019t have anyone to go with me. Not that i\u2019m worried about going alone, but it\u2019s a 20 minute walk pretty late at night and it wouldn\u2019t be safe. I don\u2019t know, should I just go??\n\nedit: maybe it\u2019s important to add i\u2019m 18F\n\nedit edit: i walked alone and some girls adopted me and we couldn\u2019t find a good party so now we\u2019re having pizza  < 3",
