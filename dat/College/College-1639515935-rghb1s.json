  "text": "Long story short. My accounting class was a peculiar one. At first I thought it was the best class ever because Professor said no quizzes or tests. He said \u201cI\u2019ll grade by your assignments.\u201dHonestly this has been the most unorganized class. He never ever returns our emails and doesn\u2019t care tbh (but he says he does) \nI had a meeting with him two weeks ago and he said I have an A-. Today i check my cunyfirst and see a B+. Mind you I\u2019ve never missed any class, submitted email assignments and on wiley plus I have a 95%\nI text my class and I see students who didn\u2019t even finish their works getting A-. It feels like he just gave grades randomly. Also, there have been instances where my classmates spammed 10 emails in a row but he didn\u2019t reply. I kinda spammed emails but I really don\u2019t think he\u2019ll reply. It\u2019s one thing to do my best and get a B+ but I\u2019m upset that I put in the work but my grades are lower than what my professor told me. What can I do now? Please help",

      "text": "Have you thought about the possibility that these students that got A+s or As excelled in other areas to justify their grade.\n\nSometimes, a lecturer grades on a wholistic view of the course. In these circumstances it's possible that these other students excelled in other ways.\n\nA B+ isn't the end of the world anyway it's still an excellent passing grade... Everyone here is saying go to the dean. I would say read your course outline to see how the course is graded before you go all out at the lecturer.\n\nAs for what your prof told you. Assuming he said this before your last assignment or before your final grades were tallied I wouldn't have given it so much wieght. As the reality is you had not been graded yet.",

          "text": "I understand the other aspects but in the beginning of the semester professor said that as long as we submit the assignments, we will be fine. B+ isn\u2019t a bad grade but I know that I deserve better because it\u2019s not just me, other students of his are saying the same thing: that he as been giving grades like lottery. \nA guy who hasn\u2019t been in class or submitted anything in the class got a C. Idk how to make sense of that. Other classmates of mine are trying to reach him but can\u2019t. \nWhen we had talked in the last meeting i had submitted everything except one chapter and he said if I submit I\u2019ll get A- which I submitted in the same day. As we didn\u2019t have any quizzes or finals there shouldn\u2019t be a drastic change in the grades. Aside from all that even if I was in the wrong, I would expect a reply from my professor explaining the situation but didn\u2019t get any.",
