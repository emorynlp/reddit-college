  "text": "Long story short. My accounting class was a peculiar one. At first I thought it was the best class ever because Professor said no quizzes or tests. He said \u201cI\u2019ll grade by your assignments.\u201dHonestly this has been the most unorganized class. He never ever returns our emails and doesn\u2019t care tbh (but he says he does) \nI had a meeting with him two weeks ago and he said I have an A-. Today i check my cunyfirst and see a B+. Mind you I\u2019ve never missed any class, submitted email assignments and on wiley plus I have a 95%\nI text my class and I see students who didn\u2019t even finish their works getting A-. It feels like he just gave grades randomly. Also, there have been instances where my classmates spammed 10 emails in a row but he didn\u2019t reply. I kinda spammed emails but I really don\u2019t think he\u2019ll reply. It\u2019s one thing to do my best and get a B+ but I\u2019m upset that I put in the work but my grades are lower than what my professor told me. What can I do now? Please help",
