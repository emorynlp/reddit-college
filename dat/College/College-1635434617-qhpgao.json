  "text": "I received a considerable scholarship for this year and my department is having a dinner and reception for donors and scholarship recipients. I tend to be so-so in social situations and imagine I'll be sat at a table with a faculty member I know and some donors. I would guess that I'll be sat with the individual who donated my scholarship amount as it was from someone in the community rather than an organization.\n\nWhat did you talk about in your experience? How can I make the situation more comfortable and make a good impression?",
