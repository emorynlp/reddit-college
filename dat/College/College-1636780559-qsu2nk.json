  "text": "I was having a conversation with my friend about how I\u2019m not applying restrictive early action, but will be turning in my application tomorrow, November 13th. She said this will reflect poorly on me because I didn\u2019t just apply REA, which is their preference, but am also turning it super early. Is this true or will they just not care.",

      "text": "I don't think it is bad... you might be overthinking.\n\nGenerally speaking you need to think about how many people apply to that pool. If I was applying to undergrad again I would want my application to be reviewed in a period where fewer were on the table. But every student and parent applying to Harvard has no doubt researched when to submit it so they probably get a lot of those REA applications. Who knows.\n\nI don't think there is a way to objectively determine how much your chances of admission went up or down doing this, but I think it is minimal.",
