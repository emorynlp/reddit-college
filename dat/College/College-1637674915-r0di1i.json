  "text": "I registered for my college courses\u00a0late, and there were only two classes that fit into my schedule for my biology course. Both classes received a 2/5 from my professor, and there was no way that I'm going to make over C. So I asked one of the professors who teaches a class with a full class, and he said that if I fill out the paperwork requesting an override and the department agrees, he will accept it. The form asks for an explanation of why I'm trying to register for this class, but I need a good reason. Should I just wait until the rest of it is full(the other two), or is there any compelling reason why the department would allow me to override ioi?\n\n(+ One course is online, and the other is scheduled for 6:00 p.m. I live away off-campus. One reasoning I came up with is that I needed to pick up my sister and make dinner for her, and I was also having difficulty learning online.(I took one of my classes online this semester)",

      "text": "If they're prerequisites for some other classes you need that could be a good option. Also if you're graduating thats your best reason. If a class is only offered in the one semester and you need it to graduate or if its a prerequisite for the next semester, or if its part of a chain that is required for you to graduate on time are also good reasons. \n\nIf you just registered late and its not a prerequisite or you're not graduating, you might be out of luck.",

I have other responsibilities outside of school and as a commuter the 6pm class is too late. I have a difficult time learning online and I would much prefer an in person course. I plan to graduate in fall/spring 20xx and I need to take *course name* this semester to stay on track.\u201d",
