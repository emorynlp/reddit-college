  "text": "To clear this up, I'm so painfully behind in my chemistry class. He has weekly quizzes and I know I'd bomb another one if I went. I don't think he has any penalties for absenses...? (I have to check). If I just spend today studying, I think I can make up for this week + next week just fine, and he mostly goes over our quizzes and then we leave.\n\nBut is this a wise decision? Should I do this? Do I need to email and say I have a painful migraine (it's a nasty stress headache, but close enough yes?)?",
