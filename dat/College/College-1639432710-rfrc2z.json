  "text": "I'm gonna make this short and simple.\n\nBasically, I started college majoring in design media art or graphic design. I love art, I love doing graphics and colors and fonts and more. I even had an internship in a company. After 6 months of the internship, I lost confidence a little, mostly because things I made aren't the same vibes with the company so I wasn't the topped intern. However, I'd still do freelance projects on my own and with friends. I even have a pretty decent portfolio.\n\nThen Fall semester rolled around, I took Psychology 001, and became pretty interested in the subject. I have a past with mental illnesses and psychology has always been a plan B for me. I loved helping friends and listening to their problems. So I met with my counselor and changed my major to psychology. At this point, I have already dropped graphic design. I thought Psychology was what I meant to do for the rest of my life. But after studying and looking for interns, I right now have already lost interest. Losing interest as in doing it for money and for a living, I still love talking about mental health, doing self-care, and stuff...\n\nI also learned that becoming a therapist won't make much money. I value mental health a lot, and I want to do something that helps me pay the bill, I don't want to work too much. I'd rather not make a lot of money than work a lot for the money and sacrifice my mental health.\n\nThe problem now, I really want to go back to do graphic design, I haven't done it for a while. I am planning to make a book-cover-project (basically re-make book covers). I want to look for internships in the marketing and graphic design field, but I am afraid that I will hate it again and go back to psychology, and the cycle repeats.\n\nI was thinking to make something that is not in my interest at all my career, but I have to be ok doing it. So that I can do my hobbies (art and mental health) and still be able to do a job that I don't hate to pay my bills and live a comfortable life. Has anyone experienced this? What would you do?",

      "text": "What you decide to try and do right out of college is not what you have to do for the rest of your life. You can try it and immediately jump to something else. The student loans you\u2019d accrue and time you\u2019d spend jumping back and forth between majors will be more impactful on you than picking one and running with it.\n\nPersonally I\u2019d recommend graphic design over psychology, knowing plenty of psy majors who ended up back in retail. It\u2019s only worthwhile *sometimes* if you\u2019re planning to go to grad school after. To be frank, graphic design isn\u2019t necessarily a rock solid career path either, but if it\u2019s what you enjoy, that matters.",

      "text": "I highly recommend that and I'm glad you figured that out. So many people feel like they have to \"love\" or have a \"passion\" for what they do. And you should definitely at least like it and have it keep you interested day to day. But a job and management can be draining on creativity and hobbies, and as you mentioned psychology might not be able to pay the best.\n\nYou can probably help yourself and others if you go into a different field, and learn and do these things on your own. You might even build a successful freelance graphic design business on the side.",

          "text": "That is true. For example I was working at a bakery (just quit a few days ago), and even tho there was no studying required for this job, but it made me money and I didnt hate going to work, plus I got to meet lots of people. I quit it because I wanted to do something in the field I study for. Bu truly I really loved that job. \n\nSometimes I think to myself, I could probably do a retail job for the rest of my life, as long as it keeps my bills paid. Then I can spend time on other stuff I like instead of making it my career. But then parents will pressure you, society will look down on you, which sucks.",
