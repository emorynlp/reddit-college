  "text": "i really like my roommate and the people who live next to us. i\u2019m very studious and i really like having people around but sometimes they just randomly start talking loud and playing music, and come into my room then and are super loud with my roommate. and i feel like i\u2019m being rude when i don\u2019t interact or engage too much. i really like to hang with them but i really need just like to be able to study, since i\u2019m studious and they are really not(which is fine if they aren\u2019t but it can be really disturbing). \ni go to the library to study a lot during the day, but i can\u2019t go at midnight because i feel like i should be able to just do HW in my dorm but i can\u2019t. \nsometimes i\u2019ll be taking naps and there\u2019s just a knock at my door and i feel bad when i don\u2019t feel like answering it. \nmy roommate just skips class and sleeps all day and she is 100% entitled to having time in this room just as much as i am, but like it\u2019s like i don\u2019t really know what to do.\nthe other day they were making noise till 5 am and i had an exam the morning of. \ni don\u2019t wanna ruin my friendships with any of these people. but i just would like to be able to study in peace, especially at night when most people are doing homework.",
