  "text": "I have a few things on my list such as looking for internships, starting an investment account so I can toss the little bit of extra money I have in it, thinking about grad school, and completely sorting through all of my belongings. Does anyone have suggestions about what else to do? I hate to waste the break just doing nothing and am trying to do productive or fun things during it.",
