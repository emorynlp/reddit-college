  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019ve had this annoying cough that has not gone away for basically a month now. I got tested for Covid a couple times and all negative. I then went to the doctor and they said it was bronchitis so I was on some medicine for that and just got off a couple days ago but I\u2019m still coughing just not as bad. Every morning I wake up coughing up phlegm it\u2019s so annoying. Anyone else also having this issue? I tend to have bad anxiety about my health so I wanted to see if anyone else was experiencing this as well. Upper respiratory viruses seem to be going around at the moment not really sure what else I can do lol",

But yesterday was the first day i didnt take any medicine as I had finished the treatment and then this morning I woke up coughing some phlegm up again.",

They will either run more tests, give you some stronger drugs, or both.\n\nWith vague/common symptoms, they end up treating the most likely cause of a patient's symptoms without 100% nailing the cause. The fact the drugs they gave you for bronchitis didn't work means it's either not bronchitis, your body metabolizes the drug weird, or you have strain that is resistant to the drug you were given.",

So what happens during the summer time, mucus begins to leak into your lungs and as the weather begins to get colder that mucus makes your lungs cold and have a persistent cough. It could potentially get worse over time and the cough persists. A round of antibiotics can help clear it up rather quickly (trust me I learned the hard way I had a persistent cough for about 3 months pre-covid). It would then help you next year to potentially take allergy medication to help lessen the possibility of happens regularly, especially with those with a history of bronchitis.",
