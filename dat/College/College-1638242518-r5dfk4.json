  "text": "I\u2019m currently a Junior and am majoring in Aviation, Pro pilot. Meaning My major is basically set up for me to become a Pilot. I already have my Pilot license, and was supposed to be doing my instrument but i got screwed out of the lab. \nAnyways I chose this major because my dad was a pilot and made good money. I thought flying was cool and right out of high school I didn\u2019t really think about what I would want to do in life. I just went with the flow and chose my major without thinking. Getting my pilots license was not an enjoyable experience, plus it happened during covid which made it harder for me. The more I think about my future and what I will be doing for a living, it scares me. I have nonstop anxiety and thoughts about if this is the career for me? Is this what I want ? I\u2019m trying to figure out what I want but i\u2019m not sure. I also feel like I have no time to think as i\u2019m still doing school and I only have a month break between semester to decide if I want to change and what to change to. Also I feel so dumb wasting all that time and money just following my dads footsteps without thinking for myself. Im not sure what to do and I am having mental breakdowns everyday and anxiety.",

      "text": "Take a step back and breath. Do you plan on staying at your current school? If so, if I were you, I would use that break you\u2019re going to have to see all the majors that your school offers, read their descriptions, search more about the ones that seem interesting to you, see what you can do with that degree, what you like and dislike, etc. That\u2019s basically how I chose my majors, takes a bit of time but can be pretty fun. \n\nIt\u2019s never too late so just calm down, lots and lots of people get into college thinking they know what they want to do, but change their minds most of the time. Don\u2019t sweat over it and search for something else to see how you feel. Good luck!",
