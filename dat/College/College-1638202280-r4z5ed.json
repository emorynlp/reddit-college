  "text": "I got a couple job offers last week that I haven\u2019t decided between. One gave me a deadline of December 6th, and the other said \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. The problem is there is one more job that I\u2019m interested in that I scheduled an in person interview with on December 20th (it\u2019s a 4 hr drive away). I was considering asking to move the interview online so that I could do it sooner and hopefully get an offer. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this?",

      "text": "It may seem scummy, but you can also accept an offer then unaccept if you want to switch. Then you\u2019re safe if you don\u2019t get the other job, or the other job dissapoints (pat, benefits, etc). I\u2019d sit down and say \u201cif I chose today, which would I take? And if the third came in, at what price would I change to them?\u201d And just follow that general plan",

      "text": "If I were you, I would avoid accepting any offers. Contact the other two and say that you still have other jobs that are in the interview process, on top of finals and the holidays, and that you'd like to be able to look at everything on a level playing field with your family over the next month and make a decision in January.\n\nEither they'll reject you, which is maybe a tiny red flag that the company isn't very flexible (and let's be honest, is hiring a new grad for May really what anyone in HR is thinking about during annual reviews/holiday season). Or they'll say that's fine. Or if they really like you they'll say \"what would it take for you to stop considering other offers?\", Which puts you in a powerful position.\n\nHiring is a pain, they want the process to be as smooth and painless as possible, and for you not to have any reason to renege on them because that starts the whole process over again.",
