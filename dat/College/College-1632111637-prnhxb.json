  "text": "I'm a freshman, and I've been in college for 5 weeks. Commuting from home in New york city. So far, I have zero close friends, been invited to one party, and have mostly just gotten coffee with people between classes. Everybody's been becoming very close with one another, and I've tried my best to fit in, but everyone at my  school dresses great and has oodles of money, and i don't (yes I have a job). My academic performance is great, but my social life is shit compared to high school. Any and all advice to improve my situation is appreciated.",

      "text": "Hey, if there are any clubs or campus groups you want to join (even something you've never tried or are just vaguely interested in) please write an email to their org and ask to join in! \n\nDepending on the club it doesn't actually have to be a big time commitment, or you could go for a few weeks, find people you enjoy hanging out with and do one or two hangouts with them then drop out of the club and just keep the friends. The great thing is that you're a first year and nobody expects you to know anything, so the chiller clubs will likely not care if you missed some planned interest meeting or club fair and emailed out of the blue. \n\nIf your school has volunteering or tutoring or some other program (or even if you can find an on campus job where there's some downtime to chat and ask for advice like in the career office -I wouldn't recommend dining for this purpose just because the dishwashers are loud and you'll be too busy to talk), I'd suggest you try those too. When you're working alongside with people, it's easier to talk to them about the work and you can ask them for help or make jokes about how annoying the work is or just do small talk about your days. If there's anyone whose vibe you like who you've built up a rapport with, don't be afraid to ask them if they want to hang out after work.\n\nI think the key is to cast a wide net at first, focus on getting to know a lot of people to the point where you can easily know their major, their interests, have some \"how was your day\" exchanges, and feel comfortable just having people you can wave to/ stop to chat with if you see them around campus. For the people among these acquaintances you feel a good vibe from, make an effort to just ask them if they want to have food together/ go to an event together. If this is scary/awkward for you, give yourself a deadline like \"I'm going to ask 3 of the people I know to hang out outside of our shared club/ work by the end if this month\" and just do it, but tell yourself the results don't matter, you win even if you ask because you made the effort, it's up to them if they want to return it and you don't want to be friends with someone who doesn't value you enough to make time anyway.\n\nThere's no guarantee you'll meet your best friends in your first year. Sometimes it's just a matter of timing. But just remember that there are certain things that are out of your control, and by trying to put yourself out there in different situations you'll have done your part to maximize your chance at finding them. I know it's frustrating when everyone around you seems to be getting along amazingly, but I promise you there's tons of people at your school who feel the same way and are just waiting for somebody to reach out to them. It seems that since you've grabbed coffee with some people you're pretty okay with socializijg in general, and you could be that person who reaches out and initiates a deeper friendship with them. Good luck, we're all rooting for you!",
