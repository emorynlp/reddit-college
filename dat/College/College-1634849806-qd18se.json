  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm 38 and returning to college to try and get a degree. I just became a dad and want to make sure I can financially provide for my daughter.\n\nI'm taking a bunch of English classes to knock out prerequisites before transferring to a 4-year college and all the English classes require MLA formatting. I use Apple Pages and was wondering if anyone has an MLA formatted template that I could download?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

      "text": "First of all, congratulations on returning to college! That\u2019s a big step and is difficult at any age. Second, I would recommend using Microsoft Word over Apple Pages. MLA format is super easy to remember once you get the hang of it. I used to use Scribbr for my in-text citations and works cited pages. They also have a template you can download - I will link it! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions, good luck!\n[MLA Format ](https://www.scribbr.com/mla/formatting/)",
