  "title:": "Do community colleges require 12 official school years",
  "text": "I\u2019m planning to take the GED and SATs(self study, online courses),  I\u2019m a international student (never been to the us but planning to) and here we graduate at 16(10 years of official school) because we do the Cambridge curriculum so we usually move up to Alevels for another 2 years and graduate there and move on to Uni.\n\nAs you guys know most universities require a 12 year official school education(correct me if I\u2019m wrong), do community colleges require this as well?\n\nIf they don\u2019t and i enter a community college for 2 years does that mean at the end I\u2019ll have 12 years of official education(when entering community college ill only have 10 years of official education) and i can then meet the requirements and move on to Uni? Also how hard is it for community college graduates to move up to Uni? My high school grades are horrid",
