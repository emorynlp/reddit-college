  "text": "I\u2019m trying to figure out a planner situation for next year, anytime I get paper ones I stop a few months in because it isn\u2019t practical for me. I love Evernote\u2019s setup where you can customize your dashboard & it includes notes, calendar, to do list, and some other widgets, but it\u2019s around $100 for the year. That isn\u2019t really an expense I can justify so if I can\u2019t find anything I\u2019ll just get another paper one & try to stick to it, but I\u2019d really like to find something that can keep all of my stuff in one place. I also have a Mac. \n\n\nTldr- looking for a cheaper substitute to Evernote, something that includes notes & task management features",
