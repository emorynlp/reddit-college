  "text": "They are the chair of the department. Stopped putting out course material mid October.   \n\n\nI really like this person as a human. I spoke with them a few weeks ago and they said they were going to update everything that week. Nothing happened. I just filled out an evaluation and I feel terrible about it because, like I said, I like this person.  \n\n\nWe have one assignment that required they approve they approve the material that would be reported on. I started to do it even though we didn't have any feedback. Then I stopped after about halfway through. Decided I'm not going to do it. Remembered I talked to them and they said they would update the class. Got pissed off thinking about it. I could probably bang out the rest of the assignment in a few hours, but nah. \n\nNot sure what else I can really do. If the evaluations just go to the chair then what does it matter?",
