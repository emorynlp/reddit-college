  "text": "I need help. My goal is to learn brain to islets map, which I did as much as I could. The full map has not yet been discovered nor explained, but still there is some information which is enough. I need to find the name of a substance which is produced by hypothalamus to make insulin, something made in the hypothalamus that affects beta Langerhans islets to make insulin. I tried saying orexins, grelins, but it is not that easy as it sounds. I also tried with preproinsulin and proinsulin but those are precursors to insulin inside the islets... I will also keep looking for it, but any help is more than welcome.",
