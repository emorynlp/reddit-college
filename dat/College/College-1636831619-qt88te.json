  "text": "Greetings, \nI am a 24 year old female. I went to college after high school (age 18-19) and I took a long break. I don\u2019t qualify for Financial Aid due to events in my past. I am now struggling with bills, but I get by. Are there any ways I could go for free (ideally)? Any specific scholarships or anything? I need some advice \nThank you <3",

      "text": "Community college is your best bet. If you fill out FAFSA, you may get grants for being low income that could cover a nice chunk of your tuition. When you turn 24 you're considered \"independent\" by FAFSA, meaning that they don't include your parents' income in determining need-based assistance. As a result, you're likely to get more grant money now than if you applied for FAFSA under the age of 24.",

      "text": "Financial Aid counts you as independent at age 24. When they figure out how much pell grant or loan money to award you, they will not consider what your parents make, only what you make. Ask more at r/financialaid. Otherwise, when you check out colleges, you can ask them about scholarships, grants, and funding. Starting at a community college is usually the cheapest option.",
