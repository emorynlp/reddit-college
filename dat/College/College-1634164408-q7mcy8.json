  "title:": "Is Poland a good place to go to college?",
  "text": "I'm currently a junior in US high school, and am wondering which college I want to go to. A little while ago, the idea to study abroad came up, and I would want to specifically go to Poland to study because I'm decently fluent in the language and a lot of my family lives there. Does anyone know if the college education system is good in Poland? The price seems pretty good/reasonable, but after searching the internet for quality of life and education, I got some people saying that it was really good and others saying that it was terrible. All I really am searching for is more information about these topics, if you have any. Thanks for any help you can give!",
