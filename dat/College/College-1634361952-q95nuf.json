  "text": "I\u2019m behind. Like, really behind. I haven\u2019t done an assignment in a month and a half straight and i only started attending class again due to social anxieties and a severe depressive episode. I am meeting with a counselor through the school and I also just got accommodations through the school\u2019s disability center.\n\nI really want to know what\u2019s the best way to email a professor about this missing work. I\u2019m deeply ashamed that i\u2019ve gotten to this point and I feel incredibly embarrassed (so much so that some classes i don\u2019t attend at all.) I really want to make a turnaround this year but i\u2019m realizing that in order to do that I\u2019ll have to communicate my issues properly (regardless of rejection.) I really want to pass at least most of my classes, and I literally cannot afford to go to college unless I have a high enough GPA for my scholarships. \n\nHow should I bring up the accommodations and my poor mental health? I\u2019ve done some searches and spoken to my counselor as well but I\u2019d like some input from you guys.\n\nETA- I\u2019m a freshman if that helps.",

      "text": "FWIW, this is something where the disability center may be able to help you, both in communicating with your professor about your accommodations and in trying to navigate the struggle of getting accommodations partway through the semester when you're already struggling.\n\n\nAs far as communicating accommodations, you shouldn't have to give details. You should be able to pass along the accommodations to the prof, and possibly have a one-on-one to talk about how accommodations will work in their class. You don't owe them personal information beyond what they *need* to know.\n\n\nWith the mental health, I think you could go with something as vague as saying you had some road bumps due to your disability. The main thing is that you want to come across as owning up and looking for solutions. So, language like \"I've fallen behind due to this. What are my options? What can I do to succeed in this course going forward?\" It may help to talk in office hours if possible, just so you can have an in-depth discussion if necessary rather than having to try to navigate this through email, if you feel comfortable. Earlier is better, too. At this point in the semester, while you've hurt your performance, you have room to bounce back, so it's a great time to have this talk!",

      "text": "I'd send an email something like this: \"Hello (professor's name), I have been dealing with some unforseen medical issues and have fallen very behind in my coursework. I have already reached out to the campus disability center and am trying to get back on track. What can I do at this point in the semester, to salvage my grade and do my best in your course?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your understanding.\" \n\nThe disability center *should* be able to help you through this, maybe even arrange a meeting with your professors (if that's something you think would be beneficial). To address your question of how to bring up the accomodations: did the disability center give you a letter to present to your professors? In my experience, once I have established my disability with the accessibility center, I get a letter to present to my professors (email or in person)... they sign and date the letter and keep it for their records. The letter doesn't mention which disability I may have, it just explains my accomodations. A letter like this would be very helpful in your situation.\n\nI'm sorry you're struggling. You did the right thing by reaching out for help. I know it feels wrong sometimes, especially if you're not used to it, but taking advantage of all resources available to you will really help.",

      "text": "In addition to the disability office\u2019s help, you can usually also seek help from the Dean of Students. They tend to be the best office to advocate for students when significant problems have arisen that have interfered with work.\n\nSome courses may be salvageable, but some courses just aren\u2019t designed for missing weeks of work and then trying to catch up. Thus, it might be good to be prepared in case you are told to drop or withdraw from one or more of your courses. There is no shame in doing so, but that might be the only way to avoid an F in some cases.\n\nGood luck!",

If you are a month behind in several classes you should look into getting a medical WD or something like that - speak to your advisor and the disability office",
