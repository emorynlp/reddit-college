  "text": "This is copied from the text of a post on r/Professors, but I thought it would be useful and enlightening to ask the same question here (but not provide the link because it would be more interesting to keep the two groups separate in the opinions they each have). So, here\u2019s the text from that post:\n\nShelving your institutions policies (as best as possible), how would you define this in the context of a classroom? \n\nI understand this is totally subjective, hence the need for policies that set parameters. \n\nWhich professors do you think are more likely to be labelled \u2018unprofessional\u2019 if they do not align with the stereotypical depictions of Profs? Do you think minoritised groups may be unfairly labelled as unprofessional due to students biases?  i.e., perceived as less legitimate or credible\n\nI\u2019m really interested in how students construct their ideas of what a Professor is and should be. I thought I\u2019d ask for your thoughts and experiences",

      "text": "There\u2019s a difference between \u201cprofessional\u201d as in formal or beaurocratic, and \u201cprofessional\u201d as in actually doing a good job as professor.\n\nI actually like when professors are casual way more than when they look and act \u201cprofessional\u201d. Acting friendly, being able to talk to you like you are equal (while still enforcing their authority when necessary), making classes interesting. Too much professionalism makes you unapproachable and boring.\n\nAs a professor, what\u2019s important is that you are reasonable and good at actually teaching. Make a syllabus with explicit timelines and expectations and follow it, make a clear grading rubric and follow it, but also be lenient if a student submits 5 minutes late or has a valid excuse for needing an extension. Don\u2019t submit grades very late or have weird grading (e.g. putting most of the overall grade on one exam). Make sure most students are actually learning the material and offer office hours and resources for those who aren\u2019t. Show up to lectures prepared and not super late (honestly i don\u2019t care if you show up or end class a few minutes late).\n\nOne last thing: *never* be openly rude or condescending (unless another student is being an asshole themselves). It looks really bad and unprofessional when professors are outright rude to students. If a student deserves an F or asks for a stupid extension/curve, give them an F and deny the extension/curve, but you don\u2019t have to be mean about it.",

These professors so often forget things or take weeks to grade any assignments and then hold us to a different standard.  If you're allowed to say \"Oh I didn't update this Powerpoint so most of this is wrong and I didn't plan the activity we were supposed to do\" without any consequences, why do I have to disclose personal information just to get a few days extra for an assignment?",

      "text": "I don't know if I've used the label unprofessional very often, I've had professors who were nice people and clearly educated in their field, but didn't know how to run and organize a course.  This happened more often in smaller classes for my major.\n\nSome examples:\n\nWe often have days where they don't have us meet for lecture and tell us to read the slides instead.  There isn't a clear connection between readings and what is covered in class, and when there is, the lectures aren't in depth or don't help us make connections with the material.  Sometimes when they're lecturing it doesn't seem like they understand what they're saying.  They often don't respond to urgent emails for 4 or 5 days after the email is sent.  They either only assign busy work, or an overwhelming amount of extensive assignments that are clearly being used as a replacement for them teaching the material.   \n Assignments have unclear instructions and expectations.  Grades are not updated regularly and it may be weeks before you know your exam or project grade.  The professor doesn't ask for feedback, or doesn't make any modifications when students have concerns (especially when most of the class is having the same issue).",
