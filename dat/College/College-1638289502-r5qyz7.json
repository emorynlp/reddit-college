  "text": "So as the title states, I got a 58 on a history exam. I studied many hours for it but a lot of the test was memorization rather than concepts. No matter how long I tried to memorize the topics I just couldn\u2019t. When I got to the test I knew I immediately failed. Before I even took the test (I missed the day of the test and she wanted me to make it up on a specific day which I wasn\u2019t sure if I could attend that make up day or not) she told me if I couldn\u2019t attend the make up day that I would have to have my first test be 60 percent of my grade rather than 30. Do you think it\u2019s possible to ask her if I could do that even though I already finished the test ? I got an 80 on the first one. She doesn\u2019t like much so I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d ask her to do this for me.",

I studied for 10 hours + for this test but I can\u2019t seem to remember anything when I actually have it in front of me. We also have 1 minute to identify them",
