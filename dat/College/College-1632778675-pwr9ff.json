  "text": "For context I have been diagnosed with aspergers and ADHD. Im 31 and have been in college 8 years and have not graduated currently with $50k in debt and still no major. After spending years in college and not getting anywhere Ive finally figured out my issues. See the past couple years with covid and having to take online courses and working and not learning anything in my classes despite getting A's and B's I figured it was because it was simply online. But when I have done in person courses my problem has been I dont absorb as much of the info I need. This was especially true in the math courses I took at university level which were basically throw you in a computer lab with no lectures and expect you to figure it out and chastise you when you asked the TA's for help. Everytime I began to learn something we moved onto the next math subject and I would forget everything I learned from the last subject. Now I am in this intro to networking course in person at community college. And the professor is explaining networking and subnetting and I have no idea what any of it means. Not the first clue. So I think it boils down to unless I physically do complex things I cant learn them. Like even on a youtube recipe I need to watch it made step by step and take notes so I don't forget. I feel like if I am ever going to find a career or be successful it has to be through hands on learning. College courses go too fast. Like in this course the professor just reads of his power points and he does explain stuff but its way too fast and I cant get it. To make matters worse we have to do this \"test out\" software where its an online lab. I dont learn anything in online labs but if he had a station of PC's set up where I was setting up the cables or troubleshooting physically I know I would learn it and retain it. Is anyone else the same way?",

      "text": "   Yes I\u2019m the same way. Can\u2019t remember shit if I\u2019m just listening. I need a lot of repetition and the physically do it to even remember, and that\u2019s if I\u2019m even interested. Recorded lectures helped alittle, but I\u2019d have to re listen a million times and it gets time consuming.",

      "text": "Same. I wanna go to a college like the way they were in the 60s or 70s. Quarter semesters with only 1 or 2 classes. No attendance policies. No financial stress. No homework. The rise in adhd came with two semesters in the 80s. I didn't know I was adhd until 33. I made good grades in the 80s and 90s. I dropped out of high school early though. I blame undiagnosed adhd and the first power point presentation I saw.",
