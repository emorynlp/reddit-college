  "text": "I sent a message today to my prof in which I tell him/her that I wont be in class and that I am aware of the consequences and that I apologized. Maybe, I said something wrong but I feel like this person was unnecessarily abrasive for a business writing class. Maybe I'm just being a Nancy boy.\n\nME:\n\n\"Salutations, I hope you are well. Regretfully, I have yet to receive my covid result from yesterday and will not be in attendance today. I am aware that this is an unexcused absence and I will forfeit points as a consequence. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I would be grateful for any pertinent information from todays recitation that you might be willing to share. Thank you.\n\nHave a great weekend!\"\n\nHIM/HER:\n\n\" Yes, as stated in course registration and in the syllabus, this is an entirely in-person course. There actually is not a recurring Zoom set up, it is only created for those with a doctor note, or in quarantine. No one will be allowed to join via Zoom unless I share that private class link IN ADVANCE.\n\nIf you would like to stop by my office during office hours next Wednesday from 2-3, I would gladly share some of the content from class today so that you have a fresh start for next week. \"",
