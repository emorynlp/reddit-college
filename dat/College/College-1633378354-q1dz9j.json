  "text": "My professor for a mandatory college success course has not been utilizing the homework/grades/course calendar options on blackboard. She puts homework at the bottom of typed lesson sheets, no assignments, and has us email the homework to her instead of submitting to an assignment on blackboard. She also doesn\u2019t talk about homework/due dates/anything like that in class, so today when she told us that no one has been turning in homework, we told her that we didn\u2019t know we had homework\u2026 I just did it all and turned it in, but god I\u2019m so mad! I wish she\u2019d use it correctly like all of my other professors. I don\u2019t want an easy, mandatory class to be the thing that ruins my freshman gpa!! So frustrated. Should I talk to her and ask her to be more clear or is that overstepping\u2026?",

      "text": "You should talk to her about it if you believe it is something worth mentioning. However, unfortunately with college mentality, many would argue it is your responsibility to keep track of classroom updates and of what work you have to do. \n\nBut I would definitely suggest talking with some of your other classmates and have them voice similar complaints so that she may be more inclined to start using her devices properly.",

      "text": "Each professor uses blackboard however they like. Your best bet would be to ask them (in private/after class/email) if they could from now on post homeworks in their own dedicated sections on bb and upload grades directly on there. Especially if other people feel the same way, having multiple people ask respectfully is the best chance at getting it done.",
