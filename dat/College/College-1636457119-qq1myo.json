  "title:": "Is it normal to transfer to a school without being able to declare a major?",
  "text": "I have less than a year left in the military and while I have taken a handful of classes before and during my enlistment, I will likely not have the required pre-requisites for CS if I end up transferring to any of the schools that I would like to attend. The school that I am currently attending does not even have some of the pre-requisite courses. I can take Pre Calculus then Calculus then the remainder of the courses I will have to take at the school. So a few questions.\n\nIs this normal?\n\nWill this decrease my chances of graduating within 4 years?\n\nAlso, how will this affect my chances of getting accepted to the school?",

      "text": "It happens a lot. How it is handled will depend on how competitive the school is. I would talk directly to someone in the department you are interested in. A tougher school, could admit you as general studies major and let you reapply to CS after you finish the prerequisites. There would be no guarantee that you would be accepted to the major at that point though.  Other schools will accept you into the program, but won't let you take classes in the major until after the prerequisites are met. If graduating in 4 years is important to you, I would look into doing precalc online or during the summer. Your advisor could help you come up with a plan.",
