The classes itself are good, and the school offers similar things that traditional four year does. \n\nThe only thing to worry about is transfer credits when transferring after your associate\u2019s. They may not all be accepted. Some CC have bridge-programs to avoid this.",

And if you are at a state school, transfers from CC to state universities are usually well laid out and I'd be surprised if you lost any credits transferring to CC and then back to your university. \n\nIt also might be worth looking at any \"dual enrollment\" programs they may have. Not sure if this is popular in other states, but in Oregon it's very common to be dual enrolled at say, Portland State and Portland Community College for the first two years of college.",

Tuition at my 4 year is over quadruple the amount at CC, and that's before any tax refunds I would get from the IRS. Thank you! What were the positives and negatives of your CC experience? You seem to have a positive opinion on it lol",

              "text": "I am a little bit biased of course cause both my parents work for the community college, but the only real downfall of community college is that most people aren't there for the typical college experience. Most people live at home and work so it's not like you can gather up the people in your dorm and go to the dining hall for dinner. But if you don't think you'll miss that, then it's not really a negative.\n\nWhen I started community college, a lot of my high school friends and classmates decided to go there too, so it wasn't hard to make friends for me. There were also lots of clubs to join. Even though most people aren't that involved on campus, there are people who are involved. I was in the choir and drama club. If you want social activities, they are definitely there! \n\nI'm now abroad in England at a university and find myself longing for my days at CC! I miss the small class sizes, and the dedicated professors. Unlike at universities, community colleges don't have TAs teach the lower division courses. I felt way more cared about in my community college classes than I do now, and honestly the teaching quality was better. I feel like I learned way more in those two years than I am now.",

              "text": "since everyone will say \"it's worth it,\" I will give the downsides. Contrary to the opinion of this sub, tradeoffs are real, and you cannot simply \"purchase back\" the tradeoffs with the saved money. But if you need the money, then you need the money, and that's the end of the discussion. Anyway, to the point:\n\n1. large companies won't hire you for internships while you are at CC, as you are not considered to be at a 4-year institution or pursuing a 4-year degree. This is a bigger problem if you are applying locations near big universities.\n2. if you want to go to grad school, there are virtually no research apprenticeships/assistantships with professors at CC. I mean real research projects, not \"read a bunch of papers and write an essay\" research.\n3. no upper-division classes, so if you got your lower-level classes done, you may have to extend your graduation time (pay more tuition, lose more wages).\n4. Depending on where you want to go for university, CC classes will be easier or harder than them, and you will be punished for the lack of rigor if you later attend a harder university. Obviously if you attend 85% admission rate university like University of Mississippi CC classes will be harder, easier if you later attend a more selective university.\n\n4a. sometimes professors baby the students and give easy A that no respectable university would accept if they found out, and if you needed that knowledge for a future class, you're screwed.\n\n4b. sometimes (most of the time?) professors are required by the department or dean to make the class easier than standard so people actually pass. remember, CC is open admission, meaning anyone, including unprepared students (prepared students are mostly picked up by 4-year schools), can enroll as long as they have passed the prerequisite class. Regarding \"passing\" the prerequisite class, go back to the top of 4a and 4b.\n\n5. if you are ignorant/lazy and rely on **overworked\\*** CC counselors to pick your classes, you will take extra time or take unneeded classes or miss needed classes. For the love of god, please take the 4 hours to read all transfer requirements and plan your courses out yourself. Can't count the number of students who complain to me, \"the counselor said X, i got screwed by them\" when the correct information is clearly on the website after 3 clicks, 6 seconds of google and 40 seconds of reading.\n\n\\* CC counselors also have to deal with certificate programs, their own AA degree programs, all the universities that they have transfer agreements with, and student mental health. I saw a couple CC counselors' day calendars on their computer screens \u2014 they had booked appointments from 9 - 5, 30 min lunch.",

I had fewer opportunities to do other academic things like research or being more involved in clubs. It is much easier to get involved now that I\u2019m at a 4 year school. In some ways I wish I could have started as a freshman at my 4 year school but I also know it would have put me into way more debt than is worth it. And with covid I\u2019d have limited opportunities in my first 2 years anyway. So for me it was worth it to stay at a CC my first 2 years. I wasn\u2019t ready to move out yet. I gained a lot of independence during my time at CC which prepared me for moving to my 4 year school.",
