  "title:": "An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We're Opening This Fall",
  "text": "Dear faculty,\n\nOh, and staff. Sorry, we keep forgetting you exist. So sorry. You're like the middle child of higher education. You've been so quiet since you realized that unlike faculty we'll actually fire you for speaking up.\n\nMany of you have expressed concern with our plans to move ahead with in-person classes this fall. I personally find the plan to be relatively simple.\n\nAll we need to do to safely and successfully reopen is require everyone to wear a mask at all times, test all students, faculty and staff for COVID-19 before fall semester starts, require all students to self-isolate for 14 days before they arrive, split most of our classes into two groups that will never meet together in-person, remove half the furniture from all of our classrooms and public spaces, dedicate entire ~~dorms~~ residence halls to housing sick students, train faculty to live stream their classes to remote students while juggling the virtual and in-person management of questions and feedback, assume students will maintain physical distance and wear masks when they're off campus, assume students won't go to any parties, prep faculty to move to remote instruction immediately if they get sick or have to self-quarantine, require faculty to designate a \"colleague on call\" to serve as their academic next of kin who'll teach their class for no additional pay if they get sick or die, rearrange foot traffic patterns in all of our buildings and stairwells, dramatically increase cleaning responsibilities for our overstretched environmental services team, completely change how we distribute food in dining halls, set the HVAC to blow as hard as possible in every building to keep air flow moving, hope our toxic work culture doesn't lead to people coming in sick despite us not updating our sick or leave policies to accommodate for a generational pandemic, and cross our fingers that we get to the point in the semester where we don't have to give refunds for housing or dining plans when we move to all online instruction anyway.\n\nI don't see what's so complicated.\n\nBut since you all keep *insisting* on asking why we're taking such a \"risk\" in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic in a country with a negligent federal response and a bunch of morons who think this is all a hoax and that mask wearing is how Bill \"5G\" Gates will steal their rights or whatever, I'm writing to clarify the university's motivations for fall.\n\n**Money.**\n\nOh my god *we're so boned* if we don't get more money.\n\nDo you not realize how much of our funding is based on dramatically overpriced housing and food? Do you not know what an auxiliary service is? *Have you not noticed a bottle of Diet Coke is $4.50 in the cafeteria?* Do you not come to the budget meetings we schedule once a year at 6:30pm the Friday before a holiday weekend?\n\nOur endowment is like your savings account: Woefully inadequate and incapable of saving you. If we lose that sweet, sweet housing and food money we are going to have to fire at least a third of you to keep our own jobs safe, but at least we'll have a good reason to ditch those of you with tenure we don't like because you criticized us once three years ago. I'm coming for you, *Christina*.\n\nSo buck up, cupcake. Be resilient. Double your workload so you can help us maintain the fa\u00e7ade that opening for in-person instruction is somehow going to be safe until we hit the tuition and housing due date.\n\nWe *need you* to do all this extra work so we can get that sweet, sweet student money and stay afloat. *You* are how we are going to get through this. ~~We're going to squeeze you dry and then ask for more (NOTE: Let's remove this line before we hit send).~~ By the way, here's a website about self-care that has three broken links to in-person yoga classes from last year.\n\nThis *will* involve you spending the summer designing your course twice for both in-person and online instruction. Extra funding? Hahahahahaha Nah, but here's a webcam and the login page for Zoom. Make it work.\n\nTo answer another question you've been pestering us with: Yes, we *have* noticed all the local K12 school districts are going to be starting the school year online. As such, I've directed HR to do absolutely nothing to accommodate those of you who have been audacious enough to procreate. Figure it out. We can always replace you with a grad student or post doc who's desperate enough to barely scrape by. Your call.\n\nWhat? No, no we definitely won't be paying you more for the extra work you're doing.\n\nYes, this is probably your new normal workload moving forward if you're lucky enough to survive the Hunger Games machinations our CFO will be doing this fall.\n\nNo, we won't guarantee you won't be furloughed or fired anyway in two months.\n\nYes, this will put the Black and Latinx members of our community at risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services staff. Unrelated note: Did I mention we're changing the name of that building that's been named after a white supremacist the past 83 years? I, for one, am grateful to be a part of solving racism forever.\n\nWhere was I again? Oh yes, money.\n\nWe need money to under pay you, the staff, and the adjuncts who teach 83% of our courses. So take this mask we paid too much to put our logo on and get to work. At least until the tuition refund deadline passes.\n\nLove,\n\nYour University President\n\n\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all the awards, and especially the upvotes that made me feel reassured this is a shared experience, and that I\u2019m not alone.",

Weekly updates to staff and faculty on what\u2019s going on. I feel like it can really boil down to the school not getting enough state funding ever and instead of getting the projected 5% increase this year, it\u2019s a 10% decrease. It\u2019s actually 57% decrease by normal measure, but cares act funds are making up enough to only make it a loss of 10% total for the year. Our enrollment is down about 5-10%",

Of the 150+ faculty and staff who had their jobs cut, the majority of them make less than $50,000 a year. The boards of single persons might be scared and insecure, but they don't give a single shit about anyone but themselves.",

Studwnts aren't seeing any of the money, he is keeping it, and we sold out our dining to Aramark, who was recently dropped by another in state university (Notre Dame I believe) because they SUCK and so people are losing their jobs.

Obviously theme parks are in hiring anyone for the foreseeable future, and the wider hospitality industry is shedding people faster than the shaggy DA... that leaves me concerned for when I'm going to graduate in the spring. No internships because of the pandemic and an unlikely job potential, combine into perhaps a useless degree from an amazing achool..",

You know, the ones who keep the networks running, who process payroll, who clean the bathrooms.\n\nYep.  About 20 years ago I was the IT guy for a smallish dept. at a major research university.  No hyperbole here, they treated me little better than a indentured servant.\n\nWhen I was hired, I was told they'd pay for any training I might need.  When I submitted a request for training, I was told there was no money in the budget to pay for it ... but I would need to get the training to pass my probationary period.\n\nI worked 50 - 60 hours a week (with no overtime pay, since I was on salary), but was told I had a terrible work ethic and was never there.  The problem was I came in at 8am but most of the profs didn't show up till noon (most the classes in this dept. were scheduled in the afternoons and evenings).  So they had no idea that I had already put in 4 hrs. by the time they finally showed up.\n\nThey constantly asked me to do impossible shit (like take a horribly obsolete laptop that wouldn't even boot up anymore, and get it to run current software).  They then got openly angry and hostile when I told them these things were impossible.\n\nWhen it became obvious that I wasn't going to get a favorable probationary review, I walked into the the dept. chair's office, and handed him my keys along with a letter that said nothing more than, \"I resign, effective immediately.\"\n\nThe real kicker?  Pretty much all of the profs in the dept. were big champions of \"workers' rights.\"  Unless you were unfortunate enough to work for them.",

I think a vaccine or something to take after you get it is more likely. Even if there is a possibility of building antibodies, herd immunity is just not smart because it leads to at risk people to being, well, at risk. It also spreads it and can lead to new strands of the virus.",
