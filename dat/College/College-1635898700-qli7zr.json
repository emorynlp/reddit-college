  "text": "So originally i wanted to do MIS(Management information systems) because i like business and IT, however I have been seeing people saying MIS is not that good compared to other technical degrees such as CS for jobs. I want to switch it to applied math with minor in CS, is this a good choice or is MIS fine? Im a hs senior btw.",

I\u2019ve never met someone in the department who didn\u2019t get a good internship or job offer.\n\nYou can definitely have a lot more opportunities as a CS major, but MIS is still a great degree to have.\n\nI know you\u2019ve only a senior in HS but I wanted to ask, what are your career goals? Have you thought about what exactly you wanted to do after you graduate college? That can help make the decision between CS and MIS",

Sure a CS degree will pay more, but an MIS degree pay is good and can also give you a 6 figure salary if that's what you're looking for in terms of stable pay.",
