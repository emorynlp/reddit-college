  "text": "I'm an economics student at Penn State.  It is a department rule that no assignment can be curved.  A professor once argued that they don't curve assignments because it can reward lazy behavior.  However, I noticed that the classes get curved a ton.  It's also a department rule that at least 15% of the class must get A's.  I finished one class this semester with a 72.4% and got a B-.  A 84 in another and got an A-.  How common is this for you? Economics is certainly a difficult major.  About half the students drop almost every Econ course I take, sometimes up to 60%.",

      "text": "I'm at a CC right now and there is next to no curving. My sister just graduated from a public university and she said teachers curved the hell out of grades there. For the most part, professors want you to pass. They don't want a giant group of students repeating the course and taking up space, they want to push you through. I was just talking with my sister about this last night and she said there was one time that only 1 person got above a C on the final. The rest barely got above a 50%. You better believe they got curved.",

      "text": "Very few professors will freely admitting to curving the grade. However, if any university mandates so many get X grade, they are inherently curving it. Similarly, when professors are grading, they must recognize that if everyone failed a question or did poorly on a paper, maybe it was the professor's fault not the students, and grade accordingly. This unofficial curving appears nearly everywhere, even though few professors will acknowledge it. Community Colleges, in my experience, don't curve at all, even unofficially. Also, what major you have rarely matters as to whether they curve or not, a 60% drop rate isn't out of the ordinary for any major.",
