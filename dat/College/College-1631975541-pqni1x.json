You can sit down next to someone in class, and try to talk to them, and they will just not even acknowledge your presence. I\u2019ve thankfully made some friends, but god is it difficult to form lasting relationships.",

Just plan things carefully- meaning- be kind to your friends if they are super social by telling them when you can go out/hang out with them but be sure to put in time developing your friendships. Find that happy medium for yourself to balance alone time/ social time to keep your friends.",

Never a bad thing at all",

Going out to dinner with a few acquaintances is a whole different vibe than my chill neighbor coming to my place and having a few drinks while we watch trash TV. \n\nIt definitely takes more energy to \"put on\" for a social situation than it does to just be yourself around some cool ass people.",
