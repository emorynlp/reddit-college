  "text": "Hey everyone, I'm currently struggling with what I should do about this coming semester. I want to hang out with my friends, I want to run a club, I'd like to study at the library, and I want to work out at the gym. \n\nALL of these things are gonna be affected by social distancing. What friends should I hang out with? Should I cut a friend off for a couple weeks if they do something risky (party, go to a high risk area, etc)? \n\nWhat are your plans this semester? How should we do this?\n\n(PS:  a nerd that wants to run DnD every week.\ud83d\ude05)",

      "text": "I'm still trying to figure out what I should do for fall. I definitely do not want to take a whole semester online from my house. The conditions at home and the general environment here will definitely hamper my productivity and make me generally disinterested in everything. My two main options right now are deferring my admission to spring sem, or going on campus and attending hybrid lectures. I don't know a lot of people who are planning to defer their admission since it's a huge learning gap, so the best option for me right now seems to be to go to campus, set up a comfortable study environment in my dorm and attend classes cautiously. Of course, there'll still be some anxiety about irresponsible people and getting sick, but it looks like I'll just have to take that risk and be careful. I'd love some inputs on this, since I haven't taken a firm decision yet.",

Definitely no handshakes/high fives/hugs/etc. I live in a suite luckily so I have a single bedroom with a shared common area. I'm going to avoid going to big parties on campus but (only if my roommates say its okay) have a couple of friends over here and there and stay only in the common area, while also disinfecting EVERYTHING once they're gone. Also going to make sure there's always soap in the bathroom in our suite, since my previous roommates weren't so great with hand washing \ud83e\udd22.\n\nMy main concern is how the dining hall is going to work. My school has only said what they're considering doing, and everything seems good but they've said nothing about the dining hall. We have a buffet style one where you serve yourself, so my guess is that they're going to limit how many people can go in and also serve your food for you.\n\nNext semester is definitely going to be a big change and it will be stressful but we'll get through it!

You should also check the news on how clubs will be handled because similarly we were told to hold things remotely. \n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say any student going to school on campus this year will be spending a ton of time by themselves and in their dorm rooms as we probably won\u2019t be allowed to have friends come over either.",

It won't really matter anyway, since I already lost the 5 pounds of muscle I worked hard to gain last year, after getting covid. Lack of appetite + relapse when exercising was a recipe for muscle loss. at this point, easy strength training workouts will allow me to maintain what I currently have left without the gym. \n\nI'm also hesitant to go back to the gym because of the possible risk of reinfection. There isn't a clear answer on the issue, and how long antibodies last, but I still don't want to risk it. The gym seems like one of the easiest places to get covid on campus, and at my school, they might make people book gym sessions. It just seems so tedious, and something like weight training that requires consistence just cannot be done effectively under those circumstances.",

If you look at Yale's it's quite robust and detailed-- students are required to submit to testing and contact tracing, to quarantine if exposed, they cannot have any guests from off campus (including parents), they can't leave the state of Connecticut without prior approval, and they must conform to a pledge that requires masks everywhere, distancing, no groups, etc. or will be sent home. So many of these questions will be answer for you, though it will vary a lot between campuses.\n\nOther schools are taking even more pro-active approaches, including things like housing students in groups according to major/class schedule, running meals in shifts, limiting residence halls to single occupancy, etc. In the most extreme cases there are plans to have students isolate in \"teams\" of 15-20 that live, eat, and study together exclusively. \n\nThe biggest risk to having campus reopen is student behavior. From what we've seen already this summer it's going to be a serious challenge to keep students from congregating in bars and parties, even is masks are mandated. I think it's very likely that most/all colleges in the US will be closed again by state order by mid-October.",

The problem is that even if we are *technically allowed* to do those things, that doesn't mean it's *safe* for ourselves and the people around us. We all have quarantine fatigue. The question is whether we're going to consider normal college life more important than health and safety. Because of the numbers of people being infected by this virus, and the extremely serious illness it can cause, I think college life really needs to take a backseat until we get a handle on this.\n\nWe should all try to keep the number of people we see face-to-face as small as possible. Hang out with the friends you're closest with. Now isn't the time to be seeing acquaintances. Ask the people you want to spend time with how many people they have been seeing and how they are practicing social distancing. Don't hang out with somebody who struts around town like the virus doesn't exist. That kind of behavior endangers that person, the people who spend time with them, and the broader social circles of all those people. If a friend does something risky because they have to, like getting on a plane to see family, they should be self-quarantining to the extent possible for 14 days. If they aren't doing that, we should encourage our friends to consider other people and self-quarantine. Obviously wear a mask any time you're in public, even outdoors if there are a lot of people.\n\nClubs are going to be better off holding virtual meetings or outdoor meetings. Club meetings, depending on their size, aren't really that different from parties. It's a bunch of people enclosed in a small space breathing each other's air and socializing.\n\nThe library will probably be a high-traffic area. It would be better to study in another building or a secluded space within the library. I'm planning to spend most of my study time at home, but sometimes I will study in my department's building. We have a large, open space on the ground floor that should allow for social distancing. Remember that even if everybody wears a face mask, the things you touch are going to be touched by many other people. Carry hand sanitizer and use it frequently.\n\nYou can play DnD virtually. I've been playing in a virtual group and it's going well. We use Discord for voice and video. There are some online tools we use to create the maps and move our players around. I can't remember what they're called, but I'm sure there are multiple platforms for this.\n\nI don't really know what to tell you about the gym. I understand people need to get exercise. I think you'll just have to judge on a case-by-base basis whether it's a good idea to do whatever workout you do, depending on how many people are there and if the equipment is being thoroughly cleaned between uses. Stuff like running is probably better to do outside.",
