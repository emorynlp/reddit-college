I didn't ask to get the virus. I'm dealing with it. I should not be penalized for needing time to recover. Tell her you are concerned with her health and your classmates health and it is in everyone's best interest if you do not come to class. Additionally, I'd write I am in a diminished state, fighting this virus. I am in no condition to attend class nor take an exam. I would add, our nation has been dealing with the pandemic for almost 2 years and that you are surprised and upset that there is no contingency for it with her class. I would also say, it stressful worrying about missing the class and assignments and you don't need additional stress while you are dealing with the virus.  State you need an extension for the class. (Find out the steps you have to take). It is NOT unreasonable.  Then, I'd copy in the department head, the dean, and the clinic director.  If she wants to be an arse, let her be exposed for it. I'm sure you will get positive results from an email that lays it all out and has fresh eyes on it.\n\nGood luck! Hope you feel better soon!",

If you are at a school with strict covid policies then there will be guidelines professors have to follow. At my university, profs are encouraged to work with students dealing with the public health crisis- the language is vague but basically means we have to be somewhat accommodating for students who are quarantining or ill.\n\nSearch your school\u2019s website for Covid info. If there is anything then there is probably a section \u201cfor faculty and staff\u201d or something like this that would lay out those guidelines if they exist.",

If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on.

          "text": "I concur with this. The grief will definitely work. I was the disabled student (deaf). There was a professor in my philosophy class. He demanded no electronics allowed in his class according to school policy. I needed laptop so my transcriber could translate speech into text for me. But he refused. So I went to the chair of the philosophy department and complained. The chair demanded him to bend rules for the sake of accommodations according to the mission and vision of the college but he still refused. Then the higher-ups got involved and intervened. Soon, he relented and they fired him after the semester. Later, I found out that there were other students who had problems with him too.",
