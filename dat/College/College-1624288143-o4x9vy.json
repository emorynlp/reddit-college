  "title:": "Advice From a Recent College Grad",
  "text": "I graduated from a 4 year college in May - I didn't have the best experience but I think I made the most of it. I learned a lot about myself and a lot of underclassmen have told my tips helped them so here are my tips/advice (for background, I was an Econ major): \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Take Your Time** \\- You don't have to do every single major requirement in your first 2 years. I paced out my major pretty slowly and it worked wonders for me. My senior year I had to take 5 classes to finish my major (3 in the fall, 2 in the spring) but they were all easy electives. Spacing out requirements gave me the bandwidth to take easier classes so I could focus on my core courses. I knew lots of people that did too much too early and burned out by sophomore. They ended up switching majors or just unhappy.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Free Time is King** \\- Every school/major is different but try to make a schedule that has more classes that only meet 1-2 times a week. Sometimes I would take classes that I knew would suck but they only met once a week so it was worth it for me. Having more free time in your schedule gives you **time to study, go to the gym, meet with friends, get a job, office hours, etc.** I didn't have classes on Fridays on my last 5 semesters of college and it was one of the best things for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Everyone's Path is Different** \\- Try not to compare yourself to others. It's hard not to, but try your hardest. Some of your peers/friends may get great internships or research opportunities while you're still trying to figure out what you want to do. That's okay. **Just focus on doing what's best for you.** When I was a sophomore I applied to countless internships and didn't get any but my peers were all going to big companies like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. I used to feel like a failure for so long but I ended up stressing myself for no reason because 2 years later I ended up in the same companies as them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\"There's More to Life than School\"** \\- This is what I would tell myself when I would get burned out. I like to think I'm a high achiever but everyone has their limits. If you ever get to the point where your mental health is suffering, just remind yourself there's more to life than school. **Take a break, go out.** It's okay to get a B or a C from time to time. **As long as you know you tried your hardest, that's all that matters.**",

Most people I know that go the gym regularly got that discipline from playing sports in high school: every day after school you are **required** to workout at practices/games . When you do something everyday and it becomes part of your routine you build discipline.\n\nMy daily schedule would be based around studying. For example, starting back in freshman year I would go to dinner at 7pm **everyday** and then go to the library to study and do homework until my work was done or it was time to go to sleep. After one semester, studying just became part of my daily routine so I didn't have to think about it that much. If there's work to be done, do it.",
