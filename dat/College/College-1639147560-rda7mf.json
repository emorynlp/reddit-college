  "text": "I got a 100k scholarship for the art school I've really wanted to go to. And then of course I go online and see some bad reviews, and see how expensive it really is. But there is a chance that the debt could be worth it. \n\nI'm waiting on a few other letters back but this is keeping me up at night. How do I make the right decision about my future??? How am I expected to know what to do here???? Help???",

They're left by the happiest and most annoyed people. If the college is nearby try to talk to people who are hanging out in the student center or otherwise not official tour guides.",
