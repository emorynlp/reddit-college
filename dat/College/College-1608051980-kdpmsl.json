  "text": "Hi fellow college students! \n\nI emailed my prof last night. I feel so much shamed because i didnt do well this semester mental health just take a whole toll of me. So much craziness happenned, that i just gave up. I told her and explained her my situation. I\u2019m moving to another state but still willing to stay in school since were all online. She emailed me back with so much positive words and encouragement. And the last paragraph saying how she can help me in anyway of signing up to my classes. Gosh i was so scared to send my email last night and receiving a judgemental email back but i didnt get that, she gave me words that i needed. I think we all need proffessors like this. \n\nHope you are all well and staying strong x",

Was going through a lot of hardcore drama (like tv show level bad), it took way too much mental toll on me. Missed classes, turned in papers long overdue the deadline etc. I tried to talk to maybe 3 professors and dean at school. I was ridiculed and bullied and eventually they cancelled my degree because a very subjective grade (not depending on how you perform on subject, but rather how a school worker (not professor) grades you). He made a mistake also, my grade was short of 0.25 (out of 20), he said he'd correct it but then changed his mind :)",

It wasn't the case since, yeah, math makes me feel like the biggest idiot to ever live. \n\nI think he could tell I was quite anxious. He was very patient throughout, chuckled at my attempts to be funny when I'd say shit like \"someone *way* smarter than me came up with this\" when talking about a formula I used  and kept telling me that it's fine that \"I'm not a mathematician.\"",
