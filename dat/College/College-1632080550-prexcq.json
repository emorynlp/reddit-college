And remember, schools are Petri dishes, sicknesses spread like wildfire. \n\nI didn\u2019t have a single problem with my vaccine, I don\u2019t think I even had any arm soreness after. It\u2019s an easy and quick vaccine to get and very worth it.",

      "text": "Meningitis isn\u2019t super common these days, but if there\u2019s an outbreak in a close-living situation (like a dorm), it\u2019s crazy contagious. Many schools require the vaccine to help protect their student body as a whole, and others highly recommend but do not require it. It\u2019s a good idea to get it in general, but definitely if you\u2019re living in a dorm. \n\nThe meningitis vaccine has a long record of being safe! As with all vaccines, you may have some mild \u201cfeeling a bit blah\u201d symptoms for a day or so - general tiredness, a sore arm or a little swelling at the injection sight, a headache, even a mild fever (relatively rare with the meningitis vaccine, more common with other vaccines). This is totally normal and does NOT mean that you\u2019re sick! It\u2019s just your immune system kicking into gear as the vaccine trains it to recognize a threat, which is exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do.  If you have any concerns whatsoever, you can absolutely talk to your doctor or someone at your school\u2019s health clinic.",

      "text": ">college freshmen students are at higher risk of catching men than others.\n\nAs a man who was in college, I never felt like I was at higher risk of being caught than anybody else ...\n\nJoking aside, all FDA-approved vaccines are very safe and effective.  Like for most vaccines, the common side effects of the meningococcal vaccine are fatigue, headache, pain at the injection site (after all, somebody just stuck a sharp needle into your arm), and possibly fever and nausea.  All mild in the grand scheme of things, of course.\n\nWhile meningococcal disease is not extremely common in places like the United States, living in close proximity in a dormitory does modestly increase the risk of catching it, and it's definitely true that [meningococcal disease can be severe](https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/index.html).\n\nPersonally, I'd get the vaccination if I were you.  If you want more information or to discuss the issue with a knowledgeable professional, make an appointment at your campus's student health clinic or at a family/general medicine clinic in the town where you live.  The doctor there will be able to answer your questions and give you advice specific to your health situation (the vaccine is not recommended for people with certain comparatively rare medical conditions).\n\nGood luck.",

      "text": "This is required for all freshman at all my local universities. You should get it, and even if you don't want to, it's possible they'll require it. \n\nI was a freshman circa 2009 so I don't remember what the vaccine-getting experience was like. It was probably just like any other vaccine. Most vaccines have a risk of getting a sore arm and mild feverish symptoms afterwards, but personally speaking I've never had any side effects from any vaccine except for the covid shot (which caused-- you guessed it-- sore arm and mild fever). \n\n> How safe is the vaccine and should I get it?\n\nAll vaccines are really safe. Back in 1955 there was an incident where people given the polio vaccine were given live polio virus and serious injuries resulted, but this is not something that is done today and there is no evidence that any of the vaccines currently given to the public pose any danger to the general population. Generally speaking, in the rare cases they find something wrong with a vaccine, they do a recall, much like when they find e coli in your spinach or lettuce. However, vaccines (and all other drugs and food regulated by the FDA) go through rigorous testing prior to being approved for the market, and so generally it's extremely uncommon for there being safety issues found after a drug gets put on the market. That's not to say it doesn't happen, but it's quite rare.",
