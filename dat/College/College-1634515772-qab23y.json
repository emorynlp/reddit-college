  "text": "So in of our class with the most credits, our professor gave us an assignment that was due Monday last week, I forgot to give it and in today\u2019s class theyre gonna correct it together, do I skip the class and send him my assignment while inventing a lie and hoping he will be understanding to me and grade me? Orrrr ? Or do I go to class and pretend everything is alright ? Btw this is one of the only two grade so I\u2019m panicking a lot on what to do...",

      "text": "Neither. You could try emailing to ask if they\u2019ll accept the assignment late (even for a penalty), but be prepared to be told that it\u2019s too late. A day or so is one thing, but an entire week is usually too long, especially if they\u2019re going to be working on correcting it today.",

After it's corrected in class there is pretty much no chance he will let you turn it in, and how could he since he went over answers.\n\nadd: If he doesn't accept it, you probably will need to drop the class if it's one of two. For that reason, it's why I'd attempt to turn it in prior to class.",
