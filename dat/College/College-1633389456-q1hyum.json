  "text": "When students complain about a bad prof, the advice here (and on /collegerants) is always to report them. To the chair, to the dean, to the president, etc.\n\nThose of you who have actually reported a prof to a higher authority, what happened next? We never hear the follow-up stories.\n\n*Full disclosure - I am faculty, and I've only once been \"reported\". A student complained to the dean that I was unfair for not excusing them from a test, without realizing that they had, in fact, already been excused. A week of stress could have been avoided with a single email.*",

      "text": "I reported a fitness instructor got some pretty serious stuff (imo). I know at least one other student complained about the same things.\n\nI was basically thanked, told they'd look into it, and then never heard anything back. She still teaches the same classes and says the same dumb stuff. \n\nEdit to be a little more specific: she taught fitness classes that were for credit and some classes that counted toward some specific certificate programs. The things I had an issue with specifically were mostly things that fell under the category of very bad, dangerous health advice, like telling students to stop taking any mental health medication, trying to convince students they could heal their own cancer/chronic health issues/etc, and giving some SUPER bad advice about helping people who are suicidal.",

      "text": "I've reported a professor to the department chair a couple times. The first time, the chair talked to the professor but there was no real change. The second time, which took place at a different university, I took a print out of my email communication with a professor to the department chair and they required the professor to honor an agreement with me that professor had tried to back out of. \n\nThe worst they can do is not help you. But you may end up getting the desired result.",
