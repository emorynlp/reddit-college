  "text": "Hello.\n\nMy name is Joshua and I've been accepted into Eastern Michigan University and Central Michigan University, and will most likely be accepted in Western University.  If there are any former students of ANY of these colleges  PLEASE comment on your experience and what you think of the school(s).  Right now, I only have an app for Eastern's students where they post about what's happening(EMU Engage App).  I need more student info before I make this decision.  Any comment is appreciated.  Thank you for your time!",

      "text": "Don\u2019t go to eastern it\u2019s the least respected university of all you\u2019ve mentioned. Campus is gross and it\u2019s not a good place. Central Michigan is in Mt. Pleasant which literally only has the university. CMU is a great school but you need to be okay with little to nothing around the school. Western (Wastern) Michigan is a party school but Kzoo is a great city",
