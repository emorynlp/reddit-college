  "text": "So, my class all scheduled up for our informative speeches about a week ago. Since I've got shit to do, I make sure mine is set to be as late as possible. That was a week ago, but since I missed my class yesterday, where we went over completely irrelevant topics, my prof is trying to push my due date of the 28th to the 19th and inform me of such by email.\n\nThe fuck is this voodoo witchcraft shit? I told her I've got exams due around then. If I scheduled for the 28th, I want my shit to be due by the fucking 28th. Who should I see about taking this to if the prof just tries to ghost me instead of giving me an actual email response? She's bad about that.",
