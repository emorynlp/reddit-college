  "text": "I am applying for college, Ive done all the research and but everyone says you have to do something AMAZING like start a successful business or code a best selling indie game or something to be able to even compete with everybody else. \n\nI am 17 and I have none of that going for me. I just find that the people in ivy league schools are already so amazing and experts in their fields, like why even go to college in the first place?",

      "text": "With the exception of Ivy league schools, the only thing that matters is whether you earned good grades in high school and do well on entrance exams. Aside from that, there is limited capacity at the school and even fewer openings available for the given majors. The schools select the most capable students until these spots are fully consumed.\n\nIvy league schools highly value racial quotas, family prestige, bribery, and other factors that the average person does not have control over. You do not have to cure cancer... you only need to be born having the right criteria (while also doing well in high school and do well on entrance exams).",

      "text": "Well the problem is you\u2019re only looking at specific groups accepted into Ivy schools who differ from the average student. You\u2019re also speaking with people who are ignorant.\n\nIvy schools aren\u2019t everything. The only real advantage is they may open up more opportunities for you after you graduate. But many 4 year institutions are just as good in terms of providing quality education. And generally speaking, no one is going to give a damn where you obtained your degree. \n\nOnce you step into the real world, you\u2019ll realize the typical worker is mediocre. Yes, experience is good to have to keep a competitive edge when applying for positions, but it\u2019s not required. You also don\u2019t have to be incredibly talented or smart to hold a job. If that were the case, most of the US would be unemployed.",

Go to a state flagship like most other people and work your ass off in a marketable, high demand major and chances are you'll build a nice career and no one will give a fuck that you never went to an Ivy.",

For most people, myself included, college is simply a way to experience life as an adult in a controlled environment, while learning and developing skillsets that you will use to establish a career (and most importantly, network with employers via the school). You don't need to be in a top 30 school to do this. So long as you have the drive and work ethic, you'll do just fine going to a perfectly decent non-IVY state school and doing your thing there. You will still be able to get a job, meet friends and look to start a family all the same. If you're at peace with the notion of \\*not\\* being worked to death as a junior banker or lawyer fresh out of an IVY for a 6 figure income, which I personally am, there really isnt any issue here.",
