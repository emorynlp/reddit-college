  "text": "Hey guys! First time poster here.\n\nBackground: I am 19 and graduated from high school in 2020 (thank you COVID). I completed an associate's degree while in high school through community college, so I came into my current school with \\~65 credits. Both my HS and community college transcripts are, well, perfect. All As. I was also very involved in sports, clubs, etc. in high school.\n\nI started at Virginia Tech in the fall of 2020. By credit, I am currently a junior and, as of right now, will be graduating in spring of 2023. I am majoring in dietetics on track to become a registered dietitian.\n\nThe problem is, I don't think I want a career as an RD. I have struggled with eating disorders in the past, and I believe this job would be something I don't enjoy and will regret in the long run. I have thought about changing my major ever since I came here, but I have stuck with it for the security of knowing I can be done with the degree relatively soon/not worrying about the stress of transferring, etc.\n\nI have thought about nursing school for months now, and I am fairly sure this is the career I belong in. I worked at a nursing home over the summer, and I was appalled at how poorly the residents were treated by some of the nursing staff, and I took pride in knowing I could properly care for and support them. I love people. I want to help people. Also, my mother is a nurse, so I have been around it my entire life. \n\nThe second problem is, if I do decide to go through with this change, I would have to transfer schools. Virginia Tech does not offer a nursing program. I have been looking at UVA's program; they have a BSN program specifically for transfer students with a bachelor's-in-progress. I could go to my local community college, because they have a great nursing program. However, because of the amount of credits I have already completed, it would make more sense to transfer into a 4-year institution (at least it makes sense to me?). \n\nI will also mention that, the more I think about it, I actually hate it here. I haven't been very happy here at VT. I feel as if my education as been sub-par (partially due to COVID) and I have not had the best social experience (seriously - if you aren't in greek life, you mean nothing..). \n\nHonestly, I don't know what the f\\*ck to do. Does anyone have any advice or words of wisdom? Money is not the biggest concern - my parents are very supportive of me and will help me in which direction I choose to go. I just don't want to jump the gun and make a decision I will end up regretting.",

      "text": "Take the leap of faith! You don\u2019t sound interested in being a dietitian. It\u2019s not a race to see who graduates first. Talk to your counselors about transferring. Talk to the school you\u2019re interested in about admissions. The process is not that daunting. You can\u2019t know if nursing would be perfect for you until you get out of your current major.",
