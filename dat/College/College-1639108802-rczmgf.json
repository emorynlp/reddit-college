  "text": "Basically, its my 4th quarter in college, and I took only a physics and chemistry course that went way over my head and I failed to get a 2.0, I don't know what will happen, my handbook says I am going to get an academic warning, how will this affect my ability to transfer, how can I get back from this. I'm freaking the fuck out.  Mid quarter I switched my degree plan, but I was already enrolled, so I really didn't even need to take these classes.",
