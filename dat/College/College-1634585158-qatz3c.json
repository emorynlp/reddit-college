  "text": "I already kind of have an answer to my question, i just wanted to know if i was over- exaggerating the situation.\nSo, for a little background info, i am a female and my dorm neighbor is a male. i live in a two-room college apartment with another female. I live in between the two of them, if that makes sense. (i don\u2019t live with the male, i only live with the female, but the male is in the apartment beside me). So, here\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s doing but i can hear him from anywhere between 3-5am banging his bed against the wall. Our college apartment beds are really squeaky so i hear that also. It\u2019s constant banging and squeaking for an hour straight at different times, it can start anywhere between 3-5am, or even 8am. Today it happened at 2:30pm. It makes it really hard to sleep, even study. I want to make a complaint about it, because it\u2019s really uncomfortable for me to hear that all the time. I didn\u2019t know if it was dumb or not to file a complaint. Also, it can happen three to four times a week. You can imagine how angry i am when trying to sleep. Maybe once or twice i even banged on the wall to get him to quiet down, but that doesn\u2019t work. He just keeps doing it. I\u2019m not sure if he can even hear me banging. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up with him. I don\u2019t think i\u2019m a loud roommate. I barely talk and when i do i am quiet. I wanted to actually knock on their door and ask his roommates to get him to quiet down (because i don\u2019t know what the guy looks like) or talk to him directly. I didn\u2019t do it because of my safety, i was nervous of how he would possibly react. So, i guess there\u2019s two possible reasons for why i hear the loudest squeaking and banging on my wall so often. He\u2019s either a loud masturbator, or he just likes bouncing on the bed at odd times \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.",
