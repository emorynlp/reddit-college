  "text": "So I\u2019m a first year student. I\u2019m trying to get out of my room cuz my roommate is really weird and is just annoying to live with. I\u2019ve tried switching before but it wasn\u2019t successful. Is there a certain way I can change roommates?\n\nThe kid sleeps through all of his classes and overall just sleeps all day. Idk how. He\u2019s literally sleeping with his mask on right now. Idk what to do. Its giving me anxiety issues and him snoring doesn\u2019t help the fact that I have a hard time sleeping.",

      "text": "i totally understand ur pain my first semester freshman year i had a roommate who quite literally never left and she never showered. which, i felt bad, because quite frankly i feel like she was forced to live on campus when the girl obviously wasnt suited for communal living. **anyways** to answer your question. i\u2019d first email your RA and try to set up a meeting in person or over zoom. i did this and it failed in my case but this was during peak covid so they were doing no room switches literally zero exceptions regardless of circumstances. however, things are different this year so i think this is definitely beneficial. the RA is going to make you talk things out with your roommate first, though, so just be aware. in their eyes switching rooms is the last resort so you have to prove that you have tried everything.",

      "text": "He sounds like he\u2019s having some really serious problems, and he\u2019s not actively hurting you. If he snores, get earplugs or noise canceling headphones. You can\u2019t change roommates because you don\u2019t like them; that\u2019s not how it works. You can\u2019t call your RA and say what you just posted. They\u2019ll laugh you out of the room. Maybe you could get a job and move into an apartment? Sounds like maybe dorm living isn\u2019t for you. I sure couldn\u2019t do it.",
