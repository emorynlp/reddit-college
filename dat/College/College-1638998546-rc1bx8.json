  "title:": "How do people seem so confident in their major?",
  "text": "I am 28 and looking to go back to school. I am incredibly lucky to be able to have the opportunity, and I want to make the most of it. I have an A.A. in general studies, so it would not be a full 4 years. I constantly think about what I should go back to school for. Nothing seems like it's for me. I enjoy learning and experiencing new things, but I have not found anything that sticks out to me. I feel like a lot of people (I know not everyone) are so confident with their choice. I look at pathways for different programs and it seems like it's either careers that don't pay well/seem interesting, or majors that require more than a bachelor's (and I can't afford that). Maybe I'm setting up my own roadblocks. Sorry to write so much. Thank you for reading",

      "text": "Committing to a major is just easier for some people. It doesn't mean it's the \"best\" major for them, or that it checks all the boxes for what they want, but they just make a choice and stick with it until they change, graduate, or drop out. I don't think for most people there are perfect majors that will then lead to perfect career life because there are just way too many variables in life.\n\nPeople change careers all the time, and many people go back to college or get other kinds of education later in life. A graphic designer can become the Manager or Director of Art at a marketing firm, and someone who studies creative writing can go on to technical writing, marketing, publicity, newspaper/magazine work, or non-profit work. Pick whatever ticks most boxes, and go for it. I know someone who studied Art History and went on to become a successful Real Estate Agent.",

              "text": "Lots of us do! There's a bunch of research in Psychology that shows that people are generally terrible at predicting how they will feel or how satisfied they will be later in life once certain milestones (age, marriage) or goals (degrees, careers, salary minimums) are achieved. People are better at predicting how different processes will give them satisfaction, like studying certain majors over time or working in specific environments over time.\n\nThere are rates of \"buyer's remorse\" with any major, but this usually comes from people who have wild expectations for what a degree can do for them in terms of job placement, career satisfaction, and salary. Just have reasonable expectations for whatever you choose to study, and give yourself backup plans for career moves before you graduate. \n\nFor example, if you are banking on a degree in Creative Writing to turn you into a national bestseller, let's just say I hope you either have a second major OR you think you would also be happy getting a job that is common for creative writers to get (tech writing, Education, etc.).\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I think sometimes college major is given both too much and not enough weight in college decision making. For someone with my personality, I feel like I could have chosen any major and been happy because I just like feeling like I accomplished something at the end of the day. And as well, now I'm in my dream career that's sort of an in between niche, I realize that at least 4 different engineering disciplines could have got me here, plus a path with no college required (albeit a lot of experience instead).\n\nThat's my advice, focus on what kind of career you want to have (technical, people focused, desk job or active, etc), and then just get a degree that might take you that way. And then remember that lives are long and plans change so you can't make a perfect plan anyway.",

I have always defaulted to psych because I do find it rewarding to help people and make a difference in someone's life if they are struggling or need help. Not that I want to be a therapist but I still think I could find something worthwhile.",

Since we spend a nice chunk of our lives at work, I\u2019m just going for what I feel is time well spent. Initially, I went for money- and found out very quickly I\u2019m not made for science \ud83d\ude02 Consider your strengths, the classes you enjoy, and what kind of income you are realistically going to be content with. If it\u2019s mainly money you want, look at those careers and see if it\u2019s something you\u2019re good at depending on those general classes you took.",

              "text": "Ah yes. Psych field is what I\u2019m in :) if you\u2019re only wanting a bachelors in psychology and you\u2019re also wanting some money, research is a good route if you have some good research places by you or within your school. That has statistics involved but nothing super crazy, once you get it- you got it. Or you can go towards more people focused work and go through case management, care coordination, intake assessment at social work organizations or psychiatric hospitals (usually more hours, lower wages). I ended up in a graduate program for counseling- and after my masters is done without being licensed, the average salary is 45k lmfao I know down the road, private practice is where the money is at but if you work for a non profit for 10 years, they forgive your debt so that may be something to think about. I would be lying if I said I\u2019m 100% on my degree, since I\u2019m already 65k deep in debt lol but hey what\u2019s done is done now haha. I will say working on the field gave me lots of fulfillment and happiness. \n\n\nMy best friend also got a psych degree and went the recruiting business route and after 4 years is making 80k.",
