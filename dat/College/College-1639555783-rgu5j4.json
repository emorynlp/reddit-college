  "text": "These are my grades for my freshman year of college in the U.S. I\u2019m kind of sad that I was not able to get an A for one of my classes, I was 2% short and I failed my math class. Today marks my fourth month in the US and I\u2019m 19 years old from Pakistan living alone in an apartment. Everything here was very new for me and I\u2019m still learning a lot. I don\u2019t know if these are satisfactory grades, want to hear others opinions. I don\u2019t know how to feel about my results.",

If it makes you feel any better a common for American students to fail a couple of classes in their college career(Especially math)\n\nJust do not make F's grades common!\nJust reading this makes me think you are never going to get an F grade again in anything you do going forward!\n\nYou should feel proud of yourself! \nalmost 3 A's!",
