It seems like community college isn\u2019t a great place to make friends cause it\u2019s more of a commuter school. Any advice or suggestions? I\u2019m pretty much back to square 1 no idea what I want to major in. I feel like right now I have no idea where I\u2019m going. Taking a few online courses and only two in person classes.",

I met one of my really good friends and CC just by asking him about a quiz or hw. Ended up transferring with him to Uni and currently trying to follow him for work. Started talking about homework ended up talking about gaming and other stuff. So just chat with people and see where it goes.",
