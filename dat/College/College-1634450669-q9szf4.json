  "text": "Evening all,\n\nI was going through my classes for some reason tonight and noticed that I missed an entire module and quiz for my hybrid class. Now I did some basic math and these missed points would bring my grade down to an 89.4%. Now I know that this isnt necissarily bad, my mind is eating itself alive because of it. I can't focus on anything else. I feel so disappointed in myself. I have a job that is constantly taking up my free time, mental health issues, and my other classes eating up all of my spare time so it would only be natural that I forgot. I emailed my professor about it but the syllabus says that no late work will be accepted. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like if I don't have A's all the time then I'm a failure of some sort. I feel like I'm \"wasting money to not get an A.\" if that makes sense. I am extremely hard on myself and I just feel like an idiot for this. I don't know what to do.",

What would you tell them?\n\nThink about that, then consider the fact that you should at least be as nice to yourself as you should be to others. There's no need to be cruel to yourself. It's going to be a difficult habit to break. And if you need help breaking those habits your school probably has mental health resources available that you can use.",

I\u2019m just getting accepted to med schools etc and I even had to retake one of my labs cuz I took a nap in my car and missed the final(don\u2019t be that stupid plz). Make sure that u set up a plan to avoid this in the future, and move on, school is meant to be about learning. And if u are looking to do schooling after college, they look at u as a whole, not as a single missed assignment.",
