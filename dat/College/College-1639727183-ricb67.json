  "text": "edit: i stayed up to finish it. i was too scared to not wake up in time to submit it. submitted at 5:42 am. now my professor will probably think i\u2019m crazy lmao.\n\nanother edit: i got an 88% on the final, putting my final grade at a 94% :) \n\nso i have an online final, its been open all week and it\u2019s due tomorrow (well technically today) at noon. i started working on it earlier in the week and now i still need to finish some free response questions and then i\u2019ll be done with it. but i\u2019m debating whether or not i should stay up to get it done or if i should just wake up early tomorrow and finish it. i doubt that i\u2019ll wake up early so my initial thought was to go ahead and get it done tonight. but i\u2019m starting to get *really* tired.\n\n\ntl;dr: my last final is due at noon, debating whether or not i should stay up late to finish it or wake up early.",

There\u2019s no real right answer here, totally dependent on the person. If you\u2019re tired and can\u2019t work effectively, get sleep and slay in the morning.",
