      "text": "Different expectations, and different skills.\n\nI say different expectations because I had a good gpa, and also thought I had a great social life, but in the end a lot of people might not think so. I was heavily involved in one extracurricular activity, it was a club team so we practice two to three times a week and traveled four or five weekends a semester. I was active in a church group. I met dated and got married to my wife. But I didn't hang out with friends (besides studying) everyday, or even every week. It was really pretty mellow, most days I was on campus until 5:00 or 6:00, went home to eat something, and watch a show, play a video game, or go to my club activity.\n\nI also say different skills, because traditional School learning is a skill that not everybody has. Whether it's memorization, connecting concepts, actually being good at reading textbooks, or even just enjoying school, not everyone can do that. It's just something about the way they learn that fits in the system and it benefits them disproportionately. It's no different than someone who's naturally athletic being good at most sports, or someone cares mad at being able to make friends easily, we're just trying to think that school and GPA are the most important thing in our life until we turn 22 or 25 when in actuality it's not the be all end all.",

      "text": "Really good time management and/or naturally being able to work quickly. The people I see going out or being involved with a social scene plan ahead and bust ass to get things done early so they can go out when they want. Depending on the program, you can also get faster as you go along. Basically once you see what someone is looking for with an assignment or how to do the work, you can often find shortcuts and be really efficient that way. Have a pattern for both when you need things done and how to do them as quickly as possible, it gets way easier to plan extra stuff with friends without it cutting your GPA.",
