  "text": "Prompt:  Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose track of all time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe concept I want to talk about is chess endgame, and how the game is played in its final moments. My question is, is this a risky approach as someone who does not understand the fundamentals of chess will not be able to understand the points talked about?",
