  "text": "Hello, I am interested in enrolling at the University of Minnesota but I don\u2019t know what I should do in the next couple years to help increase my chances of being accepted (I\u2019m only a Junior in high school). I think the best way to go about it would be to talk to somebody from the school about it but I\u2019m lost as to how I can find them. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",
