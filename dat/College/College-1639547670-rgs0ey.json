  "title:": "I just failed my college thesis defense/dissertation because most of it was wrong, and my professor didnt warn me at all even tho he knew",
  "text": "Teacher = the person who helps you during a thesis so you do a good job, idk how to say it in English\n\nTLDR: I went to my presentation and did it perfectly, but the model I used for the data was wrong (which I wasn't aware of) and I didn't pass. My teacher never mentioned ANY of these flaws to me, and I feel scammed. \n\nDuring the semester I did all the progress needed and had multiple meeting with my teacher, where I showed him my work and asked multiple questions. \n\nToday, I did my presentation, I managed to swallow the nerves and explained everything clearly, and didn't stutter at all. I literally had a smile painted on my face because I was so proud. \n\nThe teachers however had a lot of criticism on the model I had used to process the data, saying it didn't make sense using said model with the sample I had picked, and that the sample size was too small. I replied to all of their questions as good as I could, but with the core of the presentation wrong the questions were short and most of the time was them criticizing it. \n\nAfter a short while they tell me I have failed, saying I didn't reply adequately and that the work done is bad. Thing is, after multiple meetings with my teacher and he didn't mention any of this, at any given time. I did everything he told me to do, and was so confident on my work because I did the extra on everything I could. \n\nI instantly call my teacher and tell him the bad news, almost waiting for an explanation on his part, but he tells me the equivalent of \"shit happens\", then I ask him if he knew what I did had plenty of mistakes or things that had to be fixed and he said yes. I wanted to ask him why the fuck did he not say anything then and made me send him my progress 4 times before today if he wasn't going to point out something as important as \"the core of your presentation is wrong\", but I was fuming so I just wrapped it up. \n\nYou have the chance to ask for them to reconsider the score but I have heard 99% of times they don't. \n\nI don't know what to do, even tho I know blaming someone for your failures is wrong but I legitimately think my teacher has all the fault for this. The worst part is that I admired him, for the past 5 years I have taken multiple classes with him and he always so patient, took the time to help you, explained everything as much as everyone needed. I thought it was a blessing to have him help me do my thesis but now idk. I'm praying that they reconsider but my confidence is crushed and I feel sad.\n\nPD: The model I used was based on a thesis for a masters degree, which is why I thought it was fine in the first place.",

We were one of the few groups who took this opportunity. He did point out some errors and we fixed them accordingly. But then during the project presentations that same professor grilled us a huge portion of our project that he didn\u2019t comment on earlier in front of the class. \n\nIt was really shitty of your teacher to do that. Is there anyone you can lodge a complaint with seeing as they didn\u2019t assist you like they should have? Otherwise, good luck on the thesis next semester. At least it should be easier the second time around.",

I mean, while this is never explicitly stated, why would any future committees take our advisees seriously if we have a reputation of approving inadequate work?",

In the master, and also PhD, thesis supervisor/advisor is the person who advise and help you with thesis, intimately know about your research and want you to be successful and give you their opinions about your research. You're not assigned a supervisor, you have to find your own supervisor from the professors in most situation (except in few countries with the PhD like Italy for example). The term \"thesis supervisor/PhD supervisor\" is used popularly in academia in many countries for both masters and PhDs, namely UK, Australia, NZ, Ireland, European countries.
