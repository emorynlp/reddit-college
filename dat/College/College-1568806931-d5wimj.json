  "title:": "Are Online Classes Supposed To Be This Bad?",
  "text": "It's my first year of college and I have three in real life classes and two online. The second one hasn't started yet but the first is Intro to Psych. I took it as a class in high school and it was my favorite. Now, with the online class, our entire course is just reading the textbook. Genuinely my entire syllabus is every week we read a chapter of the textbook and summarize it. Then we have to reply to two other students summaries with some kind of response even though we're all describing the same thing. She'll occasionally throw in a three page essay on a 15 minute video like Little Albert. Are online classes supposed to be this horrible? I literally paid this teacher like 300$ to scan my summaries weekly and grade them.",

I've switched majors so many times I can't keep count BUT one thing that has always been consistent is online classes being awful. They have double the amount of work a regular class and its mostly self taught. I myself of average intelligence. I am no means a genius so I NEED the information to be taught to me.\n\nI'm learning how do algorithms and stuff in my programming class(That is on campus) with some difficulty. Meanwhile my online Network and Security class is having me rethink my major again. You see, I have no problem committing but when its not sticking after 6+ hours of studying...well I don't know what to do :/.And the worse part about this? An overwhelming majority of my major consist of online courses.",

      "text": "Teaching an online class is actually a lot more difficult than teaching a traditional class, IF you want to achieve a reasonable teaching standard.\n\nIf you want to learn something, then do NOT take online sections. If you just need to jump through the hoop and get the credits, then take them online and do some busy work. \n\nOverall, online classes are BS. I've created one, and reviewed quite a few of them. None of them, including my own (intro to stats), are up to the same standard as regular classes. And I really did try to make mine as close as possible. I've shot videos of myself teaching and edited them. I've made video aids for the difficult topics. I also made videos explaining exam problems after they were graded. But it was still not good enough. I got a grant making that class, so I was under some pressure to make the class presentable. **Most others would simply fill each week with some boring busy works.**",

Quick grading, as in a reliance on multiple choice or other simplified subjects like summarization, over busy work is corruptive in my opinion to actual learning because you are forced to a singular perspective.\n\nThe discussion boards can be really something great and inviting when the professor can pose complex questions for subjects they are personally interested in.",

The first being that every student will eventually be forced to interact with a computer for another class in order to complete assignments and graduate. Prob and Stats is another Gen. Ed. course that makes liberal use of the student's ability to use Excel. So, it is my job to make sure that they are ready for that. I teach them about web browsing so that they can do research, submit assignments online, and be able to Email their professor if they have questions. I thought that knowing how to send/receive Email was a given in today's world, but it is amazing the lengths some people will go to just to avoid learning something that they think that they cannot do.  \n  The second is that literally any job that you can possibly think of will require some basic computing skills at some point. The university doesn't look good if their graduates come out of there not knowing how to fill out an online timesheet, use Email, or download a PDF of corporate policy.",

The average online class I have has multiple choice quizzes/exams, weekly posts + lectures from the professor, discussions where you post your response and have to reply to others, and maybe a project/paper or two. \n\nSince you said you want to be a therapist, it may have been wise to try and fit the class in with your IRL classes.

Actually, you might end up experiencing that too, brace yourself and appreciate those professors who are truly organized, focused, and interested in the subject they are teaching.",

      "text": "Yep, all my online classes have been like that, from middle school to college. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a waste of time. After a while, I started to get tired of sitting through lectures where the teacher reads off a power point and then gives us 15 minutes to discuss a concept in groups. For me online classes are worth it for the ability to structure my own time and focus on my own learning instead of following the pace set by a teacher for the benefit of the entire class. If you really like the topic, you\u2019re more than welcome to dive into it, but if you\u2019re just there for a quick A you can do it fast and easy.",

The big thing that helps make boring textbooks stick for me is outlining the chapter as I go, with an actual pencil and paper so I'm forced to slow down even more than I would typing. If I just try to read it I'll blast through it without taking too much time to consider what it's saying, which works alright if it's a history text and the most I'll ever have to do with it is write an essay, but not so much if it's a math or engineering text that's trying to teach some skill.\n\nOutlining it and, if it's math heavy, working through the example problems, forces me to slow down and actually absorb the material. I think iit could help you, too. Sounds like that's pretty much what your professor wants you to turn in, anyway, so there's no harm in trying.",
