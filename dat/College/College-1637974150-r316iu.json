  "title:": "Would it be a good idea to briefly relocate to a different country to avoid paying high USA college debt?",
  "text": "If I go to college in the USA I know I will never be able to pay 100% of my debt, so if I were to a college in a different country I theoretically only have to pay \"regular\" college prices, not the insane amount in the USA. Does anyone know if this is possible, and what are the logistics of this, and what countries would be a good choice?",

              "text": "Depends on what field and where the OP will go. Very few people in the US know much about foreign degrees, but \n\nIt seems that most degrees from the UK are at least reasonably respected in the US. Same with degrees from many other western European nations. Employers in the US most likely won't recognize the name, but they are still seen as legitimate degrees. I have had friends who went to universities in the UK, France, Spain, and Sweden and none seemed to have too much trouble. Perhaps universities in Ukraine aren't know about and a degree from there won't get you very far, but unless you travel too far afield in your studies it should be recognized in the US.",

      "text": "Yes this is possible but just because you go to school over seas and get a degree doesn\u2019t mean it will be accepted here. If you also don\u2019t plan on staying in the country you pick after graduation it\u2019s also kind of pointless. \n\nEx: if you pick Germany, all your new friends will be german, all your networking connections will be in Germany & your internship will also be in Germany or another European country. Coming back to America after this will put you at the bottom of the totem pole employment wise and you\u2019ll have to work your way up unless you go to a prestigious school like Oxford that has American connections. \n\nYou also need to take into consideration the financial factor. Moving your whole life to another country is expensive and you will likely see your family twice a year. \n\nI say none of this to discourage you, this is just the reality of it. I would\u2019ve loved to have gone to school in Europe but it\u2019s not directly obtainable and there\u2019s a lot of hoops to jump through. If you REALLY want to do this, then do it, but you need to research a lot and think about every aspect that will be affected beyond financial reasons.",
