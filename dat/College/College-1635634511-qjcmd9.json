  "text": "Currently a freshman in the US who wants to study abroad for a semester (or maybe even a year) sometime during my undergrad. Here are the options for my major:\n\n**Oceania**\n\n* Sydney or Newcastle, Australia\n* Auckland or Christchurch, New Zealand\n* Suva, Fiji\n\n**Africa**\n\n* Legon, Ghana\n* Gaborone, Botswana\n\n**Middle East**\n\n* Amman, Jordan\n* Rabat, Morocco\n\n**Europe**\n\n* Prague, Czech Republic\n* Barcelona or Madrid, Spain\n* Berlin, Germany\n* London, England\n* Stockholm, Sweden\n* Dublin, Ireland\n* Milan or Rome, Italy\n* Reykjavik, Iceland\n\n**Latin America**\n\n* Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* Quito, Ecuador\n\n**Asia**\n\n* Seoul, South Korea\n* Shanghai, China\n* Bangkok, Thailand\n\nThoughts? They all have a partnership program with the university. There are so many to choose from, I'm not really sure where to get started. My career goal is to be a patent attorney, if that helps in any way, and I really want to travel and experience a different culture while also being in college",

      "text": "If you want to travel and experience a different culture, then take a semester/year off and do that.\n\nStudy abroad can make sense for certain majors. If you're majoring in Art History, traveling Europe to experience the various art museums firsthand can be helpful.\n\nFor most STEM majors, a semester studying abroad is often tantamount to an expensive way to take the semester off. Due to the pre-requisite chains and degree requirements, your credits normally won't contribute much (if anything) to your degree.",
