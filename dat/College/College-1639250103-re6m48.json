  "text": "I attend a community college and have about 5 classes left before I graduate with an associates in businsess. I'm heavily considered dropping out because of overwhelming stress relating to school. I believe that I could teach myself more efficiently and effectively on my own, but I feel like I need a degree and want to experience graduate school some day.\n\nEarly in school I was considered \"gifted\" and skipped a grade but I failed almost every class in highschool and dropped out due to depression. In college I currently have a 3.9 GPA. Part of my stress comes from perfectionism and trying to maintain my GPA. This stresses me out because I feel like I need to maintain a high GPA if I want to transfer to a \"good\" college in the future. I feel like I missed my chance in high school. I never took the SAT. \n\nI already dropped out of college once due to stress. Now I have only been taking two classes a semester but still struggle with stress from school and the idea of graduating \"late\". For context I am nearly 25 and feel so far behind my peers. I've tried to break down the reasons for my stress as follows:\n\nMost of my classes have been taken digitally and my experience with them has been that the teachers are practically absent and it's as if the class is fully automated. We mainly read out of a textbook and then do exercises made by some learning company like Mcgraw Hill or Norton. We have weekly discussions where most students bullshit and write responses like \"I agree!\" as part of a participation grade. Students do not really reach out to each other, there are no study groups or anything like that. Powerpoints slides are pre-prepared by these companies and nearly every exam question is copy pasted from Google. I wish I was in an environment where the teachers and students were more active.\n\nWhen I don't understand something, there isn't anyone I can ask for help. Google isn't always reliable and for someone who doesn't understand the material figuring it out on your own can be a very long and frustrating process. Something that takes me an hour of googling could be answered in a few minutes by a teacher, and often what I find online doesn't match the format of my assignment. Most teachers write back by email in a few days, the response time is far too slow to learn effectively. \n\nI also don't like the way some information is presented and sometimes get stuck when I can't understand it. Because most lessons build on knowledge previously learned, this is a recipe for repeated frustration when I come across something requiring knowledge that I did not fully understand the first time.\n\nI'm also very disappointed in the level of organization of my teachers. It is very common for assignments to have incorect dates posted, typos, and missing submission links.\n\nI'm stuck and overwhelmed. I'm trying to hold out thinking that I might get a better education/learning experience at a better college but I don't know if that will be the case. \n\nWhat should I do?",

      "text": "Perfectionism doesn't just go away because college grades goes away. Work on it. Maybe have a goal to get 1-2 \"B\"s in your five last classes?\n\nA degree is necessary for so many careers. Not many employers are impressed by \"self-educated\" people unless you do something spectacular that only .0001% can do (or family is loaded $$$$).",
