  "title:": "Can I report a teacher for locking the zoom room a minute after class starts?",
  "text": "Okay. So one of my classes is at 9 AM on zoom, I attend it pretty diligently. I'm a pretty good student. Then one day the teacher decided that they wanted to make a rule in which if you came one minute after class started to the zoo....you would be absent and couldn't attend the entire hour and a half of class. Keep in mind that two absences means your dropped. So it starts at 9:00, & I came in at 9:01 one day because my internet was cutting out and the teacher decided to test that day & so I'm gonna get a zero on a test in which I can't take because I showed up at 9:01!! And I'm just frustrated because it's like I am a good student, & I can't take a test she told us about DURING class over being one minute late. And I can't even attend the class period! And I might get dropped because I might have missed two classes over being one minute late!!!\n\nSo my question is: Can I report this? Or shall I just bare it for the rest of the semester. I don't normally get this frustrated & I just don't want this to happen to anyone else in my class.",

This isn\u2019t in-person where you physically enter/exit the room. I\u2019d talk to that girl and then go back to him and say \u201chey we are gonna get higher ups involved if you keep acting like a fucking child.\u201d",

      "text": "> Can I report a teacher for locking the zoom room a minute after class starts?  \n\nWhat does the syllabus say the attendance / tardiness policy is?  \n\n> Then one day the teacher decided that they wanted to make a rule in which if you came one minute after class started to the zoo....you would be absent and couldn't attend the entire hour and a half of class.  \n\nAs a general concept, universities allow the professors to set their own attendance policies, and it would be uncommon for the university to force a professor to change how they manage their classrooms.  \n\n> So it starts at 9:00, & I came in at 9:01 one day because my internet was cutting out   \n\nThere is the root of the problem, right there.  \nYou failed to plan adequate time for such issues to avoid being late to class.  \n\nThis isn't a failure of your internet connectivity, it is a failure of your personal time management.  \n\n> I'm just frustrated because it's like I am a good student  \n\nYou are a good student who was late to class.  \n\n> I might get dropped because I might have missed two classes over being one minute late!  \n\nSometimes, the hardest lessons are the ones we learn from the most meaningfully.  \n\nDon't be late to class. It's pretty simple.  \n\n> Can I report this?  \n\nSure. You can file a complaint about anything if you want to.  \nJust don't expect there to be a significant change.  \nAgain, it would be uncommon for administration to tell a Professor how to manage their classroom.  \n\n> I don't normally get this frustrated & I just don't want this to happen to anyone else in my class.  \n\nIf you really want to help others, be sure to remind them to allow enough time to get logged into class before the cutoff.",
