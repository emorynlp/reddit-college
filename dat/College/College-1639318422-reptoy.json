  "text": "So I had an upper level bio lab report due and we had groups. I was flagged 34% plagiarism on turnitin but 80% of the stuff flagged were singular words like names of strains or yeast, the words \u201cthe\u201d, types of tests used, and results.\n\nI submitted 1.5 hours before it was due and most people submitted earlier that week.\nThey had plagiarism score of 10. Do you think it was because I submitted later so my paper got compared to my lab member\u2019s and other people in the class?\n\nI\u2019m pretty pissed bc my prof said above 20% is a meeting (not too worried about it jsut pretty pissed).\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?",

I definitely wouldn\u2019t worry if it is largely singular words. I can\u2019t imagine they would want to meet if this is the case, but if they do just calmly explain the situation.",

      "text": "Turnitin checks for text similarity, not plagiarism. As you've noted, a higher % score doesn't necessarily suggest plagiarism, especially in STEM courses, where a lot of your writing will be either technical phrases or species/strain names or straightforward statements of methods (there are only so many ways you can say \"We ran a PCR\"). If your submission has a higher than usual score, your prof will most likely look at the report, see that it mostly flagged mundane stuff, and move on. But even if they don't, you mention they said a higher score would trigger a meeting, so you could talk to them about it at that point.",
