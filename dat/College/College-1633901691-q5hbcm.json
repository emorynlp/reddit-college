  "text": "Hi there I\u2019m doing a Bachelor of Arts and majoring in geography (my school does a blended approach of both physical/human geography). \n\nI\u2019m looking for a minor that would compliment this major. I\u2019m currently looking at policy studies or political science. \n\nI\u2019m flexible with my career goals but something in either in an environmental or a non for profit field would be cool.",
