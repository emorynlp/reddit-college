  "text": "I hate admitting that I don\u2019t think college really was the best four years of my life. It was slightly better than high school but not enough tbh. I would the best thing about my college experience was that I was able to rush a sorority my junior year yet I wish I would\u2019ve at least started a year before. However, I couldn\u2019t do that because I was a transfer student. I feel kinda bitter that my experience didn\u2019t live up to my expectations and I\u2019m terrified of what my life is gonna look like after this chapter of my life. I was supposed to be graduating this semester but my graduation got cancelled because of the virus. I\u2019m trying to see the positives in the hardships I\u2019ve experienced but I\u2019ve really struggled. I\u2019ve dealt with fake friends and I cut them off even though it was really hard and I didn\u2019t meet decent people until I joined my sorority. I had a boyfriend for a year who was never really worth it and in retrospect I regret ever meeting him. And now that I\u2019m graduating I feel like \u201cmy time is running out\u201d and I feel myself getting older even though I\u2019m 22. I always tell myself that I have higher expectations for the rest of my life because high school and college weren\u2019t that amazing but I don\u2019t wanna be disappointed again. I feel lonely because I feel like I\u2019m the only one who feels this way. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

Why?\n\n- You'll never be surrounded by like-minded individuals who are around your age and with similar goals again.\n\n- It'll never be easier to make friends in your life. Not saying you can't make friends when you are older, it just becomes very difficult to do so. \n\n- You'll never be as carefree again. College is the last time you can act stupid/carelessly and face little consequence. Once you graduate, its time to grow up and be responsible, which sucks. \n\nIs College the best years of your life? I think so, but it depends on who you ask",

I feel like even if they could have been learned outside of college, it was a way to kind of expedite it. And, you get a feel for what academics are like, you have a degree which shows that you have \"well rounded knowledge\" and you found out that you cant expect too much out of anything when comparing your experience vs expectations :). I think its OK to make \"mistakes\" but I personally feel like I wouldn't regret my college experience for anything even though it was less than mediocre... It moulded me to the person I am today and taught me a lot even though i was suffering 90% of it. I feel like I've wasted my time but I've also grown enough to see that.",

If you do it right, you will grow as a person and leave college more mature. College isn't supposed to be the best time of your life, you still have 60 years of your life left.",

      "text": "I feel ya on lots of points. This whole notion of college being an absolutely fun 4 years is bS, I think its something that the media has projected onto us to believe. I am about to graduate at 24 and feel empty, sad and like a loser tbh (I did 2 gap years where I worked different jobs and tried to figure out what I was gonna do, before I entered college)\n\nOne of my close friends from high school has become a therapist and he gave me the following advice which has helped: Don't limit yourself and expectations to **age**. You are 22 and you got 8 years left in your 20s, you basically just saw 20% of your 20s, you really have so much ahead of you. Some people get married at 18, others do at 78. Everyone has a different path, the difficult thing is to accept your path and embrace it and really deal with the cards you are dealt. And that is reaaaally hard and what I am working on every day. Every day I gotta deal with the fact that things didn't turn out as I envisioned but it's not over!!\n\nYou don't have what you wanted but you got something else that is very valuable if you use it and that is **LIFE** **LESSONS**. You got lots of them now and now we gotta build everything off them and the outcome shall be everything we ever wanted!\n\nThat's the only advice I can give you and the only thought honestly that keeps me going is that we are still in our early 20s and we shouldn't judge now. When you climb a mountain for instance, you don't stop mid way and turn around saying: \"this is not how I imagined this climb, I thought its gonna be much better!\". No, you gotta keep going until you reach the peak and then you can judge. Then you'll see the view and I think its gonna be a good one.\n\nThats my mindset currently and it has helped. Let me know if it did for you",

Imagine how sad it would be if you really did peak in your 20s. You have so much time left to meet people, create meaning and enjoy life! We get so caught up in what people expect us to do (at least I do) that we lose touch with what the world outside those people looks like. Not everyone goes to college - some people don\u2019t want to, some people can\u2019t. Do those people all have shitty lives? No. I\u2019m sure some feel they missed out. But they had their own formative years and experiences that made them who they are. \n\nAlso, people who say college is the best time of your life think of college as when they were most free of responsibilities, only needed to worry about themselves, were more carefree and just hung out with friends. College has been fun but was definitely NOT carefree for me, there was so much work! Everyone\u2019s experience is different - this was yours. The best is yet to come.",

You are just taking a lot of classes to do Gen eds, and are just now leaving the nest and meeting new people. Remember, peoples experiences vary drastically. I knew a friend who lived with their parents, and rushed to finish their degree in less than 3 years. Yet, someone like me who is very privileged and changed majors midway, finished in over 4 years (4 and a half). By my 3rd year I had a lot less friends (lots graduated, transferred, or just stopped talking and became more introverted themselves). I was just really trying to finish fast because I wanted to get out. I was tired of the classes, constant papers, stress of maintaining an OK GPA, I missed home, etc... I started off my college life, partying, going to every event in campus, focusing hardcore, and meeting new people every day.  It was a giant step in freedom compared to high school, and I think thats why people associate college as such an exciting time. \n\n My last year was kind of miserable, I had less friends (barely any tbh) I was just done with it all. I wanted to go into the next chapter of my life and I'm glad I was able to finish.  I'm not saying college is overrated, but after college most humans have 45+ years left of life; is it really those measly 4 years that one should consider the best? Idk about you, but having money, some sort of stability and still being young is a pretty good time. (I just graduated and am 24 right now)",

      "text": "Honestly, I had a rough time with these thoughts when I first came to college. I put too much pressure on myself to have the best four years of my life, and I had less fun in the beginning as a result. I put too much pressure on myself both academically and socially, and I compared myself to others way too much. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my freshman and sophomore years still had a lot of good moments. \n\nBut, I had some rough times adjusting both academically and socially. I didn\u2019t even know what I wanted to do in life after I graduated. I tried to succeed on the debate team, but I struggled to integrate myself socially and I had feelings I wasn\u2019t smart enough to be as good as the other debaters. As a shy introvert, I ended up not fitting in with the rest of the team who was outspoken since I was always talked over and I ended up quitting the team summer before sophomore year. I stayed up late countless nights working hard on difficult assignments and studying, trying to prove I was like the other honors college kids. I even gained and lost a few friendships along the way. Basically, I was lost as hell, but I found my way eventually.\n\nAs a current senior, I would say my college years have been the best despite the initial difficulties I have had adjusting. I went to my first party second semester of junior year. I found clubs that were more suitable for me and my personality. I made the solid friend group that I have always dreamed about since childhood, but I didn\u2019t meet a single person in that friend group until the beginning of my junior year while volunteering at a church. I never had any internships while I was in college, but I still landed a job in my field last month after 70+ rejections and a bunch of hard work. That being said, I still think the best years are yet to come. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say, is don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself when it comes to anything in life. The time will come when it comes, and you\u2019re better off just going at your own pace when it comes to life and figuring out what it is that YOU want, not what OTHERS want. Live your own life, don\u2019t live another person\u2019s life. I might be making half (or maybe even a third) of what some more successful students in my major are making, but quite frankly, I don\u2019t give a shit. Why? Well, I\u2019m making way more than enough to pay the bills and I\u2019m still making more than both of my parents have ever made in their careers straight out of college, AND it\u2019s in my desired field. Also, that dreaded job search is finally over (fuck the job search, especially when you have no internships...if you can, for the love of God Almighty, at least try to get an internship) and I finally got an opportunity to get my foot in the door. Now I\u2019m ready to get after it when I have my first day in late June.\n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t worry about it. Just go at your own pace, and figure out what it is that you want in life. Try not to get caught in the trap of trying to live your life in a way that satisfies others, but not yourself. Lastly, I cannot stress this enough: take your time in life. It\u2019s a marathon, not a goddamn sprint. It\u2019s okay if you stumble once or maybe even a few times. You\u2019ll get to where you want to be in time.",

In a weird way, high school and now college have become a universal enough experience that can be used to fill in that blank. Everyone I\u2019ve talked to says college was the best time because of either partying and/or the freedom. No one tends to focus on the late nights or the stress or dealing with crappy professors. \n\nA friend of mine did a really cool biking trip across the country a little while back. She told me she misses it and would do it again, but acknowledges the stress leading up to it. The experience was so great, she says that she tends to romanticize it. I think a lot of people do that with college and high school. They want to focus on the highs, not the lows. \n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s okay if those years weren\u2019t perfect. I understand the nerves. Just keep in mind that you have a whole future ahead of you. Maybe think about what you want to do or accomplish.",

You'll meet people out in the real world by doing the things you are interested in whether that's sports, book clubs, dancing, whatever. You'll have even more freedom, and having a paycheck is amazing. I found dating in college awful because of how pervasive hookup culture is but out of school I found a wonderful guy who I now live with.  As someone reaching almost 30, that feeling of time speeding up and passing faster is real, but I dont think any time, even time that was unhappy is wasted if you learned so.ething even if that something is what you don't want. There is no pressure to have done anything during college and you havent missed anything. If you want to go party, i know some 35 year old who party harder than anyone. If anything you have more money to go wild when you're older. If it's something like study abroad, you can just freaking go anywhere! (Once quarantine is over). If you regret what you studied and want to do something else or have no idea what you want to do, that's ok. I've been through three careers already and each one I've gotten closer to what I want until I am now about to graduate with a masters and get my dream job even though, 5 years ago I had no idea what that was. Just never stop working hard for what you want and it might take more time and you might change your mind but with every step you get a little closer.  \n\nWhat you're feeling sounds like the quarter-life crisis slump. So many people I know have gone through this. Suddenly you are out of school and there is no longer a defined path to follow and there is so much pressure to \"reach your potential\" as you are suddenly faced with the realization that success might not be what you thought it was and the reality of what you thought you wanted might not be your favorite. On top of that you begin questioning everything you've ever done wondering if you did enough.  Its stressful! And to go though this is the middle of a pandemic? That fricken sucks.   But dont worry! You've got this! You got out of the experience what seemed best at the time and that's all you could ask for! Nothing in life is final and this isnt the end. You have forever to do whatever you want.  You got this!\n\nTLDR; This is a super stressful time in life for everyone but you havent done anything wrong and you have infinite options going forward! Work hard and you'll figure it out.  \n\nPS. PM me if you want to chat! I've been through everything! Haha",

Also, regardless of what people say, college is extremely cliquey and high-schoolish and I'm ready to get out of that world, though I'm sure it will still persist in some ways. I think that the people who had the best 4 years of their life in college are the ones who took on useless/easy majors and partied every other night. Then when they graduated there was that \"oh fuck\" moment when they realized that they just wasted 4 years of their life essentially doing nothing when they could have been working towards some sort of higher goal.

      "text": "Honestly, I wouldn't buy into that whole thing of making college an \"all or nothing\" scenario. I found that the few close friendships I've made were infinitely better than the big parties. I was also a transfer student and really felt like my community college days were more substantive than university ever was. I feel like the pressure to make memories is actually what kept me from making memories.  \n\n\n Sure, I've cobbled together quite a few fun and bizarre \"college stories\", but the best memories I got from college were all simple things. DnD on Friday nights with my pals or sitting around our Community College's lounge area. The more I broadened my social circle, I'm finding my closest friends are people who don't even go to my university or sometimes college in general. I feel like, even though I'm wrapping up my initial college years, my social life is finally just beginning. The more I look at my school's Barstool Instagram page, the more vapid the people seem (or maybe I'm just getting old @ 22, who knows).   \n\n\nI feel like I'm still in the same boat as you a bit. I transferred to a state school and sorta felt like I should join 15 clubs or do a semester abroad. I've only made like 2 friends from my new university, but that's honestly okay. But you gotta think, should I be sad that I didn't peak at 22? We still got our whole lives ahead of us and no amount of toga parties/Spring Breaks in PCB/kegs of cheap beer can change that fact. Finding meaningful relationships and experiences doesn't have to be connected to an overpriced institution.   \n\n\nAlso, consider this fact: We don't gotta pay for our cap/gowns and grad parties! (Okay, still a tiny bit salty about graduation getting cancelled)",

I definitely feel this way sometimes, especially thinking of the times I had chances to go out and have great experiences but stayed in my room for one reason or another. I'm very grateful for my college experience though because I do feel like I grew a lot as a person, getting to know who I am and all. You've probably grown a lot too and you just haven't realized it yet. Cutting off fake friends is definitely a sign of someone who has grown up a little. \n\nI used to believe that college HAS to be the best four years of your life otherwise you're wasting it, but somewhere along the line I started thinking that any point of your life can be the best. I know that probably sounds super cheesy, but seriously, you can make everyday better than the one before if you really want to. \n\nIf it helps at all, try not to think about making your entire life after college absolutely amazing, because if something bad happens, it'll be easy to get thrown off. Just try to make the best of each day and gradually work towards a better life - whatever you think that may be for you. \n\nAlso, definitely take some time after graduation (if you can) to just sit back and reflect on the past four years. Maybe there's more good in there than you thought. Hope this helps!",

          "text": ">major in something stupid, join a fraternity/sorority, and party five days a week.\n\nWell I'm in a fraternity yet I am very far away from the other two things. Your assertion only holds with certain people in specific fraternities. Some friend groups are great and others suck. Fraternities are a friend group too so the same principle can be applied somewhat consistently. Whether FSL provides benefit or harm largely depends on your personality and the actual group of people in the organization.\n\n>If it gets better during college, that\u2019s great, but not the main purpose.\n\nYeah I'll buy into parts of this. Overall, though, you should definitely be seeing some changes if you reflect on yourself at the start vs. end of college. If we are talking in terms of self-development, college years are pretty good years for most people. It really depends on how you measure \"best years\". Money, contribution to society, happiness, etc. Because college can often be the best years for self-development but the worst for money or professional development (i.e. most don't make a million dollars or have their largest professional success during college).",

Looking back, I wish I was able to focus more on schoolwork and less about the logistics of just being in college. It thickened my skin though and I can confidently approach those sorts of issues in real adulthood pretty well.",

I remember when a classmate of mine broke down after she found out her counselor had put her in a class that wasn't even for her major or a prerequisite for it. She ended up wasting 5k and had to stay for another semester to get her degree, and the school blamed her for the mistake even though her counselor and \"guidance\" coach both pressured her to take the class. Shitty financial aid, inconsistent counseling, and schoolwork combined is what I'd define the college experience at my school.",

I was surrounded by really intellectual people who were really passionate about their studies and it was enjoyable to have a discussion about history, poli sci, literature, creative writing, engineering projects with these people.\n2. I was surrounded by people my age who generally have the same overall interests and life goals as me. It's really hard to find this environment once you leave college.\n3. My friends lived next to me and I could hang out with them whenever, wherever. Now my friends live in different cities and different states. Instead of seeing each other every other day, we now see each other annually or bi-annually.\n4. My life is now structured 9 - 6 PM sitting at a desk where my only free time is the limited hours I have on a weeknight and weekend. In college, it felt like I had all the free time in the world. Yes, I had classes and I needed to study, but I could choose my schedule. I could go to the gym and play basketball with my friends, get some lunch, play some DOTA, get some work done during the afternoon, and then spend my evening at the beach. I wasn't constricted by corporate America's 40 hour work week schedule.",

There are certainly things I will miss about college like living within 10 minutes of all my friends, going out, having three weeks off in the Summer, and living in the same town as my boyfriend. I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say I am sad this phase of my life is over, but it serves me no purpose to think this will be the best four years of my life.  \n\nI have to think of new things to look forward to now. It is nice to not have anxiety about a different exam or project every week and I won\u2019t feel like a loser for skipping out on a couple parties to watch Hulu by myself. Most importantly I\u2019m excited to see what my life will become since the first time in 16 years I don\u2019t have the structure of going to class. The friendships that are meant to last from my undergrad will, but I think \u2018real adult\u2019 life is a great time to connect more with your family and focus on a romantic relationship of that\u2019s something you want. As I get older I anticipate being able to drive a car less than 10 years old, leaving the country, and maybe having a child one day. I think as you age different things excite you. Maybe there\u2019s some people a few years out who can tell you what pleasant surprises post grad life has in store. \n\nSo many people tell graduating high school seniors to not cling to their high school friends/ hometown because you won\u2019t be able to make the most of your new life. I think the same thing can be said for college. There is a lot I could have done differently but thinking about that and trying to extend those year/ make them better doesn\u2019t serve any purpose. Who you were in college doesn\u2019t define who you are going to be wether your college years were good or bad \ud83d\ude42\n\nI\u2019m sorry your graduation is cancelled, best of luck in whatever your future holds!",
