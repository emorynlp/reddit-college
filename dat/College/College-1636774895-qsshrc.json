  "text": "So I'm gonna start broadcast media next semester and I wanted to know what is a good camera or camcorder to use for a field such as this? I would like something under $1000 but if something is said 1,100 or 1,200 I can swing it. I would like to mainly use it for video but if the rare time I need to take some photos that's where a camera can also come in handy but it's mainly going to do video. Any good suggestions?",
