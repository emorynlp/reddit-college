  "text": "I'm just doing some research for a project about if people have too much reading to do and how do they deal with this problem? \n\nSpecifically it would be amazing to know what's the hardest thing about having too much reading to do? \n\nWhat did you do the last time that you felt like you had too much stuff to do? \n\nHave you guys tried anything to deal with this yet? \n\nOut of the things you did try what did you find to be not good enough about those solutions? \n\nThank you so much for your help!",

There\u2019s not enough time in the day to read multiple hours a week for multiple classes and keep my sanity. So I literally just do not read. At all. Ever. If it\u2019s not on YouTube or in the class notes I\u2019m not touching it",

      "text": "So fun thing about some classes like one I took on positive leadership in psychology. We had writing exercises I did none of the reading but I knew what chapters to reference for the questions and did amazing on all except the 1st one. \n\nSame with my abnormal psychology class I didn't read anything except what was necessary to reference for discussions online. \n\nIf you know what pages the material is on and how to explain your thoughts and ideas you may not have to read the whole textbook.",
