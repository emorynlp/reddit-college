  "text": "Hello everyone, I am currently a Junior at Grand Valley State University majoring in Computer Science. I have year and a half left before I graduate in May of 2023. I need some honest input on some classes that I have failed and need to retake and whether I should push them back or take them right now. \n\nI have failed 2 classes so far while in college. One of them was my database class which in all honesty wasn\u2019t my fault because I had COVID and it was really bad. I was bed ridden for a whole week and the Professor didn\u2019t let me submit any late work which was enough in one week to fail the class. The other class I failed was called Computer Organization and Assembly Language. This class was brutal in every way because the class was just way too hard and it was impossible to know what would be on exams as the homework questions had literally nothing to do with what was on the actual exam. \n\nI\u2019m debating whether to take them later towards the end of my college career or take them next semester. What should I do? What would you do if you were in my situation?",
