      "text": "I won't say what school I am, it's just in Tennesee. I transfered from my old school because at the school I was at all scholarships went to tuition but not fees or housing. So I transfered schools under the logic, \"even if I don't get any financial aid it'll be cheaper\" The campus is also more social and welcoming as well. The campus I was on wasn't very diverse, upper middle class to wealthy people. Didn't know how to interact with then as I am very much not rich and can't afford to hang out with them like they did. Just go to pricy coffee shops and stuff like that.\nIn all I'm happy. I used to cry because the housing was crappy but so ungodly expensive and the fees raised the tuition by about 1500 dollars.",

          "text": "wow I appreciate your comment , and I\u2019ve actually learned something new that I unfortunately didn\u2019t know before seeing your comment. I didn\u2019t know different school scholarships money goes towards different things so maybe now I\u2019ll keep that in mind . Also that\u2019s something of my concern\u2019s too, which is that the school I want to attend values and has a great social environment. I plan to network and meet new friends or future likeminded people as well.",
