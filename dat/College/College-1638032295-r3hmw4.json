  "text": "Depending on your school, there are different services available towards helping students achieve success. Please don\u2019t be scared to ask for help if you need it, it\u2019s ok to struggle, and it\u2019s possible to get better. This is one thing I would have told my younger self, while I was in college. You might fail, but that does not mean you are a failure. You will get to where you need to be.",
