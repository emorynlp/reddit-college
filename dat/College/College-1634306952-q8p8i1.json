  "text": "Hi all! I\u2019ve always wanted to be an alumni of a particular university (To save people from making comments about liking or not liking the university, I won\u2019t say a name). Because I\u2019m out of state, I would have to do an online program. They has an online Graduate Certificate that\u2019s only 15 credit hours that I would be interested in. However, I called the university and they said they do not consider those with certificates as an alumni. Would it be worth it to get the certificate if the university itself doesn\u2019t consider me an alumni? I could still say I went to the university. Just curious on other\u2019s thoughts.\n\nUpdate for more info: I already have a Bachelors and a Masters degree.",

      "text": "Taking classes for your own growth is fine, doing it so you can use a title won't actually impress people. It may actually make them think less of you unless you are really honest that you have a certificate from this school, not an actual degree. Socially, when you say you went to a school, people will ask what year you graduated, or talk about locations on campus they are familiar with. You wouldn't have those shared experiences to continue the conversation and it would become really awkward. Professionally I think it would be a mistake, as well. Tyra Banks is incredibly successful, but when she referred to herself as Harvard Alumni when she actually took a 9-week business course it actually drew attention away from her accomplishments. Taking classes for your own growth is a great thing, but just I don't see much benefit if you are just trying to claim connection to the name of a school.",
