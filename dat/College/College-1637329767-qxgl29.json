It's unforgiving.\n\nThat being said, $5 says OP is the world's most boring troll. I'd bet more but we are in the month of idiots realizing you don't just pay for a degree...",

      "text": "Ok, here's what you do: \nSchedule an appointment for one using office hours to talk about your grade.  Then meet with the instructor, and recreate the scene in fight club. And promise to not press charges if the give you an A.\n\nOk since you'll have a hard time getting the administration to believe that 3-4 of the staff of academics are violent malcontents and that YOU just so happen to be unfortunate enough to get all 3 in one semester, here's what you do next:\n\nFind which ever one has an adult child, start dating said child, orchestrate a \"meet the parent\" kind of dinner. Shock the instructor when you walk in. Since I assume that you're probably not a parents ideal suitor for their child, the instructor will strongly want you to not be associated with their child. Offer to stop seeing the child if you get an A. You only have 3 weeks left, so timing is delicate. Start now.\n\nTwo instructors down friend, here's how you handle the next one.\n\nGo to class, schedule an appointment with said instructor. Bring a vile of Bothrops Jararaca venom-its a type of viper indigenous to South America, the venom is available for sale at any local apothecary- and a syringe. Inject the instructor with the venom-filled syringe. Offer the antidote if you are given an A. If they say yes, then you are good. If they say no, then let them pass and claim emotional distress from the instructors passing  to get the class dropped from your record.\n\nVariants of these techniques got me where I am today, about to graduate and get into my dream masters program. So hope this helps.",
