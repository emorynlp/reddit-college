  "title:": "A friend recommended i post what's wrong with the American College system based off my experiences",
  "text": "tldr; american college system is beyond broken and for 63,000 dollars you can attend two state school and a private university for a semester to earn a bachelors and associates in 6 years while administration does everything in their power to prevent it and slow you down.\n\nTo lead off; This post is going to be a long one, I am going to work to give as much information as I can to share my experience with the American College system.\n\nI started at a community college studying IT, got my AAS and chose to continue my education and went to my dream school, a private college to receive a great education. It didnt work out after a semester and I transferred back home to a state school, which gave my a grief about registering a week before classes (which originally wasn't an issue) and once again applied to the local state commuter school. Yes it was all last minute but at the time the college worked it all out.\n\nNow i have applied and been accepted to 4 schools, attended 3 of them. I attended the community college for 3 years as some misguidance from an advisor ended up adding an extra year, which was whatever. I went to the private school figuring i had to do 4 years not knowing that they took some transfer credits and none of the others that would've knocked off half the major because my advisor didn't know what they were doing. Which at the time didnt matter because i already was accepted to my next school I was planning to attend.\n\nThis one will be short, I was accepted to a state school, after talking with an advisor they tried telling me it would take 3 years to finish a bachelors after already having an associated and around 80 credits (I understand colleges have different course requirements and require certain amounts to be taken at school but this did not sound right). So i applied to my local commuter state school.\n\nI was accepted on a conditional acceptance as getting my paperwork sent from all my former schools was taking longer then we had before the semester started (about a week). Yes this was all last minute but admissions was working with me. I was studying cyber security and mislead on the program from admissions. From what I thought off the program outline and told by admissions, it would be a great program, spoiler, its not.\n\nI was admitted and began in the spring of 2020 at my current school. I came in with 80 credits, the majority were in the field so i was hopeful they would transfer (especially since 68 of the other local state school). I was told all my transfer credits where applied and it only covered 10 classes, which is a good amount but still left almost an entire degree for me to take. i sucked it up and registered with the department chair for classes. he told me to come back the first day of classes to follow up and see how it goes.\n\nnow this is where the never ending issues begin: the school has to programs stemmed off of cyber security, one is theory based and one is technical which i wanted to study, he registered me for the wrong major. which now left me needed to register for full classes the first day of classes and from the start left me behind schedule.\n\ni made due with it. i was required to take sciences which i had never taken, higher level math and an arts class. i had never taken this so i understood it. but when i was required to take classes that i already had taken but my transfer credits wouldn't be accepted it confused me. i asked again and was told there was nothing that could be done and i need to take them.\n\nSince spring of 2020, I have taken classes year round to cover the ridiculous amount of classes i was required to take. in 8 semester (2 winter and 3 summer session) i have taken 18 classes for 72 credits. My major requires 121 credits for graduation.\n\nAs i began talking with classmates in my program i learned many of them also transferred in during the same time as they left their original college because of covid or other reasons. so now the majority of my major which is around 80 students are all off the set schedule for taking classes (this ties in later).\n\nsince the program falls under electrical engineering, it required a semester of 3 electrical engineering classes which are pre reqs to cyber sec classes. we all did it but once again are off track for where we should be.\n\nnow being held back from registering for classes since pre reqs are always in the way, i cant take classes that i have already taken because my transfer credits dont count.\n\nfast forward, i begin taking major classes and learn every professor is an adjunct and none have any cyber security background, or a concept of it. I know adjuncts are common but i feel this was ridiculous since none of them knew how to teach what they were supposed to. when the professor is so unsure what they are talking about it makes you wonder how you ended up where you did.\n\nI have at this time found out the sham of a program the college is running and decided to talk with the program chair. he saw no issue with it. classes are remote and since no one i spoke to wanted to help we continued on (this was fall of 20). now in spring of 21, we were still fully remote and really seeing how bad things where. none of the profs knew what they were doing and none of the admins cared.\n\nnow working to graduate i begin reaching out to the chair and other admins to figure out what can be done so classes not offered for students that need them can be ran so we can graduate. after a back and forth of months, a week before this semester, they decided to run them.\n\nsince the beginning of the semester, it has been nothing but issues and no one helps or has answers. after being fed up not learning, not having classes ran that are needed and beginning to worry about graduation i escalated my concerns to the dean of the school that handled my program. her response was she would check into it, a week later said she talked to the prof and that was last i heard. i followed up a month later to see if anything further has happened and got a sit down meeting with her to discuss the never ending issues with the program.\n\nsince i transferred i learned that the program offers next to know value, the professors dont know what they are trying to teach, the classes required dont make sense for the program and are missing out on ones that should be offered that are for another program as well as lab equipment older then me and doesnt function. after airing out all that i have found she said she would work on it but at the end of the day its up to the higher ups and nothing will change because they only care about money.\n\nthe dean had no real solution other then all the hard work i put in will benefit me when i get a job and will make up for what i didnt learn with what i learn on the job. just the answer i wanted to hear.\n\nmy final semester is supposed to be 7 classes for 19 credits. the dean got an advisor to figure out everything i need and she starts with well your a credit over the limit, so a 3 credit classes required is what will hold me back? no the class that i spent the semester discussing with the professors running it will since administration cant figure out how to run it. i gave them the plan but since i dont make 6 figures it doesn't work.\n\nafter back and forth for months, admins cant figure out how to run classes at decent times and only can at night because we cant get professors to teach during the day because they have day jobs. we cant hire professors with knowledge on what their supposed to teach because their expensive. we cant have working lab equipment because its expensive.\n\nfinally the solution i was given is that my transfer classes will suddenly count 3 years later and cover the class needed to graduate that administration cant figure out how to run. i think i have created such a problem that they just dont want to deal with me anymore. i didnt ask for anything unreasonable just the education i paid for.\n\nI will include a table breaking down classes and paid amounts for more visual demonstration,\n\nSuffolk County Community College\n\n|Number of Credits|Cost Per Credit ($)|Total Cost|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|79|200.0|$15,800|\n\nUniversity of Tampa\n\n|Number of Credits|Cost Per Credit ($)|Total Cost|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|16|596|$9,536|\n\nFarmingdale State College\n\n|Number of Credits|Cost Per Credit ($)|Total Cost|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|72|303|$21,816|\n\nThese tables excludes the cost of books, room and board, and the additional fees it costs to attend, if i was to factor these in i would say it adds close to $15,000 more.\n\nso it costs about 62,152 dollars to obtain a associates and bachelors degree in the United States depending on where you study. It also costs around 25,000 dollars to attend a school where no one cares about you and doesnt offer any support to get your degree.\n\nThis post has been long and is mainly me noting my experience at just my current school as it has had the most issues. this may seem like me shitting on my school and it is. Since it will be asked why i didnt transfer, it was not an option. no other 4 year school in my area offers a program and if i went to another school there was no guarantee my credits would transfer again and i wouldn't have to add another year to my education (which was not an option).",

This sounds like a rant against bureaucracy rather than critique of the university system.\n\nHonestly, you seem to expect colleges to serve your needs rather than you taking initiative and navigating the system to serve yourself.",
