  "text": "I was valedictorian of a class of over 400 in high school.\nFor my first 2 years I maintained a college GPA of 3.8\n\nNow I just lost all of my motivation. Fuck turning in assignments, studying for tests, attending lectures. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s all online now? I just have no motivation to do any of it, I hate it so much, when I used to be just fine with it. Could be my medications that have changed my outlook idk.\n\nI\u2019m about to talk to one of my parents about the situation and it\u2019s gonna be super draining. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve changed so much for the worse.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the kind words and help! My talk with my parents went much better than expected, and will likely be taking next semester off to help out.",

A friend I played tennis with went from Valedictorian to college drop out. \n\nHe was on full scholarships but I think he had to drop out cause failing classes voided those scholarships which paid for his school. Another girl in my school district took her own life after being Val and getting into Stanford.\n\nIn both cases they had some really bad mental problems and you should seek help so things don\u2019t get worse. I\u2019m just trying to say it can be a lot worse than failing a semester and your mental health is more important. Like some others said maybe get therapy because it helps for a lot of people.\n\nI wish you the best",

Online classes are tough for people that don\u2019t actually give a shit about grades but genuinely want to learn and receive feedback. Why the fuck would I spend 8 hours on a lab report if I\u2019m just going to get a grade back and no explanation as to what I did wrong or how to improve? \n\nI\u2019ve gotten pretty close with my physics professor this semester (he\u2019s 90 years old lol) just because I\u2019ve been telling him how fucking stupid online learning is for some people. According to him, places will look past your GPA this past year if you explain that it was not for you and blah blah blah. Apparently a lot of grad schools are seriously considering giving applicants the option of including this year in their gpa or not.\n\nAlso, fuck your parents man, they may very well be great people just as mine are but my biggest fulfillment and success in school came when I realized this is all me. My parents want me to succeed yes but if I do bad I\u2019m the one that ultimately has to deal with it. On the other side of the coin, If I do good I am the one that gets the benefits. I dropped out of college at 21 and was a life guard in Hawaii/South Carolina for a couple years and my parents stopped caring about what I was doing. This released so much pressure on me and I was able to do a lot better on school while enjoying it more and being stressed less. Obviously I don\u2019t know you or your relationship with your parents though so your mileage may vary.",

In two or three colleges I've found, and entire semester of grades can be wiped when there are problems like yours. Please call a counselor right away as this stops being a possibility fast. \n\nMy brother got to where you are but insisted he could make it thru finals. Mom was really worried he'd hurt himself. He ended up with a gpa below 1 and took off a year. He could have gotten a compassionate withdrawal had he known. He was visibly depressed, not having showered in a while, not changing clothes, and goodness knows what else. The RA yelled at him for smelling for about 3 hours one night before and exam and my brother was so defeated he just stood there and took it. \n\nI am so glad you talked to your parents. Mine were really sweet to my brother. They told us all when we left for college that we couldn't come back, but when they saw what my brother went through they took care of him. I know you'll get better too. My brother started working on some open enrollment classes and then got a part time job and should graduate next year and has made it into the dean's list.

For me, it's limited to getting final papers (i.e. those due right before final exams open). I've had no trouble getting smaller weekly assignments done throughout the semester, but when it comes to term papers/projects, I just can't bring myself to do them. I feel awful about it, but I feel mentally exhausted from all the research I've had to do to attempt to get them done.\n\nI wish my school had the option to allow professors to post syllabi (or just a general list of assignments) in course listing/scheduling portals so that students can have an idea of the load of coursework they'll be taking on (especially as they get to be juniors/seniors) as they schedule classes so that they don't overwhelm themselves later on.

      "text": "I'm in the exact same boat. I just can't dredge up any motivation to study, mainly because my exams this semester are [expletive] insane. They're odd in ways I've never encountered before. \n\nLike, one class is this easy A, everything open notes civ course. You can save and finish assignments later, flip back through the slides on worksheets, whatever. When I say everything is open notes, I mean everything. The final isn't.\n\nOther two classes: one is run by a well meaning but unintentionally sociopathic professor that doesn't understand what is an appropriate level of coursework for a 101 class. I've already taken 3-400 level classes; the only reason I'm back in a 101 is due to scheduling and needing it to check a box. My upper level courses in the same field were vastly easier. I cannot understand how he's going to format the exam (which is of course on Friday) because he's trying to have us memorize so much niche content I'm overloaded. Second class is run by a prof that does cutting edge research and is insanely important to the field, but is horrific at teaching. Listening to her ramble about nothing for five minutes is when class is good. Her trying to explain the exam was 1.5 hours of utter incoherence. Idk what I'm supposed to be doing there. I'll probably crash and burn on both. \n\nMy other two exams are for a Russian language course where they dropped a new case on us last minute and a Soviet history course by a notoriously difficult professor which will ironically probably be the easiest. \n\nOn top of it all, I got rejected for an on campus job this fall, just like every other time I've tried to apply for anything. I have a week to decide if I want to continue in my program; if I don't, I lose application access to a study abroad scholarship, which with my luck I wouldn't have gotten anyway, but would really be the only way for me to afford it. I need to study for my exams but when I try I get physically ill out of frustration and anger. My memory is shot from depression and there is no way I can remember even half of what I need to. And if my GPA gets tanked from these exams, I lose scholarship money I need to stay enrolled. I genuinely just want to live at home with my parents and my dog again at this point.\n\nSorry for the rant. It's been a crappy week and is only looking to get worse. I have precious few places I can vent and I needed to talk about this somewhere; an anonymous internet forum is the best place as any.",

That being said: \n\nCouseling in school is free for student. I just started a month ago and it helps so much. Someone to talk to that is unbiased and challenges your thinking. \n\nBurnout is normal think ab how long you\u2019ve been in school without a break! It\u2019s normal!\n\nFind ways to implement self care and honestly getting out of bed and doing some small task helps. I also recommend the pomodoro technique (? If I spelled that right) to get me through tedious bs. Good luck and remember to take care of yourself before anything!",

It's burnout on multiple levels - burnout from school and from personal maintenance - and i feel like it happens to all of us who struggle mentally.\n\nIf you can take anything off your plate, do it asap, and ask for help where its needed. I'm not gonna necessarily say that what you're going through is \"normal\" but it makes sense to me and you have nothing to be ashamed of. Ultimately, you'll be okay with time and a change of pace or scenery. Taking a break for a semester or maybe even a gap year if possible might be really beneficial.\n\nI wish you the absolute best.",

I was planning to go back to school last fall, but pulled the plug when I realized covid was going to make that miserable (I had some experience with online classes and found I don't like them), but now I'm in a position where I don't feel like I need to go back to college.",

If you're looking for answers, I recommend HealthyGamerGG on Youtube, where Dr. K explains many concepts including lack of motivation, burnout, depression. I felt similarly as you do and this channel helped me understand how my mind works. Either way, failing a semester may feel bad, but remember that your mental health should always be placed higher than education. Take some time off, explore how your mind works (and what caused you to lose motivation) and once you're ready, you can come back stronger than ever. Good luck, my man, you've got this.",

Now don't drop the medication(s) suddenly!! Withdrawal is a real thing. Talk to your psychiatrist/psychologist and be honest about your side effects and how it's hurting your performance in college. Hell, bring your HS and College transcripts and show them. I sure as hell did myself and they were like *\"Oh...\"*\n\nThe point is to  get someone to a stable, functional level in mental health treatment. Take some time off, adjust your medications and figure out what works best for you.\n\nHell man, I had my Adderall (3 years ADHD diagnosis) taken away this semester for 2 weeks because my psychologist was out sick and the clinic told me to \"just hang on for 2 weeks\". My grades plummeted from severe withdrawal. I'm still scraping up late assignments for finals week. I'm probably going to even fail a class. Your not the only one suffering this year so far at school, I know how it feels. Again, take some time off, go to therapy (CBT) if your not already - try to understand yourself better - who you really are between the highs and lows.",
