  "text": "In my US History course, we are required to write a few papers. Apparently, my professor will only talk about the (very heavily weighted) assignment in meetings outside of class. This clearly is giving the students who can attend the session (in the evening on a non class day) the upper hand, is it not? Is this standard protocol for college courses?",

I would say this is pretty normal, since professors usually just lecture and then give you the assignment rubric and instructions, but they are usually willing to answer questions after/before lecture or in emails. I\u2019ve had very few professors actually go in depth with the assignment instructions during class (usually they do with the first one/final one, but not the rest).",

                      "text": "This professor's policy is unfair only in the broad sense that society as a whole is unfair. It's unfair that some students have to work while in school and others don't, because the ones who don't have to work have more time to study. It's unfair that some people lose hours of their lives commuting to work on the bus, while others can afford a car that allows them to get to work more quickly and easily, but both are expected to get to work on time. It's unfair that some students can attend extra study sessions while others can't. It's unfair that some students can afford test prep help for college or grad school admissions tests while others can't.\n\nAs a professor, I do try to level the playing field as much as I can. However, I can't change the fact that some students have more time than others, or the fact that some students' schedules allow them to attend extra sessions while others have scheduling conflicts. \n\nYour professor has given you what you actually need to complete the assignment: written instructions! The Q&A session is just a bonus that shouldn't be necessary if the instructions are clear and comprehensive. Read the instructions carefully. Read them out loud to yourself. Highlight the important points. If you still have questions after that, explain to your professor why you are unable to attend the extra session. Ask if you may come to office hours to ask your questions about the assignment, or if the professor would be willing to answer them before/after class, or if you can ask questions via email. Most professors would be willing to answer questions in some way or another, if there is a genuine scheduling conflict.",
