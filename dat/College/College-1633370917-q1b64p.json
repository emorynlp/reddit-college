  "title:": "Informational Interview Gone Wrong",
  "text": "Hey all,\n\nOne of my class assignments is to interview a professional in your field of interests and I managed to get into contact with a seemingly-distinguished professional. All I have to say is that in regards to the open-ended questions I've asked which were really good, I received short responses. I'm talking 1-6 words max with no detail. (This was all done via email). \n\nI'm a cross roads. I'm not sure if I should ask her to be more detailed, but I fear that over email it may taken as I am being pushy. I'm open to any suggestions on how to say \"dude, you hold a phd, can you elaborate on your answers wtf\"\n\nMy other idea was to just say thanks and leave it alone. I'll have to start from scratch all over again looking for a decent interviewee.",
