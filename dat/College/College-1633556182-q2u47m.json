  "text": "i have been in a relationship for a year, since the last year of highschool. i have now started college. we see each other like 3 hours everyday except two-three days in the week (because of college/work). we used to see eachother like 6 hours every day of the week, and he is not adjusting well to the change. i am also not being the best girlfriend, since i am meeting with my college friends very often and minimizing the time i see my boyfriend. the thing is, i lost both of my friendgroups last year. i only have my boyfriend and my recent college friends which are not very good friends of mine yet. i also have a little crush in college (i would never cheat or flirt but sometimes intrusive thoughts are unfightable, but i would never act on it, i cant control that crush but i can control myself).\n\ni dont know what should be my priority right now. i love him dearly, but he is becoming a bit of an obstacle to the things that i want, but maybe that is me being selfish. i dont want to lose someone who is that important to me, but maybe being committed since you're 17 is not the best thing for development. i just kinda want to be able to go out without making sure i can compensate for that later on, maybe its just a phase because i am in love with the whole college life or maybe its something that will stay with me. i would like to listen to some opinions about being in a relationship in your twenties/in college, and what should i prioritize rn. thank you!\u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "You should break up with him and allow him to move on with his life and you with yours. You already have expressed forming attractions to people and even described him as an 'obstacle'. That doesn't sound like you love him dearly, it sounds more like you 'love' being in safe relationship (not only romantically but also emotionally, given your feelings about your new college friends.\n\nIt be better for you to live your fullest life at college, and for him to find a partner that doesn't seem him as something that gets in the way.",

      "text": "u/safespace999 Gives a wonderful response and I agree completely.\n\nI'd also like to add to this. I was in the same situation as you when I started college. She was going to my dream school while I was going to a community college for the first two years. Things were alright over long distance, but I was so excited to see her again. Little did I know was that I was throwing those two wonderful years of my youth away because every second of my day that wasn't work or school was spent spending time with her online. I thought it was love... until it wasn't. I got into my dream school and was enrolled with her but I told her I wasn't ready to live with her yet. Problems ended up arising between us bc her workload is much much less extreme than mine (I'm engineering btw, for context). And I have to say this to you now so you don't make the same mistake. Relationships in college have a cost, a heavy cost. And it is damn hard to find that right person that you can be with who doesn't make the relationship an obstacle to your future and your success.\n\nYour priority, your primary priority, should be school. You are legit paying thousands (unless you're on a full-ride) for these classes and they are no joke. What happens now in college will affect your early career. Don't fall for the trap like I did because I ended up not making any friends while I'm in college and now my last year is spent playing catch-up to all of the social aspects of college that I missed. If it doesn't work out, don't be stressed or sad. Live your life to the fullest and you'll be amazed what happens when you chase your goals. \n\nNote: As for me, my relationship ended earlier this year because she wouldn't respect my goals or the time and effort I was giving to my classes. It was a respectful breakup and now I'm doing well on my own after we both respectfully agreed to just be friends as we start our careers. So, don't feel as if you're doing something wrong, you're in the period of your life where you can learn from these experiences.",

          "text": "if i try to break up with him, he punches walls, shouts, and drags himself to the floor. also, i pushed away all of my friends except for the college ones since i started dating him, so i would have friends but only college friends, no friends in my hometown where i live and spend most of my time in. i know it's selfish, but i really cannot be alone 5 days of the week with literally 0 friends. a part of me hoped this feeling of being overwhelmed with my relationship would go away as well as my crush, but i feel it will only grow to be bigger. probably the best thing to do is talk about it thoroughly with a therapist.",

              "text": "Uhhh, what? He punches walls? Shouts? Mmkay, look I'm no therapist, just some rando on Reddit, but you need to take yourself away from that toxicity. Look, I thought being alone after my previous relationship would leave me sad and alone, but that's not what happened. I have a few friends now in college, and the same can be done for you. \n\nAlso, I know the feeling of losing your friends. I pushed mine away when I started my relationship and it was a huge mistake. She pushed hers away too and she would always say how much she regrets it. A relationship shouldn't consume everyday of your life because once it does then all of the emotions you had are thrown away.\n\nWhen you say it's selfish, it's Mmkay. It's alright to want company. We're all human and we need a group to socialize with, but not taking the opportunity to find the right social group for you is only gonna hurt you. In college, you'll find there is a group for everyone, for everything. If you feel overwhelmed then I think it's time to let things go. Go talk to a therapist, of course, if that makes you feel better, but you should definitely consider letting things go.\n\nFeel free to reach out, too, my DMs are always open",
