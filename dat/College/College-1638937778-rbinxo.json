  "text": "Hello! I'm an Year 1 IB Psych HL student.\n\nMy interests are Behavioral Psychology, Behavioral Economics and Clinical Psychology. My psych teacher told me that such a future will not be possible and that I will end up studying in a mediocre college in many, pretty words (I feel bad but that's not the point).\n\nIf I wanted to pursue said interests, regardless of my teacher's comments, what colleges would be the best of the best? Any country are good. I wanted to go into Liberal Arts, is that a good idea for this discipline?\n\nAnd if I want to go into these colleges, what extracurriculars would be good? (I know extracurriculars are my choice but-) Like, what kind of social work/ internships/ field work can I do as a High School Student?",

I would then look at the best program for it in your region. \n\nhttps://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges-for-psychology/",

A masters adds some value, but it\u2019s insanely competitive -much so that even obtaining a PhD in the field is very competitive. \n\nThat said, even if you obtain the highest degree, your pay will much less compared to that of an undergrad who majored in some STEM field. \n\nThe best but if advice I read on here was to pursue psychology as a \u201chobby\u201d/interest. The job market for it is unfortunately quite bad. \n\nI\u2019m sorry.",

What does one do before a masters in Psych? \n3. I heard that the field has less people in it and thus, there is encouragement to join and relatively less competition than other humanities fields like business and econ\n\nI'm a humanities inclined student so STEM is not an option for me...",
