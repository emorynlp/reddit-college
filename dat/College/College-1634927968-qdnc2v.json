  "text": "Okay so, I\u2019m 24 and a first time college student. One of the first classes I am currently taking is Anatomy & Physiology I. I wasn\u2019t understanding anything and the instructor kept saying every single chapter that she wasn\u2019t going to go in depth with certain things that we should already know from General Biology. I looked it up, and sure enough, Gen Bio is a prerequisite for A&P, so why was I placed directly in this class? Is it possible to bypass a prerequisite? Thanks in advance for any possible answers.",

      "text": "Did you register for classes with guidance from an advisor or did you do it on your own through the college\u2019s online portal? My school\u2019s portal usually blocks the student from enrolling in a class if they haven\u2019t completed the prerequisite for it. In most institutions, they don\u2019t allow you to bypass a prerequisite since the prerequisite teaches you the foundational content and material you\u2019ll need to know before taking said class. For example, you can\u2019t take Calculus if you haven\u2019t taken Trigonometry or Algebra prior. You need Trig and Algebra to understand Calculus.\n\nNot sure how advising works at your school but I\u2019d definitely speak to your academic advisor about this. If the census date for the semester hasn\u2019t passed, you\u2019ll be able to drop the class with a full refund (If you received financial aid, this could affect your aid amount so I\u2019d definitely speak to the financial aid office about this). If the census date has passed, there could be another deadline date for withdrawal from a class without a grade penalty.\n\nMeeting your academic advisor to solve this would be the best solution but if that\u2019s not possible, I\u2019d email or call them as soon as possible. If you don\u2019t have an assigned academic advisor, I\u2019d call the school and speak to a representative from the advising department. Worst case scenario is, both dates have passed and you have to drop with the grade penalty, which will affect your overall GPA. That\u2019s why I really urge you to contact your school and advisor about this as quickly as you can. Shoot them an email right after reading this!",

I guess it would be best to find out as soon as possible, since I\u2019m not sure if the census date has passed yet or not. Thank you so much for your help! I just emailed my advisor so hopefully I will hear back soon.",

              "text": "The advisor registered you for the classes? I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m a bit taken aback that they\u2019d enroll you for the class when you haven\u2019t taken the prerequisite yet. It\u2019s part of their responsibility to know that information, especially if they\u2019re guiding a first year student. I\u2019d check your school\u2019s website to see if they have an academic calendar. The academic calendar should have all the important dates outlined for each semester. There\u2019s a good chance the census and withdrawal dates are there. It\u2019s great that you noticed the issue earlier in the semester than later! There\u2019s more time to figure out the situation. I\u2019m sure things will all work out once you speak with your advisor. I\u2019m glad I could be some help to you :\u2019)",

Sounds like your school fits into the latter group.\n\nJust make a mental note that your school is bad about enforcing prereqs and make sure to double check that you have them the next time you make your schedule.",
