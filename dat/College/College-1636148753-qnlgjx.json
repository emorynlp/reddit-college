  "text": "Anyone else\u2019s seasonal depression kicking in? My class load hasn\u2019t been too bad for fall 2 so I decided to download dating apps\u2026 for the 100th time. Seasonal depression people. Where we all start realizing that we\u2019re gonna be alone for the holidays, well other than homework and work ofc, but no cute winter dates or anything. We wake up at 1pm and spend 5+ hours on tik tok instead of doing something that matters because we\u2019re depressed about not having a date for the holidays, my gays know what I\u2019m talking about. Anyone else feel this?",

      "text": "I know that this is not what you want to hear, but you need to hear it anyway: a girlfriend will not solve your problems. If you are not happy with yourself, you will not suddenly be happy with a girlfriend, you will just be unhappy while having a girlfriend.\n\nA romantic relationship isn't a magic fix all for all personal problems. In fact, trying to offload your issues on your partner is not healthy. You need to be comfortable being yourself before trying to find a partner. \n\nI wish you the best and I hope you do succeed, but remember to work on being happy with who you are before trying to be happy with someone else.",
