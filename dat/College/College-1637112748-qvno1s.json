  "text": "To preface I have been going to college for only one semester but nonetheless it\u2019s already apparent that I will only skate by. I\u2019ve spent my entire life doing the bare minimum in school, and by that I mean always getting just good enough grades to get into a decent college. I thought maybe in college I\u2019d grow up and stop being lazy but I can\u2019t help myself I can\u2019t bring myself to put full effort in, I\u2019m starting to believe I never will. I want to work hard so desperately cause I want to learn and be proud of myself but all I do is let myself down, procrastinating, avoiding lectures, do ANYTHING but work on school. It\u2019s super stupid but it\u2019s all I know anymore, I try over and over to change it but I\u2019m just pathetic at this point. Anyone have any advice on how to get into good study habits? Because I\u2019m beyond sick of who I am.",

You have other options but you have to find out what they are. It\u2019s just that a degree has some value that will help establish a career.

              "text": "Hey, I\u2019ve been there. Who knows if we do it for the same reason or not, doesn\u2019t exactly matter.\n\nPoint is\u2026if you don\u2019t try hard, but it also has enough impact on you to make you feel like a failure\u2026something has to change on either end of the spectrum, ideally both. Have grades reflect your worth a little less, and invest a little more in the process. \n\nYou might have to do some introspection here. Why exactly are you at college? Do you feel free, or do you just feel trapped in a path which you feel obligated to pursue? Who exactly are you trying to succeed for? And what exactly does excite you in life? Surely something does. Figure out if you can pursue that thing in college \u2014 it might not be your whole degree, or your only degree. Hell, maybe it winds up being a club you join or start. \n\nWhat saved me in college was reveling in the *real* freedom. Get a job if you don\u2019t have one \u2014 ideally something kinda interesting, or just something stimulating that you have never done before. Find a way to get around. Start taking walks. In the morning, get up *for you, NOT for class.* \n\nGet up because *you want to be happy, feel productive, and start the day well.* Eat good food. Exercise. Reward yourself with time spent on a hobby, nice dessert\u2026whatever. You know how you\u2019ll feel if you sleep late, throw on an outfit, skip class, eat some cold cereal and procrastinate all day. The only person who can save you from feeling that way is *you.*\n\nAll of these things seem small, but they WILL help you find greater passion and fulfillment from life in general. \n\nCollege is tough. You really don\u2019t have someone standing over your shoulder the whole time making sure you succeed or at least try. That means the discipline, passion, and motivation has to come from you. There are ways to make that easier for yourself and ways to make it hard!",

      "text": "Hey friend, I know this feeling very well and it\u2019s miserable. It is not as easy as people say to just change your habits. Have you looked into your health? I felt like this my whole life then got diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune condition that left me feeling fatigued and unmotivated 24/7. It also sounds like you may have some mental health problems that are causing AND being compounded by your lifestyle. Maybe you should consider looking into this. My life has changed completely since being medicated and I\u2019ve managed to get into a really good uni doing a degree that I love because of it. In the meantime, try not to be so hard on yourself and instead try to take things step by step - congratulate yourself on the small things you ARE doing. The fact that you desperately want to change is already a such huge thing and a very good indicator that you have a good future ahead:) \n\nSome practical tips that worked for me:\n\nStart with very very gentle exercise and make it a goal to stick to it - yoga or a daily walk for example.\n\nChange your diet and drink LOADS of water. People don\u2019t realise how dehydrated they are. Get a water bottle and keep filling that baby up, you\u2019ll feel such a difference in your brain I promise\n\nMost important: accept that you will have good days and bad days. The important thing is to recommit to your goals DAILY, no matter how yesterday went. The focus is on the present and the future. Don\u2019t let thoughts about the past consume you. \n\nI hope things get better soon. I believe in you\ud83d\ude0a",
