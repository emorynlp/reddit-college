      "text": "Yes it\u2019s worth it. I work in supply and logistics, 10/10 career field. However, it\u2019s one of the career fields that don\u2019t necessarily require a degree. I don\u2019t have a degree and I\u2019m a supply manager for the government. If you do plan on going that route in college, make sure you do internships. Many places value experience over a degree.",
