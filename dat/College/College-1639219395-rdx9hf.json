  "text": "I am a college student. I recently completed an internship that was mandatory for graduation. One class in which I am currently enrolled requires me to send a thank you note to my internship site supervisors. My syllabus says to send a thank you note. It did not say to send a thank you email. I am unsure if I am even allowed to send a thank you email instead. I will email my professor to ask her if that is an option. \n\nI will show you a draft of my thank you note. The names of the people involved will be replaced with pseudonyms. You tell me if this is the proper way to send a professional thank you note. \n\nDear Teresa Benner, Karen D'Agostino, Ron Samul, Beverly Scully, Sarah Schnitman and Mike Secreti.  \n\nDuring the fall semester of 2021, I worked an internship on nightly and weekend programming for Thames students. I am very thankful for this opportunity. I would not trade this experience for anything. I hope that the next person to work an internship with some or all of you as their supervisors learns as much and has as enjoyable of a time as I did. \n\nAt the September 22nd Peace Day Event, Mike Secreti gave me a task that I could not complete. He handed me some balloons that were tied to each other and instructed me to untangle them. I was unable to do that, but he at least appreciated the effort I put in.  \n\nOn October 18th, I proposed an event for The Day of the Dead that would involve watching the movie Cacao. This plan was scrapped, as formal permission of the movie creator would be needed to display the movie in a public setting. Karen D'Agostino gave me advice on how to write a professional proposal.  \n\nI helped Mike Secreti set up for the Halloween party on October 29th. We taped a chain to the staircase. The way that I put tape on the railing was wrong, he showed me a more effective way to do it. \n\nThese are merely a few of many instances where this internship acted as a learning experience unlike any that I have ever had.  \n\nSigned,  \n\nMatthew Bigelow",
