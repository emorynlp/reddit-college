  "text": "Hey all, \nI\u2019m a current sophomore majoring in health administration and considering a minor in Cognitive Science. I want to attend nursing school after graduation through a post grad/2nd degree program. However, class registration for the spring semester is coming soon and I\u2019m having doubts on my current situation. \n\nI started focusing on my health administration major this semester and I\u2019m going to continue taking nursing school pre-reqs. But I\u2019m having doubts about health administration since I\u2019m really not that far in and I don\u2019t know if it is going to prime me for nursing school admissions. My freshman year was very lackluster due to being at home/covid and I barely got any requirements done. Now I\u2019m afraid its too late to change things up and I\u2019m not taking enough things into consideration. Are they any of you in a similar situation? Unfortunately I can\u2019t transfer into the nursing school traditionally so my best option is to finish undergrad and go to nursing school after my four years. Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. Thank you :)",
