  "text": "I have this professor who's really nice. She's a really good teacher and she cares about our education. The class material is very difficult so I go to her office hours regularly. She told me to email her on days when I can't attend her office hours (scheduling conflicts) with any questions I may have and she will help me. However, she never responds any time I email her.\n\nI know professors are very busy, but she explicitly told me to email her. I also know that she gets my emails because she'll bring them up during office hours (like a week after I sent them), and will be like \"Oh yeah, I got your email. I'll reply soon!\" but she never does.\n\nI'm just really confused and don't know what to do. She's sending me mixed signals by being really nice and caring but also not following through with her promises. Does anyone have any advice?",

We also have a center where the teachers themselves \u201ctutor\u201d which sounds better imo than the tutoring center.\n\nMaybe you can get ahold of something like that?\n\nAnd you might be able to look up the concepts online",
