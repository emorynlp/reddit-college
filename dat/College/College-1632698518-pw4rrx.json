  "text": "Hello I\u2019m a freshman Biology student and I am struggling now. It is our first semester and I have failing score on most of my subject. We already have our prelims and and I failed two subjects, one major subject. I know that this course is hard but I think it\u2019s not all about the class, I think my terror prof added to this problem. I\u2019m really studying hard but the requirements are just unreasonable. Now I want to quit the course, maybe because I don\u2019t see myself doing this anymore and it really messing my mental health already. I need advise on what to do. Do I need to shift course?which I wanted to do or drop/withdraw subjects (please enlighten me i\u2019m not familiar with this terms). Plus it is possible to shift course after one semester? cause I don\u2019t want to waste money and time with this course. Thank u in advance for the advices!!!",

              "text": "Really depends on the school. Some it's not too late to drop w/o penalty. Some you can drop but you'll get a withdrawal on your transcript. Some you can change the class to a pass fail to save your GPA but you'd obviously still have to take it and get a passing grade, and it wouldn't count towards whatever requirement it fulfills. But it's different at every school so you'll have to talk to your advisor",
