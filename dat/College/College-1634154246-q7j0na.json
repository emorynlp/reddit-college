  "text": "I\u2019m doing macro economics and I prioritized a lot of my time doing the practice work and assignments and I get slapped with a 15% overall grade. \n\nIt\u2019s the small details that are taking away points from some of my work and test grades and it can be a long list of errors. I follow directions as best as I can and I put so much work into this class. now I feel like I\u2019m wasting time trying to bring up my 15% overall. \n\nShould I just drop it and try again later ? Any opinions help.",
