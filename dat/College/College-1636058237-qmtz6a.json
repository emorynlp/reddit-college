  "text": "Hello everyone I'm a first year engineering student. The problem here is that I can't focus while Studying I failed last year because of this, I tried several times and used different methods I removed all distractions (phone, laptop when not needed, no TV....) I usually play some music makes me feel less stressed I even changed the place where I study switched rooms tried libraries but even tho I set all conditions right and removed all distractions whenever I try to study I find myself just looking/staring like my mind telling me to do anything but studying also whenever the homework or the exam is kinda hard I don't even bother to read it carefully or even think.\nI started to think there's a problem and I need a doctor please I need your help and advices I need to pass this year because it's my last chance. \nPS: please none suggests to switch the studying field because this is what I really want.",

So I went to the hospital and got diagnosed.\n\nYou can look up the symptoms of ADHD from credible sources like Mayo clinic.",
