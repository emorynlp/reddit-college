  "text": "Starting college I did very well. I was able to maintain a 3.9+ gpa. However, things have gotten harder. Burn out from full time work, relationship issues, and what I suspect is an undiagnosed mental disorder has really taken its toll on me. My gpa is 3.2 now, and it\u2019s probably going to lower after this semester.\n\nI know I\u2019m capable of better grades, but all this bull has made it impossible to see why I\u2019m even doing this in the first place. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to graduate and make tons of money (or even be middle class). It\u2019s just about getting out of customer service atp.\n\nI thought about saying f it and taking out loans, but then I looked into the actual costs of transferring out of community college. I\u2019m not prepared to get into 40-70k of debt, and lord knows I\u2019m not getting any scholarships.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "I can\u2019t really speak on the money side of things, but if it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019ve been in a similar situation to you. I was losing my mind a little and couldn\u2019t focus on school and went from a ~3.4gpa to failing every class. I spent a week in a psychiatric hospital to figure out what was going on and since then I still haven\u2019t been able to pick my grades up while working a job and working through my own issues. In my case, taking care of myself and working towards my better future means withdrawing from college and returning to a career I\u2019m much more passionate about in aviation, as well as changing to a job that\u2019s much less strenuous on me. But, that\u2019s NOT how it works for everyone, it just happened to work for me and is possible to work for others. \nSome other things that could help you out would be to talk to some of your school resources, a lot of campuses can offer mental health help and counseling to help you some of the things holding you back. \nFor your jobs and loans, I\u2019d definitely say to avoid taking out loans if it\u2019s possible for you, if you\u2019re not enjoying or struggling at community college it\u2019s not going to be worth going into debt to be just as unhappy if not more unhappy at a full university. \n\nAlso- a 3.2 gpa is not bad whatsoever, it\u2019s considered really good actually. I wouldn\u2019t worry so much about it, you can think about taking fewer classes each semester to just be a part time student if it helps too. You got this, I believe in you :) take it all at your own pace",

However that simply isn\u2019t the reality when you\u2019re born into poverty.\n\nIt does feel like giving up, but I\u2019ve been trying to get into a trade apprentice program. Most are full and I haven\u2019t heard back yet. \n\nPart of the problem is that I have a federal internship that will go belly up if I don\u2019t maintain at least half time status.",

I definitely think trade programs will be the way to go, there\u2019s a handful of programs that can lead into some really great careers without paying nearly as much. Can I ask what you\u2019re majoring in? You don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want!",

Have you considered doing programs at any sanctuaries, reserves, or even some zoos/rehabilitation centers? It could be pretty similar to what you\u2019re looking to do and help with a bit of income and some on the job experience with room for growth. It\u2019s not perfectly one to one with a wildlife biologist but it could hopefully be helpful for you! Especially for keeping life enjoyable while you\u2019re in school",
