      "text": "i agree that you shouldn\u2019t pull an all-nighter if possible and if you do have somewhat of a grasp on the material, then you\u2019re most likely going to give up at around 3/4am with a \u201ceh i\u2019ll be fine\u201d attitude anyway. if you\u2019re the type of person who can get up early, then definitely do that instead. *but* sometimes shit happens and if you need this all-nighter to pass the exams, then:\n\n- take like an hour long nap asap\n- have a plan of what you need to study and *how* you want to study is (please don\u2019t just mindlessly reread your notes or textbook \ud83d\ude2d)\n- around 1-2 energy drinks is usually fine; drink lots of water as well and after ~2am, switch from caffeine to water (tea is also good). \n- 1:30-3:30 is this weird dead zone, and if you\u2019re going to give up on studying and go to bed it\u2019ll most likely be in that time frame. don\u2019t just stay up on your phone for the sake of staying up; if you really think you can\u2019t study anymore then it\u2019s better to get sleep than to get no sleep AND no studying done\n- don\u2019t take a \u201c20 minute nap\u201d in the middle of the night bc it will not be 20 mins, it\u2019ll last the rest of the night and if you don\u2019t set alarms, you might sleep through an exam\n- get some exercise every so often, just get up to stretch, do a few jumping jacks, etc.\n- if i have something before 9am, then i usually try to stay up the whole night because for me personally, i will feel much worse if i go to bed for 2 hours than if i just keep going. if i have something after 9am (ex a 12pm exam), then i go to bed around 5-6 and get some sleep\n\nanyway no i do not recommend all-nighters they absolutely suck and you will hate every decision you made that led you to that position, but i\u2019m not gonna pretend like i\u2019ve never done them and like they haven\u2019t helped me in a pinch \ud83d\ude2d\n\nedit: typo",

The syllabus is your friend, keep a planner (I use physical, some prefer computer). Nearing exams (2 weeks out), start staggering free time to study subjects in 1-2 hour increments. Keeps you from overloading your brain in long study sessions. If I study for those short periods, then go workout, run, or clean I will always think of that topic while I just go through the motions. Idk, but it helps me lock those topics in and work through the process or analyze the situation.",

If you don\u2019t get that good sleep before your exam, you are going to have hard time remembering the material that you have recently just learned overnight making it effectively pointless to use all of that time to study rather than sleep. I\u2019ve pulled all nighters for essays since I usually don\u2019t need to remember the information I research from them, but doing it for an exam is counterproductive.",

When the adrenaline wore off I crashed and it took like 2 weeks to feel normal again. \n\nIt took me several years to learn my lesson about all nighters though. I used to tell people who gave me crap about it that I can't consolidate information if it isn't there in the first place and used that to justify cramming and not sleeping. But eventually I realized that being able to focus and having clarity after a good night's sleep helped me remember things from class but also have an easier time using logic and strategizing the test. I also now work in a lab that studies the consequences of throwing off your body's internal clocks and it's really bad for like every system in your body.\n\nSleeping is singlehandedly one thing you can do to make school easier.
