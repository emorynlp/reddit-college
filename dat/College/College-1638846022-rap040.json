  "text": "My roommate doesn\u2019t really leave the dorm and I\u2019m kind not sure how to find any privacy. I feel kinda bleh in the library and I\u2019m unsure of any other kind of typical space I can just use to get some privacy. Like, not for studying but general peace and quiet, maybe even a place to take a nap or play some video games if I ever find the time (on the rare occasion).\n\nAny suggestions?",

I had my own large room, bathroom, walk in closet, and could have my dogs. Plus I was maybe 5 minutes from my mom\u2019s house then. Which I learned is actually a huge advantage.\n\nI highly recommend not living on campus honestly. It was way too many people. I prefer to be alone, so being in that environment was really hard on me. Getting out helped me be a lot more successful in school.",
