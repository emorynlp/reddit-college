  "text": "I'm a freshman currently majoring in psychology and started this semester thinking I was going to do pre med so I took chemistry. However I'm going to get a c in this class this semester. If I want to apply to grad schools for psychology in the future, will this one c look bad on my transcript if I explain that I dropped pre med? Chemistry also isn't required for my major",
