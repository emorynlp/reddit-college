  "text": "Okay, so I went to college for 3 years after high school studying Physics. I left and I now want to go back and finish. My two choices are Liberty University (all the classes are online) or the University of Evansville (near me, and where I went originally). Does anybody have any thoughts on how to pick between these two schools?",
