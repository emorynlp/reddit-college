  "text": "I am currently a pre-med student studying biochemistry but I\u2019ve been strongly thinking to switching my entire career to aerospace engineer or astrophysics. I really enjoy learning about space and space exploration itself. I don\u2019t know what to do because I also love medicine. Any advice?! Also I\u2019m on my sophomore year of college.",

      "text": "Having a passion for a subject is something great! But we really have to think what comes after your degree. Do you see yourself working in a hospital and/or clinical setting interacting with patients? Or would you prefer working in a lab building rockets/designing planes etc. Also, do you enjoy physics? Engineering involves LOTS of physics so if it\u2019s not something you enjoy you might not want to go down that way. I was reconsidering engineering myself and found that I liked the CONCEPT of it but I don\u2019t think I would like the job itself. It\u2019s something you have to research and really think about what you like. I suggest looking up YouTube videos on what you can do with and aerospace engineering or astrophysics degree or \u201cday in the life\u201d videos!",

      "text": "When it comes to aerospace engineering, I\u2019ll say this: it\u2019s much more likely you\u2019re going to end up in the planes/flight industry at a place like Boeing or Lockheed Martin rather than at NASA or Space-X like you might want. Those are great companies by the way, and are many people\u2019s dream jobs, but it\u2019s something to take into account. If you go pre-med and onto med school, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re going to end up doing something that you expected. \n\nTl;dr: even with an aerospace or astrophysics degree, it\u2019s hard to get a job in the space flight industry.",

      "text": "People who major in physics do extremely well on their MCATs, so these majors would not prevent you from going to medical school.  I also recommend following your passion when you're young - it's much harder to do when you have a mortgage, spouse and children.  It's good to have a reasonable back up plan - but life is too short to always take the absolutely safe route.  You can also keep a bio/chem based minor so you have those classes in case you change your  mind again.",
