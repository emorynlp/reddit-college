  "text": "So I graduated with a degree and certification and am now working a full time job while taking online/'evening classes part time working towards a masters degree (I require a few pre-reqs for what I want to get). The company im with does offer tution reimbursement so I plan on using that to help pay for it, but this got me wondering....\n\nIs it crazy to wanting to always be enrolled in a degree/certification program? I studied mechanical engineering, but many of my classes overlap with other engineering programs and am thinking of pursing those and eventually an MBA. If I can work full time while doing that part time...is there any reason not to? It opens me up to more jobs after all",
