  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently in a situation where I don't know what to do or whether there's a right choice or some advice that I could get. The back story is I graduated hs in 2019, enrolled at UCR in fall 2019, attended until March 2020 when the pandemic shut down the country. Within a few months, I moved states and enrolled at CSU for fall 2020. I decided it wasn't a good idea because I was going between two cities and just wasn't dedicated to the whole online thing while having a strict work schedule and withdrew from the university. I still kept my spot, however. I got my shit together in the past year (or so I thought) and moved down to Fort Collins to attend CSU in person this fall. We're currently approaching the end of the semester, but I feel so drained and without any motivation to continue on further. Most of my credits from UCR didn't transfer over to CSU, so I'm starting from the beginning. I was so set on being a wildlife veterinarian for the past year, then realized I don't want to do 8+ years of schooling for a career in case I hate it, so I switched majors to Political Science (idk why). I really want to start my own business, though. I can't drop out necessarily because I am already $40k in debt and don't have a well-paying job right now to pay that off in 6 months. I can't go under full-time credit hours because I will lose my financial aid. I'm just in a really shitty situation and I'm stuck. I feel like I'm in a mental jail because I don't know what to do or whether or not I'll make the right choice. I don't want to disappoint my family, I don't want to disappoint myself, and I *really* don't want to be stuck working at Walmart forever.",
