  "text": "Just curious if they are worth the price and if it's better than just using my laptop + notebook? I've been taking handwritten notes in regular notebooks but I think it's time to switch as there seems to be some great apps that could benefit me a bit more. If you have one has it helped you more than just using a regular notebook + laptop? I'd probably be a bit more organized and end up studying more effectively.\n\nSide note: I'm in STEM\n\nThanks for the advice and help! :)",

      "text": "In my case, using ipad for note taking isn't really effective since I tend to remember my notes more when writing them down on paper :/ maybe it's just me\n\nBut having an ipad does help though especially when I need to google something during class\n\nI also thought it would help me become more organized lol but at the end I still prefer using a traditional planner and notebooks",

      "text": "If you're in a stem major that is more math/ physics an ipad is fine for taking notes and doing problem sets. If your major is more computer science or programming focused don't get an iPad. They also have touchscreen laptops that can act like a tablet if you really want to take notes like that.",

      "text": "I'd say go with a cheap tablet from ebay which can run GNU/Linux (and make sure it has active stylus support too.) I'd recommend avoiding the Intel Atom systems because they can be difficult to get working correctly. These things cost a lot less, and GNU/Linux is much nicer than iOS/iPad OS/whatever Apple is calling it now.",
