  "title:": "I finally passed a semester of college",
  "text": "After several years of paying hundred, thousands of dollars only to fail 9 college classes from extreme depression and anxiety, I finally passed 4 whole classes this semester. Some A's, B's, and C's but I still got the credits.\nI'm so incredibly overjoyed, every semester I paid $2000 for classes just to get all F's from not being able to get up, go to class, or do any assignments and the cycle continued for several years. I just submitted my last final which I definitely aced. I feel like I can actually succeed and get my degree.\nThis wouldn't have been possible with all the supportive posts from this sub. Thank you all for being such great humans",

          "text": "I'm not actually sure. One thing I know completely uplifted everything in life was moving out of moving out of my parents' house and into my own place. \n\nAnother was surrounding myself with positive energy, not toxic, negative behaviors coming from former roommates that would also be seriously depressed and would often pressure me into skipping class, not doing an assignment, so on. \n\nI think also a big one was just getting to work. I got out of my slump by keeping myself busy. Getting a job, doing chores, and finally doing homework which may sound impossible but trust me, once that flow kicks in, it's unlike anything else.\n\nAlso one last thing was I weirdly love going to a library or public place just to do homework, it was way more effective at getting me to work when I'm not at home full of distractions. \n\nBut also, I'm the worst person to ask for academic advice as this is the FIRST semester I PASSED D:",
