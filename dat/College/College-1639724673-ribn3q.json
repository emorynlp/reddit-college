  "text": "Algebra prep, I should have tried harder but I just could not get it at all. I bombed both the midterm and final and one of the tests but everything else was decent. I have to retake it now which will delay my journey by another semester. I really wish I had done better, studied more. Math has never been my strong suit, I barely passed in high school and its been at least ten years since I took a math class. The teacher lady just had to send me a message too saying \"Michael I appreciate your efforts but you got an F, I hope you pass one day\" like thanks for that lady. I am just so sad TBH.",

You just can\u2019t do it 2 times and think you will understand everything.  Best to go on YouTube and touch up on your skills with Professor Leonard. He will get you right",
