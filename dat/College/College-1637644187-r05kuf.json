At present it is rambling and unorganized. Your paragraphing also needs to improve and become more logical.\"\n\nI feel extremely embarrassed but i will try my best to get better. Any tips?",

Ask one of your classmates if they will peer edit the rough draft, then revise it and take it back to your writing center to get further help. If that isn't enough, then go to your professor's office hours to get their suggestions.",

      "text": "Make a plan of where you want to go. Play with which idea needs to be explained first before you can move on to the next topic. It needs to make sense and it should be easy for the reader to follow your train of thought. Play around with the different subjects and when in the paper you should address them to make the more sense of the point you are trying to make. Telling the reader what your point is before making it, makes it easier for the reader to understand where you are going. As for paragraph, change paragraph when you are introducing a new idea.",
