  "title:": "Transferring to a New College as a Senior? Is it even possible? How screwed am I?",
  "text": "I'm feeling pretty desolate about this whole situation and hoping someone can give me guidance. I'm a senior in college with only about ~15 or so upper division biology/chemistty credit hours before I'm able to graduate. Ideally, I would stick it out and finish the classes, but circumstances outside my control is making this near impossible.\n\nI'm 27 years old with a 2 yr old daughter and my husband has a drinking problem. He's relapsed hard and I'm no longer comfortable with us living here. \n\nThe problem is, housing where my current college is ridiculously high. Especially for a newly single mom, then add childcare while I'm in classes, etc. I've been in college over 6 years because of needing to work fulltime then being a stay at home mom, so part time was the only option. Now my student loans are almost maxed, which means I can't take out much extra to cover housing/daycare either.\n\nMy best option is to move back in with my parents, but they live halfway across the country. I know most colleges require 30-40 credit hours with their institution to graduate, so I'm basically screwed right? If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, I'd be so very grateful.\n\nI'm just so sad I made it this close to completing my bachelor's and now I'm stuck.\n\nTDLR: Made it to my senior year, but now have to leave college because my husband's an alcoholic, moving back to my parents is halfway across the country, so likely I can't graduate because I can't satisfy the credit hours requirement  for a new institution.",

      "text": "Do you have enough credit hours at your current university to graduate from them if you took those classes at a different university? If so, ask your current university if you can take those classes elsewhere and transfer them to your original university, then graduate from your original university.\n\nThey may not allow this, but you should ask anyway. You should also look into if any of those classes can be taken remotely at your original university. Between those two ideas, if you explain the situation with your husband to the university, your original university might still be an option for graduation.",

          "text": "I would be 6 credits short of my current university requirements to graduate \ud83d\ude14 I did a few years with a community college before attending this one, so that also puts me in a pinch. The remaining required classes I need all have science labs associated with them, but I will still look to see if any are offered online. Thank you for the suggestions!\n\nI plan on talking with the university's crisis center tomorrow, because I'm thinking they would know best on where to direct me if the university could possibly give me an exemption based on the circumstances.",

      "text": "You could always take a leave of absence, move back home for a year, live with your parents, explain the situation, save as much money as you can, and then come back out for one last semester. Transferring would probably be crazy expensive and stressful, and graduating a year faster under circumstances like that probably wouldn't really out you that far ahead.\n\nAlso, you may be able to find a college student in your town who would be willing to provide childcare in exchange for you taking a larger part of the rent or something and live with with them. Not sure I would trust basically a stranger to live with me and watch my 2 year old, but desperate times call for desperate measures, so just an idea.",
