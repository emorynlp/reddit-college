  "text": "I\u2019m in my second semester of college, and one of my classes is statistics, which I apparently need to graduate. I can not do it. I don\u2019t understand any of it, and I\u2019m already failing that class with three weeks left in the semester, so I don\u2019t think bringing my grade up is possible. I had to appeal my financial aid last year because I missed too many classes.\n\nThis time, I\u2019m doing well in every class except stats. However, I do have good attendance in stats. Someone told me that I will lose my financial aid for failing a class. I\u2019m not sure how true that is. \n\nRegardless, I think I\u2019d rather go to a trade school. Does anyone know if financial aid pays for that? And how would I even begin to start classes for a trade school? How hard is it to get accepted into one? Anything anyone can tell me would be helpful.",

      "text": "I\u2019ll be honest with you fam, I hate the US college system. But the trade school system is just as corrupt. Most of them are for profit. Trade jobs shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a last resort either. If you\u2019re wanting to actually get into the trades, look into apprenticeships. I would never recommend someone going to a trade school. If you can manage to land an apprenticeship in a union, your life is set. They will pay for school while you make decent living.\n\nEdit: if you\u2019re looking into trade schools that offer medical careers, it\u2019s not a bad path either. The only negative is pay doesn\u2019t get too high.",
