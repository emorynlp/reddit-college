  "text": "I need advice, I'm a first year accounting student, and I'm having lots of regrets, so much regret that I started to have depression and anxiety attacks all the time, my heart is so heavy and I loss my appetite as well, I even develop this weird thing where I force myself to puke by shoving down a toothbrush down my throat to be able to puke for me to feel better, I hate myself and I hate my life so far.\n\nI made a big mistake in my life, I picked the wrong course, I picked accounting over computer science and now all I have is regret, I picked accounting because my mom keeps telling me how successful and financially stable accountants are and also because my aunty and uncle are both very successful CPA's with their own businesses. \n\nThat's the reason why I took it, I didn't like it but I force myself into it, thinking that it would lead me to wealth and success only for me to be wrong, I fucking hate it, and all I have is regret. I wanted computer science, but I was scared thinking that I would simply have a 9-5 job like everybody else for the rest of my life if I picked this. \n \nI want to create my own tech startup, make my own company and code for a living, creating apps that would benefit people wherein people can have fun using something that I built. \n\nBut something happened, my family and I got covid, so it got bad and with that, during the time we had covid my grandma who was with us died and so we panicked, and as I was giving CPR to her something sparked in me, a dream that I throwed away due to fear, which is medicine.\n\nI wanted to be a doctor when I was young and with that my dad always wanted me to be a doctor as well. I always watched surgery videos at night because I loved seeing it, opening a person up which is deepest and closest thing a person can get to someone, and saving people from the brink of death, is the dream job. But I didn't take it due to covid, I got scared for my own life thinking that if I took this path, not only will I be risking my life but my family as well. But now that I've experienced covid personally, I don't care anymore, I want to pursue medicine once again. \n\nAnd now the dilemma, I don't know which one to pick between medince or computer science, I don't know what to do anymore, I'm having a hard time to decide. My parents said it's okay to switched courses in college but they only given me one chance to switch so I need to think wisely, the problem is , I don't know what to do. \n\nWhich one do I decide, medicine or computer science, I need help. My mind and heart hurts, all I feel is pain, I don't know what to do anymore, I need help.",

      "text": "oh dear. let me ease ur mind. you can do a bachelors in cs and still apply to med school. an old friend of mine did that! she\u2019s doing a bachelors in cs then applying to med school. if she gets accepted then cool but if not then she has something to fall back on which is cs which she really likes too! \n\nyou are only in your first year. take a deep breath!!! u will be okay. everything will fall into place. please don\u2019t despair!!! and please talk to a school counselor and advisor. first year is the hardest mentally bc everything is new and you are still adjusting and it feels like you aren\u2019t allowed to make mistakes. please don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. follow your dreams and do what fulfills you!!",
