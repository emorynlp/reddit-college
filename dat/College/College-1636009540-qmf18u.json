  "text": "I\u2019m thinking about Pursuing a degree in I.T. I\u2019m lost on what kind of job(s) I could get or would like to get in that kind of field. I enjoy building computers and being hands on with things. I have a program for UPS at my HighSchool that allows me to take half days off from school and go to work. They pay me and after high school will pay for my college and will get promotions after working for so long. With the degree I can get promoted to corporate and make 6 figures. It\u2019s really all in time and I don\u2019t know if I want to work there or not for the rest of my life. UPS things isnt concrete yet thought I still have to get hired. Just wanna see my options before I make such a huge life decision (Senior in HighSchool)",
