  "text": "College for me has been a bit of a bumpy road. I started out at a small private college that was only about an hour from where my family lived at the time. I liked it, and I got an opportunity to study abroad while I was there (which was absolutely incredible, if you haven\u2019t studied abroad DO IT!!!!). The issue with that school was that it was very expensive, and I ended up transferring after returning from the study abroad trip. The school that I transferred to is a very good school, and I went into it knowing exactly what I wanted to major in (criminal justice) and I felt like I had everything figured out. \n\nThe first year there went great, I met a lot of people, made a few good friends (my roommate then is now my best friend), but I quickly realized that Criminal Justice was not the right fit for me. After looking through the majors list a billion times, talking to countless professors and advisors, I decided to switch to English with a concentration in Creative Writing. I really enjoy reading and writing, so I felt that it would be a good fit. \n\nI loved my creative writing classes, but the literature classes bored me, and I really struggled with the foreign language requirement. Then, COVID hit. \n\nCOVID changed everything for me. For starters, right at the beginning of the pandemic, I underwent emergency brain surgery. Dealing with that was a very traumatic experience on its own, but classes going online meant that I was actually able to finish out the semester. I went back Fall of 2020, but I struggle with online classes and I still wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to major in and everything in life was (and still is) just a big question mark. I decided not to re-enroll in Spring 2021 and I have been living at home working full time at a retail job since then. \n\nI just really don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t think I want to go back to the school that I was at, because the town and school is getting overcrowded, and it\u2019s just not the school it was. It\u2019s losing its charm. I really have no idea what I even want to study. I\u2019ve thought about business, but I\u2019m horrible at math and literally have not taken a math or science class since 2017. I have about 60 credit hours, most of which are in English and Criminal Justice. The only Gen Eds I have not taken are math and science. \n\nI know that ultimately it\u2019s up to me to decide what I study, but I genuinely have no clue. I\u2019ve had countless meetings with advisors, talked to family, looked at major lists, and I\u2019m more confused than I\u2019ve ever been. \n\ntl;dr: idk what I\u2019m doing with my life",

It\u2019s a common term in the financial markets for people who can\u2019t ever pull the trigger on making a trade, they always want just one more piece of information.\n\nI\u2019d stay at the same school, you\u2019re almost done with Gen Ed and with 60 credit hours, you\u2019re not too bad off. \n\nEvery major is going to have classes you hate. How many more literature classes will you need? Also, ask around to other students, there may be literature classes that are more interesting, maybe a better professor or an interesting literary genre.",

          "text": "The literature classes aren\u2019t really a big issue, the main thing that I get hung up on is the foreign language requirement. I took Spanish in high school and hated it, now I\u2019m taking German. I took two semesters of it at my old school, but the credits didn\u2019t transfer over because they weren\u2019t lab credits. I even had a tutor helping me and I still completely flunked the entry level German class. The fact that it was half online, half in person made it even harder, but I had similar issues with previous language classes.",

              "text": "Was it the hybrid structure that made German hard? You could always try it again fully in person. \n\nIf the foreign language is a stumbling block, are there majors which don\u2019t require it? With my economics major, there was no foreign language requirement, but there was extra math required in statistics and calculus",

                  "text": "None of the business majors require it because they\u2019re all BS degrees as opposed to BA. When I was a CJ major, it wasn\u2019t required because it is a BS degree as well. I have thought about just getting a business degree, but I\u2019d have to apply to the school of business, and there\u2019s a whole bunch of prereq courses that I\u2019d have to take before I even applied. I\u2019ve never taken calculus in my life, so that would be very challenging to me. I tried taking a remedial math course my first semester, and ended up dropping it the third day because I was so lost. Math and I do not mix well, which is funny because I\u2019m good at memorizing numbers \ud83d\ude02",
