  "text": "So I\u2019m a community college freshman who knows I want to do business but I\u2019m struggling to decide which path I want to go down. I went to community college before university because I don\u2019t know much path to commit to and I want to save money. \n\nThroughout my career I want to be making six figures sometime within 10 years working in my career.\n\nI\u2019ll most likely transfer into a mid-level state school. So what career path would be the most solid choice for me getting a high paying job?\n\nI\u2019m interested in all of those areas but my order of interest is 1. MIS 2. Finance 3.Marketing 4. Accounting",

The ivy guy will not look good considering the pay hike that is expected with ivy. Companies are moving more towards pay for quality work, than pay for quality degree.\n\ngoes right in line with \"underpromise and overdeliver\".. with ivy it is more like \"overpromise and underdeliver\".

True Talent does get paid if you know how to showcase it.\n\nThe whole get an expensive degree and let someone pay you more fad is slowly dying off.\n\nMore and more high-profile companies are changing their hiring culture and adopting more of a talent-based culture rather than meritocracies.\n\n*Ask yourself, what are you truly good at? Are you good at anything? there is always an answer.*\n\nIf there is no answer you can come up with, add more skills and learn more skills. There are too many people that are good at managing people, too many people good at paper pushing, too many people good at too many things.\n\nYou have to find what you are and how can you \"showcase\" it. A lot of it involves around an example of what you did or can do. Think internships, volunteering, local contests.. etc etc.\n\nShow what you can do. Here is an example. Lets take music industry. One of my students had an excellent ear for sound mixing. He was a computer science student. He could program and do many things but what he was truly good at was \"sound sculpting\". He combined his talents together and started working for a sound plugin company. He makes music mixing plugins and pulls in  7 figures. If he sat on his arse, waiting for someone to pay him  6 figures for doing nothing, he would be waiting decades.",

I will say that it\u2019s going to make your work-life balance suffer in the short term though, since the top public accounting firms are known for high work hours (think 40+ to 60 hours max) during busy seasons.\n\nI\u2019d also admit that while the accounting isn\u2019t as \u201ccutting edge\u201d as the other industries, it\u2019s a very respected degree and you can pivot into other industries quite easily (e.g., finance, operations, MIS/Cybersecurity, law, etc.) because of its reputation as being one of the more challenging business majors. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely not for everyone but if you\u2019re good with numbers and understanding processes/rules then it\u2019s a low risk/high reward field if you go the fast track",

You don't really need to be a nice person either. It's about finding a pocket of need and making sure you are the one that can fill it better than anyone else. Additionally, maybe consider picking one that is good but will allow you to shine and be at the top. If you graduate in the bottom 10% of a hard program, it's less impressive than coming in the top 10% of a slightly less challenging program. Most people can't do either, so the optics are what is impressive. This is just my hot take.  Being the best in the middle, rather than average at the top made me very comfortable.",

      "text": "A bit late to this thread but I'd highly recommend MIS. My school posts average starting salaries for each major and MIS is at the top each year (finance and accounting are close behind though). Ill be graduating with an MIS degree in the spring and highly recommend it to anyone. Couple main points about the degree:\n\n-it allows you to work in a ton of different roles. This is good since you can explore what fields are interesting, make more money, etc. It's bad because you need to actively seek out opportunities. It's not like an accounting degree that has a fairly set in stone career path.\n\n-it's the most tech intensive of the majors in a business college but will not put you on par with comp Sci students. You will not have the skill set to work in software engineering unless you study on your own time\n\n-related to previous point, CS majors are tough. Tons of students drop the major or spend 4 miserable years just trying to graduate. MIS is far easier since it's a business degree. None of the classes are very difficult and finishing with a high GPA as well as tons of time to work during the semester was great. Very few late nights studying.\n\nI had 4 job offers this semester all in different areas of tech and with different salaries. PM me if you want more info on internships, average salaries, the actual degree",

I ask because 100K in New York City is a lot different than 100K in rural Kentucky, and your salary progression can vary a lot depending on where you live.\n\nI have a business degree. My school didn't have accounting/finance degrees, but you had to choose a concentration (accounting, economics/finance, management, marketing, whatever). I chose economics/finance, but since a lot of the classes overlapped with the accounting program, I decided to take an extra semester to take those classes as well since there are more entry-level jobs in accounting.\n\nI went for my masters in accounting/CPA license, but I realized public accounting wasn't for me and didn't finish either.\n\nMy progression looked like...\n\n**Tax accountant private corporation.** 3 years, started at $45K, was making $50K when I left. It's exactly what you'd expect-preparing federal/state/local returns, filing extensions, reconciling tax accounts, etc.\n\n**Pricing analyst, pharmaceutical industry** 2 years, $47.5K > $50K. Basically just evaluating prices of drugs and making adjustments based on market factors and competitor pricing. I also helped the sales team price out deals for customers. I took a pay cut to go from my tax job to this because I hated my life working ~70 hours/week. With bonuses and insanely good benefits, the starting salary was essentially the same, plus I actually had a life outside of work. I actually really liked the job, the only reason I left was because a recruiter reached out to me and I realized I could be making a lot more with my experience.\n\n**Financial/operations Analyst, manufacturing** 3 months, $62.5K. I enjoy this work so far. There's a lot of cost accounting involved. Identifying places where the company can operate more efficiently, helping with audits, running analyses for and making recommendations to the President, VP of Operations, VP of finance...things like that. \n\nSo that's 5 years, and I've gone from $45K to $62.5K (in a low/medium-ish COL area) with a bachelors from a State university.",
