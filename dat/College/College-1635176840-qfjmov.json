  "text": "At my school, I have to be out by November 19th for winter break and I\u2019m just not sure if I can stay until move out. My mental health is at it\u2019s lowest it\u2019s been in years and I was looking for some advice for how I could leave campus early and go home without it hurting my grades. I go to an extremely small school and I know my professors decently well and I\u2019m just not sure what I can say to be able to leave campus early. (I also live about 9 hours from my campus). Any advice?",

I would talk to someone on the mental health counseling office to find out what your options are. Are zoom classes still offered to Covid people? It seems reasonable that the same could be offered, but regs have been really strange at some campuses and don't need to be consistent or reasonable for the administration to embrace them.",

          "text": "Thank you for commenting! I do wanna finish my classes because the end of the semester is so close. People that get COVID at my school or have been a close contact with someone who has COVID so I know that online recourses are available for students to continue their classes. I\u2019ll probably talk to mental health services and try to see what I can do. I have one professor that\u2019s extremely strict with attendance and barely lets us miss class unless we get a doctors note that\u2019s approved by the Dean so I would probably need to get some sort of approval to leave. I appreciate your advice!",
