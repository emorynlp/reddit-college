  "text": "These last few days haven't been the best. I forgot to reload my compass pass (so I had no money for my trip to school), I got a 6.5/10 on my Chem quiz and my TA basically fudge all my numbers and gave me all the answers for my chemistry lab.\n\nI told my parents all this - and then yesterday, I took a quiz/assignment at home and had a breakdown. I had 40 minutes and I was struggling because the content wasn't similar to my tutorial (a tutorial assignment). With 3 minutes left my mom walks in and starts telling/yelling at me for something, in which I responded in a very panicked/kinda rude response that I was taking a quiz. She doesn't care and keeps talking to which I just ignore because I am  high strung on anxiety at this point.\n\nI'm trying to write at least SOMETHING for the last answer but the quiz automatically submits and I start full on sobbing. I was absolutely devastated at myself and all my failures leading up to this point. And then my dad starts yelling at me for crying, saying that he \"hates the way I study.\" I start yelling back because that's not what happened, and that I was taking a QUIZ not suddenly crying because I was studying. It becomes a screaming match, and usually I have a lot more self control, but because I was in such an emotional state I could think, breath, or do anything properly. \n\nEven after I (admittedly) slammed my door and tries to cry in my room he still yelled at me. I spent the next hour crying and honestly just hating myself. Now the next day, both my parents are mad at me (blaming all the yelling on me even though both of them yelled *screamed* at me first), i feel like absolute shit and think I'm honestly worthless. \n\nIdk this doesn't seem like normal behavior that anyone else would get after having a total breakdown - just wanted to see people's thoughts on the situation.\n\n(Context: first year student who has a scholarship- so grades really mean a lot to me because I need them to be high to maintain my scholarship. Chem quiz was easy and I thought I'd get like idk a 9/10 but whoop got a 6.5 for my first quiz result in uni)",
