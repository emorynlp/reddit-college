  "title:": "Seeking career path advice - for a college student",
  "text": "Came on here to see if anyone has any advice to a college student who\u2019s having a difficult time choosing a career path. \n\nSome background: I am a senior in college pursuing a degree in Biology. I\u2019ve had a lot of interest throughout my undergrad in the medical field - I\u2019ve worked at a medical imaging center, have done research at a hospital, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve had my eye set on medical school for the longest time, however I do not think I am cut out for it (3.33 overall GPA, have not taken the MCAT). I have also looked into chiropractic\u2019s and have been accepted into a chiropractic school, however the salaries are steering me away. I know choosing a career path shouldn\u2019t be based on money and should be based on what you like to do, but I think money is an important factor that should really be taken into consideration, especially when college and graduate schools are so expensive. Looking for some insight from chiropractor\u2019s who maybe can share their experience. \n\nAlso would like to hear from other people and their biology / medicine related jobs (or anyone really who can offer advice or a career suggestion). I feel that a Google search is very tough to find career paths - it gives you the same \u201cTop 20 Biology jobs\u201d in a world of a million jobs. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated (jobs, schooling, salary, a day in the life, etc.) as this has something that has been stressing me out for awhile, especially now that graduation is near. Thanks again.",
