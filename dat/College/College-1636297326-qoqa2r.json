  "text": "last month I was close to doing a non-reversible bad thing, so school was somewhat neglected. now I\u2019m failing and my major advisor told me I\u2019m either out or changing my major. I cannot change my major. there\u2019s nothing else. \n\nI think if this happens it\u2019ll be the thing that makes me do the ~non reversible bad thing~ lol. I\u2019m already such a screwup so I genuinely will not be sticking around to hear about how I failed AGAIN. \n\nplus, if I don\u2019t have a degree in this I don\u2019t have any career aspects. I\u2019m fucked lol. I have so much debt already. if I leave without a degree I\u2019m not gonna be able to pay it off. I\u2019m fucked. I\u2019m absolutely fucked.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting here. maybe I\u2019m hoping that someone here will have a magical fix-all answer. I can dream, lol.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI apologize for not acknowledging your helpful comments until rn. the weekend was a mess, then of course during the week I have classes and blah blah blah. I\u2019m going to do what I can to just about pass this semester. I actually started in spring of this year, so things are a little off in that sense.\n\nSO I decided I\u2019m taking the spring semester off to 1) work a bit to replenish some of my savings and 2) recuperate. Try and figure out what I can imagine for my future. I\u2019m going to transfer to a community college for the fall semester, and get all my gen ed classes knocked out. then I\u2019ll transfer back to a state college for a bachelors. I\u2019ll either continue with the major I\u2019m in now, or switch to the other I have in mind. \n\nThe reason I said that a new major wasn\u2019t an option was because, honestly, I was just too upset to consider it. This potential new major is different for career options, but it\u2019s within the realm of careers that won\u2019t make me miserable. I don\u2019t really have a \u201cdream job\u201d so that\u2019s generally what I\u2019m aiming for - something to be content with.\n\nSome of you suggested a trade - I actually have considered trade school. I realized it really just isn\u2019t for me. If things go a particular route and I can\u2019t find work that will pay me a reasonable wage, I will reconsider a trade. Just some notes: I don\u2019t think college is necessary for everyone. I also don\u2019t think trades are of less quality than a college degree (you could argue that they\u2019re much more valuable, tbh). I\u2019m in college because for the things I am good at, it\u2019s hard to succeed doing those for a living w/o credibility. It\u2019s a bit more complex than that but that\u2019s a basic explanation. \n\nWith this edit, it seems like I jumped to some catastrophizing when I posted. Yes and no. Mostly yes. I\u2019ve had depression all my life. It\u2019s more under control now than it ever has been. but after struggling for so long with suicidal ideation, sometimes my automatic reaction is to say \u201cwell if it gets that bad i can just kill myself!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever do that. Not because of school, especially since my dad co-signed my loan and I care about my parents too much to leave them with that shit. And honestly I\u2019ve survived some shit despite being so young, so at this point, I\u2019m pretty sure I can figure things out no matter what. It may take time, energy, and it may be super frustrating, but it\u2019ll all be fixable. That\u2019s what my therapist said this morning. The circumstances suck ass, but this is fixable. It is not ideal, but it is not world ending.\n\nI am rambling. Thank you again.",

There are some unions that will pay you while you learn the trade then you can decide to stick with them or take your trade skill to the open market. \nThis whole notion that if you don't go to college your life is fucked is just a myth. Maybe spend some time working 60+ hours a week to pay off your debt and once it's paid off you'll feel much better.",

      "text": "Hey dude, it'd not worth giving up just yet. I was at the point of doing a nonreversible bad thing at multiple points in my life. It gets better no matter what, you're not a failure. If anyone else was in your situation, they probably would also end up in the same spot. You are just playing the cards you're dealt. As for how you might continue, seriously consider giving yourself time. Take a break semester, leave and come back when you're mental health is better. Don't let changing your major get to you. Your major doesn't just apply to one job. There are multiple majors that can fill the same good roles, so don't give up on it just yet (unless you just genuinely hate college and are not a good fit for it). That or quit and work a good trade. They make enough money to live pretty comfortably depending on what interests you.",

      "text": "Any failure on a personal level is equally a failure on a societal level - your failure is never yours alone, no matter how personal or grand it seems.\n\nAll of this is 'a screwup'. Society is *pretty fucked*. Everybody is just faking it 'till they make it. Those that disagree are just very good at faking it. We all pretend like we know what this is all about. We have goals and plans and when we do all that then we'll finally be happy and get to relax. That's just one supposed way to live life, one of many - but when we take on that life we distort things and say that 'this is how it is'. You need to graduate college and get a good job, you need to have a 5 year plan, you need goals, you need to make a lot of money. No, this is just one path that some people have laid out. There are a plethora of people in poverty living much more fulfilling lives than other people that have millions.\n\nCollege isn't as important as we pretend it is, and it's not as important as you think it is. It doesn't need to have even a shred of importance to you. Nothing is really that important. There isn't really anything you can do \"ruin\" this, because the only good part of this is you. It's your *being*. That's the only thing that life will ever be worth living for, and it's the only thing that nobody could ever take away from you.\n\nWhenever I get caught up in the whirlwind of the life we live I like to think of Taoist monks and hermits. People who have dropped out of life and committed to non-action. The few that speak, speak of peace, joy, bliss. They never talk about problems. It seems that they don't really have problems. Their focus is on something that cannot be lost or corrupted.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to deal with your situation. You could take more time to finish college. Most people don't finish in 8 semesters. You could transfer to a community college. You could drop out and go to trade school (many trades earn more than some college degrees). You could drop out and *not* go to trade school.\n\nRegarding your debt - I doubt it's as bad as you think it is. If you wanted to, you could move to an inexpensive part of the country and you probably wouldn't have any trouble paying it off making even just $14/hr. For reference - you can rent a 2 bedroom house in my area for $625/mo, and the company I work for at the moment is hiring at $14/hr starting with no previous qualifications/training required. There's also a $2k sign-on bonus and yearly bonuses that for me have ranged $900-$3500, and you get double pay for any hours you work alone instead of with a partner.\n\nI'll give you a semi-realistic example situation:\n\n\\- Person lives in Seattle with very high cost of living. No friends or family, just dropped out of college, no place to stay, no job, no car, no valuable possessions.\n\n\\- Person has $20 in their bank account\n\n\\- Person has $80,000 in student loan debt with an APY of 8%, a term of 15yr, with payments beginning in a month.\n\nSeems pretty hopeless, right? Let's turn this around.\n\n1. Person takes out a $5,000 personal loan with an APY of 15%, term of 5yr (bad credit).\n2. Person gets an Uber to the airport for $20. Buys a one-way ticket to Houghton, MI for $180.\n3. Person buys a car for $1,000. Gets it registered for $200.\n4. Person rents a one-bedroom apartment for $500/mo, $700/mo with utilities. Need first month + security deposit, $1,400 total.\n5. Person buys a month of groceries for $200.\n6. Person buys house items and clothing for $400.\n7. Person gets a job at CCMH. They are literally always hiring and it is not difficult at all to get hired by this company with zero relevant experience. Person gets $1,000 for signing up and another $1,000 after 6 months. Person starts around $14/hr.\n8. Person works 40 hours a week. Let's say that 8 of those hours are alone, in which case person makes double pay ($28/hr).\n9. After two weeks they get their first paycheck and sign-on bonus. $2,344 pre tax, let's say $1,900 after taxes. After two more weeks the person gets their second paycheck of $1,100 after taxes.\n10. It's been almost a full month and person makes their first student loan payment of $765 and their first person loan payment of $120. At this point, person has \\~$3.5k in their bank account. However, they are through the rough and it's a lot easier to see the way out from here.\n\nFrom this point forward, person will make \\~$2,200 a month after taxes. Let's say they spend $700 on rent and utilities, $150 on car insurance + gas, $200 on food, and $150 on frivolous purchases. Their loan payments are $765 and $120 respectively, which lets the person add $115 to their savings each month. They have over $3k in the bank to absorb any financial shocks. They will receive several thousand dollars each year in February from work bonus and tax refunds.\n\nLet's say this person does not make any large and unnecessary purchases and sticks to the above financial snapshot for 5 years. After 5 years, they will have received probably $15k from the bonuses and tax refunds (this is a conservative estimate). They will have already paid off their personal loan. They will have saved up $7000 just from adding $115 to their savings each month. In other words, after 5 years this person could have over $20k in their bank account while their monthly payments have been reduced overall.\n\nThis was a rather extreme case of a person with a ton of debt, a relatively low-paying job without any raise, and zero assets. Hopefully it has helped you see how manageable debt can be even when it looks very scary. You're going to be just fine.",

If your advisor thinks you should think about other majors you should at least consider it, right? When you're already in deep enough to be worried about debt a second choice degree is better than no degree. You could totally take a year or 2 off if you need to before finishing it though. \n\nAlso don't fucking kill yourself I've been on that edge but no way I could do that to my mom or handful of friends who care about me.
