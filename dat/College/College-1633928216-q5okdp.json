  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I kind of have a problem. For the past roughly 4 weeks, I have been wanting a room Change, because my roommate has his friends and/or girlfriend over all the time, and when I confront him about it in a \"professional\" manner, he always gets irritated and bent out of shape. I also caught him going through my belongings several times and I don't want to deal with it anymore. So I emailed my RA for a room Change (he only wants to discuss this kind of stuff through email for some reason) and was told I would be given one, but I asked for one on a specific floor (people can't clean up after themselves on my current floor) and then he just completely ghosted me. I then emailed a few throughout the weeks but still no response. I even confronted him about it in person, but was told \"we need to discuss this through email.\" I am at the end of my wits with these people. If he has time to  talk in our residence's group daily AND take photos with other students (on certain days), then surely he has time to send me a goddamn email. As you can tell I am at the end of my patience, and don't know what to do right now.",

If they also aren\u2019t helping, inform the dean. A student should never have to just \u201cstick it out\u201d if their roommate is trash.",

          "text": "Problem is - hall director are just as if not as worse than the RA. There\u2019s literally no ways you can win - at east from my experience. \n\n\nBest thing OP - ride it out, and when the semester is over, do commuting - it saves the hassle of dealing with roommates you don\u2019t want and you get your own place. Sure it\u2019s significantly more expensive but it\u2019s better anyways.",

      "text": "I'm an RA and its likely that your RA has no power over room changes (I can't move students around). Even my RD can't move people, only the director of Res Life can (at my school). Also if you're requesting specific floors its probably not going to happen, and you're going to get whatever room is open. If you have concerns talk to your RD or go directly to the Res Life office. \n\nI know my school has a pretty lengthy process before room changes take place. First you have to have a roommate meeting where you make contracts, then you have a mediation with the RA to revise the contract, then have a mediation with the RD, and then before the change a mediation with the Director. So find out what the room change process is and where you're at in it.",
