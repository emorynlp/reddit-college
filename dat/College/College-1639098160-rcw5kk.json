  "text": "I'll probably delete this post in a day or so but just wondering what you guys think. I just can't make up my mind.\n\nOn one hand my family really wants to see me walk and graduate. However its a winter graduation so its smaller and I only know a few people graduating with me (I'm a little late to finish). \n\nOn the other hand- a good friend unexpectedly passed away and his memorial service is unfortunately at the same date and time as my college graduation...\n\nHow important is/was walking to you guys? Was it worth it to walk? I know there's no right answer here I'm just curious what you guys think.",

College graduation is for you, and for your parents too. Watching their baby graduate is something they\u2019ll never forget and will only get to see once (or maybe twice). Walk for them, if for no one else.",
