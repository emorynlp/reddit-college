              "text": "Depends on the type of job I suppose. There are a few ways to go with that depending on the feel of the interview and the job itself. If you think the interviewer is open minded enough to be receptive of truth then I would be honest and say you\u2019ve never been in a professional setting but you can provide a personal example. \n\nMost jobs I can think of have some interaction with others whether it\u2019s a client, customer, or coworker so pick out a personal conflict resolution story that isn\u2019t too personal or detailed (for professionalism and time\u2019s sake) and tell them how you handled it and why that relates to the job. Like \u201cI had a classmate once who was kind of rude to me and I decided to confront them in a calm manner to see why they were behaving that way and we ended up having a great conversation about a misunderstanding that caused that behavior.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s pretty generic but you\u2019d be surprised by how many people lack conflict resolution skills so if that\u2019s something you possess you need to market it. I saw where other people advised you to emphasize being a team player and that\u2019s also important. Employers want you to be good at your job but also not cause problems for them and other employees. Conflict resolution and being a team player are incredibly important for that.",

      "text": "My suggestions:\n\n**1) Research the heck out of the company/job you're applying for**. Try to understand what their mission statement is, what sort of employees they are looking for, what the company values are. The more you can show that you know the company in a genuine way (you've done your research etc.) the better.  \n**2) Practice interviewing with someone else (ideally someone with some experience).** Look up interview questions (What are your strengths, weaknesses, what makes you qualified, what's an example of you finding a creative solution to a difficult problem, etc.), think about them and try to come up with some thoughtful answers. If your interview partner doesn't feel like it's a good answer, then an interviewer most certainly won't.  \n**3) Don't worry about being perfect, but try not to come across as unprepared.** You might get blindsided with a difficult question, but the trick is maintaining composure and coming up with a thoughtful answer. Don't be afraid to stop and think for a second if you need to. It's better to hesitate and show you're using your brain than to blurt out a bad answer. Most interviewers aren't looking for perfection, they're trying to assess your personal skills, knowledge, and fit.  \n**4) Don't be afraid to ask for clarification** if you're not sure what they mean by something they ask. I used this task to stall for a second when I needed more time to come up with an answer. It's better to be clear/precise than misinterpret.  \n**5) You'll be probably be nervous, but if it doesn't go well, it's not the end of the world.** Most people aren't good at interviews and get nervous. A good interview isn't a slam dunk and a mediocre one isn't going to kill you. Just be genuine but still as professional and polite as you can (no slang, swearing, inappropriate stuff).  \n**6) Know your audience/read the room** \\- if they're relaxed or having fun, they probably don't expect you to be uptight. If they seem like they're super serious, then keep it concise, cheerful, polite and professional.\n\nOh and what some other people have said: **Dress well (shine your shoes, press your shirt, overdress) and be early.**",

      "text": "Show up on time. Maybe one or 2 minutes early. No more than 5 minutes early. (Showing up too early can be seen just as bad as showing up late to some people)\n\nDress business casual or professional depending on the job you\u2019re applying for. If it is for a retail or restaurant job, business casual is fine. If it\u2019s for an office, or something more structured go business professional. (Collared shirt, slacks or skirt, realistic shoes like neutral colored heels or flats, or dress shoes, blazers are always good too)\n\nBring a printed copy of your resume and have knowledge of everything written on it. A lot of people lie on their resumes and then when questioned they flounder. Don\u2019t be that guy. \n\nDon\u2019t lie. If they ask your availability, don\u2019t say you\u2019re free on (insert day) if you\u2019re not. It will be hard explaining why you can\u2019t show up for work on that day when they schedule you because you said it was open. \n\nRESEARCH THE COMPANY!!\nI cannot emphasize this enough. Research the company you are applying for so you understand what it is, what they stand for, and what they do. This also gives you the ability to ask questions about the company. A good set of questions to ask would be:\n\n\u201cHow do you handle global situations?\u201d (Such as coronavirus)\n\n\u201cWhat does a normal day working here look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have benefits or offer sick leave\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you offer tuition assistance\u201d (if you\u2019re still in school or they want you to get a specific certification or something)\n\nAnd most of all, don\u2019t be anxious. Everyone gets nervous but employers like when people show they are confident in themselves and can stand on their own two feet. First impressions are important and that goes from how you dress to the general air around you. \n\nGood luck!",

Generally, this includes a spritz of cologne or perfume.\n\nOn interview day, skip that step.\n\nYou generally don\u2019t know where an interview will be held until the moment off. It could be in a small office, or a vacant conference room. You could be 2 feet away from your interviewer(s), or you could be 6+ feet away from them. If you\u2019re too close, the scent can be overpowering snd distracting.\n\nBeyond that, you never know what allergies a person may have, and the severity of them.",

During that time, it was my job to help those who were irate, annoyed, or sad that their product wasn\u2019t what they needed or was broken. I had one guy who came in extremely mad, because his electronic wasn\u2019t working. I spent the time to hear what the problem was and see what I could do to fix it. When I wasn\u2019t able to, i tried to see if replacing it would be a better option for him, instead of returning it completely. He wanted to return it completely, and so, I would make sure to stay calm and get a manager, since it was outside of the return policy. Once he had his money back, the guy was fine.\n\nI would be more specific in an actual interview, highlighting what the interviewer is looking for more of. Like if I want to show off my soft skills more, I would emphasize talking with the guy to help him calm down more. If I want to show the technical skills more, I would go into my troubleshooting steps.

Arriving early can also interrupt a flow of work that anyone preparing for the interview might have had. 5-15 minutes is the ideal range but I personally show up 10 minutes before.",
