We look at the slopes of process variable data to see if they are within specifications, and use statistics to determine how wide our specifications can be. We also use math equations and models to control all of the automated equipment in the manufacturing facility where I work as an engineer. If you have more questions, feel free to send me a message and I can really ramble on and on.",
