  "text": "This isn\u2019t my first year of college, but it\u2019s my first semester finished with straight As! I originally went for a Bachelors at another college and it didn\u2019t work out due to maturity, and then started again at community college; and once again dropped out due to substance addiction and depression (probably rooted in me failing the first time). I didn\u2019t quit this time, and now at my third try at college (going for an AA before the bachelor equivalent) I\u2019m doing much better and couldn\u2019t be more proud of myself despite this semester breaking me down multiple times. The classes were probably easy to most, but they were difficult for me. Still, I pushed through, studied and worked hard, and now I feel this sense of pride I haven\u2019t felt in a long while and am excited to get my AA by summer 2022. If this momentum continues, I\u2019d be happy to go for the BFA, but if life takes me down another route, I\u2019ll at least push to finish the AA and finally have something to show for all my effort :))) I regret quitting college before, but now is the time to be proud, as I\u2019m working towards something I love more. Just so happy!! Cheers! :)",
