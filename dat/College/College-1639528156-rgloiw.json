  "text": "I\u2019m in a calculus based physics course at a community college and our grade breakdown is kind of weird.\n\nHomework - 42%\nExams - 36%\nLab -10%\nQuizzes - 6%\nFinal - 6%\n\nI finished everything in the course and ended with an 86.5% in the class. The syllabus mentions a 60% or better on the final is needed to pass with a C or better, but I scored a 46% on my final. My final calculated grade is a B, would I still fail the course? I\u2019ve put in so much work and effort into this; has anyone else experienced this?\n\nUpdate: Professor emailed me about the status of my grade and offered I take a different exam. Studied for it all night and passed with a 90%; she only offered it to me due to my attendance in class and participation. Learned a valuable lesson today.",

      "text": "That\u2019s a weird policy tbh, from what I\u2019m understanding you needed above a 60 on the final to get a C in the class (and since this isn\u2019t what the math would work out to, it seems to be something the prof enforces?). If a C-, D, etc. is a passing grade at your school then I\u2019d think you would still pass the class, just not with a letter grade above a C.\n\nWhen the syllabus says you need a 60 or higher on the final to pass with a C, is it referring to passing the final with a C, or passing the overall class with a C?",

              "text": "It might be worthwhile to email your prof to clarify, assuming it isn\u2019t something that she\u2019s gone over in class or a syllabus quiz in detail previously. If you do, make sure you include the line from her syllabus (shows that you\u2019ve already read it and are only asking for clarification), and just mention you\u2019re unclear if you should expect to receive the calculated B, or a letter grade below a C due to your exam grade being less than 60. If you have a classmate\u2019s contact info, you could also try them first. hopefully it works out for the better!!!",

A calculation error!",
