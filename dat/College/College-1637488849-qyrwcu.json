  "text": "Hello, my son has been accepted to Humboldt State University for 2022 (Zoology) but he has yet to hear from Cal Poly SLO or the UCs where he would major in Evolutionary Biology/ Ecology. \n\nWe visited all the schools and I believe that HSU\u2019s campus, culture, class sizes and the Zoology major are the best fit for him. He is a herpetology (reptiles and amphibians) fanatic, and loves the climate of Humboldt, nature and fishing. \n\nHe is hoping for UC Davis, UCSC or Cal Poly SLO because he wants to study abroad and thinks if he is lucky enough to get into a UC or Cal Poly that he should go for those opportunities. Any thoughts or advice for us? \n\nI just want him to be happy and not as stressed as he has been these last two years of high school. He is a 4.0 student, always doing homework when not herping or doing internships.",
