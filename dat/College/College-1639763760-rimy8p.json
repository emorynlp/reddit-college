  "text": "I have testing accommodations due to illnesses. I received an email today that all students with testing accommodations would be proctored remotely online. I know that this professor makes his exams much harder (basically impossible to cheat for) when we're being proctored online and this exam was supposed to be in-person for me. I'm worried that he'll make a different exam for students with testing accommodations that will be way too hard for us to complete, I also think I'm the only student with testing accommodations in this class based on past experiences",

      "text": "A professor is entirely allowed to make different exams for students whether they are taking the exam together or at different times. However, these exams should be similar in format, covering the same material, and of equal difficulty. They are not allowed to target specific students or groups with different exams. That being said, variations in 'difficulty' are difficult to prove unless there is a major change in the exam format.",

For one thing it has unique markers on the exams because even though the exams are proctored some of them still seem to find a way to the internet.  Posting to the internet is a violation of academic integrity even if the intent was not to cheat.\n\nYes it is perfectly fine to give different questions to students, I do it all the time for quizzes and exams.  Different versions, different questions.\n\nEdit: students who have studied do not care they have different versions and questions.  I started doing this when a couple of student approached me about the cheating occurring with their classmates who shared their answers with others during quizzes and exams.  Hard to catch that when it is occurring.",

I feel that it's a bit unfair for the professor to give me a harder exam because of my testing accommodations (I am allowed extra time and a proctored small area, but they decided to make all exams with testing accommodations online today), I don't know how others feel about this though",

Basically my final exams are cumulative for all the information.   \n\nYour perception of harder is difficult for me to respond to as I do not try to make exams harder or easier.  I test different aspects of the material but that is true for the final exams given each semester.  They are not the same exams each semester.  Covering the same material for the class.",

When we were doing his class remotely for the first  month of the semester, the questions that the professor put on the quizzes were never straight forward. He always included a little trick in them or something that only someone who practiced for 100 hours would know how to solve. After we moved to in person classes, his quizzes were much easier and were just like the examples he showed us in class. I feel that it is easy to prove that the quizzes for the online classes were more difficult than the quizzes in the in person classes",

Or at least that would be my rationale. \n\nI think you are stressing about something over which you have no control.  Your time would be better spent on studying the material for your final exam and ensure you read the questions carefully in the exam.",

      "text": "It's very reasonable to make a different test for different students. If they are completely different levels of difficulty, that's not really acceptable. \nBut that would be difficult to prove. Test difficulty varies from student to student. One student may breeze by an equal test while someone else thinks it's super difficult. Bringing that up to your professor wouldn't reflect well I think. How could you prove it was really that different? I'm not saying this to be an ass, but if I was a professor, someone saying that would make me think they talked to other students who had already taken the test. \n\nGiving different tests for different students is very common to make cheating more difficult. It's very effective. Obviously if it's *super difficult* compared to the in-person one you might have some merit, but you have to prove that and also the professor may not be supervised in giving equal exams to all students. They may have the power to do that in your university.",

The quizzes that we did in the first month of the semester were so difficult that everybody failed and the TA had to adjust his grading scale, but now everyone passes since we're in person",
