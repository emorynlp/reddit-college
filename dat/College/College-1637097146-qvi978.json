  "text": "I\u2019m a junior doing pre-med. or was. Not sure anymore. I got hit by a car and got a TBI two years ago and I thought I\u2019d heal by now. Instead, I fell behind on ochem because I took an incomplete. I\u2019ve failed three classes so far. I\u2019m struggling with spelling simple words. I asked my advisors for help, the disability centre for help. None of them are helpful because my school would rather keep the prestige of my major. My advisors literally begged the dean to make an exception and allow me to take an extra year to graduate. The dean pretty much gave me a \u201csucks to be you but people here graduate in four years\u201d \n\nNow I\u2019m getting kicked out of my dream program and am now undeclared. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I feel like I have became stupid. It breaks my heart having to give up medicine as a career.",
