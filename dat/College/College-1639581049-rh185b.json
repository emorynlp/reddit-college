  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore in college, on my 4th semester, and I can\u2019t stop sabotaging myself. I was doing so good at the beginning of the semester, getting all of my work in, practicing for exams, the whole nine yards, but the minute I let myself skip a single assignment because I was sick it all went to hell and I couldn\u2019t recover after that. I started missing assignments, and even an exam. \n\nThis semester went better than most at first, being that I got through midterms without missing an assignment, but I\u2019m just so freaking upset with myself because I also crashed harder than ever before. I\u2019m failing two of my classes, which is fine I guess because I can just take them again but it\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m just so frustrated with myself for letting it happen, and I don\u2019t know what I can do to solve this. I love my major and I love what I want to do with my life but I can\u2019t bring myself to crack down and get shit done.\n\nI\u2019m a very \u201cchase the dopamine\u201d kind of girl, so it\u2019s so hard to find the motivation to keep going, and I\u2019ve had more than one breakdown this semester over it. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t seem to understand how I\u2019m feeling, even though he\u2019s tried. Has anyone else felt similar, and has any advise for me? \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve tried everything - keeping a planner, schedules, reminders on my phone, a notepad beside my bed, completing things early, but nothing\u2019s helped in the long term because I give up, like I do with everything else.",

Heavy workload, didn't grasp the content, trouble paying attention in class, etc.\n\nThis might be a discussion to have with a therapist/professional rather than a subreddit. It sounds like this self-sabotage could possibly be a behavioral thing (I'm not an expert at all, just guessing here).",

          "text": "Yeah, it\u2019s just hard getting in to see someone at school, like they are backed up for almost two months, and it\u2019s worse if I don\u2019t try to go through my school.\n\nI was kind of hoping that someone else has dealt with something similar and has any kind of advice for me in the meantime.\n\nThe one class is because I kept forgetting to turn in my assignments (not even a lot of assignments, and I even did them, just didn\u2019t turn them in). That\u2019s also the one I missed an exam in.\n\nThe other is because I\u2019m a music ed major and have to take a piano class, and that\u2019s not something that I can bs and cram in a couple hours before the exam (though in the latter half of the semester I certainly tried), and since I can\u2019t ever bring myself to practice I kept falling behind for tests and I didn\u2019t submit any of my practice sheets after midterms finished. Doesn\u2019t help I\u2019m not great with piano to begin with and have dreadful performance anxiety, so practicing is a horrible thing since the practice rooms are not sound proof and there are windows and my peers are snoops.",

I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s really the problem here, since I was doing just fine in the beginning and after midterms my semester was actually pretty light until after thanksgiving break",

      "text": "I can somewhat relate since I\u2019ve had the same issue. I\u2019d skip one homework and then that would just keep snowballing cause I\u2019d think, \u201cI\u2019m still learning so it doesn\u2019t matter if I only pass with a C as long as I pass.\u201d I would always pass with a C cause I\u2019d usually get an A or B on the final exam/paper and then regret it cause I knew I could have gotten an overall A if I had done everything else. \n\nEventually decided to change that. What worked for me was choosing a study environment where I could focus entirely on studies and structuring myself. I never study at home cause it\u2019s easy to get distracted in an environment where you\u2019re used to relaxing. The library is the best place and even when I\u2019m not feeling it, I still force myself to go everyday, not just a day before something is due. Sunday-Friday evening, if I\u2019m not working or in class, I\u2019m at the library till pretty much midnight. This also ensures that I\u2019m not rushing through homework and doing a crappy job or cramming stuff the night before an exam while I\u2019m also able to spend the weekend partying and having a social life. \n\nSo try doing that. Find an environment that your brain only associates with studying and structure your week. If you lose motivation, look at the grad school you want to go to or the dream job you want and fantasize about being there. That\u2019s definitely motivated me on days when I\u2019ve had the old urges to just forget it and fuck around. And avoid falling into the trap of thinking \u201cI only need to do this much to achieve xyz result.\u201d Just look at the semester on its own and aim for straight As. Even if you don\u2019t achieve that, you\u2019ll still come close and end up with good grades.",
