  "text": "To be clear: I'm not a political science or a humanities student. I know that politics are extremely important in those disciplines! I'm a STEM major, and am taking a Soil Science 101 class right now. The second that class starts, the professor complains about having to use a plexiglass divider and proceeds to NOT USE IT. And he said that he hates masks and if my college didn't require it, he'd snatch it off! He also proceeded to say that the USA has done more for the environment than any other country. He kept sprinkling in his conservative politics to all of the things he discussed. It drove me nuts. \n\nAlso, on the \"optional reading\" page on Moodle, there's an article about socialism being bad. He's a soil science professor! Why is it necessary to put all of your political convictions (which are bigoted and dangerous in this era of COVID) out in the open? This is going to be a fun semester.\n\nUPDATE: I filed a complaint to the dean's office yesterday. Today when I went into class, he used the plexiglass protector and did not complain about the mask at all. I don't know if it had anything to do with my complaint, but I'm quite happy nonetheless. He still voices his political opinions in class, but that's okay as long as he takes measures against COVID. Thank you all in the comments for your suggestions and affirmations.",

Also a lot of sexist, mysogonistic stuff, he straight up said 'you shouldn't talk about things like that cause you're a woman'. The thing in question was martial arts.

The distinction is minute but incredibly important.\n\nFor example, a political scientist might ask, \"What does the US's pattern of military intervention say about it's foreign policy doctrine\" but not necessarily \"Should the US intervene in Iraq?\". One question can be researched and answered with facts. The other is a matter of opinion and firmly in the realm of politics.\n\nFurthermore, every political science professor I've had for the last two years has openly described themselves as apolitical. Sure, they'll make a joke about the current president every now and then, but rarely do they express their overt political views on a specific issue or identify with a party.\n\nJust thought I'd put that out there :P",
