  "title:": "Should I stay in my school\u2019s rotc program?",
  "text": "I\u2019ll do my best to explain my situation in points.\n-I\u2019ve been through basic training camp and 3 months of ROTC but I still have no interest in ROTC and the military in general. \n\n-I only joined to pay for school but I haven\u2019t received any scholarship or grants. I\u2019m currently working my way through college. \n\n-Some pros of ROTC is that I could get a monthly stipend and graduate as an officer. \n\n- Enlisting after college seems right because it feels like most in my age range and area is barely making it in terms of paying bills.\n\n-My dad said seeing me commission as an officer would be one of the proudest days of his life. This is kinda pressure because if I drop out of rotc, I\u2019d be disappointing him and others in my family who wanted to see me join.\n\nI don\u2019t want to stay in ROTC but at this point it feels like the only way I can take care of myself after I graduate. Any advice?",

As much as he'd love to have a child who is an officer, he might be less thrilled if you got killed, right? Maybe he hasn't thought it the whole way through. It's also not worth making him happy if you aren't. Imagine he wanted you to be a doctor, but you couldn't stand blood and medical things?",

It\u2019s great career-wise.",
