  "text": "I am a freshman in college, and honestly, I was not expecting the lack of energy I have towards the end of semester.\n\nI was a straight A student in high school, but I knew that college grades are a different ball park, so I\u2019m fine getting Bs and Cs on more difficult classes.\n\nIt\u2019s just, at this point in the semester, I think I\u2019m burnt out. That\u2019s the best description. I can\u2019t focus on any lengthy assignment, I have no motivation, and physically, I\u2019m tired all the time.\n\nHow do you guys cope with burnout? I need to try and turn this around before finals.",
