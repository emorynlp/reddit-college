  "title:": "Pulled four all nighters and ended up sleeping through my midterm.",
  "text": "So it\u2019s my freshman year of college and I\u2019ve been here for about two months by now. Specifically, I attend an art school that\u2019s relatively rigorous in terms of workload. For the most part though I had been able to manage my work fine, but then midterms rolled in. I was pulling all nighters left and right for all of my projects and getting 0-2 hours of sleep almost every day. Today, I had a midterm in art history and I had the bright idea to once again, pull another all nighter. I thought I had the willpower to do so but I ended up passing out at around 7am and then waking up in horror at around 3pm. I had slept through all of my 37 alarms (Also apologies to my roommate I\u2019m trying to get better at it) and missed my midterm. I frantically emailed my professor and told him my situation and if there\u2019s a remedy to this whole disaster, but I have a good feeling he\u2019s not going to cut me any slack. I don\u2019t really know what to do at this point and if I should just withdraw from the class because the only grades we get are a midterm, final paper, and final exam. (the midterm is 25% of our grade haha end me) So if I get a 0 on the midterm is there really any hope for getting that up to a passing grade? Also if I fail a class does that mean I have to wait another year to graduate because I was a couple of credits short? I\u2019m honestly just confused and miss my dog\n\nEDIT: Got an email back from him and told me that I just have to deal with my mistake. Welp",

I say that I\u2019m pulling all nighters but really I\u2019m going to bed at 2 am and waking up at 6 am to study. That is much better than staying up through the night. At a certain point you don\u2019t even retain info anymore, so what\u2019s the point? Although, I do think the saying \u201cif you don\u2019t know it by 10 pm you won\u2019t know it at all\u201d is stupid because most of the tests that I\u2019ve gotten hundreds on are because of the last few hours of studying from 11-2 am. \n\nJust don\u2019t procrastinate. Start studying early. It took me a year to learn this, but pulling an \u201call nighter\u201d is self-sabotage and honestly just an \u201cedgy\u201d lazy kid thing to do. I\u2019ve had a 4.0 (taking 18 hours) the last two semesters of my junior year and I never pulled one all nighter.",

The trouble with college is that you have more free time, but you need to budget it for work. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many classes you have but if you seriously have too much work you need to talk to your advisor about class load. But I am suspicious that you seriously couldn\u2019t budget your time better to get some sleep. You\u2019re better off sleeping and not studying than the other way around.",

Beyond that, getting less than 8 hours of sleep consistently has been linked to alzhiemers (not spelled right?) Among other mental diseases. It is also linked to several cancers and to general physical fitness. I hope people read this and do their own research to find the value of sleep. I know this doesn't help your situation right now, but unfortunately it's gonna be your teacher\u2019s call on what happens with the test. Just remember, YOUR GRADES ARE NEVER WORTH YOUR HEALTH!",

Some of us are adjusting to college and all its new people and expectations, and must undergo time consuming emotional labor. Some of us get hit with random, unpredictable and unavailable migraines that make work impossible. \n\nSome of us are dealing with EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE.

So maybe don't be so judgmental, yeah?\n\n[edited for clarity]\nEdit again: y'all I'm not condoning always procrastinating to the last minute so you're constantly pulling all nighters.

Out in the \"real world\", if you consistently miss appointments and meetings, you're going to get in trouble and you will be penalised for it, sometimes very harshly. It simply isn't acceptable to skimp out on your responsibilities on a regular basis just because you suck at organising your life and slept through your alarm after pulling multiple all-nighters. \n\nYou also have to remember that no one cares what you do outside of X thing they're involved in. How you organise your golfing trips isn't your boss' responsibility, it's *yours*, and if you let golfing cut into your work without a very good reason, your boss has a right to be pissed at you. You're the one in charge of juggling all of this stuff that you've signed up for, and it's very important for young people to learn to say \"no\" to things because otherwise it's far too easy to oversubscribe yourself. Once you do that, you inevitably start missing important meetings and letting people down, and that isn't acceptable. \n\nYou need to find a way to manage your life in a way that lets you achieve everything at a reasonable standard. That limit is different for different people, and just because Tom from down the hall can juggle 4 jobs, 5 clubs, 17 majors, and a busload of kids, doesn't mean you can do the same. Freshmen get some slack and some time to figure this out, but you *do* have to figure it out because people won't accept it for long before they stop trusting you.",

In my experiance nearly everyone pulling all nighters before an exam are the ones who have sub 3.0 GPAs even though they are a lot smarter than that. Sleep is the most important part of school after showing up to the classes and getting assignments in on time. This is because a healthy  sleep schedule literally makes you remember and recall better. As well as this you don\u2019t feel like shit the whole day and it is easier to fall asleep. However it is hard to get into the rhythm at first especially if you have the bad habit of staying up late like I did. My advice is to try to start now and to start your sleep schedule a month before school starts that way you are used to it.",

And is it one for your major or just a class your getting out of the way? 25 percent will definitely knock a chunk out of your grade but it might not stop you from passing depending on what your grade was.\n\nAbout waiting to graduate that depends on how often the course is offered.

However, those should not be a regular thing and if they are, your balance (with one of the things I mentioned above) is wrong and needs to be adjusted.\n\nTo OP, I\u2019m sorry that happened to you, but I have to concur with the others.  If you\u2019re already struggling that hard (and MUST get 100% now on everything else) then your problem is only going to increase throughout the rest of the term.  If the professor will work with you, maybe examine your balance to see what you can fix.  If not, then drop class (that solves two problems, the stress of having to get 100 on everything else AND some of your workload, which will make you more successful in other classes).",

The scripts are heavily scrutinised and can basically only be filled on the same day they run out, so too bad if you're busy on that day, you'll just have to go without that critical medication. And if you get a bad roommate who decides to lift from your medication (it's a bigger problem than people realise), suddenly you're going to run out a few days early and you still won't be allowed to refill your prescription. \n\nPlus it's very hard now just to get the prescription in the first place. I had to see 3 independent specialists in ADHD in adults, even though my state only had one working at the time. It can force people who really need it for medical reasons into breaking the law.\n\nEdit: I should also say that I found it so impossible to get the prescription that I have to use a different kind of medication off-label now, but it has similar problems with people using it without prescription.",

Find out how your school factors retakes into your GPA. At my school, if you fail a class and retake it and get say a B, then the failing grade, while still on your transcript, doesn't factor into the GPA at all and is completely replaced by the retake. If your school does something similar I would suggest staying in the class even if you don't think you can get the C. For one, who knows you might surprise yourself and pull it off, and two, if you have to retake it, it'll be really easy the second time around. Retaking it (or withdrawing and taking it later) absolutely does not mean it'll take an extra year or even semester to graduate. You could either take it in addition to the other courses you would normally have one semester (which yes, would make you even busier, but if you learned it pretty well the first time around it should be manageable), or you could take it over a summer. You could see if your school will accept transfer credits from any community colleges, and if those colleges offer it online over the summer as that makes it quite manageable both time and money-wise. Though having it transferred will probably make the GPA factoring even more complicated. If that route sounds good to you I would suggest talking to an advisor about it, withdrawing might be better if you decide you want to take it somewhere else.",

In order to get a 75%, which IS possible, but if I were you I'd first contact the professor and explain your circumstances. If they tell you they can't allow you to make up the exam, I'd ask about extra credit opportunities. \n\nIf that isn't possible Id considering dropping the class BUT make sure there aren't any extreme consequences BEFORE doing that. \n\nWhat I mean by that is whatever major you're trying to do **you usually have to get into the major AFTER getting accepted into the college**. So say that you are an art major but you are not in the official art program yet. You need to research the requirements to get into the major and every university's art program has different requirements.\n\nFor example, some Universities have very strict programs and may not allow you to withdraw from ANY of the prereqs or give you a limited number of withdrawals or attempted retakes. And if you break the major requirements you may be completely barred from getting an art degree from the school and have to transfer to another school if you want a degree in the field. \n\nAll I'm saying is do your research before withdrawing a class. Otherwise, it may be more beneficial to stay in it and take the C.",

I never pull an all-nighter (willingly anyway... damn my insomnia), and am doing very well in my courses.\n\nYou honestly should never have to pull an all-nighter. Prioritize sleep above all else. Plan your projects better in the future so you work on them well ahead of time. Pulling all nighters is simply detrimental in all respects. The work you do during an all-nighter is likely shoddy scrapped together work. You lose out on sleep which affects your mental state the next day which will cause your academics to suffer down the line. And if it comes to it, you experience what you just experienced: missing a major course event.\n\nAnyway, you might pass even having missed the midterm but it will be an uphill battle the whole way, and the *very best* you can hope for is a C, and that's only **if** you get 100%s on everything else besides the midterm (including things you already turned in).\n\nHonestly, if it were me, I'd drop the class if the professor doesn't give you any other recourse. If you fail or your drop it you will be required to retake it, and you probably can figure out a time and way to retake it that doesn't extend your graduation date.",

I find myself racing from obligation to obligation 9AM-11PM, with it taking from 11PM-1 or 2AM to get my regular work done, and so big assignments are pulling me through the night lately. \n\nI've realized how unsustainable this is, though, and next term I fully plan to pull back and work less hours (+ no longer TA). I shouldn't have to pull all nighters then. \n\nHowever, I only have the privilege of doing this because I'm only working to save up toward paying my loans after undergrad, not because any of my daily costs of living aren't being taken care of. \n\nSomeone who is in a more precarious situation than me--actually having to work themselves through school--I could see not being able to make the same concession. They would probably cut back on their involvement on all the student life/resume-building stuff instead then (service work, clubs, orgs, socializing/being active in the community), but what if those things are important to them too? What if they don't want to cut those things either?\n\nSo I don't know if it's right to say there's never a reason to pull all-nighters in college. I could see someone going through the calculus and finding it worth it to resort to all-nighters in order to be (to themselves) a well-rounded individual. Is it a good idea? Probably not. Is it healthy? Definitely not. But maybe someone more dedicated than myself could do it. Idk.",

It doesn't matter how organised you are or how dedicated you are, at the end of the day you are always limited to 24 hours. \n\nIt's up to the individual if they want to sacrifice sleep, socialising, their grades, and/or their health, but those are *choices*. There is always the option to go part-time in your studies or to drop certain clubs, but those decisions come with their own downsides as well.

I don't think I ever went to that class on more than 4 hours of sleep.\n\nAdditionally, it took the school machine shop EIGHT WEEKS to make a part I needed for my senior design project. I got the part literally the day before we left for the competition (it doubled as a club competition project). AND they didn't do one one of the diameter reductions on the shaft (to be fair, it was rather small, easy to miss, fortunately ended up as a better more robust design anyway, and the machine shop was pretty overworked). But because they missed that one diameter reduction, I had to stay up until 4 in the morning and refabricate a new part to fit the shaft. And then I had to get up at 5 for that goddamn 8 am class with the 2 hour commute. So I went to school on a single hour of sleep that day due to an error on someone else's part, and I had to correct it that same night or everything up until the would have been meaningless. And yes, I was mostly useless for the rest of the day. But the point is that it's not always the result of poor planning on the student's part.",

It's much more common that someone just *wants* to graduate in 4 years so they can earn more money faster at the end or minimise their debt, but that is squarely a \"want\" and not a \"need\". And, if you push through as quickly as you can and end up delaying graduation because you fail classes, then it probably would have been better to go part-time and keep your health/grades in better shape. Or to put off university for 5-10 years until you're in a better position with more stable finances. \n\nLife is all about picking the lesser of two evils, and you'll rarely be faced with an easy choice. Managing the risks and consequences is your main job, and I'd see consistent all-nighters and mistakes like OP's as a sign of very poor risk management.",
