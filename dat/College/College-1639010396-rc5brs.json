  "text": "Worked all day on this project, pressed submit, officially no more assignments until January 19th. I\u2019m feeling something I\u2019ve never felt before. Like I could go up to John Cena and call him a bitch, or go 120 mph in my car rn, or like I could fly to the moon. Is this a normal feeling?",

And even after the semester is over, I need to study for an exam that I need to pass by December 31st of this year. I\u2019ll be studying a lot because I really do need to pass it if I want to continue next semester. And if I do pass it, I\u2019ll starting school on January 3rd. \n\nI\u2019m basically going to get no Christmas break his holiday season for the first time. But it\u2019s okay. At least I\u2019m graduating in May if everything goes well.",
