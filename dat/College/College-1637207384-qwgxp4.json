  "text": "I received a concussion a few days ago. I\u2019m taking a history course and have to write an essay for an assignment we have a total of 2 assignments and a midterm finale as a grades + participation in discussion.\n\nIssue being I\u2019ve missed so much this semester due to a still undiagnosed medical issue but have to stay in college to keep my scholarship so I got a 51/100 on the midterm and 76/100 on the first paper. The second paper rough draft is due to morrow counting as 10% of our paper and I haven\u2019t gotten past page 5 in the book and have to write 3-4 pages.  I just can\u2019t seem to string things together and no I did not wait until the last minute the concussion happened write after the assignment was given and my teacher won\u2019t budge on peer review (the 10%) \n\nAlso the papers due Tuesday. Any solutions or am I just fucked and about to loose my scholarships and have to add tens of thousands to my already increasing debt? \n\nHell this took me 15 minutes to type and it\u2019s not writing that\u2019s the issue it\u2019s my short term memory I\u2019ve tried taking notes but can\u2019t focus and remember long enough to figure out how to write it.",

      "text": "Get a note from the physician that diagnosed you saying that your cognitive functions are impaired and you need an extension. \n\nIf it persists I would also contact disability services, given they don\u2019t do much but some profs won\u2019t even think about an extension/accommodation without a letter from them.\n\nWorking with a concussion actually makes the recovery process longer so I\u2019m not sure why your prof wouldn\u2019t give u the extension. Your health should come before school.",

And it\u2019s not even a problem with my reading or writing per se but I can\u2019t remember is the issue and it\u2019s irritating me up the wall.\n\nMy physician didn\u2019t run any tests when I was diagnosed as he said that was most likely from the symptoms . It was a work place injury and had multiple 30lbs boxes from a stack just annihilate me. The issue was I didn\u2019t have to many symptoms to begin with other than slight disorientation that went a way but I guess after a multiple hits to the head didn\u2019t have the best judgment so they didn\u2019t file it. Was in a trailer so no cameras or anything to \u201cprove\u201d it definitely cannot afford an attorney. \n\nBasically I\u2019m currently dealing with two medical issues cannot fail or drop any classes this semester without loosing my scholarships (also it\u2019s in the finale 3 weeks so medical withdrawal will be difficult to get not to mention the waste of the Lon amount as I won\u2019t get a refund), and don\u2019t want to repeat either as basically I\u2019d have to take 2 loans for the same courses all over again.",

              "text": "I feel for you, I really do. I had two double concussions back to back that resulted in a TBI my sophomore year of college. When you have the time and are able please see a doctor to monitor your symptoms. \n\nAs for your schooling, I would submit what you can for tomorrow morning and then email your professor to see if you can meet with them in person to figure something out for the remainder of the semester. Most physicians just diagnose concussions based off the impact, some may do a CT but either way it\u2019s not your profs business to ask for your CT results if you were already diagnosed with a concussion & have medical records proving that. \n\nAt this point all you can do is ask and see what happens. I was fortunate and my profs were really open to working with me and what I could do when I first got diagnosed. I hope that yours would do the same.",

Have ADHD on top of it so the memory and focus already sucked thank god for Adderall because with out it the concussion on top of the ADHD would\u2019ve been a massive blow. I was trying to get disability accommodation but as my issue is still very unknown with multitudes of negative tests (random GI bleeding) I\u2019m at this point just tired. And loans are adding up at 12k and if I loose my scholarships it\u2019ll be adding an extra 15k to my loans by the end not to mention if I end up having to repeat any classes.\n\nI wish I could submit the draft for tomorrow morning but the requirement is to print and bring it to class and basically peer review with another student and have to have it atleast 75% done. \n\n\nAnd sorry to hear about your TBI that\u2019s a really shitty situation.",

I also never believed in functional medicine for the longest time but after having one and mixing it with my traditional doctor it\u2019s the best i\u2019ve ever felt. \n\nI guess another option would be to try voice diction on your document and just turn in that. I know it\u2019s hard with a concussion cause you can have slurred speech n stuff but you don\u2019t have to concentrate as much talking as you would typing. Might be worth a shot? \n\nI hope you feel better. Feeling like sh*t with no answers is miserable.",
