  "text": "Do you need an associate's degree? An old teacher and family friend of mine was saying I need to pick classes that fit the graduate requirements for my associates, but my other friend said you don't need an associate. I would rather not do it because I want to take classes I am interested in like anatomy, biology, chem, etc. I only need to take one life science class to get my associate's, and I have already taken one; taking another life science won't count towards my associates, making it useless. This might not even make sense, and my apologies if it does not; I am only entering my second semester of college so I am still relatively new to this. A lot of the general classes needed for my associates are easy as well, so taking these are just going to be a bunch of As and I feel colleges will see that and be turned off. It will just be boring af pursuing an associate's and milking a bunch of easy general classes when I would rather be taking classes of interest, and that looks better to college. All of this credits stuff has me kind of confused, and I can't get an appointment with a counselor before the upcoming semester. Also, sorry for the probably poor grammar; I am still trying to improve it after years of shit posting on the internet with autocorrect.",

      "text": "Check if your state has deals with junior college and state colleges. Like in VA I went to GMU from RBC with my associates and had all my gen ed courses waived through the guaranteed admission program. You could do that and try it out, while taking more science courses, because you need electives as well, which your extra science courses could fill out.",

      "text": "It depends. There are strengths and weaknesses with an associates. It\u2019s not for everyone and it\u2019s not required for a bachelors. But there are some benefits to an associates some schools offer easy transfers and guarantee admittance into a program with one. It put your credits in a degree that makes those credits transferable  for life.  \n\nFor instance if you studied math and or science in some schools those credits would expire after 5-10 years but if it\u2019s in a degree the degree is still valid and grants you access to the school. This really only helps people who take breaks in between their education. If you are pursing a bachelors through out your classes will be locked in when you get the bachelors. Meaning you can take the masters at any time. So while associates have their uses they really don\u2019t matter. When I talk about my 4 degree my father always corrects me and says 3.  He doesn\u2019t think the associates counts to my degree count. \n\nMy employer acknowledges all of them. But I don\u2019t get paid more for having more degrees then my coworkers. What got me the job was my bachelors. People only really care about your highest and latest degree imo.",
