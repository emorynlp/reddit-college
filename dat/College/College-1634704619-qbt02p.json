  "text": "I think I did well! I'm taking a Computer Science Theory class and it's the hardest class I've ever taken (that, or Fundamentals of Programming Language). I got a 3/15 on my first quiz so I wasn't confident going into the midterm even though I studied for so for so long. I knew the answer to every question, it's just a matter of how many small mistakes and partial credit I made, if any.\n\nDoes anything feel better than relaxing after taking a stressful ass exam? The relief I'm feeling is unreal lol.",
