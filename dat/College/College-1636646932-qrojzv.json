      "text": "To my understanding, an associate degree is either an AA or an AS. An AA (Associate in Arts) is general education which to my knowledge most universities have you do anyways. An AS (Associate in Science) is a more narrow focused degree that is meant for joining the workforce after you earn it.\n\nSo for example if you get an AS in accounting, that means in two years you'll have a degree suited to getting you into entry level jobs in accounting. However to my knowledge AS degrees cannot be used to get a bachelor's, but talk to an advisor about that because I'm far from an expert and things vary from state to state. What I was told was that you can \"double major\" by getting an AS in two years, and then get a bachelor's in 4 years for a total of 6 years. But an AS doesn't replace your first two years of a bachelor's, like an AA does.\n\nI can tell you with confidence though, is what a lot of people do is they go to a community College for their AA to then transfer to a university for their bachelor's. That's what I'm doing now.",
