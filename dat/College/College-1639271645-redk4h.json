  "title:": "I got a 95% on my final semester project I worked so hard on!",
  "text": "I was so paranoid about failing the project, especially since it took so much effort and time to complete. It was a project for Astronomy wherein I used a telescope to observe the moon for 14 consecutive nights, document in detail what I saw each night, then pick out a specific feature on the moon, and write an argumentative research essay about the feature I picked and how sending an Apollo-style mission would support one of the four theories on the formation of the moon. \n\nSo yeah. It was a lot, but I got my A. Now, all that stands in my way of a break is my semester final test, but I\u2019m not afraid of that because even if I got a 0% on it, I\u2019ll still pass this class with a high B.",
