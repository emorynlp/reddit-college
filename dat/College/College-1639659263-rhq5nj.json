  "text": "Hello.\n\nI have a bachelor (3-year program where I live) in Business Economics, and I am now pursuing a master (2-year program) in Management. It was the only course offered in english (my native language is italian, and getting a degree in another language is a plus for most employers), and I am going to graduate in less than a year so switching is definetely not an option. I also know my job prospects are decent, since most of the graduates from previous year landed jobs in Big4 firms and the likes.\n\nI am asking to solve a personal issue. After doing some research, turns out \"Management\" is the worst business major you can choose according to prominent youtubers in the field. Given it's the US perspective - in Italy we don't really do any differentiation in terms of major, we just say we have a \"degree in business\" and companies rarely ask for specific degrees in their job postings.\n\nRegardless, the fear of studying something 'dumb' or 'too generic' is a source of anxiety for me. It may be really stupid and you can think that if you want, but it's irrational and I just can't shake this feeling. I am also not looking for pity, so can you please give me your honest opinion on how valuable the topics I've studied are? Do you think the course is too generic? If not, what profession do you think best suits me?\n\n**FIRST YEAR**\n\n* **Planning and control** - Budgeting and financial Planning; Development and implementation of balanced scorecards; Performance measurement systems; Development of a profit plan; Development of incentive Systems. We also did a project work in which we worked in teams to create a balanced scorecard plus strategy map for a merchandiser.\n\n* **Cost management** - Strategic cost analysis; Cost allocation; Quality management; Costing methods (target, product life cycle, volume, etc); Value chain cost analysis; Benchmarking analysis; Theory of constraints.\n\n* **Risk management** - Financial institutions; Market risk management; Credit risk management; Liquidity risk management; Operational risk management; Financial derivatives; Financial regulation. We also did a project work in which we analyzed a portfolio of derivatives with the goal of transfering market risk.\n\n* **Quantitative methods** - Statistical topics using R for analysis, such as PCA, Linear regression, Probit, Logit, Linear discriminant; Sources of statistical information; Economic indicators; Quantitative financial statements analysis; Time series analysis.\n\n* **Game theory** - Expected utility theory; Strategic games; Nash equilibrium; Extesive games; Subgame equilibrium; Cooperative games and Shapley value; Principal-Agent model.\n\n* **Business strategy** - Competitive advantage; Macro environment analysis; Micro environment analysis; Offensive and defensive strategies; Internal analysis. We did a project work were we produced an industry report on the ecommerce players.\n\n**SECOND YEAR**\n\n* **International economics** - Trade policies; Efficient and inefficient markets; International trade; Foreign exchange market; Open macroeconomics; Shocks and interdependences; International monetary system; Economics crisis and spread. We are going to have to produce a research paper as part of the exam.\n\n* **Entrepreneurship** - Startup development systems and Business planning. This is going to be 90% practice with little to no study, where the professor will ask us to develop a business idea by the end of the semester and present it in the form of a business plan.\n\n* **Corporate strategy** - Corporate advantage and synergies; Resource theory and its applications; Diversification theory; Vertical integration; Mergers and acquisitions; Greenfield investments, alliances and coopetitions. We'll spend about 50% of the course studying cases and producing reports and analysis on them.\n\n* **Global management** - Globalization strategies; International supply chain management; Strategic planning for global companies; Emerging markets. We are going to do a project work where we need to produce a country risk assessment for an imaginary company looking to enter a new market.\n\nThen we have to choose two free subjects. I went with **Marketing strategy** and **International accounting** (I wanted to add more strategy and quantitative aspects to the course - but I can still change them so if you have suggestions to make it more focused I'm more than open).",
