  "title:": "How do you deal with death and declining health in family while at school",
  "text": "Hello, \n\nI was wondering how everyone here deals with people within their immediate family passing and also having loved ones who are going to pass at any moment. Currently, 3 of my family members have cancer and last week another one passed away. I had 2 exams this week and another one tomorrow. The funeral is today and people within my family have advised me not to make the trip and to focus on school and visit when I can. I feel extremely guilty if I miss, and I feel guilty for not being with my loved ones who do not have much longer on this Earth. \n\nThank you for any replies or advice.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the suggestions / personal experience. I appreciate it immensely",

No-one can expect no family issues to even come up. If you need to take a break, that's what you have to do due to extenuating circumstances.",

A couple bad grades will not matter in the long run, but getting to spend time with your loved ones absolutely will. \n\nMost of all, make sure you have people to talk to. These situations come with a massive mix of crazy and hard to understand emotions, and it\u2019s important to know that anything you\u2019re feeling is 100% valid, and to have one or more people you can work through them with, whether it\u2019s a family member or a therapist or a friend. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.

My friends told me to talk to the professors but I was just not ready for that (I think a few went behind my back and quietly told at least one or two quietly). Fortunately my grades had been good so I stumbled into finals and passed everything.\n\nLooking back, I went into a deep depression that affected the following year of school that I didn't bounce out of until my last year. I really wish I had sought out mental help but that was really not a thing back then. I thought about taking a leave but feared if I left I'd be really lost. Instead I took creative writing classes and took out my frustrations there (got a lot of nice As from that).\n\nOn the other hand, I lost my last grandmother when I was 18 and I think I just took the day to go to the funeral (in her early 80s, she had been in poor health for a while so it wasn't unexpected).",

It sounds like your family is trying to support you and your goals which is great, but a part of grieving is giving yourself the emotional availability to process it. Like others have said, school will always be there, but your emotions now, in this moment, need to be listened to.

The first prof I told instructed me to also reach out to the Dean of Students office to let them know about my situation. I did so and found out they have a Student Care Coordinator who deals directly with situations where students have a long-term family emergency and need accommodation. She helped me out with reaching out to my profs and letting them know what the situation was and also gave me info on some resources my school has to deal with situations like this.\n\nWe probably don't go to the same school and we probably have 2 different situations going on, but I'd recommend reaching out to your Dean of Students' office. They probably have the resources available to make it easier for you to reach out to profs and figure out how to approach your academics during a tough time like this.\n\nAgain, I'm really sorry to hear about your family. I hope you can find peace and comfort in the future. Fuck cancer.",

Please spend time with your family. One of my friends missed her grandmothers funeral for midterms and it was extremely detrimental to her grieving process. She ended up having to take a break from school for therapy and time to grieve. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this, nobody deserves to be in this situation. School won\u2019t go away, but this chance to grieve with family is a one time chance to remember a loved one.",

I would suggest that too, especially if you tend to want to take care of yourself and your problems. But also, listen to what you want to do for your mental and emotional sake. If you want to attend the funeral, do so because you\u2019re letting yourself grieve. Do whatever you can to help yourself get through this time. If you can\u2019t take care of yourself because of your grief and worry for your family, it\u2019s okay to let people take care of you. I had to get my significant other to email my professors for me about my mother\u2019s passing, letting them know that I absolutely could not do any work. Not all people are bad in this world. It\u2019s important to let your professors in the know of things like this so they can figure out how to help you. I just hope they\u2019re willing to help you out. This is a heartbreaking situation, and I hope you feel better after everything. I also have a family member who doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left at the moment, and it is tough. Your mind and body will absolutely tell you what you need. Be open to yourself so you can get through the days and many more. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me.
