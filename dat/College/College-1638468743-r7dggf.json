  "text": "I have ADHD and it makes getting stuff done very challenging. I have a really good gpa and keep my grades up but it is a constant struggle. The doctors say I am fine and don\u2019t need medication to help because I get good grades. But I regularly struggle for hours to get myself to focus long enough to complete a simple assignment. This leaves me with late nights and little sleep. Yes I do good work and I am smart but the struggle it takes to get typing the paper or doing the project can be so huge! How do I get help? Any tips and tricks for focus",
