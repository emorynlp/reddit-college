  "text": "Next spring I am going to be rooming with 4 other people for the first time after the pandemic. 2 of which I've known since highschool and 2 I met in uni. Unfortunately one of the uni friends won't be able to room with us and we only have a group of 4 now. Normally this would be fine we just search for a living space with 4 rooms.   \nHowever the 2 friends from highschool want to include this other person (John Doe) into our group now that we only have 4. Problem is I never liked this John back in high school. Honestly I have no idea why he just has a weird vibe, and frankly I find him a little obnoxious. Since I have no legitimate reason to why I don't want him to live with us, and the other 2 believe he would be alone if we don't take him I don't want to say anything. But I know for a fact living there is gonna be effort now.   \nShould I confront them even though I have no justification, I feel like I'm being unreasonable.",
