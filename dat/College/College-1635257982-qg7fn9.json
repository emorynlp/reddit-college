  "text": "I just realized there is a course fee for the senior design class (required). It's $80/semester... this doesn't seem too crazy. And we have lab equipment and whatnot available to us. BUT, I just want to explain what the senior design class entails. Companies pay the university *a lot of money* to have students work on their projects. Our sponsor paid our college $17,500.... $10k is allotted for the project budget (we definitely won't be spending more than a few thousand though), and the other $7,500 is presumably kept by the university. \n\nThe university doesn't really do anything for the project except assign students to it and provide advisors that we meet with about once a week. The students do all of the design and work. But the university pockets that $7,500 AND THEN make us all pay $160 to work on the project that they have already been paid for.\n\nMakes me mad. I asked the dean about this situation and she forwarded the email to the department chair... for me to be promptly ignored.",

I guess my point is that a company paid the university $7,500 to have students complete a project and then charged the students $160 each to complete the project...\n\nit would be like if I hired a contractor to fix my roof and then that contractor told his little brother \"hey, fix this roof and then pay me\".",
