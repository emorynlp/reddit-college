  "text": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m a high school junior from Morocco. I have always wanted to study at a top US university. My grades are pretty good, and I also started preparing for the SAT, but I think I lack in extracurriculars, my only ones are sports and an internship I did in freshman year. Here in Morocco, there aren\u2019t a lot of options, things like academic clubs, theater, math olympiad\u2026 What do you think ?",

      "text": "Are you on a sports team? If so, stick with that- many colleges appreciate consistency (so if you\u2019ve been doing the same sport over high school, that would look good). Adding extracurricular would also be good if you can find one (doesn\u2019t have to be huge). I would also recommend trying to find volunteer opportunities.",
