  "text": "I have some questions regarding a proctored exam through canvas. My professor has accused some students in my class of cheating so he decided to make the exam proctored. He proceeded to tell us that our cameras will be watching us, it will pick up any sound we make, will notify him if we leave the tab. The exam is open book, open notes, open slides. How does that work?",

          "text": "I just want to make sure I can use my notes without being accused of cheating. I also want to know if its true that they have access to like your camera and microphone. I have made 30 pages of notes for this exam and I'm gonna be pissed off if I can't use it. Also the professor has no idea what the proctoring is like, he said it himself in lecture so I can't ask him for more information. I was hoping someone whos experienced it can tell me exactly how it works.",

              "text": "A proctored exam means your web screen is recorded, and the webcam and microphone are on. Also, someone may or may not be watching you as you take the exam. They can stop the exam any time and chat with you about certain things like fixing the view of your webcam, etc. \n\nThe exam should have parameters listed so the one proctoring the exam is aware notes are allowed. I would ask your professor specifically about this. Because it\u2019s it\u2019s not listed come time of the exam, you may not be able to use them without the risk of being accused of cheating.",
