  "text": "I needed to take classes to fulfill requirements for a graduate program. Ive been slowly filling the requirements with online classes in the past. However, now that most schools are online, I have a wider selection. Should they be cheaper since there is less overhead? How do those that are currently taking classes feel about taking classes online?",

      "text": "No. Not because they shouldn't but because they largely can't. Two reasons -- one about short-term finances and one about long-term economics. First, the short term. I (a university staff member) was on an email reviewing the costs of developing/supporting hundreds of new online classes and dealing with COVID generally: it was an unplanned cost of more than $20 million for my medium sized school. There's always a worthwhile debate about how a school should use its budget, but on January 1 this year, every dollar already had its spot in the budget and then suddenly two months later millions had to be reassigned just to keep the institution safe and running and to provide some simulacrum of an education. So for this semester, the answer to \"should universities be cheaper\" is no, simply because they can't.\n\n(In case someone mentions endowments, etc., I can talk about some reasons they aren't great options for addressing these costs.)\n\nThe second, long-term reason is the same economics that are going to kill a lot of businesses with fixed costs: all income streams are going to be hammered and schools are going to have to make guesses as to which streams can be maintained. Universities revenues are tuition/fees, investment returns, real estate (spaces they own but lease to others), intellectual property, grants, and donations. Investments (thus endowments) are tanking, foundations and government are making fewer and smaller grants, and donors have less money to give. Unfortunately that leaves tuition...it's not a matter of what's fair at this point, it's a matter of \"How do we balance the books enough that we can promise students there will be school at all next year?\"\n\nSo to be clear. Some of you are currently at schools that will fail in the next few years, maybe less, if we don't have a very quick recovery. (If you're at a small liberal arts college with a small or heavily restricted endowment, you need to finish your degree yesterday.) Most of you are at schools that will survive but don't have the option to cut tuition. A small number of you are at schools that theoretically *could* cut tuition, but they'll be loathe to because they currently have no idea how to value those other revenue streams.",

Term appointments (what my school calls lecturers) definitely could have their pay cut next year, but not in time to cut tuition this year...but they're as underpaid and overworked as hourly workers already. Junior (pre-tenure) faculty aren't much better off.\n\nA practical issue is that everyone tends to spend what their income allows them to, usually on illiquid assets like a house, retirement fund, or their kid's college fund. For them to truly contribute to the common good, you'd have to convince them (or they convince each other) that they should move to cheaper housing at a time they'll have trouble selling their house, to cut back on retirement contributions when they've seen the value of their non-pension fund crash and wonder if their university will cut their pension, and to shift the burden of paying for college more toward their kid, which would be a little ironic.\n\nI'm not making an argument for what the right or moral thing to do is. Just that \"cut professors' compensation\" is a higher bar than you might think.",

I mean, it probably wasn't unilaterall, but maybe there could be discussions about that?

      "text": "I think that it should be the same price or a little cheaper since they still have to hire professors to teach the class and that is the biggest expense is overhead, although I take issue with the extra $75 online fee. I understand they need to run the online program but for me at least the online program is the same class website. Also at my school if there is enough kids enrolled (above 45) the professor gets a portion of the $75 fee per student which is interesting to say the least.\n\nAnother issue is if the professor actually teaches, at my current school I only have had 1 online class out of 5 where the professor has put in the time to make audio recordings or PowerPoint's. The other 4 classes have just been read the textbook (teach yourself) and do weekly discussions and hand in assignments. I would like there to be a discount if we are basically teaching ourselves because it's frustrating to pay full tuition to read a textbook on our own. Basically paying $1,000 to read a textbook that only costs $150 (still expensive). I get the professor can answer questions over email but it does not justify full tuition in my opinion.\n\nOnce again this is my opinion but I would like to hear what others have to say\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Found the distance education fee portion of the CBA: \"They shall receive an additional $75 for each additional five (5) students per work assignment, over the forty\u2010five (45) student minimum rate, to a maximum of an additional $375.00 per work assignment.\"",

Professors do not get paid extra for meeting you face to face. Online video conferencing services are also COSTLY. \n3. Depending on the class, you may or may not be required to purchase additional software that could be very costly. If you think textbooks are expensive, then you should see how expensive some educational online labs are.\n\nYou might be thinking \"but the online schools such as Phoenix university are cheap\". This is because those online schools are half scam half education. Their education outcome is basically a joke in comparison to fully accredited universities.

It has always bothered me that public universities show that they value athletics, etc. more than education by paying 500,000+ to coaches, but then relying on adjuncts who might make $1200 per course to teach all levels of undergraduate courses.  I know they make money with athletic programs, etc, but the vast majority never make a profit. I don\u2019t hate sports, but I often wonder if a farm league model would be better for those who go into college programs hoping to be recruited to the big league and still have intramural teams on campus for those who want that competitive experience while obtaining a degree since their final goal is not the NFL, etc.",

Online courses have a very high drop out rate normally and that's for people who chose to take them in the first place.\n\nI had a 3.5 GPA last semester and I'm totally phoning it in right now. And if we're not having in person classes for the fall semester I'm not going back full time. In this format I'll take 6 credits at the most.\n\nI understand that the academics in college strongly believe in what they teach. Lots of professors out there really want to pass down knowledge, they don't want to just hand out degrees to idiots, but I feel this format is going to push kids out of school. Colleges are going to loose students and they might not come back. Administrators should really consider either just passing us, or just giving us the finals and calling the semester. I understand we're not going to learn as much as they want this way, but at least they'll retain most of the students.

Add in the fact that should I encounter any issues it's a bloody circus of e-mailing people to get things resolved, last time this happened I got sent from one person to the next over a chain of like 6 people because each one was like \"oh no I don't deal with this e-mail this person\". *GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.* \n\nSO much gets sacrificed in online studies and it's completely unfair to students.

Professors still gotta get paid even if they aren't on campus teaching in person. Buildings are still owned and need to be maintained by the university so that's another cost that can't really change. Everything else might make up ~$1000 per semester. The biggest cost in that group should be tutoring which can still be offered remotely as well. Library access also gets you access to numerous online resources which is still available remotely. So, if you take those out you're now left with very little in actual cost cuts. Every bit helps but realistically you're going to be very disappointed if they do cut costs and you still don't see much of a change.",

For example, \"fair use\" of copyrighted materials is much more strict for an online course in which materials will be presented in written form instead of verbally in a face-to-face setting. Disability accessibility requirements are also more complex. And because those requirements are more complex, the university has to hire more educational technology experts to certify courses. Plus, the software used to do various things from making video lectures to proctoring exams all costs extra money.
