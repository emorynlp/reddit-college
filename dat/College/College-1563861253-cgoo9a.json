I've also taped the punch holes for formula sheets which are placed in the front and use reinforced graph paper for notes. That thing has gone to hell and back with me. It's as heavy as a thick text book but I love having everything calc in one place. I plan on doing the same for my physics binder. When the proof says \"oh you remember back in (insert class from years ago you don't remember)\" I can just flip straight to my notes and refresh. It's like having my own personal text book for calc, tailored for me by me. Definitely plan on bringing this bad boy with me to my job, if only as a trophy.",
