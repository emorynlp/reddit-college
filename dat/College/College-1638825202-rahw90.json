  "text": "I am returning back to school to pursue physical therapy degree at 30yo. In spring I will be starting with my undergrad at my local CC and then transfer to a state school. My first semester courses are: Art History, Into to Kinesiology, Pre-Calc and Yoga. I also need to take either Anatomy and Physiology I + LAB or General Chem I + LAB. \n\nIf I take A&P first, I will be able to transfer to a four year school a semester sooner. I will also be able to have my classes be a bit more linear and a natural flow based on the four year schools example of what courses to take when. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, I see that General Chem is a 'recommended (not prereq)' course before taking A&P, **will AP be too difficult without the prior knowledge of General Chem?** **How much will General Chemistry aid me in A&P?**",

      "text": "Nursing major here, had to take both A&P 1 and 2. You dont need chemistry really. Further into a&p usually a&p 2 you talk about only 4 elements which IMO isn\u2019t worth taking a whole chemistry course over. But since you are only taking a&p1 you shouldn\u2019t need it.",
