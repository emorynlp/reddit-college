  "text": "Can't believe this is my first post ever but here goes:\n\nDoes anyone else drink while doing homework/studying? I was just craving some beer in the middle of some work so I started on a bottle and now I feel more motivated/energized. Any other folks out there that do the same?\n\nAnd I'm not talking about getting hammered or anything, just having a nice cold drink on a warm night.",

Sometimes I\u2019ll have tea, hot chocolate, or sometimes lacroix. The reason being I don\u2019t want to subconsciously link productivity to alcohol. That seems to me like a fast track to accidentally develop alcoholism.\n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal approach, and in general - I don\u2019t see any reason not to drink while working.",
