  "text": "What do I do? I havent been tested yet, so im not 100%, it might just be the flu since I normally catch the flu at this time of year every year, but I will get tested to be 100% sure. If my test comes back positive what I can do? These classes are both in person classes, one of them having 0 online work (the d2l page is literally blank). I feel like if my test is positive, and I email my school they will think that I am just trying to get out of finals to cheat or something. Ive done pretty well in this classes, having an A in both. What should I do?",
