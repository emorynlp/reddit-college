  "text": "Im a freshman and its already time to get ready for the spring and summer semester!! I dont have any experience in STEM research but I really want to at least try to apply to some summer research programs in my field. \n\nLike most applications, they ask for two letters of recommendation, but I've only been at this school for three months and it feels in-genuine to ask any of my teachers for a letter since my classes are big and i dont really know them personally. \n\nIf anyone has some tips for asking/finding people to write letters or rec. please let me know. Or if anyone has experience in summer research programs i'd love to hear that too!!!",

      "text": "I did an REU between my sophomore and junior years (in math). Like you, I didnt know anyone well enough in freshman year to earn two letters. However, both of my letter-writers in my sophomore year were people I met in my freshman year. One was a professor who I took a class with freshman year, the other was a professor who I met in practice meetings for a math competition who I later took a class with. So my suggestion might be to get to know your current professors now. Even if you don't get a letter from them for Summer 2022, if you take a class with them again then they will be able to write a stronger letter next year.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for things you could do this year, though",
