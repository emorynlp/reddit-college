  "text": "Hi y'all. So I'm a sophomore in college and I feel exhausted. Like this isn't just a \"make it to winter break\" type of exhaustion. My mental health is the worst it's every been and I just got a promotion at work that means I'm going to have to work more and it all feels like too much. Not to mention I've lost so much self confidence because I've not had time to work out.\n\n I should also mention that I'm an online student. I moved to campus freshman year but had to do online classes bc of covid and I decided to move 4hrs back home this semester bc it still felt too risky. I was supposed to study abroad next semester but that got cancelled once again because of covid. So that brings us to now. I can either try to squeeze in another semester of online classes before moving back to campus in the fall or I can transfer to a college closer in the spring but lose my scholarships. \n\nI've had time to this about this for a few months but every time I do, I just end p breaking down because I just want a break. I feel like I just need some time to fully focus on me and become a better version of myself. The college I currently attend will even hold my scholarships for a semester. However, I feel like such a failure for doing so. Im a 4.0 student and I feel like my family will think I'm pathetic or that I won't go back. I know that everyone has their own path in life and I shouldn't compare to others but its just so difficult. What should I do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: How do I convince myself that taking a semester off is okay and I'm not a total failure",

      "text": "It's your life, your goals. You're in college because you want to open up more opportunities for yourself, not because you want to impress your friends and family. \n\nCollege is not a race to completion, and the more you treat it like it is the more likely you're gonna trip and fall. You will feel much more confident, collected, and prepared for your workload if you took a break. I knew quite a few students at my school who saw the writing on the wall regarding their mental health and tried to push through it. It wasn't uncommon for them to halfway through the semester have a nervous breakdown, see sharp decline in the quality of their work, or find themselves abusing things like stimulants or anti-anxiety medications.\n\nThe smarter ones would withdraw there. The others tried plowing through and ended up in a worse position than they were from the last semester. Some lost their scholarships, some possibly owed money, all of them set themselves back. \n\nTake the semester off. It's far more common than you'd believe. Your school holds that scholarship for a semester because they anticipate these exact circumstances. You are not a failure for utilizing the options afforded to you. However bad you feel about taking a semester off, you will definitely feel worse if you try to force yourself to stay in and your mental health begins to sabotage your grades. \n\nI took 2 years between my Sophomore and Junior year because I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and needed to stabilize my life. It didn't feel good at the time, but years later after graduating it really didn't matter to anyone and I'm glad I did things the way I did.",

          "text": "To second this commenter, I\u2019m a college advisor. And I see students in a variety of situations. \n\nIf you\u2019re in a spot where you truly need a break, take it. If you keep pushing you\u2019re at risk of having a full breakdown mid-semester and tanking your grades because you\u2019re focusing on your grades rather than your health. \n\nThis focus can work, for a while. But it always breaks down, it can just take a bit longer. If you truly need the break, please take it. If your school is willing to put a pause on your grants then it means that they know this happens. College is hard, and there are a ton of situations that can make taking classes in a certain semester miserable. \n\nI encourage my own students to take these breaks when they\u2019ve reached their own limits. Trying to force a semester to happen when your brain just can\u2019t function truly isn\u2019t worth it.",

I mean  do something with a productive outcome. \nI mean I wouldn't care what others think about me.( whether my parents or others). \nAll of my family and friends havecso many genuises almost a coincidence causecall of them are like 1 in 100 elites except me. I just go on and don't care about them. \n\nThere are tons of people who have taken years off let alone a semester. \nIt's quite common in India. And there's nothing wrong in taking breaks \nSo it's completely fine. \n\nMental health is more important than any kind of education.",

If not, consider how you would respond if someone said this about any other student in the same situation. You'd probably think they're an unreasonable asshole. So, cut yourself a break and stop spreading this unhealthy viewpoint by projecting it onto yourself.",
