  "text": "I have taken AP physics C mechanics and am now taking e&m in my senior year. Both of these classes have kicked my ass, especially e&m. I'm barely passing e&m but I did well enough to get a B in mechanics. I want to major in materials engineering so I'll have to take calc physics in college.\n\nHow different are the two? Which ones more difficult or are they basically the same? Any advice would help greatly.",

          "text": "I would second this. If there is any way you can work your butt off to get a good score on the AP exam I would do it. I might even try and take the mechanics test this year if you can. It will save you money, reduce your course load, and he's right these classes are way easier in high school. Most college stem courses will have a very thorough homework assignment between every single class, and the class like physics will also have a lab that is much more in-depth then the time and effort you would put in in a high school lab.\n\nI'm also going to put a plug in for my major, chemical engineering. You'll learn a ton about material properties, but it's much more general and diverse.",

                  "text": "I wouldn't be concerned at all. To be 100% honest, a majority of your non major courses like physics calculus chemistry etc, are not directly important for your engineering major when it comes to specifics. As long as you can take a derivative or a simple power rule integral, or have a general understanding of how gravity or electric fields are inverse square relationships, or other similarly general ideas, that will be more than enough of a foundation for your chemical engineering courses. Ironically enough, most chemical engineers at my school, their least favorite class was physical chemistry, and upper level chemistry course.\n\nTaking it in high school is also going to be a huge boost to you. I transferred schools and took a couple Gap years in between, but the one course I have to retake because it didn't transfer, was twice as easy the second time around, and I got a better grade in it.",
