  "text": "A sorta update post again. I told my mother, who pays for my college tuition, about my struggles in my Computer Science major and wanting to switch to a different one. She was disappointed and frustrated to hear about it but told me, There's nothing else we can do\". I already have an appointment for next week to tell my advisor but I feel so terribly guilty and ashamed to essentially have wasted almost $10k for nothing. We have to pay in full because I'm not eligible for financial aid. The whole reason of why I want to switch is that I don't understand the concepts behind my coding class. I relied heavily on my friend to help me out, and essentially cheated my way through the projects. As stupid as it sounds, the only thing I really know is printing words to the console. Not only that but I have failed twice for my calculus 1 class, and I feel that the math-involved topics isn't working for me. Now it comes to this. I had this stupid idea of maybe re-taking my coding class from the beginning and basically doing a sorta \"re-do\". I thought sure, I would graduate late and still pay, but we wouldn't have to pay another $10k again. Is this plausible and realistic or I am giving way too much thought into this?",

      "text": "Some people just aren\u2019t cut out for a certain topic. \n\nAsk yourself, do you even enjoy your current major? What would be the benefits of switching majors? Why did you fail the class? Was it a lack of interest, a bad professor, too complicated? \n\nIf it is a lack of interest, then swap. Nothing will fix that. If the concepts were too complicated, watch some YouTube videos or buy some books on the topic. Everything can be learned, it only depends on your interest in the topic.",
