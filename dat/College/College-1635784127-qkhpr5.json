  "text": "Does anyone know why it cost money to send in a housing application?? Mine is $100 dollars and they offer waiver forms but they make it so difficult for you to qualify for them it's ridiculous.  Some of us college students already pay housing fees, wouldn't it make sense for the housing application to already fit in with the housing fees we are already paying??",

My university lost my financial aid records around move-in day, so I had to back out of the housing contract last minute. Housing officials kept the application fees because they still had to find and hold a place for me, being that I requested one.",
