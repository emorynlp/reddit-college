  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and my parents have FORCED me to attend a in state college that they love and I\u2019ve hated. Even during the tour, I hated it. Since it\u2019s forced, I\u2019m now a student at that college and as I thought, I hate it here. My parents thought that once I start going here, I would love it. That hasn\u2019t happened and the first semester is already over. I\u2019ve mentioned to my parents many times while in tears throughout the semester, about how much I\u2019ve hate it here and wanna transfer. It was even mentioned that I fake my happiness here. The response I get from my parents when this subject comes up is one of anger. Sometimes they even ignore the subject when it\u2019s brought up. I\u2019ve tried a lot and nothing will change their opinion. What do I do? Do I just stay in a school I hate?",

You can make the best of it or be miserable for 4 years.\n\nThat sounds cold, but if they\u2019re calling the shots, you\u2019re pretty much stuck.\n\nI was in somewhat of a similar situation, I didn\u2019t hate the state school I went to, but I was bitter that  my family allowed me to waste time and get my hopes up for other schools when they knew I\u2019d only have a choice of which state school I was going to go to.",

      "text": "I was miserable in my last school I transferred and I couldn\u2019t be happier. My parents understood because they knew I was not emotionally satisfied I got the grades but I just hated the environment. Before bringing this up to my parents, i applied to so many scholarships and financial aid so that the news school tuition matched my old one. This is how my parents were okay with me transferring schools. It didn\u2019t affect them whatsoever I did the entire transfer process and made it easier for them. So I say convince them that this would be a change that they won\u2019t even have to deal with, show them that you would do anything to move schools and hopefully it\u2019ll work out.",

Let's make that clear.\n\nIf they were offering to pay tuition, you decided that listening to them was easier for you over going off to another college without that backing. You picked yourself.\n\nIt's still the same decision. You need to decide if switching schools is worth risking whatever financial support they are giving you.",
