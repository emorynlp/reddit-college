  "title:": "Am I Done For? (Failed 2 Classes, Wondering how FAFSA works)",
  "text": "Simply that, guys. Am I done for? This is my 3rd year at Uni. My major is Information Technology (Support Technician) and I took quite a handful of classes since my advisor said I would have to (although I wasn't sure why). All were her rec. Two of these classes I failed. Like flat--FAILED. 46% in one. 58% in the other. F's. They were so damn hard and not even in my line of work, both were code classes. I couldn't get behind them. The first was a Software Development C# course, and the second was Android Development. I have never worked with some of the software they instructed we use. \n\nOne of the instructors tried his hardest to help me. For that, I am grateful. But my greatest concern is my FAFSA. I am on a pell grant. Will I have to pay those 2 courses back? (I am literally broke ;\\_;) Will I lose all my funds? If so, well I can't continue to go to college. All my other course grades are A's and a couple B's. I have never failed anything so hard in my life! I'm so confused...how does this all work? I can't find a single definitive answer on their website.",

      "text": "You should be fine, its only 2 classes. They might warn you about it and you could get a warning for awarded letters or something but i think youll be fine. I doubt theyll take away your funds just for 2 classes you didnt fail. I think maybe after the 3rd class is when shit gets serious and they would put you on academic probation or something worse like the things you mentioned.\n\nBut yeah i would talk to the financial aid office at your school and ask if you are in good standing or see if you just got a warning.",

And them having such short a time for completion, I just didn't have enough time personally to focus those two down. Albeit, I am still confused on why I had to take them--but oh well, I'm fine now. :)",
