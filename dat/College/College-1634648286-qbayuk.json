  "text": "Both me and my bff that I\u2019ve known for more than a decade recently started college. The thing is, it\u2019s not the same college. I knew that it would be hard bc I had her all my life and now that she\u2019s not around to go to parties with me and introduce me to new people, I don\u2019t know what to do. I am not a socially awkward person but I don\u2019t really make the first move on someone.. like ever... (INFP here) \n\nI\u2019m feeling emotionally unstable and people around here are SO rude like tf? They\u2019re not even friendly, even if I was able to make the first move (like go say \u2018hi\u2019) no one is willing to be someone\u2019s friend. \n\nI\u2019m seriously doubting my decision to go to college. I feel so lonely and my roommates are longtime BFFs. I feel so left out and I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019re friendly either. I moved to another city ONLY for this college and it feels like I\u2019m drowning right now. Is there a way to meet NICE people? I\u2019ve never been this alone and if I meet some nice people, I\u2019m willing to go talk to them first.",

Find people who are in proximity to you in classes and just ask how they are. I also  started carrying around a game of Exploding Kittens in my bag and asking people to play and talk",

      "text": "Hi, (omg a fellow INFP). Yeah, in the start it is difficult to socialize with people. You can encounter rude people in your classes and some friendly ones, but mostly rude people. smh I hate it when it happens. What I did is I joined clubs and tried to talk to them. The best thing that happened to me is I found a group exclusive for the first-year students. It was fun. I hope your university has a similar program, especially for freshpersons.",

      "text": "You're not alone in how you feel. I understood what you described 100%. Finally made close friends in high school and they're back home and I'm in a different state. A lot of people in college are unfriendly and if they're not, they either already have close friends or they just don't click. \n\nI would say try going to very specific interest group clubs where everybody has to be passionate to be there. They clubs are also going to be smaller and more intimate than a huge popular org on campus. That's what I'm going to give a shot at least. \n\nGood luck! You're giving something new a shot for your future. Don't forget that you're trying and remember there's support waiting back for you at home. (also, INTP here)",

      "text": "Push yourself to talk to people, and then just give it time.  Talk to classmates before class.  Talk to other people in your dorm/building. Join clubs.  \n\nOnce you do that regularly, a few of them will \"stick\" and become friends. It will take time though.",
