  "title:": "Which major is more difficult Electrical engineering or Nursing?",
  "text": "The reason I ask which major is more difficult, is because my family always likes to put whatever I do on a lower pedestal than them. I recently began Nursing school, and both of my brothers have graduated with an electrical engineering degree. My father recently said and I quote \"your work doesn't even come close to what they did in engineering, not even close.\" Here is the situation, my brothers never needed to work towards their education because they just understood the material instantly, meaning they didn't need to study. This ability was great for them, and I am happy they had an easier time in school. However, I don't appreciate when they put down my major constantly. \n\nPersonally, I need to put effort towards every class I take, whether its math or science, because I sometimes don't understand those materials right away. Not only that, but my mother wrote every paper my brothers had assigned since they were in high-school, whereas I have always done my own work to obtain my grades. Is it true what my brothers say that electrical engineers don't write many papers in college? I guess what I'm trying to say, is an electrical engineering degree truly harder than nursing?",

What ultimately matters is that you love what you do, not meaningless bragging rights about how \"hard\" your major was. \n\nI am genuinely shocked that your family is essentially mocking your chosen path rather than being your biggest supporters.

      "text": "Funny this post exists, as I\u2019m studying electrical engineering and my girlfriend is studying nursing. We\u2019re both struggling lol. However, I say this time and time again, I feel like personally I\u2019d much rather solve a problem or use a tool to work my way through a problem than memorize information. So far from what it seems, nursing school seems to require FAR more memorization than what I\u2019m doing right now. So I feel like for me personally, nursing school would be way harder. Also, it\u2019s important to mention that my grading scale for many classes are curved to where a 65% is a C, while my girlfriend needs a 78% for a C in most classes. \n\nIt\u2019s silly to compare college majors though, they\u2019re all difficult in their own way\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m sorry about your parents. What they should be doing is commending you for your hard work, and how much you\u2019re giving back. Nurses are vital to the healthcare system, and it would fall apart without them. Bravo to you and any other nurses/nursing students/CNA\u2019s out there!",

All stem degrees are filled with students with remarkable levels of intelligence who still struggle with the material and have to put in the extra effort.\n\nIntelligence or gift on its own means absolutely nothing. What you are willing to do with it is what matters. Abstract and difficult ideas remain difficult regardless of iq. People who have a higher level of intelligence don\u2019t have a magic key that makes learning difficult concepts and getting through difficult materials easy. Easier? yes but not easy.

(the outliers, both in terms of high IQ and low IQ are few and far between.\n\n>A lot of people think they're above average, but in fact they're only of normal intelligence.\n\nThis really has no bearing on our discussion. What people think or believe their IQ isn't relevant to whether \"gift\" or \"IQ\" makes STEM degrees easy\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also it seems that you're still underestimating what average people are capable of and assume that you and your classmates are above average in intelligence. Also you seem to have a different definition of what is considered intelligent or gifted.\n\nYou seem to have shifted the goalposts here. So what you're saying is that it is easy for gifted students to get stem degrees, yet perfectly doable for those of average intelligence? So is their \"gift\" making it easy? or is it easy by default? Forgive me but I do not see how or why this point is even relevant to what we were discussing. Can people of average intelligence finish STEM degrees? Absolutely this is evidenced by the thousands of people of average intelligence who do complete STEM degrees. Basically, you don't need to be special to do stem work. You just have to be willing to put in the hard work to understand complex theoretical concepts. However, you cannot ignore the fact that Engineering, Maths, Physics and Chem programs, have higher average levels of intelligence than the rest of academia, we can chalk it up to having to deal with theoretical and abstract concepts.\n\n>You haven't really seen a true gifted person.\n\nOdd of you to assume such a thing, over the internet, about a person you've never met before.\n\nThe whole premise of our conversation is that even those who are gifted or have higher levels of IQ will still struggle with the abstract concepts in STEM, and it will in no way be easy. It might perhaps be easier for them than it is for those of average intelligence, but not a walk in the park as you make it sound.",

In elementary school, I thought addition subtraction, etc. was pretty easy. In middle school, it got a bit harder with algebra and geometry. In high school, it got to the point that I would consider \"difficult\" : trig and calculus, and I had to study a lot in order to get decent grades. For someone who has a keen gift in a particular subject, that point at which the subject stops being \"easy\" is much later. In high school, I knew people who breezed through calculus, but then in college started having more trouble with differential equations. But there are also very gifted students who I know that did not have trouble with dif EQs, linear algebra, and calculus in college, but then it got hard for them at analysis, geometry, topology, etc. They still had to put in years of work to get to that position, but that doesn't mean those years of work were hard for them.

Unless the task has a binary level of success, for example, running a mile under 5 minutes, it will always get hard for everyone at some point. The best mathematicians in the world had trouble proving Fermat's last theorem, etc.\n\nHowever, I would disagree with you on the last point. I think that applies to people who are more \"decent\" than geniuses, if that makes sense. I think pretty much everyone has heard the following story. Someone who is pretty good at math, let's say, and coasts by with decent grades in mediocre classes in high school. Then college comes and they get wrecked by their first physics or diff EQ class.\n\nHowever, these people probably aren't geniuses, I would say. The people I knew from high school who I could immediately recognize as very gifted found my AP calculus class quite easy. One of the guys I looked up recently though, and he had a very high GPA in computer science, and was a TA for a bunch of different classes, and had taken higher level CS/math classes in algorithms and analysis. Very smart people end up adapting well to more difficult classes, since they already have a massive leg up due to their intelligence. And most very smart people are very curious and want to try hard, it's just that their current classes aren't doing it for them. Like I said, I had been working very hard in high school to do well in my math classes, but I have no doubt I would be blown out of the water in an analysis class by someone who was just naturally great at math.\n\nPlus, a lot of the genius level people find their basic math or whatever classes easy, but then do really hard stuff outside of school. My brother was studying for math competitions and also learning higher level math while taking the \"easy\" calc classes.",
