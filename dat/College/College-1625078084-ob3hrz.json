  "text": "This will be my first year in college and I may struggle a little financially. Right now I have both a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro. I have my iPad decked out with a magic keyboard and Apple Pencil. I was thinking of selling my MacBook for some extra cash since my iPad can do almost everything I need it to and it\u2019s so much more versatile. \n\nI\u2019m asking because my college advisor said that we may be introduced to courses in computer science starting our first year so I\u2019m afraid an iPad won\u2019t cut it.",

      "text": "You can and you can't : \n\n1. Check and make sure most of your school apps/portals etc have either an iPad app or works on a mobile Safari. Especially check for uploading and submission of assignments (That includes uploading presentation videos, reports/essay/online assignments etc) Do note that almost all schools don't support iPad. You're most likely on your own or will be advised to use a laptop if you haven issues if you do seek your school technical support.\n2. Depends on the coding lessons you're doing. For standard type of coding you'll see most coding on iPad are accessing a MacOS device remotely via FTP etc to have a proper IDE for common languages like python, C++, or assembly language 28k. You can do Swift on apple dedicated app I guess, but not something you will be using on the sort of general CS first year courses. YOU WILL NEED A LAPTOP/DESKTOP. \n3.  You struggle to get some extra cash? I would suggest getting a tutoring gig/ and considering finding a part-time job for the extra cash rather than selling your stuff (Barista/Store assistant or job posting on your campus are great options). Google for them.\n4. iPad is not a need. More of a want. Sell your iPad if you have to and just revert to typing notes on laptop and paper/pen/printouts. \n5. If you can, sell the magic keyboard and even your pencil. Opt for cheaper combo of a generic cover stand case w/ maybe tpu bumper(?) and a cheap bluetooth keyboard+mouse combo --> I got logitech K380 bundle but there are even cheaper less reputable but equally serviceable brands out there like Alcatrotz etc. There are Apple pencil replica/cheaper alternatives out there that may not work as well (connectivity start-up lag/no wireless charging) but still works with iPad.",

          "text": "Until Windows support ARM decently, and only when there is a decent ARM laptop produced: M1 MacBooks are the best laptop you can get now and the M1 Macbook Air is easily the best laptop in terms of cost-performance. There isn't any laptops that performs as well and still remain this light, this quiet, and have this long a battery life.\n\nIf I am not using my brother's old Macbook Air (Early 2014, battery unable to hold a charge, permanently docked to a slightly fraying charger) and finding that it performs pretty decently for day-to-day, I would not have went with an iPad, but with a Macbook. My game plan as a working adult (part-time student) is to use the macbook till it can't service for all my coding needs, things I can't do on my iPad (Certain desktop only features for services i.e. banking, antiquated website elements that don't work on mobile version), as a bigger screen to read/ put lectures/zoom on while I write my notes on iPad etc. (I am blessed to have an abundance of mostly underpowered laptops in my home I can take over in the name of education XD)\n\nMy choice of iPad has a pre-condition that I have a personal laptop to fall back on and use if I need to as a secondary device that can cover what my iPad can't do or do as well.",

Hell you can always just have a first crack at writing the code on the iPad or on paper, think things through and then see if it runs/finish it when you have access to a computer. It\u2019s probably the best way to do it anyway.\n\nProbably best as always to talk to someone about it though, ask people at college/teaching your courses if it\u2019s doable/what they\u2019ll cover and then do some research on how doable that is. \nAlso I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your courses don\u2019t support macs and won\u2019t be able to help troubleshoot mac specific troubles.",

      "text": "Junior CS major here, still take my advise with a grain of salt. If push comes to shove there are ways to make a MacBook work with the various programs you will use as a CS major. Tho, personally, I would recommend against that, many of my classmates have forced their way through a semester or two with a Macbook but they always had some problem or another with it, from running the program the first time to navigating to their file and submitting their work. And plus most if not all of your professors will just expect that you'll be using a windows computer as well and will teach how to install and go about the program as such. And typically the professors I've had also didn't knew what to do when a student had troubles with their MacBook.\n\n\nWhen you get a chance make sure to talk with your STEM counselor (a general counselor also works but typically a STEM counselor would know a bit more) about what programs your college has that can help you. For example, I've been through two colleges so far, the first one gives out refurbished laptops to students in need, completely free and it's really yours (they can only really do the minimum of what you need it to do). The second loans laptops for a semester and you just need to renew your loan with them.\n\n\nIn summary, if you really have to, yes, a MacBook (idk about an IPad) can be used for the programs you will be introduced to as a CS major, it'll just either be an extra step or two. But for what I recommend, all those programs that you'll be using as CS major is better off being installed and used in a windows computer especially since your just starting off your comp. sci. journey.\n\n\nWishing you all the best luck!!!",

A project might take 8+ hours to get done, homework, and lab, the chance of you spending 5 + hours at a library on a daily basis is very high. Well unless you really good at coding and can get it done fast. \nGoodLuck mate!!!!!!",

A chromebook is just a very cheap, hacked-on solution, and will not carry you into the sunset of your development career.

That being said, I can recommend just staying very mindful of your use cases while shopping around. Note to yourself how demanding the programs will be, and shop accordingly.\n\nThis particular comment chain was related to operating systems, so in that realm I could say that you should pick:\n\nChromebrook: You know for a fact that you will only need to use a web browser, email, and document editing with Google drive. \n\nMac: The Apple ecosystem is something that appeals to you and you are willing to slightly compromise price to get the ecosystem and operating system. Get one of these also if you are in a digital creative field: as far as I\u2019m aware Mac is the standard in this discipline. From a pure specification standpoint, you will get less for more money but there are some benefits to Mac that don\u2019t appear on the spec sheet. \n\nWindows: essentially any other use case. This is probably the best option for the average person. For CS specifically, Windows vs Mac probably doesn\u2019t matter at all, just decide if you want to spend extra money for the apple ecosystem and that should be all it comes down to.\n\nThe one piece of advice I do have is that when you shop around, use a local classifieds site for your area and check out some machines in person. You can always try eBay to get stuff for cheap but it can sometimes be a hassle and you have to know what you\u2019re doing.",

The only reason I still had a computer was to do research and coding, as an iPad wouldn't have been able to handle it. Depending on what classes you're taking, you may want to have a laptop as your assignments may be easier to complete on an actual computer rather than an iPad alone, but it's honestly up to you.",

Engineering requires programs like AutoCAD that actually only runs on Windows (Uni has no Mac versions for a lot of these expensive programs.)\n\nIDEs are typically FOC, downloaded online and definitely have a IDE that can function on Macs either natively or via Wine. In fact, Python actually is easier to install on MacBooks due to its more Linux interface than on Windows.",
