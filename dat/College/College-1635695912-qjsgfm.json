      "text": "Idk why but I got a little obsessed with your post and started doing digging and yeah I can see why you made this post. Rose hulman is better overall even have the highest grad rates, while chico is half the price but kinda sketch. \n\nIts up to what you value the most. A good education or debt. I had to think about this too choosing between cal state long beach or cal state LA with its prices and recognition. I went with the more expensive school cause at the end of the day it'll look better on my resume.\n\nBut idk your financial situation, but if you do end up paying that 72k a year, you should try to make sure you use every resource, get a part time campus job, scholarships the whole works.\n\nEntry level pay for a CS at worst is 22k and average at 45k so maybe try your absolute best to lower your debt in that two years to 30k ish. \n\nYeah this is a tough choice, but its really up to your priorities and what you need from your education.",
