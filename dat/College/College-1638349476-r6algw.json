  "text": "Like the title says, I had to go without sleep. I\u2019ve got class early this morning and everything on campus opens at 7. Any advice on staying awake without waking up my roommate?\n\nEDIT: Finally convinced to go take a nap, fell asleep, then my roommate had an alarm go off at 3:30 in the morning. It must be a sign\u2026.",
