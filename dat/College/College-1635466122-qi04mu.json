  "text": "Hi all! I'm looking for some college students to fill out a survey about college shopping, mostly relating to household items (anything for your bedroom, kitchen, living room, and bathroom). It would be really helpful if your parents could participate as well, just so I can see their side of things. \n\nAll responses will be confidential. This is purely for a class project. If you agree to letting parents participate, I will follow up via email and send the parent survey link.\n\n[https://forms.gle/JLWDWnoDiaTZksBB6](https://forms.gle/JLWDWnoDiaTZksBB6)",
