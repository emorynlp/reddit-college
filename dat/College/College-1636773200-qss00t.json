  "text": "So um I have to review some commercials for my marketing class and I\u2019m not sure if I can turn this in.\n\n I think the Alexa commercial also does a good job, but Michael Jordan being sexy kinda steals the show. Don\u2019t get me wrong it does a good job of showing what the product can do, but all anyone is going to remember is the scene where he takes his shirt off, or stands in the sprinkler, or how the light swirls in his eyes while he reads erotica in the bathtub. God damn that man is sexy.",
