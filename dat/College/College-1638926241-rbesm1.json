  "text": "Long story short, I have this one Professor that often cancels class and office hours sessions right before they happen. I also only had one grade put in from September.\n\n(As a commuter student that lives more than 2 hours away from campus, it kinda sucks to come to campus just for class to be cancelled). \n\nI\u2019d just really like for them to reply to their emails. In person, they told me that they were busy but that they would try to reply to their emails as soon as possible. And it just doesn\u2019t happen. How can I nicely talk to them about this?",

Theyre getting underpaid, deal with bullshit like you do, and have unexpected events happen all the time. Consider asking the prof to make appointments by zoom or other video chatting service more available. Maybe even lessons too.",
