  "text": "Prof here, sorry to barge in. But I need your thoughts.\n\nI've taught plenty of online classes in the past, but only to students who willingly chose the online option. This fall my campus will be fully online so I will be having students who don't like or don't want online classes, but they are stuck. \n\nSo, knowing that I'll have students who don't want to be online, as their instructor, what things could I do to make it better? Things to do? Things to avoid?\n\nI especially want to hear from the haters. Fire away.\n\nThanks much.\n\nEdit: much appreciation for all the comments so far. I'm reading them all, I promise! Keep them coming, even if your comments are redundant with someone else, it's useful for me to see what gets repeated and isn't just a random one-off.",

I don\u2019t know what class you\u2019re teaching but most lower division stuff like cell & molecular biology, calculus based physics, calculus 1-3, linear algebra, differential equations, organic/general chemistry etc you are not the primary source. I have yet to find a math teacher as good as professor Leonard or a chem teacher as good as chad prep (both YouTube personalities) why should people watch your first try lectures when these amazing personalities exist already? instead I would most want a professor who clearly outlined the learning expectations with homework that comes close to exam material with the online professor there to answer hw questions. If the online professor was going to lecture then working problems with the class to me is infinitely more valuable than having something explained half as good in twice the amount of time than my favorite online personalities.",

      "text": "Professor here - What many have mentioned here about not having video on is true, internet can be fickle.  I learned that you can add avatars to Blackboard collaborate and other stuff.  So, if you want to do an introduction discussion board - and they don't want to take a picture they can use Bitmoji or any of a million other ones to make an avatar for you to see while looking at video class.   It made my Ultra training class so much better this summer.\n\nOn the doing lectures front - I use Screencast-o-matic and usually have my face in the corner while I am showing them around in Blackboard or other items on the internet they need for the project I am having them do.  In BB Ultra you have to use Youtube for the video holder.  We have mandate to have closed captioning on our videos.  - So after you upload to youtube- come back about an hour later - depending on the length of your video - and you can edit the AUTOMATIC captions - instead of typing the whole thing out. \n\nDo not be afraid to leave in the \"ums\". I say \"so\" a LOT.  And re-record to make it more clear.  I have a degree in Television and have edited all my life and Screencast-o-matic has some very useful editing choices. Don't be afraid to click around.  I put on a new front and back of a video from spring lock down work to this summers hybrid class.\n\nWe are not allowed to use Zoom at our college - remember those porn bombers \\*yup they hit us. So we use blackboard collaborate and Microsoft teams. \n\nThat's what I have.  I was letting others teach online classes and not pushing for it - but I had fun this spring.  Got to try lots of techy things for my class.  Slack was pretty good for Instant messaging.  But Microsoft teams worked rather well for lots else - we just got rid of Skype.\n\nGood luck. \n\nAnd thanks to all the students posting - you have given me plenty to think about.  I am glad you mentioned how horrible the proctor software is - I had not heard anything.  We have been told we are getting a license for something this fall.",

      "text": "In on-campus classes there is a lot of space for the professor to get off track while showing a slide, making it difficult to figure out to remember from the slide. Off-campus, theres a lot of space for the student to get off track while looking at a slide. Highlight key terms and what will be on tests, if you offer extra credit or bonus questions, those could be other information from the ppt that wasn\u2019t necessarily key information. \n\nIf you\u2019re a RECORDING a lecture to upload instead of providing the slides, the same applies, but rather than highlighting the information you can say something like, \u201cTake a minute to pause the video and write down the information on this slide- pay attention to X.\u201d That\u2019d be really helpful for me. \n\nAnother thing about recording lectures- provide CLOSED CAPTIONING. Either type captions out yourself, or pay someone to do it. This is so valuable for students who are deaf or hard of hearing. Not only the disabled community can benefit from this, I know a lot of students are going to be at their family home this semester and may not have the option to listen to your lecture with sound. It\u2019s become increasingly popular to watch videos and tv shows with captions on, atleast amongst my friends, whether we are watching a video with someone else and they\u2019re talking, or you\u2019re watching a movie and can\u2019t hear the actors over yourself eating. I personally learn better when i can read and understand what someone is saying to me as they\u2019re saying it.",

If you don't intend to post weekly due dates, don't change the syllabus once a week and announce any changes.), have some kind of weekly quiz (not worth too much) to test skills and knowledge, either make study guides for exams or have students do them for extra credit (I had a class that did this last semester), keep communication open and if you mess something up own up to it (a few years ago, I took an online class where the instructor seemed great at first.

This summer, I decided to take a two credit, four week course to \"warm up\" to online classes for next semester. \n\nI loved my professor. When I told him that I totally spaced on getting a Visa (student with disability disclosure) for the summer, he believed me and gave me accommodations without me having to send in a form so I could get my accommodations ASAP. He also had a strict schedule where every week looked the same (textbook questions due Mon., discussion post due Tues., discussion post synthesis due Wed., etc.). *Everything* was due at midnight, which was something I appreciated greatly because my work schedule changes weekly and I wouldn't have to rush on any deadlines. He was also very understanding about my disabilities surrounding school.",

If you're not already, definitely do live lectures through Zoom or some other video conferencing platform. I absolutely HATE that the majority of my professors just prerecord their lectures and post them to YouTube for us to watch on our own time. Nothing is productive when lectures aren't interactive. It's a huge pain to be watching a prerecorded lecture and then not be able to ask a question right away if I get confused. I also really have no motivation to watch the lectures when they are not live. I need a routine in my life, especially during these trying times. Definitely record the live lectures and post them so that dedicated students can go back and catch small things they may have missed.\n\nAlso, be willing to have live office hours through Zoom. Going back to how annoying it is to not be able to ask a question right away when lectures are prerecorded, it is also an extreme burden to have to compose really long emails to professors in an effort to explain something you are really confused about or stuck on, only to receive a vague reply that doesn't help at all. A lot of questions really need to be asked and addressed \"face-to-face.\" I know that many of the email questions I have taken upwards of half an hour to compose and send to my professors, who were completely unwilling to have live video office hours, could have been asked and answered satisfactorily over Zoom in just a few minutes. If it really doesn't work for you to have office hours over Zoom as often as you would in person, at least be willing to let students make appointments with you regularly.",

A study guide that\u2019s really efficient in covering what\u2019s on the test is a must.

(So it's not just the pandemic that was a problem.)\n\nSome problems that I've run across either myself or have had friends encounter:\n\n* If you're doing synchronous classes, please for the love of all that is holy, don't penalize students for not attending.  My internet went down during classes and my professor told me to just use my phone without considering that I don't have unlimited data.  I had friends who had to try to do their classes in cars from restaurant parking lots in the middle of stay-at-home orders, it obviously didn't go well.  People are having to get jobs or may have gotten sent home to the four corners of the globe and have time zone issues, but there may not have been another alternative to synchronous classes.  \n* Put up any PowerPoint lectures ahead of time so that people who want to can print them out/put them up on a tablet/etc and scribble along with them as you go.  \n* Captions are fabulous for accessibility, plus if there's a transcript of them available, it helps students who have to miss classes or can't have audio on because of their living situation.\n* If you're assigning group projects, please don't force students to sit in a breakout room on Teams/Zoom/etc to work on them during class time.  Being forced to sit there hearing group members making noise and their background noise on TOP of our own background noises is absolute hell with attention deficit issues and turns into a prolonged period of getting nothing done except getting frustrated for the required period of time when we could normally take our bits and go at our own pace separately and be fine.  (This happened to me, it turned into getting nothing done and wanting to scream because I was required to be there twice a week for almost 2 hours each time.)  If students want to use that dedicated block, great, but don't make it mandatory.\n* For the love of god, don't use those awful proctoring websites.  They're such privacy violations and they can be sources of shame for students in less than optimal conditions or be outright problems that might force students to take zeros.  Some of the services require having a desk and a chair and being able to show the area around it on camera.  Some people don't have access to any kind of area in their home that fits the bill because of living situations and may have to do their work on beds/couches/floors.  Some also can't get quiet environments where nobody will walk in and start talking to them or they'll get interrupted.  Students may be embarrassed if they have to show a proctor their surroundings.  There's also that awful feeling of being watched the whole time.\n* If you can, please be on camera somehow.  Some students need to be able to read lips and/or see facial expressions to be able to understand and retain information and that's something that may have prompted the decision to take in-person classes even when online was an option before.\n* Be extremely clear on expectations, learning objectives, timelines, etc.  Some students aren't comfortable trying to stop you in the middle of an online class and ask questions like they might raise their hands in a classroom.\n* Don't require cameras to be on.  It's fine to encourage it so that you're not talking to a bunch of blank screens, but requiring it can lead to frustration and/or embarrassment and it's a privacy issue.  (It's not like we don't trust you, but requiring us to put our cameras on would force us to open up a window into our home lives that we might not usually want professors or classmates to see.)",

The things I\u2019ve noticed most between my actual college online classes and the ones I took at ASU is the lack of familiarization with Canvas/Blackboard at my college. Categorize the folders according to date. Put the syllabus in the syllabus tab. Any links to recurring meetings/discussions/labs put in a spreadsheet with clear indication as to what has to be accessed when. Most students (that I know of) don\u2019t use the \u201cpages\u201d tab so avoid that if I you can. Again, that\u2019s personal experience so I could be wrong. \n\nUse simple language when attempting to convey the structure of the class. For example, my professor used \u201cpeer group\u201d and \u201cgroup\u201d to explain breakout rooms and lectures which confused the hell out of me until I showed up for the lectures I wasn\u2019t supposed to be in and I had to email him to ask what was going on. Similarly, my other professor used \u201csynchronous\u201d and \u201cnon-synchronous\u201d to describe the lecture and the discussion respectively and, because I had another class with two lecture sections instead of just one, I was confused as to what this meant. \n\nEssentially, keep it uncomplicated. \n\nProfessors are being hit as hard as the students are and as a student I wanted to say thank you for asking because we\u2019re all figuring this out together. Thank you for the commitment to your students.",

But it's because I treat it like a true discussion, and not like a bunch of mini papers.\n\nIt was actually my time here on Reddit that made me realize people really can have interesting and vigorous conversations online, why can't we recreate that in the online classroom? I start by explicitly telling students that I want the discussions to be conversations, equivalent to what you might casually say in the classroom, and not the equivalent to giving a speech or writing a paper. I encourage informal or casual language (although do request good spelling and halfway decent punctuation). There are no format or length requirements.\n\nThe questions or prompts on the discussion have to fit with the idea that it is an informal discussion, so questions are open ended and emphasize \"what did you think about the content?\" rather than coming to a correct answer.\n\nI think it also helps to have extra discussions worked into the grading scheme, so that if there's one or two and an individual student is just not feeling it, they can skip that one no penalty.",

Working with a group to solve problems was so much more productive than guessing. It really forced us to go over the material in the module to agree on answers. \n\nUse online resources whenever possible to avoid expensive textbook costs. \n\nDon\u2019t have synchronous classes. Let students do the work when they can. \n\nHave a separate discussion board where students can ask for help from each other and then give extra credit to the students that use it.",

It was one minute per question, you weren\u2019t allowed to visit previous questions after answering them, MC but 7 choices per questions, A LOT of questions had weird phrasing like triple negatives, and closed book ofc.",

And she actually read the chat and gave her immediate input to what is being said.

Im not the person you\u2019re looking for, but I will tell you what it is that can make them lovable. They:\n\n- Do not require to \u201ccheck in\u201d to online lectures. Aka attendance. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t live stream, but they should be optional. We\u2019re adults, if I want to learn/make a good grade I\u2019ll check out your notes and lectures. I also feel like prerecorded lectures are better in general since you can pause/slow down as much as needed for my understanding. If I have a question I\u2019ll email you, Google it, or go to YouTube University.\n\n- The class doesn\u2019t rely on proctorU. You can still make the tests difficult, but don\u2019t invade people\u2019s spaces, privacy, and slow down their computers. \n\n- The professor responds to emails within 24hrs and is clearly and throughly answering my questions. Especially when it comes to answering assignments.\n\n- Not an online only thing, but a class schedule detailing everything that\u2019s due/expected is nice for planners.\n\n- If you use a hw system, use a common one like Cengage that has a cheaper package for students instead of something like Connect that\u2019s $165 per class. Similarly, please make all assignments open at the start of the class instead of segmented by week. Believe it or not, I have totally finished a class in my 2week trial so I could cross the class off my list AND not pay for a book. I don\u2019t see how it hurts you to keep them open. \n\n- Do not give group projects. Do I really have to explain why this is a complicated process rn? Similarly, projects that require you to go somewhere like a museum or leave the house in general. I had a Summer class that required something like that. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: I saw a lot of people complain about busy work (quizes, Cengage assignments, discussions, etc) but those have never bothered me. I learn a lot from them and they\u2019re what\u2019s helped me the most on my exams. However, my classes only consisted of said \u201cbusy work,\u201d and didn\u2019t have papers, projects, and other stuff. If they did, the busy work would have been an annoyance.",

I also really like when the professor offers and encourages students who have questions to send an email or even talk through zoom. It makes the students feel like their education isn\u2019t being hindered because of online classes. I would try to steer away from talking through lectures slide by slide. I\u2019ve also had professors do that and it\u2019s pointless to not explain things while going over slides. I would also not eliminate projects and such because they\u2019re hard to grade or something along the lines of that. I had a professor last semester who pretty much quit teaching the class and cancelled the final exam when we went online. It was a shame because I really liked that class.

But I think most people disliked the switch to online because a lot of teachers and programs never did it so they were learning what worked on the fly. Which resulted in either the same amount or increase in out of class work with less instruction. Not to mention not many schools lowered tuition or reimbursed students when switching to online so you were paying the level of on campus support and resources with out receiving any of those resources. So in the end I think people will find your class better because you know what you are doing and how to balance out work. I'm sure you can't do anything about the tuition problem but that's up to the students. So over all just keep doing what you know works. Sorry if this was more ranty than what you were hoping for but I hope this insight helps.",

      "text": "Like others have already said, don't rely on the textbook or online textbook publisher platforms as the main source of learning - after all, we're still paying tuition to learn from you. Otherwise we'd just buy the book. \n\nAlso, everyone I know, myself included, despises computer proctoring services like ProctorU. It totally feels like a massive invasion of privacy in our homes and on our devices. Furthermore, it messes with our computer settings and configuration. I've dropped online classes specifically because the syllabus said ProctorU would be used. It's a no-go. Better option is to make the exams slightly stricter on time, or better yet, ask questions that aren't directly copied from the notes or slides but make the exam open-note. Make the questions more about understanding the material rather than memorizing specific details to the extent that you can. That's generally a good practice for in-person classes too, but it inhibits student's abilities to look up the answers as easily for online classes. Some of my professors have just made their exams slightly(not much) more difficult and open-book, and the score distribution remained about the same as it was for standard in-class closed note exams. If you absolutely must use some sort of software to keep students from using the internet, use Lockdown Browser if your school pays for it. I still hate it, but it wasn't \\*quite\\* as awful as ProctorU. But even still, students can cheat by using their phones or notes that aren't on their computer. And the Lockdown Browser still sucks. \n\nMake the class Asynchronous as possible. When we aren't at school in person, we often have other obligations that come up in person. It can be easier for some than others to set aside a specific time each say to do a specific class on the internet. \n\nLastly, I know a couple others have talked about this too, but make sure due dates are clear. Blackboard isn't always very user friendly for that, so make sure to send out reminders and make some sort of schedule as to when things are due.",

It was one of my favorite classes I've taken outside my major. \n\nThe class was Crime Scene Science, a chem course.\n\nIt was on a two week rotation. \n\nFirst week, you were supposed to read the chapters, and watch short clips (about 5 mins long each) that explained the premise of the chapter. They had a quiz at the end of each to check understanding. \n\nSecond week, you were supposed to watch the lectures that the professor made, he usually had some sort of quiz at the end to check your understanding, but you could retake them to get better scores. These quizzes were about 30 questions each, depending how long his lecture was and the content. There was also a final test for the chapters and an assignment. \n\nEverything was due at 11:59 PM on Sunday at the end of the two weeks. It was recommended that you do some the first week and the rest the second, but if you wanted to work ahead a little, that was fine. If things came up and you couldn't finish it until the last two days, that was okay too.\n\nHe also was really good at answering emails, and very straightforward. The routine was easy to follow and there were never any \"surprises\". I always knew what was due no matter what.",

We all hate it and feel our privacy is violated.\n\nFrom a student point of view, I do a lot better in a class when I feel like a professor is interested in my sp\u00e9cialisation and my professional work, and is supportive in encouraging me through relevant feedback on my classwork, as well as being open to help guide me if I need it. Knowing that is invaluable.\n\nIt will be invaluable to many people - for if they hate classes and would usually not choose them, chances are, they are not in their usual uni environment. They are probably very stressed from their circumstances, and may not have the support system that they usually have around them of people who actually understand their goals and want to help them succeed.\n\nOne thing: I actually disagree with a couple of people below in the discussion boards. Requiring a discussion board of something relevant to both a student and the class material is a fantastic way - for me at least - to feel connected to the class. My two favorite prompts thus far have come from two different classes:\n1. A Western European Politics class: research and give your opinion on either the effects of Brexit on the EU, of Basque devolution, or the effects of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, *En Marche!*, in France. I loved this because I actually have been doing daily research and have been very involved in one of the three, and it was such a joy to be able to speak about it in a context where it was appreciated. 450 word limit.\n\n2. The effects of culture in your personal growth essay from an artistic standpoint (for the class of Art in Globalistion). To do it well, honestly, and with a sense of professionalism and analysis was actually quite challenging - even to accelerated graduate students.  \n\nIt is kind of you to care so much about reaching out to your students - show them that, and you will reach the ones that are open to being helped now. I would guess you are an excellent professor.",

They required one question and two responses each week, and packback itself scores responses based on some algorithm, so we would have to have a 60/100 curiosity score for each post for it to count. Only downside is you do have to pay for it, but i definitely liked having control over what I talked about rather than an assigned prompt. \n\nAlso, do not require face cameras on for zoom calls. Or for kids to be sitting up 100% of the time. That really annoyed me during my summer online class. \n\nfinally, make sure all slides are posted prior to class, and then record the lecture on zoom and post that as well for people to review. There was a lot of connection issues and technical difficulties in one of my classes, so some people missed the lecture sometimes and were unable to find out what was said. I would recommend not mandatory attendance, but bonus points for those who do actually come to class.",

      "text": "While I am one of those students who chose to do the online format for both my entire undergraduate degree and now my graduate courses, I think I can offer insight as well. \n\nFirst, I don\u2019t mind the discussions, esp if they\u2019re relevant to the assigned chapters. I\u2019ve learned a lot from the research I\u2019ve had to do for these. What I do mind is x number of responses to peers and word count for those responses. One of my last professors didn\u2019t require responses, but if we wrote good replies to peers those qualified us for extra credit points. That was a much better way of handling it since these discussions often are in lieu of the discussions that would occur during an in-seat program. \n\nSecond, do not assign busy work or assignments that require codes. In fact, the codes should be an absolute no-no when students pay money for the course. Likewise, avoid $800 textbooks or the requirement for the newest edition if there are several editions. \n\nThird, do not require group projects in an online  setting. Every single group project I have been a part of have been disastrous because of nonparticipating students. The project as a whole always suffers because the remaining students are required to assign and wait for nonparticipating students to contribute before completing those sections last minute. While I understand the reasoning behind group projects, they simply don\u2019t work in an online setting (especially in accelerated programs). \n\nLast, explain assignment requirements in detail (either in the syllabus or the assignment page) \nand be prompt with your responses regarding assignment questions (I always had a few for major papers that were not covered in the syllabus). I always liked those courses that offered a draft option for major papers. A draft submission meant I could see if I was on track before submitting the final version. Constructive feedback should also be given afterwards. \n\nBest of luck!",

It\u2019s very stressful to manage life with the pandemic if you have under a week to view all the assignments and complete them in about 6 days. Viewing them ahead at least let\u2019s me plan my time accordingly.\n\n2. If you do discussion boards please have it remain professional and discuss topics from the textbook. If you want to know how students are doing put that in a seperate discussion board that is not graded. \n\n3. If possible record the meat of a lecture that can be followed by PowerPoint or YouTube. I take notes with my composition book and loathed live sessions because it was difficult to keep up (sound lagging, video distortion, asking to repeat). I preferred pausing the lecture as needed to write the notes down and our professor always highlighted pieces we needed to read or concepts we needed to have a good understanding of. \n\n4. Exams. If your course offers any math please get rid of the timer or extend the timer. We had to do advanced math in one class and **show our work** by typing it out. It was such a struggle to insert an equation and type out my explanation for 50 questions in 1 hour and 15 minutes. It\u2019s just not possible. Our professor gave the exam as many hours as as possible in a 3 day time frame. We took a survey what day works best for us and she recorded it. If there were any complications we would email her. Any questions to the material email and she would call many students to help.\n\n5. Be empathetic, understanding, and lower your expectations. I had classmates that contracted the virus or know someone that died. It\u2019s a difficult situation in that many of us are also out of incomes too. If you\u2019re expecting someone to work 100% for a B and over 100% for that A this semester, don\u2019t. Scale back and also offer extra credit. \n\nThank you.",

Not everyone has the privilege to have home environments conducive to learning or that meet requirements for proctored online exams.

Don't even bring out the gap semester/gap year argument either.  That isn't an option for everyone.  People have scholarships contingent on continuous enrollment, people may not have been given the option to defer, or people may be on tight schedules where courses are only offered alternating semesters or alternating years and having to take even one semester off could screw up their timelines and lead to more debt, etc.",

      "text": "So many good suggestions on here, so I won\u2019t add much. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got: \n\n-Whether or not the class is synchronous (I saw you mentioned you weren\u2019t sure about live calls), keep a schedule and stick to it. Post content at the same time(s) each week and have homework due at the same times. And follow through with it. The only thing that keeps me motivated/sane during online classes is setting something of a schedule for myself, which is impossible to do if the class doesn\u2019t have a regular schedule. Maybe this is obvious, but I had a prof last semester who never posted content when she said she would and it got so stressful. \n\n-respond to your emails! Or hold virtual office hours! Anything like that. Again, might seem obvious, but the same prof last year was terrible at responding to emails. Without in-person meetings, if you\u2019re lost on something, there\u2019s no hope. \n\n-Have some way for students to interact (but maybe not group projects). Create a class group chat or something and encourage informal discussion. It would have been so nice to have peers to reach out to bounce ideas off of, ask questions, or just talk. \n\n\nThanks for the effort you\u2019re putting into this! We all need professors like you.",

      "text": "As a teacher, you are able to use tools like discussion boards or extra assignments if you wish, but just please remember that many students are now working fulltime in order to keep up with college payments and such. \n\nThis last semester, I found myself completely burnt out, because on top of the already assigned final projects, papers, etc... there were extra weekly discussions, new assignments, and entire new classes that now needed to be included online (music ensembles, phy ed classes, etc.) that required papers and discussions. \n\nI had one professor that I genuinely looked forward to each week, as they always took time to ask about what was going on in our personal lives, and gave us room to discuss the news and our personal victories. It was nice to hear about things that didn't revolve around COVID-19 or homework. I don't know what your class sizes look like, but my prof required at least one personal meeting with them to check in, and to see if the student needed any assistance or even just a half hour to vent about what could be frustrating them. I enjoyed my meetings, as it was just a time to talk, and I was able to ask my teacher how they were doing, and what I could do as a student to help them :)\n\nEven just you making this post shows that you care, and I applaud you for that. I may not know you personally, but you show that you care about all of your students with your action, and that is so critical in the situation we are facing. However you choose to go about it, I hope this semester goes well for you!",

      "text": "I just want to clarify that I love my online classes. That being said, I avoid signing up for online classes with professors that do the following don\u2019ts:\n\nDON\u2019T require students to get their participate grade based off of them attending the zooms or online class. You can\u2019t really measure participation that way, which is why it\u2019s an online class. Students shouldn\u2019t be punished for completing their work on time, in their own time, by managing themselves. That being said, instead you can have assignments due weekly or at the end of the week, or some kind of deadline known ahead of time.\n\nDON\u2019T force your students to attend zoom classes as a requirement. It\u2019s similar to the first one, but different in that professors tell you you *must* attend the classes. Once again I feel like online classes give students an opportunity to manage their own time and do the work they\u2019re required to do in their own time, and that that\u2019s okay. Sometimes by forcing students to attend zoom classes they get more irritated with the workload and start slacking. I know I do lol. \n\nDON\u2019T assume the worst of your students just because it\u2019s an online class. I have a friend who because of covid-19 have a professor who accuses everyone in the class of cheating. As a result, she gave extra work such as essays or make assignments and tests so much harder and stressful than things already are. I feel like one of the best ways you can get your students to respect you, enjoy your class, and enjoy the material is to trust them. Students react different to classes based a lot on the way a professor handles things. I see that in my own classes too when it comes to the behaviors and attitudes that students have. \n\nDON\u2019T not check your emails or be irresponsive. It\u2019s an online class, things happen, and communication is key to making it work. That being said, having deadlines known ahead of him is important. Stress the deadlines! \n\n\nOkay, that\u2019s all I can come up with from the top of my head. The key points listed above are just the main ones that bother me, coming from experience(I wasn\u2019t trying to be nick picky). That being said, thank you for asking! You seem like a really cool professor who cares about his/her students, and your quality of teaching. Good luck with everything!",

They even went through each example in slides/homework/practice problems. They were on top of Piazza, answering questions with a very short response time. For the lab portion, they made us work together and record a Zoom video answering brief questions about the lab. We weren\u2019t best friends by the end, but it was nice to briefly interact with people and it helped us understand the material. \n\nI know the last suggestion is very intensive and a lot of work (honestly don\u2019t know how they did it, they are so amazing, which is why it was my best class).

Occasionally I've gotten stuck doing 12 hour shifts (hooray for being essential right?) and going home to do my homework after that is almost impossible, it's either half assed or late. I had a wonderful prof last spring who was so understanding and would give small extensions when asked. This helped a ton.\n\nI've seen some other people comment about discussion boards as well. I don't mind them, but please don't require responses to others' comments if possible. Sometimes you just can't add more to the conversation when everyone has the same answer to the same prompt and you get stuck writing \"I agree!\". \n\nI also had a prof who had us hand write our assignments and send in pictures this past spring semester. I think the intention might have been to prevent plagiarism? I don't know. But it was annoying to have to hand write something that would be turned in digitally.",

      "text": "I teach online and use many of the practices in \\*successful\\* online classes that students write about below. At my university, I do a lot of training for professors across the disciplines, and my focus is on developing meaningful feedback. \n\nFor online learning specifically, I've learned a great deal from [Michelle Pacansky-Brock's](https://brocansky.com/) work; she's an expert in making online education better. You could poke around on her site that I linked above or go straight to YouTube. She has many videos there, including a few keynotes where she talked about the problems of online teaching and how to improve what we do. \n\nIf your subject lends itself to discussion, I recommend [VoiceThread](https://voicethread.com/) (VT). My institution has a license, but I think you can get a free one if yours doesn't, and you can set it so it's free for students. I first found Michelle Pacansky-Brock's work because [she has a free Kindle book](https://www.amazon.com/Humanize-Your-Online-Class-VoiceThread-ebook/dp/B00DTAKMTC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=michelle+pacansky+brock+voicethread&qid=1594386173&sr=8-1) on how to set up and use VoiceThread effectively.  The app is a game-changer. Every semester, my online students tell me how much they \\*enjoy\\* the discussions (!!!!). Last semester, when my face-to-face classes had to convert to online, they said similar things---especially that it was VT that kept them connected to the class.\n\nI also recommend using screencasting software, especially [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) (free with Google apps). I use my voice to speak my feedback to all my students, face-to-face or online. My online students tell me it's valuable and makes them \"know that I care.\" I've done some research and have a few publications supporting the use of screencast feedback, and it's easy to find in academic journals. Also, screencasting works in any discipline and at any level! I've done many, many workshops teaching professors how to use it, and you can simply use the tutorials with Screencastify (linked above) and be up and running in minutes. \n\nI hope what I've shared here can give you a few practical applications to try. I'm not affiliated with any of the products, etc., that I mention. Without question, I know my students benefit from everything I've promoted here. My reviews and personal anecdotes support that, as well as the many \"thank yous\" that I've received from colleagues over the years.",

      "text": "Like many other people have said, the busy work is extremely frustrating. It's frustrating that one of my professors added online modules through our textbook that add 8 hours of work per week once we went online. In person, the course only consisted of lectures and exams. So I definitely did not understand the reason to add more work when we weren't doing it in the first place. Don't add things just because we are online. The assignments/expectations of the in person course should be transformed into an online version.\n\nIf your class normally involves discussion, I personally would prefer discussion over zoom during class than typing discussion posts. But either are acceptable as long as the requirements of discussion posts are within reason. If the most someone would say in class is a paragraph or 2 worth of information, there is no reason to mandate 6 paragraphs for a discussion post.\n\nGroup work is already dreadful when classes are in person. Please don't assign group projects online. Typically, I find them to be a waste of time and frustrating since someone ends up carrying most of the work for the team.\n\nIt is evident that you care about engaging your students by asking here and that does not go unnoticed. Make sure that your students know that you care. That you know some of them hate online school. It may be beneficial to have anonymous surveys throughout the semester, so your students can provide feedback.",

I think it would definitely work as an alternative for students who do not wish to use the message board, as body language and tone of voice cannot be expressed through text.",

As a result people tend to either make the most vague and non-committal observations that have no substance because they're afraid of missing the point or they go off on their own tangent which nobody else is willing to follow. Discussions aren't organic because the original posters don't have any guidance the way they might in an in-person setting.\n\nI've never had a class do this before, but I think if you pair your lecture with the online discussion it'd be more genuinely interactive. It'd be like you give your lecture over zoom and students can post in the discussion tab asking questions or making comments at the same time, and you or other students can respond in real time. This could also alleviate the anxiety people have about interrupting a lecture online as well.",

      "text": "This semester all of my classed had been online and in summary I can say, that live sessions with mandatory attendance, a well structured syllabus, reading assignments with guiding questions for preparation and break-out sessions in class for discussion worked the best for me. It is harder to engage in a discussion when you have to talk to the whole class online, however break-out session take the pressure out of it and it is way more comfortable to discuss in smaller groups (preferrably not more than 4 students in each group), especially when you were given clear questions and guidelines for the discussion. Things that did NOT work so well, were, as a lot of people mentioned before, dicussion boards and non-live classes without proper interaction with the professor or the other students. Actual group work, like presentations or research projects are not very feasible as well, since it is awful to study with people online over a longer period of time. Weekly assignments are fine and might keep students engaged, as long as they are not too demanding, since this might end up in lack of quality. Additionally you should try to keep in touch with the students as much as possible. Maybe it might still be possible to have individual appointments via phone or at least answer your e-mails frequently. As much as I hate online classes and especially miss all the social interaction, which might be a main reason for so many students despising the now obligatory format, it is possible to make it more enjoyable and interesting for everyone. Hope this helped!",

Even something as simple as trying to learn something from a different person in the same style can be much more difficult. Those students will always prefer having just you do the videos because by the time they reach the more difficult parts of the course they're already familiar with your style and how you explain things. Supplementary videos should be just that. They shouldn't ever replace content because you don't feel as though you have anything to add. For some students the fact that it's YOU saying it makes all the difference.\n\nNot the student, but you can use Zoom breakout rooms and stipulate how many people you want in each rooms.  When it's time for those to be over, you can end the breakout rooms and then people come back into the main session.",

The professor, as main host of the session, can randomly or specifically assign a certain number of students to a group, in which they can discuss a certain topic. In our class, we had to prepare readings and were given guiding questions on the reading before each sessions. After an introductory lecture and general input from the professor, we were assigned to the groups. Each group was given an individual discussion question on the topic and/or the prepared reading by the professor. Mostly, we had to prepare a short PPT-presentation with the main findings and results we came up with in our group. Sometimes, more thourough research was required, but most of the time we had an average time limit of 15 minutes. All of this happened synchronously. After the break-out session the group returns to the main session where all results of each group were discussed with the whole class. The professor can also join and switch between the individual break-out groups to give some input and observe how well everyone participates.",

Discussion boards and poorly worded multiple choice quizzes or tests, especially.\n\nNone of my classmates care what I have to say in response to their discussion post, and the ones that respond to mine don't care about when I said (or whatever they are posting) either. Since all 30 of us have the same prompt, 90% of us are saying the exact same thing.\n\nIf you're gonna do multiple choice tests or quizzes, offer more than one attempt or make it for very few points. For a class where I'd do fine on a short answer or essay based exam, I've nearly failed when all of the quizzes and exams were pulled from some online test bank (but in my case the wording was really off in some cases- like the teacher tried to change the questions just enough so they wouldn't be google-able, but it rendered them very difficult to understand what they actually meant.)\n\nPlease try to get around requiring microsoft word or other products that cost money to buy the full version. There are free, fully functional softwares available that do the same tasks. It only takes about 30 min to research which softwares would work best for your class - if you have a preference at all.

Meaning, if you know someone going to another school who does provide Office, then you may be able to temporarily borrow their access (literally just having them log into their school account on the computer you want Office on, and then have them download Office, log out, and then Office is yours). Never expires except you may eventually lose ability to update, and I believe my school allows it to be downloaded onto 5 computers... I only need a maximum of two.",

Thank you for seeking out ways to make it a bit easier on your students though!\n\nDepending on what you have for your main computer and the model of your iPad, there are a couple of different options. If your iPad is one of the latest models and you have a MacBook, sidecar is an option. That would essentially turn you iPad into a second display. At the point, you would just have to record that display during your lecture. \n\nIf you\u2019re on a PC, I would look into using one of the many screen mirroring programs out there. You\u2019d essentially want your iPad display to appear on your PC screen.  It sounds more complicated than it actually is. [Reflector 3](https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector)seems to be widely used, but I don\u2019t have much experience with it. Luckily, there\u2019s a plethora of YouTube videos available to guide you. \n\nHope this helps you out a bit!",

He does a lot to encourage us to talk and share ideas in the group.\n\nOne of the big downfalls for students in online classes is forgetting when things are due. The same professor emailed us a link to the schedule on the first day - it's just a google doc with links. Links to the recorded sessions, links to the homework, links to the quizzes, etc. Organized by week, updated regularly. He updates the links at the start of the week and when new recordings are ready, and it helps a lot to have everything in one place - no hunting around on the class webpage for the links. \n\nThe same professor also seems to despise live online lecture. He does it only when discussion is needed. Instead, he makes his own lecture videos, posts them online, and keeps the online session to 15-30 min for updates, clarification, questions, etc. The lecture videos are full of notes and visual aids, emphasizing the important points, and move fast enough to be not boring - he makes them with the expectation that we will pause and rewind and watch the video more than once. Bonus that he uses youtube so we can watch the videos on 2x speed on the second or third rewatch. The software our school uses for online sessions doesn't have a setting that allows you to change the video speed.\n\nHad a professor last semester lecture fully online, monotone, didn't know how to use his software well, etc. It was very hard to focus in his class. He eventually discovered onenote and things were a lot better, but still difficult. He was trying to continue doing things exactly as he had when classes were in person - just notes on a whiteboard. I don't fault him though - it was an unexpected, sudden change for everyone.\n\nHad another professor who took advantage of his software to make things interesting. Changed pen colors frequently, for example. It was a math class so not much you could do to make it fun beyond that. Well, he let us - encouraged us to go a bit off topic in the class chat, and that livened things up a lot - group dynamic was different though since we had all known each other from class before we all got sent online.",

Having it recorded makes it possible to catch up. \n\nWhat helped the most though was just the professors being open and understanding and accommodating. It\u2019s possible to maintain rigor and yet be super understanding of the students.

Everyday for the 4 week class we were required to post a 300 word (min) discussion post and comment on at least 5 other people's posts. Everyday after work I would come home get the dumb modules done and then puke out as much babble onto the discussion post that I could just to get the grade. It was easier to say dumb inflammatory crap than have an honest discussion so everyone in the class would spout out the hardest left or right leaning stuff and parrot whatever jargon was available. And then we would comment on each other's posts by patting each other on the back until we met our quotas. No meaningful discussion at all occurred in that forum and I spent hours writing crap I don't even believe just to get a grade and get out.\n\nUnfortunately attitudes like that are pervasive in college. It hasn't been until recently that I gained the perspective of how childishly I treated college. It's supposed to he a bastion of education and enlightenment but it seems likes every 20 year old in college does everything they can to avoid doing homework and going to class. I never read a single book I was assigned in my classes that I paid to take. I avoided my engineering homework until the last minute everytime. And I never cracked open a textbook if I could get away with looking it up on YouTube or Chegg.",

We don't want to keep track of twenty small assignments in different folders unless it's one big task with instructions from one to the next. It's easier to just follow directions than it is to skip around from assignment to assignment.\n\nAlso, please use rubrics for almost everything and honor those rubrics. I had a professor who would bury requirements in the single point or no points column when I'm looking at the column that gets me full points. So, please don't do that, but most of us rely on rubrics to give you what you want.",

Since that is not an option I think keeping students engaged and interested in the material is going to be really important, so simply having them read and discuss may not go as well as utilizing different online resources that require more focus. Do a Kahoot or many kahoots; very fun and they work virtually (if you\u2019re able to schedule some time where students can meet)!",

But what made it at least somewhat bearable was my professors acknowledging that this was a tough and complicated time to live in. I appreciated them letting students know that this was going to be the new normal but also showing us that it was a learning process for everyone involved. This made the class feel more intimate which actually made me enjoy the lectures much more.\n\nI don't know how large your classes will be nor do I know what your subjects you will be teaching, but I would recommend possibly providing some interactive aspects to your lectures. For instance, using breakout rooms to divide students into small groups (if you're using Zoom) so they can discuss key points you've just discussed.",

I thought that was nice",
