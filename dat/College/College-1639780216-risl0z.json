  "text": "So my final was due on Monday was given an extension until Wednesday at 11:59, couldn\u2019t turn it in via canvas because the assignment was locked after the due date.\n\nFinished assignment at 11:45pm Wednesday. Emailed her at 11:55pm explaining I couldn\u2019t turn it, knowing she wouldn\u2019t see it until the Thursday but at least to know that I tried to. \n\nProf emails back at 11am Thursday saying to email it to her, and that she needed it \u201cASAP by today\u201d or would have to give me a zero.\n\nEmail it to her at 2pm and then I get an email back an hour later saying she can\u2019t accept this as she\u2019s already submitted the final grades.\n\nThe thing is final grades submission to the school isn\u2019t until 4 days after the last class/final, it was only 3 days PLUS my other professors are still submitting grades and updating canvas as I type. So, she just wanted to submit it early and it\u2019s not like it can\u2019t be changed. \n\nWhat do I do? I need the grade to pass the class.. should I ask her to request a grade change form to be sent to the office of registrar or just take the L.",

If I received an A on it -it would\u2019ve been enough to pass. \nMy thing is she didn\u2019t HAVE to submit the grades at that time, especially since she knew I was having issues sending it. \nOther professors haven\u2019t even graded my finals and they were also due on this same Monday. Some are even saying to have everything turned in by 12/20 as that\u2019s when the school grades are officially posted and final.  \n So I\u2019m like what was the point of that?",
