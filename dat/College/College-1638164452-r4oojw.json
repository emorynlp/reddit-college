  "text": "Enjoyed meeting strangers on Omegle  when I was in high school except the creepy uncle flashing his dicks. \n\nHow did everyone find Omegle? Any fun video chat ideas to engage or connect with students?  Should we bring back Omegle for college students? Would you like to meet strangers or meet people in your city/community?
