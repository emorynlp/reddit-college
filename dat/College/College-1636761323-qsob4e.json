  "text": "I\u2019m a 19 year old sophomore and this is my first year of campus. I have yet to go to a party, get drunk, smoke, have a night out of fun aka the typical college experience but I mainly want to do these things because for some reason I feel like I\u2019m missing out. I always hear people talk about parties they went to while I just go home on weekends because I prefer being there and I\u2019m 30 minutes away. I have friends and also a boyfriend who are in the same position as me and are also introverts and we just want to have one night of fun just for the experience and to get it out our systems I guess. How do I go along getting invited to parties and just making college more fun?",

      "text": "I go to a school with a huge party scene. BUT only if you are in Greek life. I am introverted and despise the Greek life, they basically run the school. But my roommate and I have still managed to get pretty large parties. \n\n  \nYou just have to make connections in class and in clubs. You meet one person, they have a group of three friends, your boyfriend meets one person and they have a group of friends. At this point that's already a group of 12-15 you can potentially get together. Also, the big parties you might be hearing about, believe it or not they are all the same for the most part. Last year I went to several large house parties and the first one was a blast. All of the ones after that were exactly the same and got old quick. \n\n  \nLastly, everyone at college is in it to have a good time, so don't be afraid to reach out and ask for an invitation :)",

      "text": "If you have friends and a boyfriend in the same position then thats kind of an easy fix, throw something yourself. It doesn't have to be a giant house party but a get together with friends drinking and hanging out will probably be more enjoyable for a group of introverts.",

      "text": "If it\u2019s stressing you out just go to one. You\u2019re lucky that you already have people who want to go with you. When I went to my first college party, I had to literally beg my friends to go because nobody wanted to. I didn\u2019t really care for the scene, but I was very glad I got the experience under my belt. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how parties work on your campus, but it usually isn\u2019t hard to just show up at one and get let in.",

      "text": "i was like you. fortunately, my roommates had connections for parties & i would go with them on Saturday nights every 2-3 weeks. I never went to homecoming, prom, any high party, etc. ever since I transfered to a state university, I decided that I was not going to be introverted & take some risks. I was always too scared to go out of my small social circle. honestly, these college parties are overrated (or i haven't been to one that's crazy/big). also, drinking & smoking has never been my scene. I just want want check out some parties, meet some people, hangout & have fun. I didn't really like the parties I went to, but I'm glad i got the experience.",
