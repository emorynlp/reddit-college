  "title:": "Should I rat my friend out?",
  "text": "So, i am currently taking a CSE class and although its been rough I was still able to do all the projects myself without anyone's help. One of my friends is also taking the same class,  yet he was failing and needed some help. I sent him my codes for the second and third project in the hopes that he would be smart enough to make it his own code instead of just changing some of the spacing and some of the variables. Today I got an email saying that my code is very similar to someone else's for my second project, my friend got it too. I currently have a scholarship and cant risk getting a failing grade in the class, and after talking to my friend he told me to say anything that will help me even if it means mentioning him. Should I rat my friend out and make up a story in which he ends up being the bad guy? I really need some advice on this since this is the first time something like this has ever happened to me.",

Idk what story you can come up to, but high chance you are just as screwed as him.\n\n I was in similar situation about receiving that kind of email. It was someone I didn\u2019t even know and they asked us to code it in front of them to prove we know the content and we are innocent.",
