  "title:": "Picking a school dilemma",
  "text": "Few choices in my dilemma for selecting a school\n\noption 1: Far away from home, great rankings, beautiful campus, direct flights to my local (home) airport an hour from campus. Suburban area, close to the beach\n\nOption 2: Closer to home, an hour train rides away. Big city, focused on my major, not the best rankings, the campus is meh, dorms are meh. Could transfer after a year or two to the larger, better-ranked school right next door, co-op program \n\nOption 3: 5ish hour train ride, big city, beautiful campus, decent rankings, nice facilities, sort of a party school so may create distractions\n\nOption 4: the same ride as #3, the same city as #3, nice campus, highest-ranked out of these 4, co-op program, runs on quarterly schedule so not sure about course rigor.",
