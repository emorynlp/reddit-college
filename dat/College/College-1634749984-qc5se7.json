  "text": "Report bc original post got removed bc my title mentioned a laptop (?)\n\nHi all, this is probably a super dumb question. Throughout high school and my past 1.5 yrs of college, I\u2019ve always printed out notes supplied by professors and taken notes manually. However, it\u2019s started to be more of a hassle and I don\u2019t like to use so much paper. I\u2019m really bad with technology tbh so I don\u2019t really know where to look. Does anyone know any applications/programs that I can use to take notes of pdf files of lecture slides (on a laptop)?\n\nI always see people using their iPads to take notes and I\u2019d honestly love to do something like that, but unfortunately I\u2019m way too broke for an iPad right now lol.",

      "text": "I use an iPad now, but for a solid year before I got it, I used a drawing tablet hooked up to a laptop. Mine was a beginner Wacom tablet that was $80 (tbf I actually draw with it lol), but you can definitely find some Huion ones that are like $30 and are just as good for note-taking purposes. I really recommend using One Note as a notetaking app, and turning off pen pressure sensitivity regardless of what app you use (it makes your handwriting less jank).  \n\nIt's really not nearly as convenient as an iPad is ofc (set-up is much less space efficient, obviously less portable, handwriting is less neat now that I look back at it, and if you've never used a drawing tablet before, there's a learning curve that might take a couple of weeks). But if you want a stop-gap while saving up for one, or even if you just want to try it out, I think it's cheap enough to hold you over. Plus, if you like it enough to keep at it, all the better! I liked this method enough that if I hadn't upgraded, I still would've stuck to it over paper.",

There also is this notebook that they sell at target or something I think called rocketbook maybe like $30 where you take notes on it with a special kind of erasable pen, then upload a pic to the app, then it makes them into online notes, and then you out the notebook in the oven and it erases everything. If you look it up there will be a less confusing description but it is really cool \ud83d\ude02",
