  "text": "What the heck do I do when the donor zoom meeting is conflicting with my calculus final exam date and time. I feel like the donor should have known that there\u2019s final exams in that week. I can\u2019t just tell the donor to change the time because this is a big company. They were the ones who invited me for that time. The only way to not conflict the time is probably begging my calculus professor to change it for me. This is ridiculous lol.",

Well, they probably just didn\u2019t care and just pick whatever date is available for them.\n\n This looks like a big event and many members will be there who are in this big company so I feel weird asking that one person with the only email I can contact if he could change the date. There was no option to change time or date in the email. It just says register or you will regret it.",
