  "text": "First, a bit of context:\n\nSome time ago, during my BSc, i found myself really interested in a research topic. That topic was ageing and anti-ageing research. So i looked up who in my country was doing that kind of research, and found that the head of the genetics department at my uni is one of the foremost researchers in the field. So i wrote him a letter that i was interested, and would he consider being my advisor in a TDK (student research competition). He said he'd consider it, and we should meet. A date was agreed upon, i went, we talked. I got into his research group, i will shortly be second author on a nature article, all is well.\n\nHere's where the question comes in. Why was this so easy? I wasn't seriously evaluated, i was just in. There wasn't and still isn't anyone from my age range in this or almost any other research group at my uni. Hardly anyone does TDK, hardly anyone wants to do research. Why? I literally got my own lab, and a fast track to an academic career. Why is no one doing this?\n\nPs.: Sorry for my horrible spelling, i am not english, and quite tired.",

      "text": "Because not everybody wants to do research.  Duh.\n\nIt's a generally long process and sometimes the end results are not rewarding. It could also be your part of the county/country/ state/providence does not really have that many researchers in the area (hence them just bringing you in, I have never ever heard of someone being brought into a lab without at least an intake interview and department review)\n\nOther people aren't lazy, you just happen to be proactive and lucky. Also sound a little vain.",
