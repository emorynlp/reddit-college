  "text": "I\u2019ve been in college for a couple of years now. Aside from a couple of anomalies, I\u2019m an A/B student. Maybe it\u2019s COVID, maybe it\u2019s something more. But I\u2019m so tired of trying to push myself to work full-time and hold a full-time school schedule. I\u2019m a Chemistry major and my classes are getting so hard. And I\u2019ve worked in the education system for the past few years and I\u2019m just so burnt out.\n\nI just want to know what my best options are? Like I\u2019m applying to scholarships like crazy, and I don\u2019t have much of a social life. Do I just keep on keeping on or like watch some inspirational Nike ads? Lol like what tf do I do? Or has anyone else been through something similar? How did you handle the stress?",
