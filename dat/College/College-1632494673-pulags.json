  "text": "This is my third semester at a community college and for the first two semesters, we did hybrid learning so roughly 1/4 of all students were on campus at any given time. Campus was basically dead.\n\nIt was quite nice actually, I'm a loner by nature and enjoyed the peace and quiet. I talked to maybe one or two people total in all my classes. And my class size was tiny, about 2-5 people a class.\n\nBut this semester the campus is absolutely buzzing with people and activity. I've had multiple guys stop me and compliment me on what I'm wearing, people will say \"good morning\" or otherwise greet each other, and generally are a lot friendlier and more social than last semesters. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it just due to lack of social connection for the past year?",
