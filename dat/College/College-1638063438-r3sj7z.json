  "text": "Hi all!\n\nI did Penn Foster for high school a few years ago and am considering using them for college. I currently have a small online shop/brand for my art but am near clueless as to how it will go down the line. I\u2019m wanting to get into business management to learn how to take it down a good path, but I\u2019m not sure what to pick. They offer 4 things I\u2019m interested in, though I can\u2019t decide which would be best for me and the future so I\u2019m hoping someone can give me a pointer! (No one in my family has gone to college so I\u2019m pretty lost, I apologize)\n\nBusiness Management Associates Degree\n\nE-Business Management Certificate\n\nSmall Business Management Career Diploma \n\nStarting Your Own Business Career Diploma\n\nI\u2019ve heard a certificate can be good in certain circumstances but I\u2019ve also heard a degree beats all. Any help would be very appreciated!",

      "text": "None. Go to a community college if you want to pursue this. Penn Foster is a for-profit school. Nothing you get from there will be respected by most employers, especially large, prestigious companies. Especially for business. Your b-school matters so much for your exit opportunities as a business major. You don\u2019t want a school that will get your resume thrown out.\n\nThere is almost never a single reason to attend a for profit school. Their instruction is trash, their standards are nonexistent, and their career outcomes are sad. \n\n[For profit students make up 11% of all students in the US but make up 44% of student loan defaults.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/10/these-are-the-schools-driving-americas-student-loan-crisis/)\n\n[Most students end up worse-off at the end.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/for-profit-earnings/485141/)\n\nThe ONLY reason to attend a for-profit is if you\u2019re well into your career and your company just wants a certain degree for advancement and they\u2019ll pay for it. Even then, its 2021. All types of schools from community colleges to the Ivy League offer degrees online. You can get every single kind of degree fully online from a great school besides a PhD really. So why ever support this scummy industry that\u2019s destroying the educational system?\n\nDon\u2019t.",

              "text": "Yes you can, you should take a look at other states and see their exact laws on it in terms of in-state and out of state tuition for CC. You could try to transfer your credits across CC systems and be proactive about it by telling both colleges about it, keeping all of your class syllabi(this is to compare course objectives, very important for transferring across systems), and seeing specifically if your target transfer uni would accept it.\n\nIf you can avoid it, I say try to finish it all in one state.",
