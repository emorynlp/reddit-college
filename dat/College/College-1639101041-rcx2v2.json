  "text": "I actually didn\u2019t have a bad first year in college. My second year was alright, but it was clear that I was struggling with what path I wanted to take. Ended up changing majors after my sophomore year, from I.T, to computer science. In my transition from sophomore year to junior year, the pandemic hit. And boy did it hit me. While I wasn\u2019t on academic probation, I absolutely could not pass the needed computer science class to proceed to the next one. I just could not do online school.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that when you switch majors, it automatically adds a year to your track. Added with the pandemic year I had for comp sci, it added ANOTHER YEAR. So now it\u2019s projected 6 years.\n\nThe problem is that this past semester was was the first time we were really back in person. But, while I actually made an effort to do study groups and actually try to learn, I am afraid that I did not do well enough on the final to get the C to go to the next class.\n\nI just feel really dis motivated. I do really want to to Comp Sci, but I admittedly need to fix my study habits. I just for the life of me can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so hard for me to improve on them.  This is admittedly all on me at this point, and I need to get it together on my studying.\n\nAnybody else take at least 6 years to finish undergrad? My main concern is that I may not be able to financially do it anymore, as I\u2019m taking loans out to get through school. What are my options to soften the financial blow of the amount of loans for when I proceed, and get out of school?",
