      "text": "The best, or fastest way to access high levels of compensation is to be really damned good at what you do.  \n\nThat's not fortune-cookie wisdom, that's a reality that you should dwell upon.  \n\nIf you are smart enough to get accepted to a good university that you are smart enough, and have the self-discipline to push yourself through a couple of classes that you hate because you know there is a good reward on the other end of the rainbow.  \n\nBut that's not the level of competency or excellence that will enable you to access the levels of competency you have in mind.  \n\nYou can't just get good grades in the subject.  \n\nYou have to invest your personal time in the pursuit of the subject matter.  \nYou have to join clubs to talk about it.  \nYou have to find a way to tinker with, and practice manipulating the subject matter.  \n\nYou need to fall asleep not every night, but many nights thinking about the issues relevant to the subject matter.  \n\nAnd you need to keep doing this for the next 10 to 15 years (your entire early-career phase).  \n\n\nIt's not super-difficult to push yourself through a couple classes you hate.  \n\nIt's not outrageously challenging to get a job doing things you don't actually enjoy.  \n\nBut it is very uncommon for an individual to be able to keep doing those things that they hate for a decade or more.  \n\nSo, that brings us full-circle back to the beginning.  \n\nI'll rephrase your original question slightly:  \n\n*\"What career-path has the best opportunity for high compensation?\"*  \n\nThe answer, IMO is this:  \n\n*\"The career you enjoy the most.\"*  \n\n\nIt's not super-difficult to access six-figure salaries and associated compensation in the US, if you are exceptional at what you do.  \n\nPlease observe my intentional use of the word **exceptional**.  \n\nYou don't have to be a super-genius to become really damned good at your profession.  \nYou just have to apply yourself, full-swing, all-in.",
