  "text": "We have a group study that must be passed to our professor and he will be submitting it in turnitin to see if our paper has below 20% match in order for us to proceed with the exams. I and my classmates do not have a Turnitin account as our prof is the only one being able to do so. \n\nThe thing here is that most of the work is done by my groupmates and being the leader, I had to assign them parts of the paper for them to work on. I had to copy-paste every paragraph they have made in Google in order to check if they just copy-pasted articles from the internet. To my disappointment, most of the works are copied from the net (some word for word) so I had to paraphrase them and change some drastically. \n\nMy question is, is Google an effective plagiarism/similar text checker compared to Turnitin with additional options of checking? Even though I have edited everything I feel like Turnitin is going to notice a lot of similar texts and I worry that we have to repeat it again hence having a lower grade.",

I am so sorry you have to deal with this.\n\nIf it's so easily found just by Googling, then it will definitely be recognized by Turnitin, and paraphrasing alone won't take care of the issue. Sources have to be properly documented. Did your plagiarizing groupmates at least note where they copied their work from?",
