Dropping out is always an option if you feel it\u2019s better for your mental health, but you will most likely not be able to work in your desired field if you do that.",

      "text": ">Should I just drop out, take my college money, and live off of that? \n\nI think that's the worst option. It's not a terrible thing to find out that college isn't for you if you're really finding that out, particularly so early. It would be a bad thing if you're spending this money without figuring out how you're going to replace it because you are going to have to end up doing something. One door closes and others are open but you will have to walk through one of them. I won't tell you to take your money and go to trade school because it's basically the same problem many high school grads have with going to college without a solid plan, you don't know which trade/major you're going to like, much less one you can tolerate doing. What I will tell you is get any job and try to figure out a path while the college money you'll probably want to use to start down that path is either holding steady or at least going down slowly. That way when you wake up and say 'I want to crew on superyachts' you have this money to go learn marine engineering or marine electrical right away.\n\ntl;dr It's fine and maybe even helpful to learn what isn't for you but it ain't fine to stand still just because you learned one path doesn't fit you.",
