  "text": "I am two semesters away from graduating but even now I\u2019m still messing up and failing two of my classes. I keep justifying it by telling myself that I\u2019ll do better next semester and if I have to I\u2019ll just graduate in the summer. I\u2019ve been in school for the past 6 years and when I finish my b.s it\u2019ll be 7 years. Anyone else say I\u2019ll do better the next semester and never do?",

      "text": "Yep. Especially during COVID. Took a break from school and told myself I\u2019ll do better. Don\u2019t have access to my adhd medicine though, and for certain classes the motivation just isn\u2019t there. That and feeling increasingly lonely because I feel like I have to choose between either studying or being with friends for most days.",
