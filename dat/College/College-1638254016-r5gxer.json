  "title:": "Survey for College Students Regarding Social Media Use and Mental Heath",
  "text": "Like the title says, I'm conducting a research project for school analyzing the impact of social media use on mental health and grades, while also cross-examining the impact of remote learning and how it has affected your social media use. Please, consider taking a few minutes to fill out the survey, as I need a lot of responses to get reliable data.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIVfidCx5uFLKP3r4wCFo\\_qX2SdaNR7DutMhR7Y95rbCknQQ/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIVfidCx5uFLKP3r4wCFo_qX2SdaNR7DutMhR7Y95rbCknQQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)",
