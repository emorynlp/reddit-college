  "text": "I've just started an assignment around college application support for students. I'm from Ireland. Before college, students attend secondary school. Secondary schools have Guidance Counsellors who help students with their colleges choices, applications, etc. But I'm wondering how it works in other countries? So what country are people from and did you have Guidance Counsellors? If not, who helps students? Was there a dedicated professional available to guide students? Or did you need to get external support?",
