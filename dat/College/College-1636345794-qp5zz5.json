  "text": "I graduated High School in 2018. Entered college that same year and dropped out for a year because of anxiety. Got in again in 2019 and I didn't like my university. Applied for a scholarship in one of the best private universities of my country and after the longest examinations I got in with a scholarship in Chemical Engineering and started studying in 2020.\n\nI was never particularly good in Math, Physics or Chemistry. Just did enough to get by and sometimes I was able to get a high grade. Most of what I know now I learned in the last 4 months because I failed Calculus I and had to study everyday to pass it during the summer.\n\nMy dad died in April 9th, and 10 days later I had to star the spring trimestre. I had no chance to grieve properly and my mental health plumeted. I didn't care about classes. That's why I failed Calculus and learnt almost nothing of Chemistry.\n\nBut not everything was bad, when I passed Calculus i felt like I could actually do engineering and that it wasn't that bad.\n\nFast forward to today's date and I'm struggling with every class, I have no study method or discipline. I realized I don't like what I'm studying, I feel horrible everytime I'm in class and even have had some panic attacks due to how wasteful I feel i am being with my time.\n\nMy scholarship needs me to have a 3.5 or higher GPA and mine is getting lower and lower with each test. \n\nI have told myself a hundred times to get over it and just get my degree since I should be graduating in 2022 if I hadn't dropped out twice, but the disconformt is too much to handle.\n\nI want to change to Psychology, I have been interested in it for over 5 years and in retrospective I should've majored in it since the beginning, but i told myself that engineering was gonna give me more money. Now money doesn't seem as appetizing as a sane mind.\n\nI don't know what to do, i just want to hear y'all.",
