  "text": "And I am not talking about just the suborbital trips conducted by the billionaires but the Commercial Crew flights to the \"International Space Station\" on the SpaceX \"Crew Dragon\" and hopefully the Boeing \"Starliner\" by next year as well. There is also the \"Orion\" and \"Space Launch System\" which NASA hopes to land astronauts on the Moon year after year after 2024 to prepare for human missions on Mars hopefully by the late 2030s or early 2040s.\n\nNASA and other space agencies plan to operate the ISS until 2030 while at the same time construct a \"Gateway\" orbiting the Moon with a reusable lunar lander starting in 2024.\n\nThere was one billionaire space mission that excited me and that was \"Inspiration4\".\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/970173918/the-skys-not-even-the-limit-cancer-survivor-to-become-youngest-american-in-space\n\nSo how have people at your college reacted? Were any of them excited for it? Were most apathetic to it? Did anyone criticized the billionaire space race or even scientific space exploration? \n\nI heard that many people including civil rights leaders protested the Apollo launches. For those of you at Florida colleges do you think lots of your fellow students will come to Artemis or even Commercial Crew launches to protest?\n\nAs a space fan I don't mind the protests. It is nice to see young people being aware about current events. I would be worried if they were spending all that energy and yet do not show up at the polls to vote for leaders who share their views.",
