  "title:": "Is 6 W's on undergrad transcript too much?",
  "text": "My Spring 2021 semester I had 5 Ws. I joined AFROTC about a month into the semester. It overwhelmed me significantly and I was taking 21 credit hours with my additional AF courses. I also was completely online because of the rona, and I just do not learn well in an online environment, I need an instructor lecturing me. Most teachers during the rona were useless and lazy and did not even post lectures - many just posted long pdf docs for us to read and that was our 'learning time'. Anyways, I dropped two classes so I could manage my time better. Horrible idea - I ended up quitting AFROTC about a month later, because it was still affecting my academics. I technically had 2 classes under AFROTC, so that was two more drops. Now I have a total of 4. I took up a second session 6-week course since I had dropped so many credits, and the class was an absolute disaster. More than half of the class ended up dropping - the teacher was a complete moron, and spoke to us students in email as if we were stupid. The emails are honestly appalling and I know students from that class are currently trying to get him fired. So I had to drop that class too, and I missed the cutoff to drop without a W by like 4 days. So that is 5 W's right there in one semester. I still completed the semester with 4 classes and straight As, however.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow this semester, I am taking six courses. I obviously need to tell myself not to bite off more than I can chew come next semester, because I do not know what goes through my mind when I sign up for six courses. I am a junior btw. I realized about a month ago that I cannot stand my major (GIS) and I want to switch majors, so I am going into Landscape Architecture next semester and taking a couple extra years of undergrad and will join the National Guard to help pay for the extra years. I am taking one class this semester where the professor is god awful; I even hired a tutor online and I have met with him multiple times, and he says that my prof is the worst he has ever seen in Comp Sci (it's a Python class but like for maps). I have a 95 in it right now, but it will only go down from there. I am guessing that I will get at highest a C+. I want to drop it so badly especially since I am changing majors so it will be a useless class, and the prof is horrible. 6 W's sounds bad, but two are just from AFROTC classes, so I like to think of it just as 4. Is it a horrible idea to drop my current Python class? Should I just take the C+ or whatever I get? I have a 4.0 GPA, and I don't want it to look like I just drop all of the classes I don't get an A in - I feel like that is exactly what it looks like. I'm nervous as hell, any help would be appreciated.",
