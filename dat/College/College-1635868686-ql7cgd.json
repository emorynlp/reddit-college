  "text": "I'm not sure what to put in my financial aid appeal without sounding like I'm blaming my professors. I failed organic chemistry one quarter and microbiology the next quarter so my financial aid has been suspended. Both of the classes were online and had very bad professors in my opinion. microbiology was the worst. Th prof's \"lectures\" were her reading verbatim from notes with no other explanations and she would use abbreviations that wouldn't be explained. Her test were open notes and she had us print notes that she said would be all we need, but i still failed all of the tests and she wouldn't let us see it afterwards to see what we missed. I've since switched out of pre-nursing and I'm over halfway through my first quarter in the medical assisting program where I have a's in all 3 of my classes.",
