  "text": "High school junior here. I'm just wondering if there is as much an importance on competitive events (not just DECA, but Speech and Debate, MUN, HOSA, FBLA, etc) in college as there is in high school. I've seen some people do MUN in college, and I know DECA has some things too. But, in general, are competitive events as significant as they are in high school or are things like internships, jobs more important? Right now, I'm feeling a lot of peer/parental pressure to participate in some and the only way I'm getting through this is by telling myself there's almost exactly 1 more year of this (11/30 is when UC applications are due)!",
