  "text": "Ok I just wanna start by saying I don\u2019t have ADHD or any other mental illnesses.\n\nI had really good work ethic in HS and freshman year of college. It all went downhill during the pandemic and especially sophomore year when everything went online. I\u2019m a junior now, and I know I have the potential to get shit done, but Idk why I just can\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not even gen eds, it\u2019s major classes and other important job related responsibilities. \n\nI\u2019m also noticing that every time I go home to my strict mother, I can get stuff done lol. \n\nI really miss my old productivity. I wish I could just stop binging YouTube because I feel so unmotivated.",

      "text": "This might sound like a no-brainer, but try separating your work enviroment from the place you relax in. I always found that I was a million times more productive if I went to the library, vs doing homework in my dorm room. \n\nHaving a study buddy also really helped me. If you have a friend who also needs to get work done, you can do your homework in the same space and hold each other accountable. This also works if you just study in a space that's quiet, with other people around. \n\nAnd last, if you haven't done this already, it would likely be worth your while to contact your school's counseling center and make an appointment. Therapy is a great resource for anyone and if youre struggling with productivity, it could help to voice your concerns with a professional and let them give you some advice.",

      "text": "I was about to ask the same question. I feel like, I have lost my passion for school and I don\u2019t wanna go to class anymore, but on the other hand I\u2019m junior and I need two more years to get my degree. The only thing that keeps me going is, it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to waste the last two years for nothing.",

Once covid hit it dropped to a 2.7, entirely because of my in ability to become productive, I for the life of me cannot study from home. 6 weeks into this semester and I\u2019ve gotten pretty much an A on everything since Everything is in person and I can finally study on campus again, specifically the library.",
