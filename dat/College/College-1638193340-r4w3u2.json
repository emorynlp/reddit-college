  "title:": "Difficulty in wanting to complete work/attend class",
  "text": "I'm doing a 4-year course in Computer science, and I've found myself starting to really not want to do anything since November, my energy levels have gone down and I've just felt so burnt out because I not only find a lot of difficulty with what I'm learning, but I'm getting so much work that I couldn't even get a job the first 2 months I arrived here with the excessive workload\n\nNow come November with no breaks and I've just run out of wanting to continue doing work, I have a passion for the subject and what I'm learning, I just have such a great deal of difficulty understanding it and taking it all in. I've contacted my course director and they've given me more classes to help me understand but I'm afraid of failing, as I got perfect scores on my exams till now\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this and what can I do to save myself from failing everything",
