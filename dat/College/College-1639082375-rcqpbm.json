  "text": "I wasn\u2019t very close with him, but I had him for at least one class every semester since Spring 2020 and I just talked to him a couple of weeks ago. I found out on my lunch break at work while talking to my other prof about our final projects. Now I\u2019m just hiding out in the bathroom kind of sad. This is the first time I had a prof/teacher pass away during the semester.",
