  "text": "When I first came to college my parents told me that every first year gains the freshmen 15 because they have free range of the cafeteria and get as much as they want. But I have been loosing weight because I\u2019m trying to eat healthy, but I also struggle to eat 2-3 dining hall meals a day because all my classes are spread out, so I can never find the time to walk all the way to the dining hall unless it\u2019s very early or very late. When I was at home, I would eat many small snacks but now I have to eat a meal to get some food. Does anybody have any advice on how to not unintentionally starve yourself and loose weight?",

I\u2019d meet up with friends for breakfast/lunch/dinner as a freshman and all the walking I did made me very hungry so I loaded up on the food. \n\nIt sounds lame but I forced myself to pick out any type of fruits/veggies with every meal so that way I didn\u2019t just fill up on cookies/ice cream/sugary cereal/snacks even if I hated it. Broccoli and cauliflower are great for you and if you eat them first you can just get it out of the way lmao",

A lack physical activity due to more studying and shit can also be a culprit. I took 2 years off before deciding to go back and I gained a lot of weight on the 1st because I literally didn\u2019t do shit lol. I sat on the couch uninspired asf all day and I hate myself for it(the part where I was sitting all day, I don\u2019t regret taking the time off though since I started my first business and actually started networking in the industry I wanted to get into . But my actual freshman year I\u2019m down 20lbs from just watching my macros. I was eating chick fil a literally every day and later on chipotle(which was a lot easier to track calories and maintain where ai wanted to be since the menu was just healthier in general, whereas at chick fil a I had a specific meal that just worked) but I was making sure it kept me at or around 30/40/30 on most days and my job made sure I was getting my steps in while also doing mountain biking every so often. You probably don\u2019t need this advice but majority of the ppl reading this probably did gain rather than lose on their freshman year so here ya go.",

It sounds bizarre I know, but eventually your body gets used to the small amount of calories and will start holding onto everything you eat so the weight loss will plateau. and once you go so low, it will no longer be sustainable. \n\nProtein bars, like cliff builder bars are great. If you have a microwave on your floor or a mini fridge, you can do some rice with veggies. greek yogurt & oatmeal is also a good option. \n\nYou can also see if your dining hall has a to go program, you could go in the morning for breakfast and then take your lunch togo.

I would say keep a ton of snacks in your dorm so that you can always eat something even at odd times in the day. Also carry a snack with you in your backpack as well. You don't always need to use a meal to get food if your campus has little convenience stores. Also, take extra food from your meal to bring back to your dorm (like a banana or salad).",
