  "text": "So, i am a freshman and I got to a community college. I had an algebra II class online the whole semester and thought the final would be online as well. It wasn\u2019t. We ended up having to take it in person and I made a dumb mistake. I used a math solver on the computer while taking the final and the instructor found out and told me she knew. She did an academic misconduct student notification form and sent it to the academic dean for academic discipline. I just got a meeting scheduled and I\u2019m interested to know what will happen. Am I over with?",

You can expect minimally to fail the exam and possibly to fail the course and there may be a notification on your transcript or file that you have to report when you transfer or if a job asks for that information in the future.",

You should have been given weeks notice but a class is online for a reason. They could have proctored it and still have you at home\n\nI don\u2019t know what a math solver is so I can\u2019t say much about that one. Set up a meeting with your teacher and professor and admit what you did and ask what will the process be. If it\u2019s your first incident it won\u2019t be as bad",

              "text": "It's partially a precaution against cheating. It's much harder to proctor students when you can't be in the room with them. Pre-Covid many places would require online students to go to a testing center local to them to take exams. Online exams were unavoidable when having people gather to take a test wasn't reasonable but I suspect we'll see more classes asking for in person exams in the future.",

If this is your first instance they may just fail you for the class and give you a warning. \n\nEither way when you get called in to talk to someone about the incident, don't lie. Especially if your professor has proof, you'd just look like an idiot. Own up to what you did and sincerely apologize, promising to never do it again. Don't try to give a bs excuse as to why you felt the need to cheat. There is never a good reason.",
