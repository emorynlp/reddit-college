  "title:": "In school for accounting now but r/accounting says Information Systems is a better major. Thoughts?",
  "text": "Pretty much title; I'm still not very far into my major but I'm graduating with my associates degree next summer and from there I'll be transferring to a university. I genuinely love accounting but everybody just makes it sound like this fucking awful monotonous job that sucks your soul out for barely decent pay. Before majoring in accounting I was doing physics major and minoring in mathematics but I wasn't impressed with job prospects. Everybody keeps mentioning the IT route; my gf is well established in her career doing IT and she makes bank and seems to enjoy it which has me thinking; is accounting even worth it? My goal was to get my MBA -> CPA, but now I'm debating on a different path. I genuinely want a healthy work-life balance and to make as much money as possible if I'm being totally honest. What are your thoughts?",

      "text": "Accounting, while monotonous and repetitive, pays pretty well. IT/IS pays well and has new problems to solve every day. It will be the better option if you enjoy technology. That being said, a lot of IT jobs lack a good work life balance, as you\u2019ll usually be on call, required to either work weekends, holidays, or 24/7, or spending your spare time learning and taking certifications to stay relevant. There ARE jobs out there with good work life balance, and you may not always be required to be on call or constantly take certification exams, but it is relatively common place in the industry. Despite how bad I make it sound, I would take it over accounting any day. IT is extremely flexible and you can easily change career paths with a bit of studying and drive. Find out you hate dealing with customers? Don\u2019t do IT support/system administration and do software based roles instead. Love cybersecurity but find yourself bored of it one day? Try another path in IT. Your accounting knowledge should be very useful if you ever go into management; I have to take an accounting course in my IT major.",
