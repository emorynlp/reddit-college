      "text": "In this situation you're gunna have to lie. For me I did a bsc in biochem for 3 years and just transferred into cs honours this school year; I'm 22 rn. A lot of the girls I currently date are 18-20 years old, due to older people at uni being so rare. I don't lie about my age or year of study due to me only being a few years older at most. However, since youre 24, I'd definitely recommend you even lie about your age by a couple of years too. While I don't normally promote lying, in this instance you have to if you want any sort of success. Any girl your age is gunna likely have a career with her own place or already married. Obviously if you want a serious relationship then lying about that stuff may be significantly more difficult to pull off in the long term. So it's up to you in the end, but just my suggestion",
