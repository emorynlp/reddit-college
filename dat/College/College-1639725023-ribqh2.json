  "text": "You can skip this long paragraph if you want, I just wanted to provide a little background and I tend to talk a lot so I might've typed too much lol. \n\nBasically, I've had a pretty rough time with school. I went to community college last year and failed two classes and withdrew from four. I was extremely depressed and was suffering from undiagnosed ADHD. I transferred to my local university this recent fall semester thinking living on campus and the university structure would help me (my home situation also wasn't great so this was a way for me to escape). I hadn't been in school for about seven months at the start of the semester and I had been doing a LOT better. I will always struggle with depression but I am not in the same place I was last year at all and I am doing pretty good mentally. I thought I was ready to go back to school and then I was diagnosed with ADHD right before the semester started. I've still been trying to figure things out with medication and therapy for that. Over winter break I'm going to be doing one week trials of different medications and doses to kinda speed run the process before the spring semester starts. I'm also taking a 5 week course over winter break so technically I'm taking 24 credits next semester but that's just how it's billing me and not how it's going to feel like. So, last semester I failed my statistics course not because the material was hard (I actually found it pretty easy) but just because I started to fall behind with my work and could never catch up. I also withdrew from my English 101 course early in the semester. Next semester will be my fourth attempt at that class (I'm genuinely good at writing and English, it's just I get overwhelmed by writing big essays and the structure of the class doesn't work well with my brain and that's why it's so hard for me). So since I'm so behind on my math and English gen eds I decided to take English 101, 102, statistics, and regular math all in the same semester, but they will all be 8 week courses. \n\nFor context, I'm a History and Education double major (technically just history, secondary education isn't a major but the certification requires even more credits than my main major).\n\nSo, this is what my classes will look like -- they are all 3 credits -- and how many times a week they meet.\n\nHistory of Women in the Middle East (2x/week)\n\nFoundations of American Education (1x/week)\n\nStatistics - 8 week course (2x week) & Quantitative Math - 8 week course (2x week)\n\nEnglish 101 - 8 week course  (online) & English 102 - 8 week course (online)\n\nAstronomy (online)\n\nCurrently, I would only have class on Mondays and Wednesdays. I have the rest of the week to study. Ideally it would feel like I'm just taking a regular course load of 15 credits, just that a couple of the courses would be pretty fast paced. \n\nThis is pretty much what my course list would look like anyway, just without doubling up on math and English. I know that the 8 week courses will be intense but I think that works better for my ADHD because halfway through a course I tend to burn out and the 16 week semester is just way too long for me so I think they will be fast and stimulating enough for me. By the time I start to burn out, I'll be done with those courses and then starting something new.\n\nI'm also not terribly worried about the accelerated classes because I'm relatively good at math and I literally just took the statistics class I'll be taking at the beginning of the semester and quantitative mathematics is supposed to be even easier. I also have ideas of how to succeed in my English classes for once because it's not my writing skills that's causing me to not pass this class, it's my time management skills, executive dysfunction, and my inability to ask for help. If I can find a way to overcome those I don't think passing will be too much of a problem for me.\n\nI'm kinda nervous about this but I really want to catch up. After the spring semester I'll be two years into my degree and still so behind if I don't pick up the pace. The main thing about being behind for me is more about the money and time wasted rather than how I look to other people or my peers or whatever so it's more for practical reasons that I'm putting pressure on myself to catch up like this. If I pass all these classes I can spend the rest of my degree just taking 12 credits a semester as long as I take a class a year during the summer or winter, which I would really like so that I have time to work to actually pay for this degree and have a life too.\n\nI'm planning to talk to all of my professors at the start of the semester so I can set myself up well and keep them in the loop. I plan on talking to my school's disability office as well but I'm not sure what accomodations would actually be helpful. \n\nI guess what I'm asking for here is reassurance that what I'm doing is alright and I'm not shooting myself in the foot. \n\nSorry for such a long post! Thanks for reading this all. I wanted to give enough details about the situation so that my situation could be properly assessed.",
