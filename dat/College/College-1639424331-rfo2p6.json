  "text": " I have 20 assignments due by 11:59 pm. if i hurry and work till the last minute i may be able to crack open at least 15 of them, but definitely all of them. I'll probably get at least a C which is better than an F. my teacher allowed me to turn any missing assignments and I've been extremely lazy. they take about 40 min to complete, and it's all done via software. What is my best strategy?",
