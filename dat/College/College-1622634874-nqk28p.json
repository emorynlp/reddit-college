  "text": "Why do professors think we have way more time because of Zoom classes??? Yes I save 20 minutes a day to not drive to class and that\u2019s it. A lot of professors give us a lot more work to do which goes way over the pre-corona workload for credits. We had one \u201cfree\u201d day (holiday)  where I have 4 classes and the professors said \u201cwell you can also read this book because you have so much time because there\u2019s no class next week\u201d. Correct. But now I have to read three more books and another assignment because of one \u201cfree\u201d day. Besides that the workload is crazy. Why do you assume we have so much more time ?? I\u2019m sitting in front of Zoom classes and then do assignments and then go to bed. Okay whatever it is what it is. But stop saying \u201cyou have more time because of Zoom classes\u201d. Nah. YOU have more time because you leave us alone in breakout groups for half the class.",

      "text": "Classes are still being designed to meet the standards set by Carnegie units, but there a few reasons the workload is larger in practice:\n\n1.) Anti-cheating measures: In order to cut down on cheating, faculty have been encouraged to increase the number of small assignments, larger projects, and more comprehensive, open-book exams. This is largely coming from the administration.\n\n2.) Increased coursework:  Increased coursework, especially small stakes assignments, is a product of student complaints over exams and essays worth 30% or more. Students don't like being evaluated on the basis of a few major items, which makes it difficult to recover from a bad grade. This is mainly coming from student reviews.\n\n3.) The Challenges of Working from Home: Students are generally bad at managing their time/working from home, and what might normally take 90 minutes in person, takes much longer online. \n\nFor example, in a 90 minutes lecture, students are forced to pay attention and learn much more than when they multi-task and \"watch\" lectures at home. This causes them to have to re-watch content and eats up more time. Also, while I normally would give a pop quiz at the end of the lecture that students write and forget, when the same quiz is assigned online it becomes another item to worry about and complete later.",

      "text": "Last semester I had one undergrad lower-division biology class that had so much work that I was spending 90% of my time every week on it. The work for each week was: 2 quizzes, read 2 chapters, post to the discussion board, respond to another student\u2019s discussion post, prelab, lab assignment, postlab, in class discussion worksheet, in class \u201cclicker\u201d questions. It might not sound too bad, but the amount of depth we went into was insane. The lab portion was like another class on its own. I have my bachelor's in biology already, so this was a very interesting class for me, but I've never worked so hard for 1 class in my life. I can't imagine how overwhelming the class was for those who were taking it for the first time. \n\nI really hate how my professors think they can give us assignments and have deadlines whenever they want because they always have access to us. My chem professor would assign work on the weekend and have it due the same day, assign work and not give us a deadline until the day it'a due or changed deadlines when he wanted without telling us. His expectation was that we were at home and on canvas 24/7.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that my lab midterm was on a school holiday",

Something many students do not relaize is how much work it is to transfer in-person materials to an online setting.\n\nStudents, why do you assume professor workloads got smaller? How do you think your work goes online? Through the online fairy? Especially now, when so many students whine and so professors have been flexible with deadlines, but then they continue to whine. Nothing makes you happy because it\u2019s never your fault, it\u2019s someone else's.\n\nAnd as someone pointed put, blame your peers, who were demanding refunds for supposed lacking education (even though it\u2019s a choice to not turn on one\u2019s camera or to participate in a breakout room).",

We don't even have access to books at the moment (can't actually buy them because they're either extremely expensive or unavailable). Literally am not provided with any study material but yes I am whining.\n\nAlso in the worst covid hit country at the moment. Almost the entire country is in lockdown so I can't even access the library for resources.\nProfessors don't have time to grade my first semester papers(the second semester has already started) but yes we have all the time in the world to do multiple assignments that literally fetch us no marks.\n\nThe OP isn't whining about doing assignments but has raised extremely valid issue which literally almost every student is experiencing. Just because classes are online doesn't mean we have more than 24hrs in a day. Professors are literally putting in 0 effort and blaming it on the online mode of studying while the students are expected to do the assignments plus learn the whole course by themselves.",

Some students arrive at college ready to take on college-level work, are motivated, and can manage their schedules. A lot of students cannot and a smaller number of high quality complex assignments just results in them falling off the radar. Administrations want professors to build their classes for the latter kind of student, and that means a lot of handholding in the form of extra assignments. That extra work might not help most of them learn the material, but its main job is to make sure the students get to the end of the semester without disappearing, because if you can get them to the end of the semester they're much more likely to give the university another pile of money for the next semester.\n\nThe problem is not ignorant, negligent, evil professors; it's a system that's increasingly reliant on sky high tuition dollars from large numbers of students.",

We were really stretched thin, and no one to cover the course in any meaningful way.\n\nSo, I said, sure \u2014 gimme a day to get used to all the pain meds and another day to migrate all course materials for online delivery. Lucky me, I have tons of experience with online, so no learning curve on my end.\n\nHowever, while we were working out the details, the dean gets involved.\n\nAnd HE, in his infinite wisdom, remarks that the class, as I had it set up, lacked \u201cinteractive and synchronized learning experiences\u201d (direct quote).  I do my WTF face (on the inside), and ask, on the outside, what he meant by that\u2026because I was and am sure he didn\u2019t know what any of those words meant.\n\nThis was his answer: \u201cIt needs to have more graded forums, and each module needs at least one formative evaluation.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m REALLY going WTF, because what he\u2019s asking is akin to asking me to go faster than the speed of light.\n\nWhy?\n\nThis course, is a 4 week course, divided into six modules (along the major incision points of the periods). What he was asking for is to put in a graded something every other day. In addition to the summative research paper \u2026 I explained all that, and, as predicted and feared, the man didn\u2019t budge. \n\nLucky me, I have tenure and could have said, well then, YOU go teach that fucking course, but instead I make acquiescing sounds, and deliver the course as I had originally planned.\n\nBut you can see how interference from above or ignorance from below can result in completely unworkable course loads for students and not better learning in any way. \n\nSo, before you go lynch the profs on the ground, find out what sort of influencers have the ear of the administration and to what degree those have a degree in instructional tech and system design\u2026",

          "text": "To be fair the students who want more rigor didn\u2019t necessarily ask for more hw. I can kinda sympathize with them since they just want a quality education and some profs were really slackin and taking it easy bc quarantine gave them the opportunity. So ideally we\u2019d have rigor but also a sane amount of work.",

          "text": "Yeah I kept seeing people talking about how online classes would be easier, etc and myself and the others who have taken a lot of online classes (I took 4 years worth) tried to warn everyone but I think because we were fewer, we got overlooked.\n\nThe truth is, online classes have always had tons more work. I took quite a few classes at campus when I lived where there was a university and we had a decent amount of work. Being my first year plus a semester, they were mostly core so sometimes I had a bunch of stuff at once. But when I started having to take all my classes online after I moved, it seemed like my workload almost doubled. Insane amounts of work, which is why I spread them out and took 5 years instead of 4. And I got my degree the year before covid so this isn't new.",

What universities should have done is pressure professors to actually teach their course, because that\u2019s what went out the window in the pandemic. We\u2019re basically out here teaching ourselves, drowning in busy work, which ofc makes it hard to get an A. I mean half my professors just make a bare bones PowerPoint and send it out, and the other half does the same thing just to read it out loud. \n\nI\u2019ve seen high school zoom classes, and those teachers are actually teaching, they\u2019re being engaging, asking and answering lots of questions, so on and so forth - I\u2019ve seen far, far less of that with Professors and it\u2019s draining everyone.",

              "text": "Exactly. If you ever checked over r/professors during the last semester there were so many threads about how to basically get away with doing as little teaching as possible, lot of them used outdated PowerPoints etc. I know quarantine can be hard on them too but we\u2019re paying in person uni prices for what is basically online school so it\u2019s be nice if we could actually get decent quality at least.",
