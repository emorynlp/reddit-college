  "text": "I have to take General Chem 1 for one of my prereqs for a transfer nursing program. I took Honors Chem in my sophomore year of high school and I remembered it to be pretty easy. The prerequisites for General Chem 1 is \u201cPreparation for General Chemistry\u201d or a passing score on a Chemistry Profiency Test. Should I just self study and take the Proficiency Test? I also have to take General Chem 2 and Organic Chem later on so would taking this route be setting my future self up for failure?",

      "text": "I had to do an online preparation course before taking gen chem in college, it reviews/teaches any concepts that you need to be familiar with in the actual course. I think as long as you feel comfortable with the material, either option should be fine. Not a bad idea to check with an advisor at your school also, but if those are both listed options to get into gen chem then I think you would be good either way",
