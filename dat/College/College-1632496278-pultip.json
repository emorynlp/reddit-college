  "title:": "How do I go about finishing the semester with a threatening and rude professor?",
  "text": " \n\nToday during class Professor told the entire class to shut up which is not something out of the ordinary for him to say. Multiple people in the class are having side conversations but as we are going through the notes I noticed that not only did I but other students around me had a few blanks and we were not sure of what to put. I ask my table partners if they have the missing blanks and they said no. Professor tells the class to stop talking but he is looking directly at my table partner and me so I stopped talking. Professor shows visible frustration whenever we ask a question or raise our hand about 97% of the time so in fear of him getting angry at me, I asked my partner instead of raising my hand. I later on then decided to raise my hand because we were moving forward with the PowerPoint and our notes were still blank. When I ask him about the missing notes he gets frustrated as if he is confused with what I'm asking but a student across from me comes to my defense saying \"No she actually is right the notes are a bit confusing can you go back?\" The professor goes back clearly upset and not willing to look at his own textbook to see what we are confused about but states \"fine I guess ill go all the way back to the beginning, back in my day in college you just had to keep up with the notes, this is why I don't like powerpoints they don't teach you anything\" and he continues to jab at the class. At the end of class, I am making my way out of the door and another student across from me is refilling his vape mod but the professor doesn't say anything to him. I am on my out of the door and Professor stops me, points his finger in my face, and says \"stop talking in my class\" I try to ask him why did he stop me as I'm on my way out of class and single me out like this in front of everyone but he did not want to hear what I had to say nor did he even take the time to listen to what I was trying to ask him. I have never seen him stop a student on their way out to tell them to stop talking in his class especially if he was referring to multiple people in the class like he claims he would have to stop each student that was talking but no he singled me out. He misunderstood what I was trying to ask him and instead of letting me explain he starts screaming over me saying \"I wasn't just talking to you I was talking to everyone\". As I'm trying to explain to him that I did not mean during classtime I meant right now at this specific moment he starts screaming at me in front of everyone. I stated that he was being very rude. Professor screams in my face \"Stop talking back to me, keep talking back to me and you'll just make this harder on yourself\". I keep trying to walk out of the classroom with my friend as he is yelling at me and he follows us into the hallway to keep screaming at us. He has never left his classroom before his students before. Only this one time to follow my friend and me out into the hallway to scream at us as we are trying to leave. My friend and I are so scared we were frozen crying at the end of the hallway by the doors to exit and he is just still screaming at us and being very aggressive. He then says \"You wanna keep talking? Keep making it harder on yourself I'll kick you out of my class!\", even though I was so choked up and on the verge of a having panic attack I could not even defend myself against his aggressiveness. The entire event was so humiliating and terrifying we felt too afraid and uncomfortable even going back to class after the break for our lab with him. \n\nI'm not sure a simple apology can fix this. I have too much anxiety to even go to class Monday in fear of him threatening me or screaming and getting aggressive towards me again even if I simply just ask him a question. I'm not sure I would even feel comfortable in his presence at the moment, especially not alone if I am required to have a conversation with him. I don't think it is okay for a professor to be able to be so aggressive towards students especially if it is visible that they feel threatened and are in no position to be able to defend themselves. And as a black woman, noticing that everyone else in the class that was talking was white or white-passing and he only stopped me I cannot help but to wonder if it has to do with the color of my skin.\n\nI WANNA CLARIFY THE MAN CAN TEACH! his class is not outrageously hard bc he gives you all of the information but he very disrespectful and rude and very very condescending! He makes it hard for you to even ask a question if you are confused about something and you are not allowed to take your own notes!!",

      "text": "Professors that can't teach or grade properly have no business being in a classroom. Maybe a professor should be graded on their ability to teach & grade courses, and have their salary adjusted accordingly (or be FIRED/suspended from teaching courses and lose the ability to get a piece of that tuition money) Have the university make it policy that at the end of the grading period, the department chair assesses the professor's ability to: 1) help students achieve the Student Learning Outcomes and 2) assess the students' ability to demonstrate knowledge of tall the SLOs, and only of the SLOs. (as in, a trig course that covers just the Pythagorean identities should assess students knowledge of all the Pythagorean identities. It should NOT assess students' knowledge of non-Pythagorean identities except, perhaps, as extra credit. And the assessments should cover ALL Pythagorean identities.)",

Recording his behavior will definitely be good evidence for your case, so make sure you have plenty of good quality recordings, and plenty of witnesses, both will make presenting your case easier.",

You talking with another student added to it.\n\nWhat he should have done was tell the whole class to quiet down because he couldn't lecture and if he can't lecture then you can't learn \n\nWhat you should have done was raise your hand and asked the question the minute you had the question.\n\nAre his actions \"yelling at you\" and carrying on like he did unprofessional, absolutely.",

Just don't act confrontational.",

He has offered the entire class to go speak with him privately about why his students have been failing for the past decade and nobody does because he is so intimidating and aggressive if you say anything about him or his teaching or correct him he will lash out on you",

He would rather you bleed through your pants during than going to the bathroom and coming back. Once you leave regardless of circumstances you have to stay gone.

              "text": "I'm going through a faculty complaint with my Prof. from the summer semester. You basically need to stay in the class, stick to your guns, record outrageous behavior, and be prepared to file a grade dispute if they try to give you a punative grade. It's a lot of stress, and the faculty can't really provide you with support, because if they agree with what you are saying, it puts them on the hook. They would be admitting guilt of the institution, and they aren't going to do that without a formal inquiry process. \n\nIt SUCKS. But I am SO glad I'm doing it in my class. I had a Prof. spreading Anti-vax nonsense, and when after I confronted them in class they failed my final paper. I just had my grade dispute meeting, which I think went well, and I'm still waiting for my faculty complaint meeting. It's a long process, but schools do have a process in place already for students going through situations like yours. If you want to DM me with any questions please feel free to reach out. I'm an adult student doing this in my forties and it's hard enough for me now. I don't think I would have had the ability to do this as an 18 year old.",
