Some get super pissed when everything that might be assessed isn't written down (usually on a slide) for them to study. Others, like OP, can't stand just \"reading\" from the slides because it is boring. Similarly, showing up to class isn't studying and sadly, most students aren't exactly reading the textbook before they get to class.",

Well, that tells us one option to \"improve\" things is to have the professor lecture without the slides. They're saying the exact same stuff, just reading from the same script, but now without the added value of the slides. We fixed the problem by making it worse.\n\nSo then we say that just reading a script is a waste of time. Well, we can again \"improve\" things by taking the script away and having the professor lecture mostly the same material, but now from memory. Since the prepared version was probably better than just working from memory, we've again solved the problem by making it worse.\n\nEventually what we have to get at is not saying \"this is bad\" but rather asking \"what do you think would be better\"?",

When you're giving a presentation as a student, are you taught to read off the slides verbatim? No.\n\nThe slides are a guide, but you expand on each point in a way the slides can't. You ask questions to prompt students to interact with you. If you're struggling to imagine how this works, I'll provide an example.\n\nSay there's a slide for what variables are in a computer programming language, and the definition is very technical. The slide might say \"Variables are a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name.\" The professor may then expand on this by comparing variables to a type of box that can hold information. \"Imagine you have a box with some piece of valuable information, such as the position of a player in a video game. At various points in the game, you want to know the players position, so you decide to open the box to look at the value inside. The box is labeled 'Player Position.' Whenever you modify the players position, such as when the player presses the forward key to move, you modify the value inside the Player Position box.\"\n\nIn other words, the professor can add additional metaphors, analogies, and help struggling students by explaining further. Professors who do not do this and instead read off the slides verbatim and also are poor at answering student's questions offer zero value to the student. They literally could not be there and nothing would change.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "text": "Depends. During in person classes, I hated when professors would do this. Word for word. But, on the flip side, I had the best experience when they did read off the slides, and then would ask us questions to help us think about the slide. Another good usage of slides is if they only put short bullet points on there, and then lecture on it for a while, so you're forced to make your own notes. It makes me feel like I'm really making myself learn something versus someone who is simply reading to me.\n\nNow, for virtual setting, reading slides is only helpful to me if they are more than just listing off the section headings of the textbook I just read. It's like, did this professor just give us an outline of the chapter? My book already has that. And for those that don't read text books, it's equally as useless.",

Almost every class has had an extensive powerpoint to go with the \"lecture\".\n\nThey also told us we would need cursive in real life so I guess we should have realized they were full of shit.",
