      "text": "it would be if you used it a lot. keep in mind note taking apps (like good notes) are also extra money and an apple pencil is easily another $100 (and i believe that\u2019s for an older generation of the pencil). it also depends on what model you get but you could be looking at almost $1000. \n\ni have one and found that\u2019s it\u2019s useful to carry and much more lighter than lugging my 2013 mac around. there\u2019s more room in your bag for books cause all your notes are on the ipad. i think it\u2019s worth it if you have the money. \n\ni also would consider looking into programs your schools have if you really want an ipad but don\u2019t have the funds for it, like a students in need fund or any academic assistance. some schools have a fund set in place for students who need technology or funds to improve their academic experience. that\u2019s how i got my ipad and apple pencil and how one of my friends got her laptop",

      "text": "I really enjoy using an iPad for classes as it\u2019s like a great all-in-one for typing notes, writing, doing assignments, etc. \n\nIf it\u2019s going to be your main driver, consider your major. I majored in accounting before switching to gender studies, and accounting used software you could not get on an iPad. Don\u2019t have that issue with gender studies.",
