  "text": "I'm currently a sophomore attending a local CC, and I feel like ever since the pandemic, I am really awkward when it comes to talking to people. I feel like all my social skills have completely gone away and I don't know how to properly interact with people. It's kind of at the point where I feel like I have to give a disclaimer to people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope I am not the only one.",

I really feel/felt the same way you describe here, and what I noticed was that when I did get into an interaction with an actual human I would be stuck on thinking about how to actual interact with them without actually doing it. You can\u2019t overthink how to act in social scenarios, a lot of these minor body movement that convey certain meanings as well as things we say come naturally in more social settings. Or at least this is the case for me. I hope this helps if it makes any sense at all.",
