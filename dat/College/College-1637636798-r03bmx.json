  "text": "I'm not pointing fingers here or not taking accountability but I've been frustrated all semester with my government class.\n\nI'm a freshman, I'm doing quite well this semester and I'm making A's in all my classes except my Government class that sits at a lone B- right now and I feel completely frustrated about it. Sure, I may not have learned the material well enough, it was a harder course than I was expecting but even then it just isn't making any sense to me still. \n\nI was going to drop it early on but decided to tough it out and ended up not doing super well on our last exam. The professor is a cool guy, but his class structure sucks imo. His lectures are convoluted and confusing, he tends to ramble at times and I don't know what to take notes on. Study guides don't cover almost anything on the exams and the book is utterly worthless. There's quizzes at the ends of chapters that he claims he would \"borrow from\" on the exam and I studied the hell out of those just to get curveballed on the exam. It feels weird and unfair at times, a lot of kids are failing the crap out of his class and the structure of the class is 5x worse than all my other classes. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this before? Any insight? I'm not pointing the finger at anyone, maybe I just screwed up, but at times I really just haven't found this class that useful and I study well and even when I know the information I'm not actually tested on any of it and instead given arbitrary questions unrelated to the lecture material.",

Correct exams and take them, ask for feedback and help understanding where you\u2019ve gone wrong. The professor is the only one who knows what they\u2019re testing, and what they want you to know.",
