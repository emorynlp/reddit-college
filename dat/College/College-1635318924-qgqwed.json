  "text": "I'm torn between wanting to retake these classes and obtain a degree vs getting a diploma and leaving engineering completely. This year has been physically and especially mentally draining.\n\nI've been on tranquilizers and antidepressants during exam period. \n\nAnd now I'm suffering from short term and long term memory loss, low bp, any shocking event is making me faint, hair loss, loss of appetite. In short it's hell for me.\n\nI have already taken a year more than my peers, taking another year will probably be mentally draining as well and physically.\n\nCan somone help me?",

      "text": "I understand you\u2019re mental struggling, but you are so close to getting your degree. Especially in an extremely difficult major. \n\nI know you said you can\u2019t take another year, but why not slow down the pace at which you take your classes? Enroll part-time and take 1-2 classes instead as you work on improving your mental health as well. It may not seem as demanding if you take on a light course load. \n\nIt may be difficult, and ultimately you need to do what is best for you. But ask yourself this, will you regret your decision when you look back at this moment in the future?",

          "text": "I've thought about it and my course made me absolutely disgusted with people, with myself. I've been knocked down again and again by the lecturers.\n\nI cannot take it part time, my lecturers aren't flexible, they demand you attend every class,lab etc. I'm to be blamed if i didn't know there was a test,had to get an official letter signed before being allowed to take a test. I had 2 test back to back for the same class on purpose just so he could make me fail them.\n\nI've been severely depressed with many things happening this year and taking the classes for another year is a mental burden that i don't know if I'll surpass.\n\nSo i think the best would be to quit before i kill myself",
