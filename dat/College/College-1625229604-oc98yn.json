  "title:": "As an older person attending college, I find the content to be condescending to young people.",
  "text": "I\u2019m 43. I returned to school to get a degree. I\u2019m ending my final semester, and I\u2019m taking all the stupid gen-Ed classes like public speaking, English, stats, etc. \n\nEvery assignment in every class, when it can, is seriously condescending to young people. \n\nIn my stats class, we had to do these dumb \u201cAcademic Habits\u201d assignments once a week, where we watch a video on mental health, social media usage, having a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d etc. The main theme overall is \u201cput your phone down and go outside\u201d. Our signature assignment in stats was interpreting 3 data sets about \u201csocial media usage\u201d\n\nIn English, I have written 2 papers that included some sort of social media propaganda. One was a presentation about \u201cteen mental health\u201d, citing social media as a huge factor. The other was about \u201cusing social media in a constructive way\u201d. \n\nWhat the fuck. College students are adults. Can we stop patronizing them about phones?? \n\nI was so disappointed in the statistics signature assignment. We spent all semester doing complex math and interpreting data. I finally learned how to do this all stuff and I thought maybe I could really apply it to a data set of my choosing, or look at some interesting statistics. But no, more Boomer propaganda shoved down my throat. \n\nI get that social media can be a problem for young people, and I understand that young people are struggling with mental health but can we challenge them with some interested material instead of reminding them constantly? \n\nHas anyone else had this experience or is it just my CC?\n\nEDIT: I understand that the topic of social media usage is important, but do we have to make every assignment about it in every class? Social media usage is an exhausted topic in the media, at home, in high school etc. I have teenagers who I know have been listening to adults drone on and on about social media for most of their life. I want young people to get excited about other topics. It\u2019s just my opinion.",

When I was taking my gen-ed courses at community college mind you the focus was on doing and completing the classwork as assigned and learning the basics of things. I did have to take an algebra course that I took in high school, but that's because I wasn't a math major and only needed one math class (which I got a 94% in, math repitition ftw). \n\nNow that I've been in Uni, my college professors will occasionally ask how we're doing personally, but that's because my major has smaller class sizes. Otherwise discussions are incredibly fruitful. Due to our small class sizes we do jump off-topic sometimes, but otherwise my experience with classes have been great for me.\n\nI do feel bad for current freshman though, as they are coming up in the age of \"growth mindset\" and \"SMART goals\" and a hodgepodge of super vague investors basically telling people how to live life all the way into the education system. Imagine being defined solely by your ability to explain the \"growth mindset\" without having any other life beyond making money and being a genuinely uncreative human being.",

I also went to a CC (where I had a great experience so I am probably biased), and as an undergrad I was older than the majority of students. In my program now I\u2019m the oldest by quite a bit. This is all to point out I feel your pain in many ways. \n\nSomething I\u2019m surprised no one has pointed out that I saw, is that we are on a social media platform right now. You must have seen some toxic behavior on here before. Teaching young people (or anyone for that matter) how to evade that content as much as possible and/or respond with common sense and empathy seems like a worthy goal. Even if this is not explicitly stated, thinking consciously about social media practices will encourage these behaviors. I have hope.\n\nI have also worked extensively with students from underserved communities (including older/re-entry students). A lot of these go to CC, especially before transferring to a 4-year, where they go to learn basic college-ing skills. Many don\u2019t know what a syllabus is or how to read it. Most don\u2019t know how to effectively read academic material or take notes. These are all parts of varying levels of cultural capital that we bring with us. I think those of us who have these skills are lucky and should be aware. \n\nI have always struggled with mental health issues and study mental health in my discipline. I think the more awareness out there that this is an important issue, and access to resources will encourage those who feel alone in their situation, the better. Some people have said \u201cthose who have mental illness or say they do,\u201d knock it off. You don\u2019t know anyone else\u2019s status. \n\nFinally, I have come to feel kinda protective over my students and younger people from my experiences dealing with them. It seems like you do too in a way, but I would suggest trying to get to know more of them better maybe, to see what some individuals feel, and try to avoid assuming for a large portion of your classmates. I\u2019m always pleasantly reminded that they\u2019re amazing individuals with rich inner lives that each have their own opinions for their own reasons. Best of luck in your studies!",

Would they hear about it at all? Providing these guidelines when people are 18-19 is, in my opinion, absolutely essential when considering the addictive mechanisms in place that these companies have put in them and the age that most people get a smartphone (which is roughly at age 13 these days). I'm only 21, but I sure as hell wish I knew what I knew now about phones when I got my first one 5 or so years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In support for your position:** This brute-force way of teaching this topic does seem a little too extreme and far-fetched even to someone like me who really is passionate about this topic. I feel that eventually after so many times hearing about this topic, the students would see it as trite and might not pay as much attention to it anymore. It also seemed a little weird that they had this topic in your statistics class of all classes. Perhaps they should create a separate class centered around digital well-being and mandate everyone to take it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*just for the record, this is the first time I've heard of an type of school/college teaching about this stuff, I attend a large 4-year public school and haven't seen any information in any of my classes related to phones/social media (unless, of course the class focuses on it)",

And as you might imagine, students suffering from anxiety and depression tend to perform a lot worse.\n\nNow also, unrelated to social media, is the problem that Gen Z has been delayed in developing independence and autonomy. So, they arrive at college with life skills closer to a 16 year old of Gen X -- not their fault, that's just how we're raising them. That makes college far more stressful and also leads to a lot more poor decisions being made. So that's not derived from social media, but the problems create a sort of perfect storm.\n\nSo what we end up with is a class of students who are under-prepared for the stresses of college, are prone to anxiety and depression, and just to make matters worse, carrying distractions with them into class.\n\nThe reason you keep seeing social media brought up in your classes... well, imagine instead wondering why your professors keep talking about taking care of your legs, but when you look around a class of 20 students, there's 6 broken tibias, 8 sprained ankles, another 8 students with severe leg cramps, 4 busted knees, and 2 torn ACLs. And the class is on cross country running. Mystery solved.",

It just feels easier now to really stand out academically because no one else seems to care. I realize if I were at say Harvard that might not be the case, but I truly think it\u2019s a generational thing.

      "text": "I see a lot of people caught up on your social media examples. Maybe that was your main point, but I've found that colleges condescend to students in even more ways than that. Hell, I haven't even started my freshman year, but one of my very first experiences interacting with staff at my community college went very poorly. \n\nMy mom and I went together. I'm 21, she's 46. We're both going back to school. We went in to discuss the FAFSA and to figure out what our next steps should be with the only person in the financial aid department that continued to work in-person during the pandemic. (For context, both of our phones were messed up and we live next to the campus, so in-person worked better for us. In hindsight, we probably should've taken our chances with meeting someone else over a phone call.)\n\nDuring our meeting, my mother asked plenty of important, relevant questions about how we receive financial aid money, how it's distributed if she decides to go part-time versus full-time, etc. She's the only one between the two of us that has been to college, but the whole experience has changed since she was in school in the mid to late 90s, so she didn't want to assume anything about how things work these days. She was well within her right to ask questions, but the financial aid lady seemed to expect us to shut up and listen to her monologue while quickly running us through a PowerPoint on a small computer screen that my mom couldn't even see clearly (let alone keep up with at that pace). \n\nThere came a point about halfway through the meeting where the financial aid lady literally looked my mom dead in the eye right as she started to ask a question, and put her finger to her lips to shush my mother like a kindergartener. \n\nDuring the whole interview, my mom was shushed twice and I had to start writing my notes with a pen on the papers in front of me because every time I would write down relevant notes in my phone's memo app, the financial aid lady would glare at me as if I'm being rude. I guess she didn't believe I was taking notes, despite me explicitly telling her what I was doing and showing her my screen. Even after that, she would pause and huff any time I started to write anything down.\n\nI feel like, at least in my area, college staff are prepared to condescend to *anyone* (with the notable exception of wealthy parents). I don't know if it's because they're used to dealing with young, rowdy high school grads, or if it's because they're not used to any level of pushback - either way, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nSince then we have dealt with a similar attitude from the Assistant Dean at that same campus, and have also been treated poorly for calling the school to ask about things that they don't ever bother clarifying. \n\nI'm not even sure how to handle it, honestly. I'd love to bring attention to the issue, but I need them to not make my academic career hell. Maybe there will be a chance to do or say something on my way out.",

They will most likely love their subjects and want to share their love with you.

IT WAS A MATH CLASS!! how tf does what i did in my week have anything to do with learning math ... the requirement was like 3 paragraphs and it was just a huge waste of time ... i dropped that class.. there is some professors that treat us like children ..  i don't take them. i always look on ratemyprofessor.com now before signing up for a class... your college seems to have an agenda tho. It seems like all the professors were instructed to do this. some explanations i can think of is the college president is a total \"boomer\" or they are doing a social experiment on you guys or they want you guys to communicate less with each other and not share resources ... very strange..",

Since I care about their well-being and success, what else can I do but try to teach them a few of these skills when they're needed to succeed in my course? To effectively teach the students I actually have, I must accept that they arrive with these gaps in their knowledge and experiences.\n\nHonestly, you should talk to your professor about these frustrations.

They are legally adults but many have never done the things that adults do because it's not legal to do them as a minor. They may not have experience living on their own. They may not have ever paid rent. In fact, CC students are much more likely to be living at home with their parents still, so while they are 18, they may not have done much of anything yet that requires them to be an adult. Their lives are not terribly different to what they were a year ago, just now they go to CC instead of high school.\n\nI remember being 18 (wasn't *that* long ago). It was a very confusing time: the day before, I was a minor and had all the knowledge of a minor. The next day I was an adult, but still had all the knowledge of a minor. There are a lot of risks and dangers in the adult world (debt, criminal responsibility, signing various contracts for housing and employment) that you don't automatically know about at 18.\n\nYou're a minor (~17) in terms of knowledge and experience and you're thrown into the adult world with adult rules and no leniency if you get stuff wrong. It's not incorrect to realise that 18-19yos straddle an awkward line between childhood and adulthood. There is a lot of learning that happens in those years, and through the 20's.",

It **is not** something that happens in universities.\n\nAlso, you can't even say it's a thing at your community college because you've only taken a small number of gen eds. That doesn't mean it's also the topic of choice across all of the subjects you've never taken. A single low-level statistics course and a single low-level English course is hardly representative of all subjects at all levels.\n\nPlus you have no idea what interests young people. It's fine for you to find it all boring, but don't speak for other generations. Don't tell young people that they find discussion around social media to be infantilising. University is a place to interrogate the real risks and benefits of something we use all day, every day. That's valuable. \n\nPersonally, having grown up with early social media (MySpace and IM), I would find those discussions to be incredibly relevant. **Especially** in a statistics class because there you are dealing with data, not merely opinions. But it's very surprising that you somehow went through an entire statistics course with data about social media usage and you *still* think it's \"Boomer propaganda\".

My youngest child had to be remediated outside of class hours to get his reading up to a level I found acceptable. Every year I\u2019m consistently dismayed when I look at the kids homework. I always feel like they should be farther along? It\u2019s weird.",

Assuming the majority of college students are there to pursue a bachelor's degree AND any student pursuing a graduate degree must have first completed a bachelor's, one would expect that if everyone went straight out of high school the age would be near 20, being halfway through for those who started at 18. This may not be the most dramatic difference, but it shows a lot more college students are much older than one might expect. Older college students have a right to be a part of the community just as much as younger ones, and their opinions should not be disregarded simply because they have a different perspective.",

They employed inefficient strategies that made them vulnerable to forces, whether satirical or malevolent, that threaten informed citizenship. \n\u2022 Over two-thirds never identified the \u201cnews story\u201d as satirical. \n\u2022 Ninety-five percent never located the PR firm behind the supposedly \u201cnonpartisan\u201d website. \nOften students: \n\u2022 Focused exclusively on the website or prompt, rarely consulting the broader web \n\u2022 Trusted how a site presented itself on its About page \n\u2022 Applied out-of-date and in some cases incorrect strategies (such as accepting or rejecting a site because of its top-level domain) \n\u2022 Attributed undue weight to easily manipulated signals of credibility\u2014such as an organization\u2019s non-profit status, its links to authoritative sources, or \u201clook\u201d\u201d.\n\nThis is a huge issue for all age groups, but especially for the largest age group entering college right now.  It\u2019s not condescending so much as it is necessary.",

That is because such students are generally wanting to learn only applied job skills, rather than the full range of knowledge expected of college graduates.  That's not to say one is better than the other, but rather that one who hates gen eds may be wasting a good deal of time.\n\nAs far as the social media goes, clearly much of your coursework involves that subject.  Still, one has to write properly and effectively for English class.  It really doesn't matter if the subject is social media, world events, or whatever.  Its the same in statistics.  Your test involved social media.  Many of my stats tests involved the tensile strength of various strings of yarn.  One has to apply the same statistical concepts for both.",

Parents are much more involved in their children\u2019s lives and children are given much less free time to organize and regulate their own activities. They are given much less freedom to roam their neighborhoods. \n\n2. A larger portion of the population goes to college. It used to be if you wanted to go to college, you were on the academic track in high school, where you took 4 years of mathematics (that would prepare you for calculus), lab sciences, and a foreign language. College freshman were much less likely to need remedial classes. \n\n3. College was relatively speaking, much cheaper, particularly public universities. \n\nI think the stakes are much greater now, but students are less resilient and less able to handle setbacks.",

Browse the front page of YouTube for 15 minutes. Then turn it ALL off. It's no wonder people are mentally ill these days. Look at the crap that's being fed to us. It seriously gets worse every year. I'd argue exponentially worse. Turn off your TV and YouTube for ONE WEEK. Seriously, I dare you! Do it  absolutely no video for ONE week. Then come back and tell me if your life has improved or not. If you watch stupid people, you will turn into a stupid person.",
