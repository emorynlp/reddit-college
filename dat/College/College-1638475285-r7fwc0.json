  "text": "I just received news that my uncle passed away yesterday. My family doesn't have a confirmed date for the funeral yet, but it will be sometime next week. It will be held a few states away so I'll have to travel to attend. He passed away in a similar way to how my father, his brother, passed several years ago so this is really difficult for me to process. It was extremely unexpected and sudden and bringing back memories of my father's death. \n\nI have final exams scheduled next week and final projects due this upcoming weekend. And I also have work scheduled tomorrow and next week. I don't know how to reach out to my professors and my boss at work about my uncle's passing. I definitely want to attend the funeral and to be there for my family. I'm just not really sure how to handle this situation with work and school and would really appreciate any advice for my situation.",
