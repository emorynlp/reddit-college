  "text": "I just received news that my uncle passed away yesterday. My family doesn't have a confirmed date for the funeral yet, but it will be sometime next week. It will be held a few states away so I'll have to travel to attend. He passed away in a similar way to how my father, his brother, passed several years ago so this is really difficult for me to process. It was extremely unexpected and sudden and bringing back memories of my father's death. \n\nI have final exams scheduled next week and final projects due this upcoming weekend. And I also have work scheduled tomorrow and next week. I don't know how to reach out to my professors and my boss at work about my uncle's passing. I definitely want to attend the funeral and to be there for my family. I'm just not really sure how to handle this situation with work and school and would really appreciate any advice for my situation.",

You'll likely need a copy of the obituary at some point, but for now, reach out to your professors and tell them what's going on and see if something can be arranged. You might also consider mental health support services through your university.",

      "text": "I would draft a generic email, which is short and sweet, directly to the point.  Then you can copy and paste it to each of your instructors and be done in a few minutes.  How about something like:\n\nDear Professor XYZ,\n\nI just received news that my uncle has passed away.  I don't yet know the exact date of the funeral, but this will almost certainly cause a conflict with my remaining course commitments.  Please excuse my absence for the short-term future, as I need to be there for my family right now.  I will let you know when I have returned.\n\nSincerely,  \nu/fuchsiazebra\n\nRemember that it's not up to you to handle this situation perfectly, or say exactly the right thing to other people.  This is a difficult time you are going through.  Please remember to look after yourself!\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, and about your father as well.  Nobody should have to go through that so young.",
