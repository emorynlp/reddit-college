  "text": "Really fighting my demons on not performing an academic withdraw. I transferred to a big state school after graduating CC and I hate it here so much. All my friends and family are home. I don\u2019t think I will actually do it because it seems incredibly stupid and extremely expensive considering I get my school paid for by my service and I would have to pay back everything. But damn man I just need a little motivation to grind out this final month.",
