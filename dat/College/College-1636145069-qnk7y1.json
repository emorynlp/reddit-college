  "text": "I've been obsessively diligent in repairing my GPA and making only As and Bs. Pulling all-nighters and testing my will to keep going. So far it's working. I've also been busting my ass in getting accepted to a Rome study abroad program (it worked). But I feel so exhausted  that I'm not even excited. How do I enjoy life again with no completely free days?",

      "text": "There\u2019s gonna be some exhaustion from working so hard. I can say that if you have any free time don\u2019t spend it on social media. Exercise helps, meditation helps, relaxing for an hour or two everyday helps stress and energy levels, maintaining a good diet works wonders or at least take multivitamins, B vitamin supplements, iron supplements. Too much coffee makes it worse in the long run, I try to limit myself to one cup a day if I really have to, but only 2-3 cups a week if I can do that. I use to drink 2-3 cups per day and got really burnt out and depressed. Joe any of this helps!!",
