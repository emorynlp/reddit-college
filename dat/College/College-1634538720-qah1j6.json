  "title:": "Math Major struggling to keep up with the demands of online classes \u2026 time to switch majors?",
  "text": "Im a second year statistics major at Community college, while also working full time (37.5 hrs/week) at my local high school. I was previously a Nursing major completing prereqs and I was able to get by in Chem/Anatomy/etc. by slacking off a bit .. but after switching to Statistics, I find it hard to make time for learning Math (specifically Calculus) while also on a full time work schedule. I enjoy math and statistics, but taking the time to apply my learning to the homework can be tedious among my other classes. I recently got a 76 on my midterm which I\u2019m not proud of. Is it time to give up as a Math major if I can\u2019t even keep up with the demands? Or should I sacrifice my current employment opportunity for school instead? Looking for some guidance, thanks!",

Some courses tress too much yet you'll never need them in future.\nHave tried joining group discussions with classmates \nOr have tried private tutoring ?",

      "text": "Calculus can be one of the hardest classes in the major. I wouldn\u2019t give up. Calc 2 is likely the hardest. Maybe you can ask a high school math teacher if they can help you or if they have good study resources and maybe they have a better opinion on whether the math track is a good fit for you. \n\nTalk to your boss about it before making the decision as well. Explain that you\u2019re taking really hard classes and if it\u2019s possible to cut your hours back or if there is a better position that would fit your needs.",

      "text": "A 76 isn't actually that bad in calc 1 although it will probably seem low if you're used to A grades. It's unlikely that you have major gaps in prerequisite material and likely that some small changes in the way you work on things can have big payoffs. \n\nAlso, calc 1 exam 1 is notoriously difficult for people who are used to more computational classes where you are given problems like \"solve this equation\" or \"simplify this expression\"; you're not alone. \n\nOne of the things that makes learning math really hard is that in some areas (calculus especially) it's easy to get the \"right answer\" by learning to pattern-match. And the problem with that is that if the question is asked in a slightly different way, you don't get it. \n\nAnother thing is that the questions are just L O N G. There are a lot of steps and an error in step 2 throws everything after it off. \n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1) Get in the habit of writing out work to more problems, and writing it out clearly. I watch people work on homework problems, and it's just numbers written here and there around the page. Don't do this; even if the homework is online, do it in a notebook and number the questions 1, 2, 3, etc. If you have multiple attempts turned on and you need to do a problem more than once, write down all attempts instead of just the last one or just erasing. These are for your own benefit; when you go back through to study for the tests, you can see \"Oh I had to try that question 4 times, I better review it\". Also you're a lot more likely to remember the steps for multistep problems if you're writing them out instead of just entering the answers into the computer. \n\n2) If you have things you just need to memorize (like derivative rules) put them on a flashcard; either a physical one or an app on your phone. A few times a day, briefly run through them. It'll take up-front time but it'll speed you up later on homework. \n\n3) If possible, see if you can get someone in a class to form a study group on something like Discord.",
