  "text": "I\u2019m in an audit class where 30% of the grade was a group project. Ever since quarantine started I\u2019ve been trying to get my group mates to work on this project but my messages have been met with silence. Even before, one of them contributed nothing at all. So I desperately need my professor to assign an alternative solo project. One of my friends is in the exact same boat, MIA and unresponsive group mates. He said he\u2019s been emailing the professor for 5 weeks now and to let him know if she ever replies to me. \n\nI first emailed her April 15, explaining my situation. But of course, I did not receive a reply.  I went on blackboard and left a message for her in the discussion board where i saw another student telling her to check her emails. Then i checked my syllabus and realized she had another email. So I emailed her at that address on April 23. On that same day I decided to also email the chair of the department who\u2019s also a professor of mine this semester. The next day the chair replies and says he was just in a meeting with her and that he knows she\u2019s okay so he\u2019s going to forward my email to her. Still no reply. \n\nShe even uploaded an \u201cattendance\u201d to blackboard and I filled it out telling her to contact me back. She sent out an announcement saying she\u2019s been taking online classes to learn how to teach online for the past 2 weeks and that she\u2019s going to hopefully get back to what we\u2019ve been emailing her about soon. There\u2019s 3 weeks left of the semester. I really don\u2019t know why she felt like she needed to learn how to teach. We don\u2019t have any live lessons with her because she \u201chates the way she sounds on camera\u201d so she uploads random notes every 2-3 weeks and we\u2019re supposed to learn that way. \n\nI\u2019ve been so stressed and anxious because this is my last semester and I\u2019m about to fail a class because my professor won\u2019t reply to her emails and assign an alternative solo project. Last night I drafted another email wherein i included my first 2 emails with time stamp and I sent it to both of her addresses and copied the chair of the department and the dean of the business school. The chair replied saying \u201cI\u2019m rying to get in contact with her...\u201d \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do anymore and what can be done if i do fail this course. I\u2019m at my wits end and is starting to wonder if I should call a lawyer in case of the worst possible scenario...\n\nPlease let me know if you guys have experienced anything similar and what I should do. Thank you :(\n\nEDIT: so copying the dean of the business school really did wonders for me. She replied to my email just now saying she\u2019s sorry she \u201cdid not reply sooner\u201d and that she\u2019s going to allow me to do a short paper on an auditing topic of my choice in replacement of the project.",

This is probably going to end up fine!\n\nYou have done what you can vis-a-vis reaching out to her for now. Just continue to follow up with additional emails periodically. You need to carefully label and save every communication, meaning give your emails clear, specific subject lines. Create an email folder and put the emails there (sent and received). \n\nThe important thing is that you be proactive on this project. You need to do the work that you can, without your group (and within reason). I'm not saying do everything, just do SOMETHING so you can show you tried. And you need to document the process, so you have evidence that YOU did the work. If there's writing involved, do it on Google Docs so the revisions are saved, or periodically send drafts to your group mates and say \"Here's what I did, can you please contribute X, Y and Z?\" And save that email. \n\nAssuming things continue as they are, you will turn in a very incomplete project at the end. You will include a note that you did all of the work because your group mates were unresponsive, and that you can provide evidence. You will also note that you emailed her about this multiple times.\n\nIn the end, she will very likely give you a good grade because she doesn't want to deal with this either. And IF she doesn't, you contest the grade.",
