  "title:": "I'm a film student, worked on group project, half my group members bailed and my final film is horrible and unwatchable. Advice?",
  "text": "Hiiii there. I'm a film student. My professor had our class team up in pairs of 4 to make our final films and act as one another's production crew for our minute long films. 2 of my members are best friends and bailed on the project (day of) while me, my actress, and the other group member were already on set. I had to film without them, but was incredibly difficult because I required extra hands for it to be successful.  \nBasically, my film was ruined because of this. I had to act at director for the actress, DOP, sound help with my other group member. As I'm editing now, I'm realizing I left out scenes/sound because I was busy doing one job and not focusing on other elements as much, as well as panicking because I felt overwhelmed. It's my first film ever, and was ruined because of bad group members.  \nThe professor knows but wants me to turn in what I have, which is basically nothing. I don't feel like turning it in, because the professor is planning on screening all of our films at a local theater and on their website. I don't think this film should be screened, it's horrible and doesn't reflect my capabilities.  \nWhat should I do? We're supposed to turn in tomorrow for rough edit critique but I have nothing worthy of turning in. I already know it's bad, and incomplete.  \nWhat should I do?",

The film was about a sleep disorder, so the first half is a girl tossing and turning in her sleep. Second half was going to be a bit trickier but with the extra hands and help, it wouldn't been able to be pulled off. Unfortunately I only have a first half of the film done, no sound. Looks bad.",
