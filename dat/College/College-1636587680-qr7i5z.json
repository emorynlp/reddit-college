  "text": "So I am applying to good colleges such as Villanova and Lehigh which have low acceptance rates. However if I do get in I am worried that the classes may be to difficult since it\u2019s so hard to get into. My school doesn\u2019t really have terribly tough classes however I have taken 5 ApS Euro, Calc Ab, Bc, human and Gov. but the teachers at my school are every forgiving so I am worried I will fail out of college since the classes will be difficult. Thoughts on this?",
