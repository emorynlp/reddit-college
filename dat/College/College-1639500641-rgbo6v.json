      "text": "It happens. Operation Varsity Blues famously involved a number of rich people bribing coaches or admission reps to say they're children had higher standardized test scores then they did or were sport recruits for sports they didn't play (and then getting caught and arrested). It presumably happens somewhat more often accounting for cases where it doesn't get caught.\n\nAdmission decisions are often reviewed by multiple people and a student will take many classes during college. The risk of trying to bribe people is as soon as you hit somebody who you can't buy (or even can't buy with the money you're offering) you can end up in a lot of trouble, certainly denied admission and possibly finding yourself at risk of criminal charges depending on how successfully and seriously you've crossed the line.",

          "text": "\"It presumably happens somewhat more often accounting for cases where it doesn't get caught.\"\n\nThe people in the Varsity Blues operation were terrible at it IMO. It was like they learned from bad crime movies or something. What you would expect from celebrities with no practical skills. Their way of going about it created more exposure than they would have had if they were smarter about planning it. Lots of written emails detailing their plans and commiting more fraud than was necessary for admissions. Just very loud.\n\nCriminally this is fraud-centric. It isn't so much the bribery (\"bribing\" a private college is different legally speaking than bribing a police officer or government worker), it's defrauding the university by misrepresenting the applicant.",

Many colleges, the admit-everyone private non-profit as well as the private for-profit, do not weed out so many, if any. But for everyone else, there is immense prestige that could be lost. Not to mention the career of a single academic. University rankings exist and play a huge role in where students go (although not all universities are ranked, some really good ones are not ranked, e.g. St. Johns College in Annapolis, and ranking certain universities is notoriously difficult). Where you went to university has a major impact on what jobs you can get and where. Harvard will look better on a CV than University of Virginia which will look better than Eureka College. So, people often go for a more prestigious school. Therefore, if universities want to keep getting quality applicants, they need to maintain prestige. Everything they do, even the ridiculous non-academic things, are calculated for prestige. Bribes would ruin prestige.",

However, SAT/ACT are statistically not much better at guessing a student's knowledge or forecasting if they will do well in university than high school GPA, and there is some disturbing data that poor students score far lower on the SAT/ACT that rich students. This bias towards the wealthy can be countered by weighing GPAs versus each high school's average, but the SAT/ACT cannot account for that. Also, the SAT/ACT is much more of a memorization-test than a thinking-test and the grading of the essays is notoriously opaque. Hence, many, even many top-tier schools, have removed the requirement for the SAT/ACT.\n\nFor GPA, schools do not determine GPA as it is reviewed by the school board which in turn is reviewed by the state. However, as not all high schools have the same funding, averages at different schools vary wildly. Rich high schools, with money excellent teachers and outstanding support often have a higher average GPA than a poor high school. A 3.5 at a rich high school isn't great while at a poor one a 3.5 might be the highest grade there. Hence, most universities weigh the GPAs relative to average class GPA of that particular high school.\n\nPersonal Statements could be ghost-written, just as SAT/ACT tests could be taken by someone other than the intended student and LoR could be faked, but it is rare. Normally, universities could take a guess if your other writing fails to meet the level of your personal statement, and if it is discovered after you apply, nearly every university would kick you out instantly. Also, plagiarism checkers exist.\n\nLoR are open for corruption, but they always come from teachers (who must declare whether they have a conflict of interest or not) and it does allow a university to get a good idea of a student if done correctly. Does the student struggle with tests but excels in papers? Are they a leader? Are they an independent studier? Are they involved in class or just do the work? Astound in music but weak in math? That sort of info can only come from a LoR. That being said, LoR tend not to be weighed too heavily for undergrad admissions as universities know the limitations of them. Postgrad application LoR are a completely seperate but major issue too.\n\nExtracurriculars are tricky, and many will agree with you that they should be ignored. Generally, what counts as an extracurricular depends what university you are applying for and your major. A Pre-Medical major might have volunteer work at a nursing home. An Education major might have volunteering at a day care or pre-school. Some universities also take into account sports, but not all (although more and more universities are, thankfully, placing less emphasis on sports). Other extracurriculars could be leader of a high school Chess club, or other such clubs. Many elite universities look for extracurriculars which connote leadership qualities and involvement in society outside of school. However, how various universities look and evaluate all the different types of extracurriculars is famously non-transparent.\n\nIt is totally possible to lie and fake your way into a university and it does happen. But corruption often comes down to the standard cultural perceptions of corruption. In the USA, there is a perception of little corruption so the vast majority accept that as standard and never contemplate corruption. Also, cheating your way through university is far harder than cheating your way into university. Given the crazy-high costs of US high education, failing an admissions is far cheaper than having to pay tens of thousands a year to fail anyways.",

You can reform the system to be better at evaluating knowledge. One step would be to segregate the exam into smaller exams for various subjects, like British A-levels or Russian Unified State Exam. That way you would be able to assess the proficiency in various subjects separately.\n\nRegardless, high school GPA IS a numeric value and it can be factored in if you really want it. I personally don't like trusting random institutions of unclear trustworthiness to rate students.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>there is some disturbing data that poor students score far lower on the SAT/ACT that rich students.\n\nI see nothing disturbing about it. It is only logical that people with more money to spent on tutors would have an advantage. The issue of poor students doing worse on tests due to the fact that their economic situation is a serious issue, but allowing them to bypass the test just because they are poor is not the solution. If you want to improve the opportunities for the poor you should improve their education opportunities BEFORE they take the test and apply to university. For university application, only the person's academic achievements should matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>just as SAT/ACT tests could be taken by someone other than the intended student\n\nYou have REALLY lax security then... Even I would have totally gamed such a system then... Here where I live when students take the Unified State Exam the building is guarded by police with metal detectors who search everyone for gadgets. Obviously, your passport would be checked. Security cameras are everywhere and they are being watched from other parts of the country by random people. At any moment any one of them can phone the school and inform them about a transgression. There would be at least 2 people in the exam room at any time. Any time someone asks to go to the toilet, he or she would be escorted all the way and back. There was even talk about getting the military involved to block smartphone signals around schools during exam days, but that would stop the signal from working in the whole neighbourhood so the idea was abandoned. The system is designed to be uncheatable.",

I'm also unsure exactly how British A-levels work, but hopefully they actually test thinking skills as opposed to the SAT/ACT's effectively-memorization test.\n\n>If you want to improve the opportunities for the poor you should improve their education opportunities BEFORE they take the test and apply to university.\n\nAgain, lovely idea, and if the US would centralize schools instead of dividing them into small school districts each dependent on their population for their tax revenue (thereby removing the unequal funding issues which all schools from elementary to high school face) that would solve this issue. Alas, this is politically impossible.\n\n>For university application, only the person's academic achievements should matter.\n\nI completely agree! Sadly, a shocking large of portion the US thinks of college mainly as a path to a career, ignoring the learning-for-learning's-sake aspect, and the majority of universities have embraced this ideal, leading them to treat higher education merely as a path to money, as opposed to learning.\n\n>Here where I live when students take the Unified State Exam \\[...\\]\n\nThe US has many of the same things. Metal detectors aren't used, but you can't bring anything into the test except calculators for a portion of the math section. Most people in the US don't have passports, so they use one's student ID number and password to determine who you are. Not as safe as a passport, but not terrible. Security camera are used (and there are multiple supervisors watching). I'm not sure if you can go to the bathroom or not (I didn't take the SAT or ACT).\n\nAll in all, corruption is theoretically possible. However, the amount of corruption often depends on the public's perception of corruption. As the Corruption Perception Index demonstrates, the US is the 25th least-corrupt country. Not a great number, but better than most countries in the world. It just isn't a place where bribery and other forms of corruption are seriously contemplated by the vast majority of people.",

That is what they should be in the modern society.
