      "text": "It happens. Operation Varsity Blues famously involved a number of rich people bribing coaches or admission reps to say they're children had higher standardized test scores then they did or were sport recruits for sports they didn't play (and then getting caught and arrested). It presumably happens somewhat more often accounting for cases where it doesn't get caught.\n\nAdmission decisions are often reviewed by multiple people and a student will take many classes during college. The risk of trying to bribe people is as soon as you hit somebody who you can't buy (or even can't buy with the money you're offering) you can end up in a lot of trouble, certainly denied admission and possibly finding yourself at risk of criminal charges depending on how successfully and seriously you've crossed the line.",

          "text": "\"It presumably happens somewhat more often accounting for cases where it doesn't get caught.\"\n\nThe people in the Varsity Blues operation were terrible at it IMO. It was like they learned from bad crime movies or something. What you would expect from celebrities with no practical skills. Their way of going about it created more exposure than they would have had if they were smarter about planning it. Lots of written emails detailing their plans and commiting more fraud than was necessary for admissions. Just very loud.\n\nCriminally this is fraud-centric. It isn't so much the bribery (\"bribing\" a private college is different legally speaking than bribing a police officer or government worker), it's defrauding the university by misrepresenting the applicant.",

By the time the cohort graduates usually only the more competent students are left, so the degree is still worth something, even though it's from a lower-tier school.\n\nThere are other degrees (mostly in the humanities or the like) where this \"weed-out\" process never really occurs, and those degrees tend not to have much value in the job market.",
