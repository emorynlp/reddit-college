  "text": "I missed my lab by complete accident and the makeup for when I was sick with COVID as well. \n\nI was supposed to make up my lab from last week yesterday but for some reason I got mixed up on my schedule and thought the lab was at 10am and not 9am. I got ready for lab and everything only for a double check to see I had already missed it. I feel stupid, but juggling 8 classes after being sick has been quite difficult. \n\nI\u2019ve missed the first two labs, and now that I missed the second the makeup policy states you can only make up a lab the week after. So I don\u2019t get to make up my lab when I was sick and I don\u2019t have a doctors note for the second one. \n\nShould I email my professor anyways? He seems like a nice guy. But I feel dumb. I made a 100 on our first exam it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t care about the class. \n\nAnyways, if there\u2019s 8 labs and they account for 10% all together, how much does each lab count for? Can I still make an A?",
