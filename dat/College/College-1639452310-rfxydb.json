  "title:": "Is 1st year engineering supposed to be overwhelming?",
  "text": "I am a engineering student specifically electrical and honestly it isn't super difficult but overwhelmingly taxing.\n\nThe assignments are like two weeks worth of homework jammed into a week.\n\nI literally am studying nonstop. Classes start 8am and end 5pm and I study for like 7-8 hours and repeat the process 5 days a week. Sleep nonexistent\n\nIs engineering designed to be this way or is it just my college?\n\nMy courses\n\n1. DC Circuits - Theory: KVL, KCL, Thevnin, Norton, etc, and practical use of a breadboard, power supply, ammeter/voltmeter.\n2. Calc 1 - As the name says but its geared specifically for EE\n3. Technical Communications - Communicating in a workplace\n4. Programming - Learning C programming\n5. Testout IT essentials - Learning how a computer works and how to repair them\n6. Computer Drafting - Solid Edge, Multisim, Visio\n7. Physics 1 - What you would expect, but mostly about electrical physics\n8. WRKS (Basically learning how to solder capacitors, diodes, resistors onto a PCB)\n\nI don't blame anyone if they decide to dropout or spread out the workload, this is madness, the fact that I did this all in one term amazes me sometimes.\n\nI will be catching up on sleep during the Dec 17 - Jan 4 break. I feel so bad for anyone whos working I probably would have died. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am very thankful for a scholarship that is paying for all of this but damn, I wish my high school was more informative about the load. No joke: I was going to take accounting. ",
