  "title:": "A little over a week until I get my undergraduate degree in physics. I have no idea what I'm going to do next career path wise. Any help from those who have been through this song and dance before helps!",
  "text": "As the title says, I'm just about to graduate with a degree in physics at a small state school. I have great grades (3.95 GPA, honors student) and a very good reputation with all of the professors in the physics department plus some research experience under my belt.\n\nThe problem is, I have no idea where to go from here. What my experience in academia had told me is that I'm a great student, I can learn well, and I have a knack for writing/communicating with respect to my peers (I'm not sure the bar is so high for physics majors in this respect).\n\nHowever, I have no idea (and high anxiety about) how well the skills I learned in college will translate to the work environment. \n\nI'm willing to take a wide range of advice from general post graduate advice, to specific advice from people who were in my exact same position. I would also be willing to answer any further questions.\n\nTldr; about to graduate college, can use some wisdom",
