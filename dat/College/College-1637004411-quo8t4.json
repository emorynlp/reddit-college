  "title:": "Should I drop out of college and redirect my own life because I can't guarantee paying for tuition?",
  "text": "Paying for college while broke in unusual circumstances is pushing me to drop out.\n\nI am a college student attending a public film school. I like being here. Unfortunately I--a 2020 high school graduate--was retarted enough to jump right into university ASAP. During a pandemic. Where I felt like shit and have continued to feel like shit for three semesters straight. I love being creative, doing creative work. It brings me purpose for this world. I, however, hate feeling like shit when all I have done with my day is work and drive, work and drive, with no window of opportunity to enjoy the day, my friends, or my life outside of my own house because I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUCKING MONEY.\n\nHere's the fried thing, right? My tuition isn't expensive by normal college standards. It's like $5.5K a semester. I have a merit scholarship that cuts it to $2.7K a semester. Here's the problem though: My step-father, who's a well-paid doctor, is refusing to pay for my education simply because in his own words \"I am not your father\". Mind you he pays for many other expenses like matinence in the wonderful house we live in and car repairs. He's easily making six figure income and jacks my EFC up for FAFSA. Oh well that fucking sucks, at least my mother might help right? No, it's not a given. Half of her time is spent being grandma and grandpa's legal guardian because they had a big mental health can of worms spill out and it's still being cleaned up. She's only able to work temp since the temple she worked at cut her off during the pandemic. Now she and I would have to scrape our savings to pay $2.7K. $2.7K!!! That's fucking ridiculous we have to pay scraps while she can only work temp and I'm dealing with full time college. I have about $1.3K and she prolly has a little over that. I don't know, she's not transparent on her end of this financial deal \ud83d\ude21.\n\nSo I'm thinking of dropping out, or taking a gap  year. Or two. Or many, because I just DON'T HAVE MONEY. Or *ENOUGH* MONEY. Trust me, I would love to hone my craft at my school until completion and earn my BFA. But honestly? I can't work and study at the same time, because even with one (1) (ONE!) editing comission I am taking MONTHS to complete. That and if I'm struggling with one comission I can't do school on top. School is a 37-45 hr week job. Adding a job on top will make me insane. I have friends that work in college or multiple jobs. They claim to be okay. They're bullshitting because their mental health is doodoo and I'm already medicated for current problems AS-IS by being a full time college student. Second, I don't have friends in college. Many friends rather, because three semesters during a pandemic and being poor in a rich man's house doesn't provide much opportunity for campus engagement :))))))) so that's been down the drain and I've felt like poop. \n\nSo now I'm thinking about going back to square one. Get done with this semester, not make any college plans for the spring, and straight up see a career counselor, because if I go down this path of scraping for dollars for college with my mother, it'll end up terrible for both of us, our relationship will go to shit, and I will be left only with tools and a piece of paper in a grown-up world where I still have the emotional and directional discipline of a teenager. I won't be able to survive on my own after graduation. I'm constantly insecure that my direction in life isn't 100% my own and I fucking hate myself for that.\n\nSo what'll it be, should I press on with my studies unsure of how to pay? Or should I drop out now and stack some paper before I make any further decision? Or could I just scrape whatever I have and spend on alternative education solutions? I don't wanna call warm and hotlines over this shit anymore.",

      "text": "I think the fact that you're going to film school changes things here. It's been said time and time again that you by no means need a degree to get a job on a film/TV set, and that's because it's true. Going to film school is nice in that it'll get you connections and it's fun (in theory at least). But there's or course no guarantee that the degree will amount to anything as experience is always more impressive than a degree\n\nThink of the fact that a 4 year tuition comes out to just about $22K, and you're absolutely not guaranteed to even land a job after it's all said and done. combine this with the fact that you've said you can't work because school is giving you such a heavy workload, and now you'll end with a degree that may not immediately get you some cash money and you haven't been working to save up anything. It sounds like you're sort of setting yourself up for disaster.\n\nHowever, I genuinely don't think that stopping now is the right answer. I know that you said you can't have a job because of the workload, but working even 2-3 days a week will be enough here, and I'm only saying this because I've seen it happen before. My co-worker at Target only worked Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (sometimes just two days a week) and that was it. He had enough to pay his tuition, and it was deadbeat easy work that didn't distract him from school. \n\nIf you do the math of working only 2 days a week you'll find that just a 4 month period at Target (or any company that pays $15) working 6 hour shifts, you'll earn $2700 without taxes. If you just work in the Summer you can work an extra day and easily have more than enough.\n\nTo me, the answer here is simple. Yes, working sucks, but it'll only be for 2 days a week and it'll be enough to pursue what you wanna pursue. I've got a great respect for anyone that goes to film school. My cousin did it only to drop out for similar reasons to yours, except her tuition was $20,000 per year. And I'd have done it If there was more of a guarantee of getting a job after you're done, but it doesn't work like that. The situation you're in, while I obviously can't speak on it, sounds manageable. You're gonna have to get a job and work a little bit if you wanna get it done\n\nBest of luck to you",

              "text": "Glad to help, but I do wanna point out some things. It's easiest to get hired at Target when they're hiring for season, and you may have already missed that deadline. But since you really only take up 2-3 days you might be exactly what they need. Target was typically good to me in terms of hours, but you can be sure you'll never get scheduled for a day you mark as unavailable.\n\nGiven that there is a \"labor shortage\" it should be somewhat easier to slide into a role of doing whatever there for 2-3 days, but if target doesn't work just try any other popular retail place cause they almost certainly pay $15, especially if you're in a big city.\n\nAlso, I don't wanna mislead you with calling the work \"low effort\" necessarily solely because you might accidentally walk into a store with some hardass management. Just being a grocery stocker or cashier is by far the easiest route you can take, but it is mind-numbing for sure. The good thing tho is that even if you do get some really bad management, target is notorious for making it near impossible to fire an employee solely based on work performance, you'd have to fight a customer or boss to get fired. You definitely should put Target as the first on your list tho, just hope that the management isn't too bad at your store",
