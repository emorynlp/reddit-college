  "text": "I was filling out my FAFSA and got to the parent section, where you put in your parent(s) demographics and information. I initially thought since I live by myself I could just skip that part... I was wrong. Long story short I need my dads financial information but he refuses to give it to me. We aren't on speaking terms (hence me living by myself) and I obviously can't just guess and get it wrong on such an important document. I asked my mom to do it (They are divorced) but she said he claimed me on her taxes so the school would need my dads and not my moms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes the FAFSA need the information of the parent that claimed me or just any parent? And if they need the parent that claimed me specifically, what are my options here?",
