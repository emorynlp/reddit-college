  "text": "To the teacher, people around me, etc?\n\nThe last time I was in person someone sat next to me, and when i said hi they got up and left to a new seat. I usually zone out in class or don\u2019t feel drawn to the material ( think math class) so I can\u2019t strike up a conversation about something I don\u2019t really understand. I\u2019ll see people around me talking to their seat partners but my mind draws a blank. I need some ideas how to not let this happen again lol. \n\nPeople also talk in group activities and I tend to draw to the back of the group nodding and smiling, maybe saying one thing at the end. I\u2019m not introverted, but being in a class setting makes me detached and uninterested even if it\u2019s my favorite subject. I could know exactly what\u2019s going on in the project, and\nmaybe even have better ideas to give out but end up staying silent. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re getting in trouble for interrupting someone, and they say \u201c well go ahead then\u201d and all of the sudden you don\u2019t want to talk. \n\nCan anyone relate and help me fix it?",
