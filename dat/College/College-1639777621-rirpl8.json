  "text": "Personally I have one goal, and that is to enjoy myself as possible\n\nI feel like I didn't genuinely have fun this entire semester. I never spent so much as an hour on one of my hobbies, I didn't set aside time to FaceTime my boyfriend for anything other than studying or sleeping together. I was stressed every single day about classes, and to be honest I don't feel, like my grades even reflect that. They're good but do they make up for the countless hours I spent studying or crying over them? Nope\n\nSo this winter break I'm gonna be baking, knitting, spending time with loved ones, being spontaneous! And when spring comes around I want to continue focusing more on my hobbies and setting aside time to enjoy myself at least a couple times a week.\n\nFor those of you who have goals/plans for the break, what are they?",
