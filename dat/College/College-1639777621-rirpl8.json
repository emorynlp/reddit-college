  "text": "Personally I have one goal, and that is to enjoy myself as possible\n\nI feel like I didn't genuinely have fun this entire semester. I never spent so much as an hour on one of my hobbies, I didn't set aside time to FaceTime my boyfriend for anything other than studying or sleeping together. I was stressed every single day about classes, and to be honest I don't feel, like my grades even reflect that. They're good but do they make up for the countless hours I spent studying or crying over them? Nope\n\nSo this winter break I'm gonna be baking, knitting, spending time with loved ones, being spontaneous! And when spring comes around I want to continue focusing more on my hobbies and setting aside time to enjoy myself at least a couple times a week.\n\nFor those of you who have goals/plans for the break, what are they?",

I had a flat 60 on the first essay that was given out so I was stressed out of my mind whether or not I did well on my second essay. I turned in my essay on the due date of November. She barely graded it on the 13th of December. I passed, but Jesus fuck was I stressed out if my mind if I was gonna pass let alone be able to keep my scholarship.\n\nMy personal winter goals is to have fun and take care of myself in the mean time, I\u2019ve been binging the MCU since I missed out a lot of the movies growing up. Spend some time with my friends because we kept wanting to hang out, but school and work kept eating away at my time. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking up knitting! Knitting is so scary to me, loool",
