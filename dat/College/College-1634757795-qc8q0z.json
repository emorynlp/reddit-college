  "text": "Hi! I'm a freshman and I've really been struggling to find people I genuinely clique with.\n\nIn high school I had a SUPER close group of friends so maybe I'm just really used to having people always around, but here I am constantly lonely and its really effecting me emotionally. I know growing close bonds takes time but I haven't even meet anyone I see doing that with...\n\nAnyways I guess I'm just wondering how long it took some of you to find you're people and how you did it?",
