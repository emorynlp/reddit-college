      "text": "You don't qualify but you met all the requirements? Doesn't seem right.\n\nNot really a broke system. The application fees for those two aren't a lot and you can afford it with that income. It would be nice if you could persuade them to waive it, but they probably aren't going to categorize you as someone who would be burdened by the $50-75 cost. \n\nYou'll probably get some federal/state aid for college because that cost is something you would be burdened by at that income. My parent's reported income was slightly more and I got decent state-level aid.",

              "text": "It's not really about luck. The qualifications for need-based aid are formula based. You just need to be aware of what aid is out there and try to have less savings when you apply (pay for all your repairs, car downpayment, vacation, etc. before applying). Do the FAFSA but also look for major-specific aid, state aid, local aid, and aid for any special demographic you are in.\n\nCollege is a big decision. I would not apply somewhere if you are not willing to pay $50 for the application. You will probably get aid down the road but you have to be willing to put some of your own money in.",
