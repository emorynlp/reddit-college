  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a high school senior and haven't gotten in anywhere yet, but my ED school has a no freshman car policy. Is there anyway to get around this (I have no medical condition/family need). Also the area doesn't really have available overnight parking. Do you think I could just pay an upperclassman to register the car as their own and get an on-campus spot? Thanks.",
