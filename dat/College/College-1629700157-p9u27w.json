Here\u2019s to a great semester: love yourself and love one another and we\u2019ll all make it through together!",

We see how hard you work and the extra time you put in for not enough pay. We see how hard virtual teaching is when nobody turns on their cameras. We see the late nights of marking and know that early morning classes are just as hard on you as the are on us. We see how hard covid has hit you, just as it has hit us too. \n\nWe\u2019re all in the same boat, just trying to get by. If we build each other up and support one another, we all succeed, profs and students alike. \n\nBe kind to yourselves. We\u2019ll see you in September.",
