  "text": "im a freshman but college so far has been so stressful for me, especially calculus. originally i was taking calculus c but then i dropped to calculus 2 cuz i wasnt doing well in the class. i was doing ok in calculus 2 until i received my last quiz grade: a 60%. I spent HOURS studying and felt so confident while taking this exam i genuinely dont know what happened. quizzes dont count for that much but because i missed the first half of the semester i dont have any other quiz grades to balance it out. i have to make up the midterm that i missed and thats causing me even more stress because the midterm will also account for all of my other missing hw and quiz grades but i dont have any notes from the beginning of the semester and when i emailed the professor what i need to review he didn't respond to me. \n\nif i fail calc 2 i will be screwed. ive been trying to switch my major from psych to comp sci and the comp sci program is super competitive and i need a good math average. if i dont get into comp sci all my future plans will be screwed. my whole family is pressuring me to pursue this major and i dont know what other major id be interested in. \n\nim just seriously so upset and disappointed and i dont know what to do anymore.",

      "text": "Does your school do grade replacement in the event that you fail a course? If so, then if you can show that you can kick ass and pass calc 2 with flying colors the second time, then I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t admit you into the computer science program at your university!! Even if you don\u2019t get into your computer science program this year, you still have a ton of time as a freshmen, since I\u2019m assuming that you still have a bit of gen Ed\u2019s you can knock out. If by the end of sophomore year you still aren\u2019t admitted into the comp sci program at your uni, you can talk to an advisor to see what your next steps are so that you can get to the same job as someone who is in the program, such as transferring to another school that lets you directly into the computer sci program and/or pursing another major, such as a math major with a programming minor for example. This setback you\u2019re facing right now is only temporary, but if you keep the course and stay persistent at wanting to study comp sci you\u2019ll be programming in no time!",
