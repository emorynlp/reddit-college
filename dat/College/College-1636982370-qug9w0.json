I\u2019m still trying to recover it and am terrified of not being able to graduate. Part of me feels like college might not be for me and maybe I should bite the bullet and drop out but I feel like I owe it to my family to continue. My gpa is between 2.7-2.0.",

Make sure that you form good study habits, talk to your professors when you have questions and not just before the exam, talk to your classmates, talk to the TA if there is one, etc. Feel free to pm if you have any other questions! :)",

I'm graduating with a 3.27 which isn't the best as the diploma I want to do takes in the 4.0 GPA people first but I'm proud that I went from a 2.33 to my 3.27 in just 9 classes. Feeling like you are now is actually a great motivator to do better because you'll do anything to avoid feeling like this again. Don't be too put off by failing either, instead look at what you did well and find ways to apply that to areas you didnt do well, look at where you need improvement most ans focus on those and don't be scared to ask for extra help if needed. You've got this, don't give up \ud83d\ude01",

I came back to college 2 years later and now I have 4 F\u2019s that tank my 3.3 GPA. I would\u2019ve failed just 1 class that semester, but I freaked out and wanted to pursue other things and didn\u2019t care about the future. We\u2019re only 5-6 weeks out from the end of this semester, ride that baby til the end and think about it over the summer. Don\u2019t hurt your future self like me",
