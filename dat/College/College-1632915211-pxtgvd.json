  "text": " \n\nI fked up.\n\nIt was a big test for uni and I fell for the temptation to cheat. It was just one question and I was given the answers to it by another friend. You bet I used those answers and now I really fking regret it. Those answers were for a different version of the test and had completely different answers.\n\nI got caught.\n\nThe deans realised that I have answers for a different version of the test and now I'm being called in for an interview. I regret everything and really fked up.\n\nNow, I just don't want to get my friend involved, who gave me the answers, involved in this mess. But, I don't know how to explain anything else.\n\nWhat do I do?",

If you apologize profusely and are sincere about your regret (and if this is the first time you have been caught for something like this) they will probably give you a 0 on the test but let you off with a warning.",
