  "text": "It\u2019s a big private school in Fort Lauderdale and while I don\u2019t wanna say the name because I\u2019m scared of someone from there seeing this, is this what most of you guys are paying for an education? Especially after Covid now that we\u2019re back in person, I can firmly say only one of my professors actually cares or makes an effort in the classes. Im thinking of just transferring to community college but I want to go into optometry and I\u2019m scared now that the graduate program that my current uni has will not take me seriously if I drop out to go to a cheaper school with the same or maybe even a better education?",

      "text": "I go to a \"state college\" aka community college with bachelor's degrees on the side and a university like campus. It's kinda the best of both worlds, I get very cheap education only $1,500/semester in-state (free for me). And I also get access to a nice looking campus with different buildings, library, career services, special events, sports games, etc. I'm thinking of transferring to a state university after I finish my associates degree, but only if it's affordable. If not, I can always go back to this school and do my bachelor's there. To answer your question about the qualify of professors. The quality is maybe 3 average. Some teachers will brag about their subject and make everyone feel dumb for not knowing....cough cough algebra. And some teachers will grade you like you're already an expert...cough speech. And then some teachers will just give you a homework assignment and all the necessary information to do it....cough intro to C. It's also important to keep in mind that not all these teachers are professors, some are just substitutes or didn't get their official title yet (not sure how professors get their title). Overall, I think your school is way too expensive, and I used to live close to that area so I know how expensive everything is. I think there's only 1 cheap university over there and I've heard the quality isn't that great since they accept pretty much everyone....cough FIU. Maybe consider going there since it's cheaper.",

      "text": "Honestly professors can be hit or miss. The way that I look at it is , the professor has no obligation to spoon feed you the information. To most professors it just a gig where they get paid to proctor the course itself. I\u2019m in my third year (biochemistry major on the premed track), and almost all of my premed classes with 100+ people in them was what you described. My tuition comes out to 56k a year , and I often contemplated the worth of it.\n\nNow that I\u2019m in my third year my classes are smaller, and my professors are much more approachable and honestly do a much better job then in the previous years. Again this is probably since this class is close to graduate level but nonetheless it\u2019s still the professors decision.\n\nNobody can tell you what the right decision is. For me 90% of the information I had to teach myself , and I do not regret it. I don\u2019t regret because what else would I be doing with my time? Best of luck to you.",

I did have a few awesome professors but for the most part, professors simply didnt teach the material better than i could just learn it on my own via a book or youtube. To me, college isnt about lecture and learning; it is strictly about the degree. Sucks to say, and i wish it were that you could go to college and just learn, but really i believe it\u2019s just a means to an end. Dont go to college unless you know what you want to do and it requires a degree",

Then I left. I\u2019ve also had classes where they just read off the power points. Some professor just don\u2019t care about students. I\u2019m not sure transferring to a community college is the right move, as they often don\u2019t have the same 4 year degrees and programs, but if this is a common occurrence, you may want to look at cheaper 4 year universities with your program. I would also talk to older students, preferably in your program to see if it gets better after the weed out type classes, because for the most part it did for me.",

Seek out research assistantships.\n\n\\>Read non-required readings interesting to you relevant to your field, or even irrelevant.

I found that - and this is speaking in broad brushstrokes here - faculty at R1 and R2 (research intensive) universities typically weren't taught how to teach, view research and not teaching as their priority, and often find undergraduate students to be a nuisance. That's obviously not the case for all faculty. Many care deeply and spend a lot of time grading, creating engaging lesson plans, all that jazz. But, in general, faculty aren't taught how to teach. I was in my grad program, it was considered a novelty/unique by folks in other programs. \n\nAnyway, I wrote all this to say this: I'd recommend that you if you can, check out a lot graduate programs, not just the one at your current institution. If you're unhappy with the educational experience you're receiving as an undergraduate there, it might be the same or worse at the graduate level. Maybe not, but it's worth broadening your considerations for future programs. Because at some point, you'll need faculty to write letters of recommendation and to do other kinds of work that demands time, attention, care, and energy that extends beyond someone phoning it in and reading a PP slide.",

      "text": "My impression from my own experience and the experiences of others around me is this: You pay for three things in a college education. 1: The name on the degree. We all hope that the education we're getting is genuinely valuable and indicative of capability, and it can be (see the second and third points), but at the end of the day, the most important thing you're paying for is the ability to say \"I have a degree from x university so you should hire me\". Of course, in reality, simply graduating doesn't equalize everyone, and some people come out of college significantly more prepared for a career than others. This brings me to point 2: the opportunity to create a good education for yourself. Lectures and tests in and of themselves aren't what makes college education special and valuable - theoretically you could just buy the books and teach yourself everything. The value comes in what you do besides the bare minimum - in meeting professors and classmates with new ideas and experiences, making connections in academia and industry, and utilizing opportunities for research and activities that you wouldn't be able to justify funding yourself. This is why grad school admissions are beginning to consider research and engagement nearly as heavily as GPA and test scores recently. Finally, reason 3: The ease and confidence of having a semi-set curriculum. The reason you and employers both feel confident that a degree prepared you well for real-world work is that curriculums are standardized. You are able to move along a preordained path, sprinkling in things you are interested in among standard classes that the university has deemed useful based on data from academia and industry. \n\nTL;DR - If all you're doing is going to lecture, doing homework, and passing your assessments, then no matter where you're going you won't be getting the full benefits of a college education.",

There are some research universities that take a lot of pride in teaching quality, but it varies a lot from school to school. 9\n\nTeaching colleges, on the other hand, put less emphasis on research for their faculty and put heavy emphasis on quality teaching. For business schools, there are totally different accreditations. AACSB, for example, is a research-oriented school. If a college is ACBSP-accredited, they concentrate heavily on teaching quality. \n\nA teaching college will have a lot higher percentage of instructors with masters degrees (as opposed to doctorates) and many of the instructors will have significant work experience in their fields. Research universities can be staffed completely by researchers, and sometimes the instructors have no applied practice in their fields outside of research. If your school has a lot of doctorate programs, they will of course have more doctorate-level instructors. But depending on the major, undergraduate courses can be taught by masters-level faculty at many schools.",

If the answer is no, then transfer. Loans and debt are no joke and you don't want to be stuck paying somewhere you're unhappy with, and if the school is hiring professors that don't care, then the school doesn't deserve your money either.\n If you don't like the university now, why would you want to go there for grad school? Who cares what that college think, because you honestly shouldn't. If the undergrad isn't good, then the grad school won't be any better. Find another school that has an optometry program. Trust me, there are plenty of options out there. I transferred my sophomore year and I'm the happiest I've been with school. If you can find a cheaper and better education that makes you happy, go for it. Do it for yourself.",
