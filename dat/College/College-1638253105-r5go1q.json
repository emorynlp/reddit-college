  "text": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm currently taking a break from university, with no concrete plans of returning for a couple reasons. Recently I noticed the rise and appeal of coding bootcamps/online courses to learn specific skills. Trade school has also been coming back as more of a cost effective and viable option for those who are unsure of what major to pursue.  \n\nThere are a couple reasons why I think the future of university might look a bit different. \n\nFor example: \n\n1) Cost of university/college is still insanely expensive, as well as student debt in the U.S. is a big financial burden for recent grads. \n\n2) A lot of tech companies such as Google and Amazon are offering courses for people who are willing to learn tech skills and earn certificates. Although there are caveats with these types of programs I'm sure. I think Amazon requires you to work for them once you complete the program. \n\n3) The job market is more saturated with recent grads. A college degree's value has diminished now that most people have them. Decent-paying jobs also require a lot of experience, but most recent grads don't have the experience or qualifications that those employers are asking for. Not to mention, entry-level jobs don't pay enough for students to pay off their student debt within a reasonable amount of time. \n\n4) This one is more of a personal observation, but I've noticed that students who go into college without a strong sense of knowing what path or career they want to pursue after often feel depressed and unmotivated to complete their coursework. Most of my friends are still in university either in undergrad or doing a graduate program. From their anecdotes, they seem miserable. Most of them dread it and can't wait for their school breaks. A lot of them are often stressed out of their minds and struggle maintaining a healthy lifestyle while attending university. This is also why I'm hesitant to go back to school, since it seems like I might end up in the same boat as they are. \n\nSo I think my question is, what do you guys think the future of university/college will look like? Will more students decide that university isn't what they wanna pursue after high school?",

      "text": "students who *commit* to a major and do their best by getting high grades, going to grad school, getting internships, will do just fine. it's the \"idk what i want to do but i just want to get an easy degree and make bank after school\" slackers that screw themselves over.\n\nthe increase in availability of loans/financial \"aid\" because of demands for increased access to higher education is the reason for higher price of college.  the reason a bachelors degree isn't \"good enough\" anymore is because of the same root cause: demands for increased access to higher education. so you have idiots who barely passed high school getting in 85%+ admit rate university graduating with the classic \"math/science too hard, ez money plzzzzz\" bachelors degree making all the other bachelors degree holders look bad, when they really shouldn't have been admitted to the university, nevermind graduate with a college degree.\n\nthe ideal future of college is that they make middle school and high school rigorous again while providing more support to economically disadvantaged students so high school diplomas actually mean something other than \"im a grownup!\", then college admissions will actually mean something, and then college degrees will have lots of value. and that way the poors are being pulled up to the bar, rather than lowering the bar for everyone.\n\nin the short term this would result in dramatic falls in college admissions and high school graduates, which necessarily result in entire colleges shutting down. People and worldwide news will complain, \"the united states is falling backwards in education1!!!!11oneleven!\" and that \"parents know how to teach children the best!\" And if these policies were ever actually put into practice, I fully expect a satirical illustration of people working to pull down a branch of a fruit tree with the rich/powerful holding it up away from the ground.\n\nin short, if high school kids are too lazy or stupid to get into college, then don't give them money for college. i *would* suggest the banks assess academic potential of students before loaning them money, but that is dangerously close to redlining (which is illegal)",

Ended up being end of 2020 and 2021 crap\nHit the fan. My family has been though a lot of tragedy this year trying to get cleaned up from 2020 as well.\n\nI am currently am taking classes to fix what I have started at community college.\n\nI have 4 cousins 2 in hs, one a freshman totally unsure on what to do. The other dropped out at least a year he\u2019s citing he can\u2019t handle online.\n\nthis is a hard one, I see work wise a lot of coke into the office 1-2 days a week and we will migrate to our happy places. Right now I am flexible part time (I have to visit Walmart in x town) and go to my airport when they need me (per round) to get prices to do pricing comparisons. So my journey to the airport is 1hr away.  I only stomach it because it\u2019s maybe 8 times a quarter. \n\nI see a lot of confusion right now.",

      "text": "1. That's true. Blame student loans \n\n2. Yes that's true but getting a degree is better and most companies won't offer certifications and you'll need a degree\n\n3. Thats what internships are for, to gain experience. And for your entry level pay argument it depends in what you want to do. If you pick a low paying field as your major and you decide to go into debt for it then yeah but if you pick a good field to go in debt for then it shouldn't be that hard\n\n\n4. Likely that's not the reason, id bet the reason is that COVID is ruining everything and sending people online and online courses suck. I had this issue even though I came in to college knowing what I wanted to do",

Perhaps some fields like CS/IT will get drawn away to those coding certificates, but the vast majority of fields will be unaffected. From personal experience, I know from experience the majority of humanities classes and a large number of social science classes do not translate well to online formats, let alone Coursera-like certificates. Many STEM fields have a lab or something similar, something unreplicable through online.",

Certificates are alright but every interview I went to asked why I didn't have a uni degree in cs instead of doing random certs. \n\nCs does seem like more of a field where you can prove your worth even without a degree but if that is your chosen field don't make it harder than you need to. Even though it seems like everyone has a uni degree these days that's just not the case in the real world. Even if you don't use your degree to the fullest right away after graduating it's still a huge step above someone who doesn't have a degree. \n\nI think we need to remember that doing uni or college doesn't always allow us to skip that entry level, and shouldn't expect to be landing a really decent paying job right away.",
