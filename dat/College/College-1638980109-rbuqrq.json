  "text": "This is my first semester back at college after taking two years off and working. I am doing fine in school, my grades are good (lowest grade is a 92) and I am not even super stressed out by finals. But I am sitting in class right now bored out of my mind and I've been questioning if this is worth it or not. I don't love how I spend my time constantly doing school work, it is not enjoyable. I don't like how most of my classes are super boring and I have to do this bs homework for classes I don't give a shit about. I feel like I am wasting my time. With this being said I do not know what an alternative would be right now. \n\nMy goal was to give college a year and see how I like it and at first it was fine but as the semester has continued I have started to become fed up with it because I do not see the point in my classes or why I am being taught the material.",

      "text": "You could leave and figure out something else to do with your life, which is a recipe for huge depression and regret unless you've already got something specific in mind. Or you could stay, maybe take some classes that help you figure out why colleges and curricula are structured the way they are (history, sociology, public policy), learn some things that are genuinely valuable to you, and leave with a degree.",
