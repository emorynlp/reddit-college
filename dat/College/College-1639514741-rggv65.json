  "text": "I just got my final grades back and I got a 3.3 GPA this semester.. I feel kind of sad because I know other people have higher grades than that, I just feel like I work so much that getting all A\u2019s is a lot to ask of myself. What does your GPA look like (if you work full time)?? Do you have any advice on how to manage time better??",
