      "text": "From the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/student-exception-to-fica-tax):\n\n>FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes do not apply to service performed by students employed by a school, college or university where the student is pursuing a course of study. Whether the organization is a school, college or university depends on the organization\u2019s primary function. In addition, whether employees are students for this purpose requires examining the individual\u2019s employment relationship with the employer to determine if employment or education is predominant in the relationship.",
