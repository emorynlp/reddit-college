  "text": "How do you guys study using PCs for like Calc or physics that need internet and alot of practice to pass considering how easy it is to get distracted by said pc I'm trying to do that but I'm struggling  it might sound silly but I actually want help before I went to college I used to just study the books so I usually just go to a quiet place and study there but in college subjects are hard and need alot of research using my pc but I get distracted very easily.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a graphic design major so a lot of class work is done on a pc and usually needs internet for some googling. I also struggle with focusing and tend to get derailed looking up random stuff, but i found limiting yourself to one screen (if you have many monitors or whatever), turning off phone notifications/other msging stuff, and putting up some kind of white noise in the background works for me. Usually I put on something I\u2019ve already seen and doesn\u2019t need my attention, music (nothing that will overly excite you) or a mundane YouTube video of some sort (I really like wagon making videos for this, from Engles Coach Shop). It took me a while to figure out what I need to do to get focused. For me, once I get into the groove of working time flys by and I usually don\u2019t wanna stop. If the quiet place works for you keep on using it! I\u2019ve also heard its good practice to have a different place or some kind of ritual you do before studying in order to get into the right mindset.",

          "text": "i find that playing anything other than my own voice can distract me so i usually not listen to music when im studying but i haven't tried it for so long i mean years probably so i actually have an idea of what to listen to and i kinda understand what you mean with groove of working i actually get the same feeling when i study something and can actually understand it if that make sense and lastly the problem with me going to a different place and study is i don't have internet data basically i can't afford it and i have to use internet esp for youtube and other websites like telegram that has more videos and the only place i can access them is using my pc thanks for the reply tho i have 2 monitors so im gonna turn 1 of them off and try maybe that will make me focus more",

              "text": "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re going to live on campus or commute (at my uni you had to dorm your first year if you lived far enough). Usually campuses have Wi-Fi in every building and in most places where you have some kind of public seating. I\u2019d highly recommend making good use of the library or student union on campus if you can.",
