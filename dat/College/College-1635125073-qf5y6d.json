  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m finishing my undergrad this semester in biology. I no longer want to be in the field. \n\nI need some advice\u2026after I graduate, should I go back to college for two years to finish a computer science bachelors? I have all the core requirements so it will only take me two years to complete it.\n\nOr should I go straight for a masters with a biology bachelors and do software engineering? Would I find a job with a biology bachelors and software engineering masters? What do you guys think?",

      "text": "It depends on what you plan on doing with the computer science degree. If you plan on making software/coding, it would be better to just work a biology job and do a coding boot camp in your free time until you work up your skills and experience to then transition into a software role at some other company. If you want to do computer science research, then you\u2019ll probably want to get your bachelors.",
