  "text": "No, I don\u2019t want to tell my professor that I\u2019m having mental health problems but rather it\u2019s her that I\u2019m worried about. She used to always be punctual and on time, all of the assignments have been neatly labeled and she always was engaging. Within the past few weeks, assignments stopped being uploaded regularly, the midterm assignment was uploaded two days before it\u2019s deadline and she doesn\u2019t teach anymore. She often leaves the zoom class early and let\u2019s the other teacher teach. I\u2019m worried about my teacher. Not because of my grades of anything, but because I\u2019ve had depression for the most of my life and I see a lot signs. What should I do?",

      "text": "Contact the chair. Don't treat it as a complaint, but an honest concern. Don't try to diagnose or suggest what's going on, just state what you've observed and that you are concerned. Be sure to emphasize that you have no complaints with the quality of teaching and that this is less of a professional complaint and more of a personal concern.",
