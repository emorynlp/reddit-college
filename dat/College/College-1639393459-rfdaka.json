  "text": "So this semester I'm going to be taking \n\nBIOL189 w/ Lab - Fundamental Life Science Course  \n\nCH 203 - American Experience and Constitutional Change (History)\n\nCOM 335 - Communication in the Public Interest \n\nI may also add a photoshop or digital photography class so that I can be full time and get scholarships.\n\nI personally struggle a lot with essay writings and get overwhelmed easily if I'm taking more than two difficult classes. I know biology will be difficult for me but I would like to get your opinion if you've taken a history course and communication course before.",
