  "text": "Hi!- I'm a senior in college and I'm applying to grad schools. The whole application process has made me feel like I didn't do enough during my college years. I worked while doing school full time, but they were jobs that didn't have much to do with my major. Is it just me, or do most college students not do any internships, volunteer work, study abroad, etc.?",

My honor society had volunteer events, so did student government, and even my business fraternity. Even my internships I did had volunteering events. Most jobs have some volunteer opportunities.",

If you want to do volunteer work though, you can check in with a rotary club in your location. I\u2019ve done years of service with them and am now a Rotex (although I don\u2019t do much now with work and all). You\u2019d enjoy it, I\u2019m sure. \n\nAlso what is your major?",
