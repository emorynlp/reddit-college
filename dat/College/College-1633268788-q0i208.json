  "text": "There are too many people who walk slowly and write text messages while looking down. If I try to pass them it never fails that the side I choose they start swaying towards. I go left then they go left, I head right they go right without fail. If you need to see what you're typing please move to the side of the hallway/path (or learn where the buttons are so you don't need to look directly at it). I just try to avoid them but one of these days I'll just not move and shoulder check somebody.",

I've been hit three times, never hard, just people being dumb in intersections. I've ridden in NYC, too. It's funny, people are a lot more relaxed in Chicago, and NY is INSANE, but NYC has better infrastructure. City biking.... It's its own thing...",
