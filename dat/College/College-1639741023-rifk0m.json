  "title:": "Could I get into Rice as an international student with these stats",
  "text": "I am a junior in high school and the universities in my country, Turkey, does not accept SAT scores. Also, no need for essays or extracurricular activities while applying. Only Turkish university exam is required.\nI am not sure if the chances of me getting accepted by Rice or similar US universities is high, so I don't want to take a risk spending my time on studying for SAT. It is very diffucult for me to study for both exams.\n\nI'd be grateful if y'all inform me about my chances with these stats\n\nI studied in Texas as an exchange student and I liked it there so much that I want to go back to Texas for college.  I am not sure how to calculate my GPA out of 4 but on a scale of 100 it is \n->97 for prep class\n->95 for freshman\n->85 for sophmore \n->95 for junior \n\nI didn't begin to study for sat yet, however I took 3 practice tests. My scores are around 1400. \n\nMy exchange program was funded by the USDOS. The acceptance rate of the program was %1 that year. When I was in the US I won an essay contest among exchange students and completed +200 hours of community service. \n\nI led two clubs in Turkey in Social Studies High School that I got in as the highest ranked (%3) student. I was the valedictorian for the first two years. \n\nI am the youngest (only high schooler) founding member of a Search and Rescue Team, finalist of the national debate tournament. \n\nPlease let me know if I should keep trying for the US colleges. I don't want to take a huge risk if it is too late for me :\")",
