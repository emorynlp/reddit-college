  "text": "So I\u2019m 16 1/2 years old, currently in my junior year taking college classes, and lately I\u2019ve been thinking about my academic future\u2026I definitely wanna continue on my education and get a degree in mechanical engineering but I don\u2019t know if I want to continue it where I\u2019m currently located. I currently live in Houston Texas but I want a change of atmosphere/scenery, not saying Houston is a bad city at all but after living here for 16 years in the same place you start to beg for something different\u2026something different like Colorado. I know some may be thinking that I\u2019m planning way too ahead but this has been something that\u2019s been on my mind for quite a while. My purpose with this post is to gain some advice on why a decision like this may be wise/unwise of me, maybe someone from personal experience could tell me could offer guidance",

      "text": "Moving states is something you need to consider quite a few factors for. Living costs, transportation, weather/climate, and of course educational resources. \n\nIf you're fine with snow, you can go north quite a bit. If snow isnt your jam, you're gonna need to stick south side. If you dont have much experience with transportation in snow, consider living close or on campus. If you dont have appropriate weather gear, get some before going. \n\nIf you have your own car, you can live reasonably distant from campus and find nice rents. If you dont, you'll need to rely on public transit or live on campus.\n\nMoving out means you'll need to pick up rent and food. Around me, rent can get up to 1200/month for some 1 person flats. Food can run you 3-400 a month. Roommates help, obviously, and should be considered.\n\nAs far as education, making sure the school you go to has your desired major. Make a post on the local subreddit asking for thoughts.",
