  "text": "So my bio professor has this grading system where you can earn a certain number of points (860) during the semester. He also doesn't believe in the whole \"I'll show you your grade as you turn in assignments, and it'll go up/down based on the avg of all past assignments\" thing that most teachers do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead, everyone in the class starts at a 0, and 860 is a 100%/A+. You basically start the class from a failing grade, and each assignment will raise it. At the end of the semester, you'll be able to see your final grade (x points out of 860), but you can't see what grade you have before that (both overall and past assignment average). So for instance, if the total amounts of points you've earned throughout the semester is 700, then your final grade will be an 81.4, or a B-.  \n\n\nTL;DR Prof has a grading system where everyone starts the class with a failing grade, you can only earn a max of 860 points/semester, and you don't get to see what your grade is until the semester's over.   \n\n\nIs this a common practice? None of my other professors do/have done this (I'm a freshman and I've experienced 5 classes so far).",

      "text": "So, you can\u2019t see what you scored on each assignment? No grades for assignments are released at all?\n\nAssuming that things are graded as the course goes and that you get scores back for each assignment as it\u2019s graded, the kind of system you are describing is just a matter of semantics. You can calculate your percentage at any time by taking the points you\u2019ve earned and dividing those points by the total points possible thus far. Just because the professor doesn\u2019t do it for you doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t determine your grade - unless, of course, no points are shown for anything all semester.",

      "text": "Every class you start does it this way. You earn your points for a total at the end of the semester. Some categories can be weighted, but the idea remains the same. So you can look at as starting with all your points or starting with no points. Doesn't really matter.",

      "text": "Many teachers do this, depends on the software they use. If the software is easy enough you probably get ongoing updates, cause it's an easy option. \n\nGet the rubric. Either online or by hand making a running grade calculator. \n\n90% on assignment 1, worth x points, x % of final grade. Current grade, 90%.\n\n80% on assignment two, worth x points, x percent of final grade. Current grade, 85% \n\nAnd so on. But yeah, look up Notion templates or apps.\n\nYou should be tracking this anyhow to make sure your grades are correct.",

      "text": "so you are saying that usually, your classes start everyone out at full points/100%/A, and they get reduced as the semester goes on? So, it's not like you are earning points as you go, but your are losing points? I'd say that is not the norm, but that your bio professor is actually how all other classes do work, except you can usually ask them what your grade is throughout the semester. I have always started out with zero points and then as I turn stuff in and take tests, those points start accumulating toward the total possible points.",
