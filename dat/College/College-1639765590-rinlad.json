  "title:": "[ X] Grade & My NIGHTMARE Experience With ASU the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences",
  "text": " I am a sophomore at ASU. I, like any other semester, REALLY ENJOYED the classes I had. However, unlike previous semesters I was not fortunate enough for things to go as smoothly as they did in my First Year. Well, This semester I woke up to a nightmare scenario. AND I want to preface this by saying that. I joined the university during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic for Fall 2020, when classes were 99% on Zoom. I am also not that great with technology. Other than my first semester as a freshman, I have set up my schedule through my.asu on my own since Spring 2021. Well, On \\[a day of the week\\] I was informed when inquiring about the \\[X\\] grade that I saw in the gradebook (later found out to mean audit) that my class was set up to be audited. Now, I would never, ever, ever, EVER. Voluntarily do this. More power to you if you wish to Audit a course, however, I want all the credits I had long days and incredibly short nights for to go towards my degree. My professor said that he would be willing to change to a letter grade AND initially the Registrar approved, I HAVE THIS ALL IN EMAIL. I also want to add that it was INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT to get in contact with the right people. I kept getting transferred from department to department. Then, the people I was meant to get in contact with AT THE COLLEGE were APATHETIC to the point of RUDENESS, when, all of a sudden\u2026. \u201cactually no, we cant.\u201d MEANWHILE The entire time I was overly nice and cordial, between sobs and tears of course.... I got an A- in a 3.0 credit course, that is being audited from the 16 exhausting credits I took this semester. This experience has honestly traumatized me. I realize what other students and alumni mean when they say ASU doesn't really care about the well-being of their students. Especially when it comes to their grading policy. AND I think we need to see a major change happen soon! I am not the only person in my family to get conveniently bamboozled out of credits one way or another. Which is straight theft if you ask me... I may just leave THIS college because I don't care for the apathetic snakes that are handling my transcripts...",

      "text": "Hi I responded to your other topic in /r/ASU but I think it got deleted?  It sucks what happened to you but there might be a possibility of taking a proficiency exam and passing out of the class.  See [https://catalog.asu.edu/credit\\_exam](https://catalog.asu.edu/credit_exam)  since you would have received an A- had you not accidentally registered to audit it, you would probably pass the exam no problem.  It would probably beat having to take the course all over again anyway.",
