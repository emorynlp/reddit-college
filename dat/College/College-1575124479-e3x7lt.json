  "text": "if you have to write an essay, whatever is the required font size, start writing it on a smaller one. For me, the required right now is 12, and i'm writing at 9. The stress and the focus of writing will easily make you forget you made this change, and when you are absolutely desperate, on the cusp of the panic attacks that are a basic component of writing essays:  Select your whole text, and adjust the font size up. \n\nI just checked where my progress is actually at, and I'm legit almost crying from happiness. It's a great source of catharsis. Helped me finish a lot of essays without nervous breakdowns.",

      "text": "So, after a couple years of suffering from long stretches of procrastination (like right now) and subsequent essay panic, I've figured out a decent system for getting a 3000-4000 word research essay in roughly 6 hours from scratch. This means I wake up at 9am with no progress at all, and finish by 3pm with a completed paper. In the process, I build an outline by stringing 3 quotes in 400-500 word chunks, and use that to rapidly finish a paper.\n\nFirst, you want to come up with a good number of sources. Note when an essay required peer reviewed, scholarly sources. For that, a lot of people go to the pain of looking at physical books, and I say fuck that. Instead, open up your university's library webpage and see if they have a search engine for that library. If so, you might be lucky and have access to a database of scholarly peer reviewed sources, usually in research articles posted to research journals. Do a bit of skimming and collect ones that work with your argument and have quotable material.\n\n\nSecondly, read your sources, obviously, and remember to grab quotes that support that thesis and put those into a word document. This will come in handy later. If you don't have a thesis, just grab interesting quotes that you could build into a thesis. For my Saudi Arabia history class, I had to come up with a way of critiquing King Faisal's attempts at reforming the state government, and noticed that they poured millions of dollars in supporting an agriculture industry while I was doing research. Stuff like that.\n\nFinally, the research usually takes me 2-3 hours, and this includes building what I like to call an essay skeleton. As you collect quotes, start organizing them by common argument. Multiple quotes about agriculture sucking might be sorted into a \"agriculture sucked, therefore [Argument]\" kind of deal. That's the good shit that forms the bulk of what your thesis is arguing towards. For a 4k paper, I ended up with 1 main argument, and 4 sub arguments at 1k words each, usually well quoted.\n\nFinally, the dastardly writing phase has begun. I find a good 3 quotes is sufficient for a decent 400-500 word chunk. My formula is always; [Present Argument] \n\n[Either use a quoted paraphrase or a blended direct quote to further an argument] \n\n[Explain why the quote furthers your argument] \n\n[Set up sentence for next argument]\n\nThis setup allows you to blitz an essay in 500 word chunks and provides for richly detailed word chunks with research supporting a majority of your essay. If they're sourced from peer reviewed databanks, even better. I always have quotes left over as I finish and that's a good sign.",

I\u2019d pull loads of related articles just like you said, then as I read them I\u2019d dump any quote I found relevant into a Word doc.  When I got sick of reading I\u2019d group the quotes based on what they had in common. \n\nBy this stage the arguments started to make themselves, and I\u2019d order them into something that made sense from the perspective of a whole essay, then I\u2019d finish by sticking the quotes together to form coherent sentences.  Intro and conclusion last and all done.",
