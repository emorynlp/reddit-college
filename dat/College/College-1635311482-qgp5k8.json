  "text": "What\u2019s the nicest way to text my roommate to be quieter when she gets back? She usually gets back to the dorm at 2-3am and she is SO loud when she comes back. I\u2019m talking slamming drawers shut, turning on lights, playing music, etc. Should I say \u201chey when you get back can you pls try to be quiet?\u201d Or something? I don\u2019t want to come off rude but I just want some sleep :(",

She may not understand it is rude doing what she does, but that's easy to find out. \n\nBe a bit rude to her, if she escalates by being rude back, she is just an indifferent asshole. If she is upset by your rudeness, you can exain that's you are a bit irritable from the messed up sleep and apologize.\n\nEither way, being a bit rude here is to your advantage. Rude is not bad in situations like this. Good luck!",
