  "text": "I'm new to college and i need advice .I never was in a Relationship with a girl .but I'm Like a friend with only one girl i knew in high school because we are like the autistic / introverts that struggled to make friends in this first 2 weeks. \n\nanyway I live in a private university dorm room it's like an apartment with 2 bedrooms each bedroom with 2 beds and a Living room so 4 Roommates per apartment  there is 12 Apartments per floor and 4 floors . (4 males or 4 females per apartment )\n\none night i found my roommates (that live in the other bedroom) cooking fish so we helped them and we eated with them that's how i tried to know them better until they asked me do i like girls ,so i told them i don't want to fuck any girl until i know her better (which was a mistake ) anyway they told me \n\nok do you want to kiss\n\n\\- i told them why not \n\n\\-one of them said you can kiss me \n\nso i told him -I didn't kiss a girl why do you want me to kiss you (I'm not gay )\n\nthe conversation was longer and after that they told me if you want to kiss a girl \n\nthat they will call a girl for me you can even do what you want and They're not joking at all \n\nthey even bring 2 girls per night and i see them they are not always the same girls .\n\nanyway it's my first time to kiss or even have sex and i wanted some advice .\n\nshould i just let them bring the bitch .is it safe without a condom (I don't want HIV) \n\nbecause i don't really want to fuck with a girl i don't know but sometimes i think I'm stupid if i don't accept that thing.\n\nI live in north Africa   \nand Sorry for my trash English",

No shame in sex work, but there is a higher risk of STDs in that situation. \n\nAnd don\u2019t have sex if you are not ready. It\u2019s not a box to check off at a certain point in life. It\u2019s something to do when YOU want to do it. Not because your roommates want you to.",
