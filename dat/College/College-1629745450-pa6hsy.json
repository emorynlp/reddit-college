  "text": "Classes just started for a lot of us and unfortunately for me, some of my professors decided to not use canvas, which is a free site that our college requires professors to use  for things such as homework and tests if youre online as well as posting other material. \n\nIt seems like they have some wiggle room cause as previously mentioned some of them have opted to choose PAID websites in order for me to access my HOMEWORK. They also do tests on there but seriously? I have to pay tuition, which would theoretically pay for instruction and access to do my own damn homework and tests. \n\nI understand that this has been going on for a while now but how is this not illegal. It is literally extortion when you have paid for a service and then they force you to pay even more money to be able to even use the original service. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan we band together and somehow sue against practices such as these?",

Sure it's nice if you know sooner, but it's not extortion if you don't. The time that you find out what you need will have no effect on your willingness to stay in class and pay for the required materials. \n\n>Also no, with tuition you agree to exchange your money for the professors knowledge.\n\nIf you think that tuition just pays for the professor's knowledge, why do you bother buying the textbook? You can just sit in the class and absorb your professor's knowledge all you want.\n\nAnd if you truly believe that tuition just pays for your professor to share knowledge, why are you surprised that course materials cost extra?\n\n>For the professors that don\u2019t require subscriptions they all recommended the book but almost never required it unless we were doing hw from the book, which if they did I often found pdf versions of the book for free, sometimes even provided by the professor!\n\nYes, that is indeed what some professors do. I don't see the relevance of this to your argument that professors who don't do this are extorting you.",

The student, assuming to be in the US, is paying absurd tuition only to be faced with more hidden fees. If I were in the US, I'd be fucking disgusted too. Yes, I know professors are exploited and overworked. I didn't realise this when I was in my freshman year and I, retrospectively, feel that I was too demanding of my professors (I expected the same standard of assessment that I got in highschool so I gave very negative course evals due to the overuse of MCQs and automated grading which I thought was the height of laziness). But it's still incredibly unfair for the university as an institution to prey on students like this.",

I\u2019m not an expert in everything I teach (like intermediate language), but in a course where I am an expert, I give the students a perspective they couldn\u2019t get from a non specialist. My paper topics, for example, will be things that cause heated debate at conferences and will be interesting to think about. When I\u2019m out of field, my paper topics will be more boring because I have to go for the obvious. It might not feel that different to an undergrad, but looking back on my college experiences the courses where the professor\u2019s expertise matched the class really were special. They were moving, they were interesting, they made me want to learn more. It took being an expert myself to really see it, and I couldn\u2019t judge the things I took out of field, even now. From the student seat it\u2019s hard to tell (unless you Google them) who\u2019s an expert in what. I wish people picked their classes that way!",

Why do you think more publishers are releasing their own subscriptions and access code schemes. Pearson, Houghton Mifflin, cengage, mcgraw hill, mac millon they all have their own thing going and these are just some of them. The business portion of my college does the subscription stuff. Pretty much all of it in the future can potentially be just these different companies competing with access codes and subscriptions making the cost of college rise even further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only that but these are global companies that have vast influence since publishing is essentially a monopoly.

This is why I said it was \"your\" choice because it was. I know contraceptives are not 100% successful just as you do, which is why I don't have sex. I had a few close calls with my ex however, I'm just super thankful she never got preg.\n\n>I learn better from actual labs and lectures personally\n\nThis has nothing to do with using online tools. I had chemistry classes that were in person (prior to covid) and still used online tools to aid in learning. We had in person labs and lectures with all the HW and quizzes being online. We did in person tests and lab practicals. If your bio classes are online due to covid, they will be in person eventually. The school lockdowns won't last forever.",

The second comment I made about pregnancy is more related to how pretentious and ignorant yours comes off. Me mentioning labs and lectures, has to do with what helps ME learn better, because you mentioned how YOU learn better from online programs.

I'm thinking of the future, soon that baby is going to be a massive financial burden on you for 18+ years, in addition to the stress you already have. This was the angle I was going at, but it seems you are only thinking about these 9 or so months you are pregnant and how it's stressful to have work (how does that correlate with professors using online tools?)\n\n>because you mentioned how YOU learn better from online programs.\n\nYou are sorta twisting my words. Yes, I said I learn better with online tools but I also mentioned how learning engineering benefits from these online tools. It was supposed to be inferred that ANY engineering major would benefit from these tools but I understand if that was too far of a leap for you to make.  \n\n>how pretentious and ignorant yours comes off\n\nThinking about my future and making a responsible choice makes me ignorant? It seems it's the opposite. I get the pretentious part I guess, even though I think you are grasping for straws at this point. \n\n>It seems that you struggle a little bit seeing things from a different perspective other than your own\n\nIt is true that I do lack a degree of empathy for people I don't know/aren't important to me. However, I'm more of a logical thinker vs an emotional one. When you first mentioned being pregnant, I thought it was because of the financial burden, since that is the only thing that would correlate with professors requiring you to buy more stuff. It doesn't seem like this was the reason you mentioned being pregnant. You mentioned it because it makes you more stressed but I'm not sure how that correlates with professors having you buy extra online tools? Getting confused as to why you'd mention something that seems unrelated doesn't mean I can't \"see things from a different perspective\".",

In addition, the professors life becomes easier. \n\nThis leads to higher quality office hours and just overall assistance. I understand your frustrations though, these tools will eventually become cheaper if not free in the future. My physics professor got us a deal on our online resources, we payed about 40 bucks. I had another professor actually give us FREE online tools (book, feedback, HW, quizzes) everything.

Much easier to read physical material. It doesn't strain your eyes and it's easier to not get distracted by other internet resources or tools. \n\n2/. You can annotate more easily on physical medium. \n\n3/. It's generally a lot easier to find cheap ways of getting physical books such as lending them from a library. \n\nFor tests, it's pretty damn obvious that physical ones are much better for Math based stuff:\n\n1/. Impossible to show workings in a meaningful way in online exams\n\n2/. Easier to grade physical tests (not including the use of automated grading software that only records answers)\n\n3/. Much easier to prevent cheating in them (huge one).\n\nI know you could say that for point 3/. \"Well, just make them open book\" but how are you supposed to know whether or not the student wrote the exam as opposed to someone else? Plus, sometimes, having a bit of memory work for lower level classes can help reinforce and conceptualise material (e.g. having to perform an unfamiliar proof like the Macluarin Series for Sinh(X) which you may be able to find online, yet performing it from memory helps to understand and internalise key concepts. Why not just specify that you can bring the course textbook/other materials into the exam? That's the best way to do open book exams. \n\nBy the way, if there really are software that automatically grades Math workings, then I have to say, that could be useful.",

I'm not belittling your preferences, moreso just establishing why I think online tooling is better: \n\n1. I find it much easier to read on a screen. The strain only comes into play when you have bad glare or poor lighting. A screen is nice and vertical whereas a book is horizontal so you have to stain your neck to read. Not to mention the extra space on your desk the book takes up, and that annoying tendency for the pages to turn on their own, especially with new books. What do you mean distracted by other tools? All the tools I've experienced only helped my understanding, not hindered it. \n\n2. Actually, electronic books are MUCH easier to annotate. In addition to all the basic stuff such as highlighting, you can even type notes within a page and hide it so it doesn't obscure the book material. Best of all, you can search the book for your own highlights or even just keywords. In a traditional book you'll have to flip to the index and it's just really cumbersome. Plus you can erase an accidental highlight, good luck erasing highlights on a physical book. \n\n3. I've sourced almost all of my college books from online sites that give it away for free, FREE. Plus with ebooks, there is no waste product or need to cutdown trees or whatever happens during the manufacturing process. This is only a personal issue but I find library books disgusting. This is because as a kid, I used to get books from the library and one time I opened one to my horror...a big, green booger. From then on I find library books repulsive, God only knows what people do with them. \n\nNext the test ones. It's worth noting that I believe testing in itself is a flawed concept and needs reform either way.\n\n1. Depends on the professor. Some of mine have allowed us to use things like iPads to take digital notes and send it in with the test. If you don't have the iPad, they would let you scan your handwritten notes to send in. \n\n2. You say to exclude the automatic grading but that's how these tests are graded with the online tools most the time. If they had to hand grade each one individually, how is that any easier or harder than physical tests? At least with the online ones they don't have to lug around 400+ tests wherever they want to grade them. \n\n3. People have been cheating well before the internet even existed. They will always find a way, thus being part of why I think tests need reformation. I'd agree it's easier to cheat with online exams but that doesn't mean people don't cheat in person. \n\nOverall, I think your points are valid for yourself as they are your own personal preferences. I personally find online and digital resources to be much more superior.",

With a book, you can effectively shut off all other distractions out of your sight, but it's much harder to do that when your ebook is tied to the internet. There have also been studies that show that physical media have better learning retention than online media. I would love to find ways to reduce eye strain on them, especially since I'm short-sighted. If I can find ways to concentrate as much on online textbooks as on physical ones, I would agree with you, but I can't find a way.  \n\nFor the record, I agree with you about the tests. A lot of the time, they aren't great at assessing knowledge, especially in upper division classes. But to me, online tests are way worse than physical ones even if both are bad. \n\nAnd how does the automated grading work? Does it just target the correct answer or is it more nuanced? My huge issue with automated grading is that it seems to lack nuance and not target learning outcomes appropriately, especially for written reports and papers. \n\nI honestly think there should be online grading services out there (a huge business opportunity if you ask me) that universities can contract out to grade work with the guide of a professor's rubric or something because it is unsustainable to have physical grading for large class sizes. I just don't know whether or not to trust automated grading given that the process itself is subjective. I don't want to be at the whims of a faulty algorithm, thank you very much. \n\nI know you can cheat in-person, but come on, you are in a massive exam room filled with invigilators that strictly forbid any materials that are not a pen and a calculator and a book or whatever is required. You have to leave all other stuff in a locker. It's way harder to cheat in that scenario than having a completely unproctored online test where you could literally hire someone else to do the exam and no one would notice. That's a massive issue and that, alone, is why I can't see why online exams should replace physical ones. The only way to go about it is to set up large amounts of remote test centres throughout the country all installed with high-end computers with high quality internet and a strict proctoring device. But that would be way more expensive than the current method so why bother? Unless someone can create a cost-effective solution to this, I just can't see it happening, at least in institutions that give a damn about academic integrity.",

This may even be true.\n\nThese are businesses, so they must make a profit somehow. Payment comes in three versions:\n\n* Service is supported by advertising.

Departmental budgets are usually very tight, so only the most prestigious schools can afford this.\n* Service is free for the university and paid by the students. This is the most common. It's usually justified by saying \"Students already pay thousands, another $20 won't hurt them.\"\n\nThere is a fourth alternative, which is offering nothing at all.

This is why I am vehemently opposed to making college free. It will end up like healthcare in the US: colleges would have the power to raise costs without repercussions (something that is already happening), costing the government a huge amount of money. It literally does nothing to fix the problem and in fact, only exacerbates it by encouraging these institutions to expand for the ever rising number of students who opt for it. And besides, it's obvious that in the 21st century, we cannot rely on universities to provide education for the masses. There are too many conflicts of interests involved (professors want to research as opposed to teach). That fact alone should indicate that only people who actually want to go into research should go to college (duh). There needs to be HE alternatives that target the white collar job market that most college goers actually want to go into better. Degree-apprenticeships are a very good example of what I'm thinking of. Focus solely on teaching effectively on the job and in the classroom (connecting with the students) and rigorous assessment. Because that's all it needs. \n\nIt does turn it into some kind of apprenticeship program, but what's wrong with that? We'll all enter the job market at the end of the day and we may as well make it easier for young people to develop marketable skills that they like so that they earn a living rather than forcing them through something that's sometimes irrelevant to their aspirations. We don't need to be paying for fluff like high end sporting facilities or advanced research facilities. If you want them, you can always pay for them yourself! The pandemic has made it so apparent (without the \"college experience\") that college expansion is a vanity project and nothing else. It's so sad that our society puts college on such a pedestal that it's become a gatekeeper of competency when there can be so many cheaper ways to achieve that.\n\n Tldr: college is inefficient and does not serve the needs of the majority attending so set up cost effective alternatives that better suit their needs.",

While I now understand just how much work professors actually have (and also how extortionate and corrupt HE admin has become), I cannot take a course seriously if I don't have my homework/tests properly graded with good feedback. Assessment is king. \n\n This is the bare minimum in my book. Good teaching is only an extra, I want to know whether or not I actually understand the material and to what level of mastery. \n\nI don't want to sound cruel, but in the modern era, there are plenty of ways to get good teaching for a fraction of the cost. What should set a university level class apart is high quality assessment. That is what professors should primarily be spending teaching time doing: grading and assessment.",

The teacher puts in no effort, so I am not sure why I am paying tuition AND paying for pearson.  Also, I am sure some of those raise in grades ur seeing is because u can copy and paste the test questions into google, and the exact test question and answer will pop up.  I got an A on many tests because of this.\n\nI do think ur way of approaching it is pretty awesome tho.  You post the textbook and use the Pearson as a supplement.  I would be ok with that if the pearson is decent quality.  Howeever, I have to say that the best classes are always the ones in which the teacher makes all their own material.  Yes, its more work, but I actually feel like im getting what I paid for, and I also like that non-automated assignments allows for alternative answers that are also correct.  There is some leeway in how one can answer.  I have many times had to email the teacher because I lost points on pearson when my answer was correct.  I cite the exact page and direct quote from the book, and show why the Pearson counting my answer wrong was wrong.  I have gotten quite a few points back from doing this :p, although im sure some teachers thought I was annoying,.",

              "text": "I recently graduated and have been involved in teaching lately... While I don't necessarily approve of using these services, there are a few legitimate reasons professors choose to. Assuming you're talking about Wiley/Sapling/Cengage type of thing:\n\n1. These sites often have wide question banks that professors can use. They can randomise the questions individual students see without taking up too much of the professor's time doing it manually. They can also switch up details more easily (eg change numbers in questions, etc).\n\n2. These websites actually provide a way to give individualized feedback to students on each question which is virtually impossible otherwise in an intro class with 200 students. Some websites are less good at it then others (*cough* Wiley *cough*) but that's besides the point.\n\n3. LMS websites like Canvas, Brightspace, Blackboard, and others are incredibly finicky with material upload, and universities often change between them. This often results in errors and corruption of the professor's materials. It super sucks, and a good way to avoid that is to use these virtual textbook/HW services.\n\nTwo out of three of these reasons are saving professors time, while one out of three improves student learning. You may think this is lazy on behalf of the professors. I promise you that it's not. These issues are incredibly time consuming and it takes away from time the professor can use to actually do meaningful things for you that aren't hours and hours of mass grading.\n\nLook around your university's scholarship directory. It's usually not difficult to get refunds for all of these services if you save all your receipts (yay for receipt emails) and spend some half hour finding the application and filling it out.\n\nAs a side note, this isn't the only thing you're forced to pay for outside of normal tuition and fees. I had to pay an extra fee for each lab class I took because we were using expensive equipment. It doesn't show up in my uni fees until after add/drop period, but were warned about it in the syllabus. It's really not much different.",

                  "text": "I can understand charging for the expensive equipment to an extent. There really isnt a way for a student to gain access to that sort of stuff usually but in terms of the HW around half of my professors use canvas and the others use services such as these. I've had a professor grade a 20 page single space paper with several classes of 70+ people. If professors feel overwhelmed with the amount of homework they give maybe they should not give that much. Its college, some classes don't even have homework and its really up to the professor, I can appreciate the work but sometimes these people really dont do that much for the amount that we pay them.",
