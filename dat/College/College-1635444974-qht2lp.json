Tips you\u2019d now give yourself if you were entering college again? About time, homework, resources, life, budgeting, etc. Literally anything! \n\nI\u2019m also working a full time job M-F 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM. Weekends off.",

Utilize a planner and plan your weeks out. What assignments you\u2019ll do what day, what class you\u2019ll dedicate each day to etc. It\u2019ll keep you sane and let things from piling up so you don\u2019t spend three days awake without sleep bc you left everything for the last minute. It\u2019ll also let you have a social life/time to rest on the weekends if you keep yourself caught up during the week. Otherwise you will burn out fast.",

      "text": "General time management tip that people ask me as another full time student and worker is to use the time you\u2019re forced to be in class productively! So after you get the gist of how helpful your professors are lecturing, decide if that time is better spent doing assignments while sitting in that zoom call. For example, I have two 3 hour lectures on Monday and I don\u2019t tend to get \u201cmuch\u201d out of learning the content through my professors, so I usually just sit in class and finish easier assignments or start my study guides for exams. This is really helpful so that when crunch time starts for exams, you\u2019re not wasting time on completing busy work. My stress ends up to be a lot lower than it would be otherwise + it\u2019s a great way to keep your grade up in \u201ceasier\u201d courses so you have enough time to not bullshit assignments.",
