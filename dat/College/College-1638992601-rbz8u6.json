  "text": "This semester I am supposed to be graduating snd I can't. The passing grade in one class is a 70 and I have a 69.2 and I need .4 to push me over. My professor will not give me the .4 and I can't use the pass or fail. I recently got into grad school and I won't be able to go because of this problem. Now I have to stay another semester to take one single class where all I needed to pass is .4. There's nothing more I can do at this point. And at my school they do not offer any classes over the winter brake for my major. Any advice?",
