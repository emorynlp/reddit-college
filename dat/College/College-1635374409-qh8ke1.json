  "text": "Im just so sick of school and things just keep legnehting the time I am going to be in school. I was told to take a physics class at my community college and that i would get credit for it at mine, only to find out that my advisor lied to me and the course does not transfer over. Now im out of 500 bucks and will have to retake the class at community college because the class sucks ass at my college. I just want this to be over with. I have mo more motivation left in me. Im a 5th year senior and thought i would be done in spring, but now its looking like I have to wait until the fall. I just dont know what to do anymore.",

It's time to claim your diploma as proof of your successes and your failures- your ups and downs. Blood, sweat and tears were almost definitely put into it- cross the finish line and take your victory.",
