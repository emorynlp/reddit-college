  "text": "I\u2019m a hands on/mechanical type although I\u2019m not great at math.  I\u2019m not too much into nerdy stuff like CompSci but I do think graphic design would be interesting.  I believe any engineering program would be a bit too difficult for me.  I\u2019m not too interested in the medical field.  Any ideas of what I should study?  I do want a career that would make decent money at least.",
