      "text": "Well if you\u2019re goal is to get trashy people to sleep with who have a good chance of giving you something then my advice it to simply go out wearing your most comfortable but also slightly confident looking clothes/skin, drink enough, and watch out for people who just want free drinks and not actually hook up. Unless you\u2019re not trying to fuck, then best people are those wanting you to buy them a drink.\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019ve had really fun times going to bars WITH my intended hook up. Sometimes adding other friends can be beneficial too, ya know a wing man. Just makes sure they are helping and not making things worse. It\u2019s a fine line and they are on one side of the other most likely.\n\nGood luck",

Wingman would be nice although most of my friends also do what I\u2019m trying to do to an extent. \n\nI mean I don\u2019t want to get anything that would suck. I don\u2019t want to get anything period. And if I do that god punishing me perhaps lol.",

              "text": "Lol alright fair I mean if it\u2019s just random hookups at the bars you\u2019re after my advice is to be confident, be feeling yourself, looking your best whether that\u2019s shaving or something, and then committing.\n\nDon\u2019t ever question yourself, you are your own king! I mean question a lil bit don\u2019t be a psycho, but to a degree hookups are about feeling safe SO you can enjoy it right.",
