Yes, some profs are lenient but others aren\u2019t and you shouldn\u2019t make it a habit to ask for an extension.\n\nIf your mental health is getting in the way of your studies that much you need to reach out to disability services to get an accommodation.",

I lost my S/O of several years and had a prof take off 40 percent of a large assignment because I turned it in 2 days late even though I explained to him my situation before it was due. \n\nWe all struggle with motivation and mental health sometimes, but life has to continue and we have to figure out how to get shit done.

This could look different for everyone, but for me it means putting in the extra effort when days are good. Granted, I am an online student which does afford me some extra flexibility within the week. \n\nIt\u2019s not a professors fault if you do not study, and most don\u2019t care - the syllabus will often give you an idea of their opinion on the matter. Some teachers may offer compromise if you communicate ahead of time, some teachers have strict no late work policies unless there is a medical emergency or death of family. \n\nI\u2019ve encountered a lot of professors who have the attitude that if they do it for one student, they have to do it for everyone.\n\nWhen you sign up for college they essentially see it as you confirming that you\u2019re capable of the commitment.",

      "text": "It never hurts to ask. Some professors can be very accommodating about issues with mental health, especially around this time of the semester. However, he probably won't say yes, especially if you have a large class size and/or a lot of time to prepare for the test.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to be \"honest in a group.\" Find a few friends, or maybe just some random people in your class who also would like the test delayed. Get together and go to the professor's office hours as a group. The most important thing that you do here is DO NOT LIE. Do not say that you've been sick without a doctor's note, a family/friend died, or any other outlandish excuse. Most (good) professors understand the stress of day-to-day life and can understand a build up of stress that leads to mental health issues. With your group assembled, let him know that the \"class\" has been struggling with their mental health and they would most likely perform much better if they had a day to relax and not stress before the test.\n\nIf the professor feels that the entire class wants this, then you have better chances of him saying yes than if you just ask him out of self-interest.\n\nGood luck!",
