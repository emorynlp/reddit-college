  "text": "I spent like a good 6 hours studying for my Calc midterm with a friend. We went over all of the material the gave us and thought we had a good understanding of it. The test wasn't has hard as I thought, but afterwards I realized I goofed up some easy questions. I feel really stupid now and am having trouble keeping calm until I get my scores back because I really don't want to retake Calc.",

I'm never truly confident that I did well despite basically understanding the material enough and studying for hours. There's been times that I was right in my doubt and there's been times that I should have been more confident. It really is a gamble, no matter how hard you study, if you'll do well sometimes.",

The question asked where the divisor was in the problem, and my dumb-a chose the dividend. I feel so dumb because those are the easy questions that should be a no brainer.  I just hate that I missed out on easy points.\n\nJust try and brush it off, and stay confident.",
