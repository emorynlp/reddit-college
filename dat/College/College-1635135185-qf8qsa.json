  "title:": "How do I know if college is for me, how do I know dropping out is the best choice?",
  "text": "First things first I am a first generation college student so the pressure ls heavy, my father has worked his ass off physically for 18 years and I know that my only responsibility now is to study, he wants to work so I can study and get a better future but if I leave I feel like I would have failed him\n\nI have no clue what I want to be in life or Pursue and no interests, I know I want to make a lot of money to help my parents and live comfortably, I\u2019ve been pretty neutral this semester and not letting myself think negatively or whine but I\u2019m starting to crack, I go to a school where I might pay 40 k annually (after aid) and I have no idea abt aid or how and to use fafsa or how anything will be paid, I considered going to a cheaper college but I\u2019m scared I will regret it bc I\u2019m at a college that is \u201cwell known\u201d with \u201cunique classes\u201d\n\nI also have no clue abt anything college related, I didn\u2019t even know what mla format was or how to site, I still barley know, or how to address professors, I don\u2019t even know how I am supposed to write a 6 page paper with the skills of a high school sophomore \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being lazy or a quitter or do I really have a reason to drop out, should I just suck it up like every college student? I overthink alot and have so many questions abt myself and what mentality is really mine, do I actually care abt being on prepared with  my readings or do I want to go with the flow, \nAlso Almost all of these problems are my fault and I assume that, I know I should\u2019ve researched more before picking a college and I should\u2019ve learned more abt college and money \nI just picked the private college I got into bc it seemed cool, really shows how stupid I am",

      "text": "In my personal opinion, if you are already in college, there is no harm in finishing it! Use these first couple of semesters to explore: go shadow doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. whoever you think you might be interested in becoming! That way, you can pick a major your truly passionate about. And worst comes to worst, if you don\u2019t love it, you can still do something that you could\u2019ve done if you dropped out now. Basically look at it this way: you drop out now and have pretty limited options in what you can do, or you finish your degree and do whatever you want after, but if anything you still have a degree to fall back on!",

      "text": "Use the school resources as much as possible, how to manage workload, free tutoring, don't feel discourage if you got a bad grade. Believe it or not a competent institution is designed to challenge you and pass. \nLastly you don't know jack shit, I'm saying this in the most positive way. Stop burdening yourself on things that haven't happen. Just work hard on something you like.",
