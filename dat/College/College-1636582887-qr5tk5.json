  "text": "Hello! I'm about to start tutoring for the first time and I need advice. A bit of background: I'm going to tutor a dyslexic high school student with a life threatening condition. He can't go to school in person so his teacher send him powerpoints and questions to answer, but it's really hard for him to learn online because of his dyslexia. His mom is going to get me his textbook and powerpoints to look over. What are some fun and effective ways to teach him and keep him engaged? How often should I give him breaks? What are good age appropriate rewards for doing his work? Do you all have any general advice about tutoring? Anything will help! Tysm!",

      "text": "You could try to reach out to your school's tutoring center. I was a TA for a few semesters and they actually gave me a little bit of \"training.\" What I found helped me when giving assistance was referring students to other sources for help. It was a science class I did so I would refer students to khan academy and other youtube videos often. I would also try to have as much work be done by the student as possible. For example, I'd do 1 example with the student and then have them go through one until they were able to do them on their own.",
