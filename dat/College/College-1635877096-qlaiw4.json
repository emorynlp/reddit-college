  "text": "So while I was studying for my Calc II test a few hours before we take it in class, I get an announcement from our professor on our canvas page that he posted a pdf of our exam.  In a state of confusion and shock, I didn't know whether or not if this was real. I quickly checked our class group chat wondering if this might be the actual exam we will be taking in a few hours.  After a minute, the professor's post was quickly deleted without any further announcements making me think it was the actual exam that my not tech-savvy professor accidentally posted.  Can the students get in trouble for exploiting our professor's mistake?",
