  "title:": "How long to study for finals?",
  "text": "I'm a freshman and have never taken a final before. I have 2 next week on Tuesday but haven't really started studying yet. I have the entire weekend and Monday to study, and I hear people start around 3 days before.  Should I just begin studying on the weekend? \n\nI have a bunch of projects and assignments due this week, and I'm struggling to even start before the weekend. If you're wondering, the finals are intro to CS and chemistry.\n\nI'm doing pretty well in chem, but I pretty much forgot a lot of the concepts. Should I go back and memorize them again, or should I just skim/quickly review the concept?",

      "text": "My finals are tomorrow and I started studying an hour ago. Do not recommend. Although, I graduate Friday and my grades will remain the same unless I either do not take my finals, dropping them, or if I get a perfect 100 and then I\u2019ll get an A in the classes. I\u2019m sitting at b+ \u2018s and I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m honestly just ready to be done. But in reality, start studying now. A couple hours a day is better than binging in the days before.",
