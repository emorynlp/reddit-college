  "text": "This is my first semester in college, I couldn't do most of the assignments cause I have been working at my job or just forgetting to do it, but I have been doing all of the quizzes and tests. I feel like a failure and blame myself cause now that I know what I'm doing is wrong, I wish I cared sooner. Is there a way to retake the class that I failed, or do I need to talk to someone about it?",
