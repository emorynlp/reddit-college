      "text": "If you like writing and have some engineering background, have you considered professional (also referred to as technical) writing/communication or whatever variation your school has? I\u2019m a Biochem and professional writing double major who specifically focuses on scientific and medical writing in my English classes. It really helps to have the background (in terms of making the writing easier and also making you more attractive to employers) and there\u2019s plenty of relevant industries looking for people to write for them. I personally love it. Stem is my day job but technical communication is the kind of English I personally like.",

      "text": "Journalism major here! Journalism is a field that you absolutely do not need to major in if you're looking to go into the field, although there's nothing wrong with majoring in it as well. If your school doesn't have a journalism major, any other writing-intensive major will help (English, History, Sociology, Psychology, Advertising . . . ) Additionally, what type of journalism are you interested in? If you're interested in business reporting, major/minor in business so you can know what you're writing about (as well as expand your opportunities beyond journalism). If your school has a student newspaper, I highly recommend joining the staff. You learn infinitely more through experience than you do in a journalism classroom, although some classes will help boost your range of skills and it'll provide you with a wide network of people with similar interests - plus newspaper kids know how to party.",
