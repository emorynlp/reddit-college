  "text": "Currently a sophomore and go to a top public school and my parents are footing the entire bill (tuition, room/board etc). I come from an immigrant family and we are upper middle class (couldn't get any aid). I've had this lingering feeling of guilt ever since college started and it has especially been exacerbated recently since one of my parents is a medical worker and working long hours bc of the pandemic. There's not a day that goes by where I don't think of the sacrifices they are making to give me a good education.\n\nI asked how I can \"repay\" them and they said through \"putting in hard work and trying my best\". I think I've been pretty successful in college so far (high GPA, got a pretty good finance internship lined up etc.) but I still feel like what I'm doing isn't \"enough\". I hope to pay them back one day but they said they wont take any of my money (you know how immigrant parents are lol)\n\nJust wondering how to deal with this burden and guilt and if anyone else is in a similar position to mine.",

      "text": "My parents did something called Florida Pre-paid, which I'm sure other states have but for anyone who doesn't know, you can basically start a plan for your child as early as when they are born, you lock in a price to pay each month based on the plan you pick and their age you start at. You can choose plans as minimal as  \"2 year degree, not including housing\" and then I think they have tiers all the way up to something like \"6-8 year degree including books and housing\". Basically as long as you go to a Public Florida college and start when your child is young, they will have most of tuition covered and then maybe books or housing if you choose. May parents picked on that covers tuition for about 4 years.... and I feel guilty about this ALL THE TIME. \n\nAs another comment mentioned below, it has made me VERY stubborn about trying to work as much as possible to be as independent as possible.\n\n Interestingly enough though, my parents have always made it a point to let me know that they simply wanted better for me and that they just hope by doing so I can give an even better life to my children and most of the guilt actually stems from other classmates and coworkers....\n\nTo give some back story, my mother is from the Philippines, where the American way of kicking a child out at 18 is seen as kind of cruel. It is customary to support children throughout their education.  My father is American, and since she was able to save so much from being supported through college, she actually paid off my father's student loans before they got married. The whole student loan experience of my father's only added to their point of wanting me to NEVER have to get sucked into that hole. And knowing this growing up kind of mellowed the usual stems of guilt.\n\nUNTIL, I actually graduated high school and started college and started working more consistently. Classmates, coworkers, and friends from high school alike all had something to say about my college being paid for in the sense of \"must be nice for mommy and daddy to pay for school.\" As if I was some spoiled unappreciative rich kid.... when in reality I was working a lot to try and save and be independent and growing up, while mostly a comfortable middle class, we were not luxurious in any sense.\n\n It was after I had a conversation with a now EX friend that I realized that i shouldn't let others make me feel so guilty about this (even if I can't help still feeling it a little bit) She was on this whole rampage of \"I have to get financial aid, my parents came to this country with nothing, I'm not lucky like YOU\"... meanwhile I had known her since middle school and  her and her parents drove nice cars, had the latest iPhones, always shopped at the mall, wore name brand clothes and jewelry, went on trips every year, etc. Etc. Well... growing up my family shopped at places like Ross and TJ maxx, spent weekends couponing, and didn't travel much. I had a flip phone when all my friends had iPhones, and never wore brand names like them. So while her family found importance in wearing name brands and having the latest iPhone, my parents were taking the money they saved on not indulging us in those things and paying for that college plan. \n\nWhich honestly, to each their own, but if YOU are gonna come for ME with my off brand shoes and Android complaining about how you're so poor while holding your new iPhone, with your Tiffany rings and Tory Burch flip flops, you can kindly f** off. \n\nSo now I just make peace with the fact that my parents taught me to have my priorities straight. I can worry about being guilty, or I can focus my energy in being so grateful and making sure that I make them proud so that I can give my children even more..\n\nAnd yes, I realize that there are many out there who had neither luxury of nice things or college tuition, but in the area I live in, most of the bitter backlash was coming from individuals who are more privileged than they admit and it is obvious when they just prioritize different things.",

They chose to create you, with that comes the responsibility to help you get ready for adult life, including paying for your education, driver's license, etc. Once you are self-sufficient it's up to you to make the best of it, but until then they owe it to you. That doesn't mean you can disrespect them and of course you can be grateful that you have parents who believe this because there are plenty who do not. Still, they decided to have you and you didn't ask for it, the least they can do is help you be prepared for it. \n\nIn my opinion parents are responsible for their child until the child is ready to face the world. You can't do that with just a highschool education.",

You're there for an education. \n- take advantage of internships. If your parents are paying your living expenses, you can maybe take a lower paid internship to get your foot in the door over bartending. \n- go to class! When you're away from home and you don't have a job, sometimes you skip class. You miss out on relationships with your professors who can help you out later.",

I have my moments where I feel guilty, but I know that their dream was for their children to get a college education so they don\u2019t mind paying for it. Also, I helped them out some by applying for scholarships before on top of my merit aid (I got no financial aid either), making it less of a burden on their end. \n\nI agree with many of the other comments saying that it\u2019s an investment. I\u2019ve had a pretty easy run academically in college, and I also have a good GPA, and it makes them really happy. You\u2019re doing exactly what you should be doing!\n\nPS: The field I\u2019m going into has a lot of well paying jobs, so my dad jokes I can buy him a Porsche and that will repay him for my education.

In regards to your parents, they likely just want you to be in a better place than they were at your age. If you can achieve that, them paying for college will have been worth it in their eyes, and it sounds like you are on your way to achieving that with an internship and good GPA. Don't worry too much about paying them back or anything, just succeed in school and live the best life you can. When they retire and you have a career, then you can worry about taking care of them(again, assuming they don't end up needing help before then.)",

They\u2019re also immigrant parents and are upper middle class now, though middle class when I was growing up. They wanted me to go to graduate school in a field I disliked, so I left after a year of grad school, so the bulk of my guilt is mainly with the $95k that was spent for tuition, room, and board that was completely wasted. Even though I did well my undergraduate career, I feel like dropping out of a graduate program overwrites all of that. Now I\u2019m taking prerequisite courses and planning on applying to an accelerated 1-1.5 year nursing program (another $20k). I plan on paying them back for all of it, but I don\u2019t have as much time to do so since my parents are older (in their 67 and 70). I feel a little better that despite my failed grad career, my parents have plenty saved for retirement so even if I didn\u2019t exist and this was all just a bad investment they still have plenty. Plus my siblings (12 years older than me) are doing well now and also plan on paying back my parents for college - unsure if they have already. I will probably need another 6-10 years to be able to pay back the entire amount and one day, if I still have enough time to save up the amount required, I also want to buy them another rental property so they have extra income going well into their 80s. \n\nThere\u2019s definitely ways to pay your parents back if you absolutely want to (I definitely will for minimum the 95k wasted, probably for my entire college) by spending time with them, caring for them, giving them money for emergency medical expenses or retirement, buying them a house. You can also be appreciative and just do really well in your life and tell them about it. I\u2019m still not sure my way is the best way, and maybe they won\u2019t even want me to pay them back or won\u2019t accept my money. But I\u2019m still going to be thinking about it and if they won\u2019t accept my money upfront at least I\u2019ll buy them a house.",

When I was a child we were poor to the point he would send mom away to her mom\u2019s house because they couldn\u2019t pay the bills and the house would be too cold, and he didn\u2019t want me going through that. He just called me the other day, drunk, talking about how he is sorry he couldn\u2019t get me the toys i wanted so much when I was a toddler, and how awful he felt because of that, and that he\u2019s trying everything he can so he can make me live under the best conditions he can provide. He says I am his motivation to work. \n\nPoint is, parents want whats best for their children. They don\u2019t want their children to suffer, or be stressed, or any of that. Especially if they were poor at some point, that\u2019s what they work so hard for, so we don\u2019t experience the same difficulties. I know me going to Uni makes him so so proud, he boasts about it to his friends. I don\u2019t feel guilty because I know he is happy. He is happy that I am getting this education, and every time i tell him a mid term or a final went well I can hear the joy and how proud he is through his voice over the phone.",

Were quite poor growing up, luckily enough to get $50k+ in need-based aid per year. At the start of college she tried sending me a few hundred $ a month to pay for other expenses (despite multiple injuries forcing her into medical retirement), but I figured out ways to make do without (e.g. not buying any textbooks or a computer and instead using library resources, working out a \u2018deal\u2019 with dining hall employees whereby I\u2019d say hello to them and they\u2019d give me lots of free food, taking advantage of free marginal entertainment supplied by clubs, learning how to hitchhike, etc.). She refused to stop sending me money so I had to close my bank account an open a new one to which she lacked access. Was a bit mad at first but eventually came around, and later on I managed to snag several more scholarships and save enough money to smooth over future financial bumps (e.g. starting grad school I still had ~$15k saved after working a dig in France and bumming around Southern Europe, which helped when it turned out my first paycheck wouldn't come until a month and a half in). Also used some of that to e.g. send her and her boyfriend to an all-inclusive resort for a week, and otherwise try pay back long-standing debts through other fancier gifts, when possible. It's still not entirely clear what my long-term financial trajectory will be like, but hopefully if my wife and I ever start making the really big bucks we can ensure that my mum (& grandparents, etc.) is well taken care of lol.",

My husband grew up overseas, his father worked in gas stations and did odd jobs just to get his kids the opportunity to go to high school and college in the states. Didn't have enough money to pay for their kids' college, but just getting them here was a big sacrifice. \n\nAs parents, and having the \"background\" that I/we do, It sounds like they're proud of you, and I can tell you they feel like they \"got their money's worth\" just by your being successful in college. \n\nYou'll \"pay them back\" by being a good person, and by giving them your time when they need it (and when you can spare it - I'm not trying to suggest that you're their slave now) later in life, especially when they get older. \n\nBasically, they don't want your money, and barring really hard times, they'll never want your money. They want your happiness and your success, and they want you to be someone that they're proud of. \n\nGuilt is normal though, I think, just try to block it out? Sorry... \n\nSo here's my guilt story: I'm an older student, with kids, and my husband is the one paying my tuition (and for the kids school.) Meanwhile, I'm studying, so I don't really have time for taking care of the house and kids like I used to. Yeah, I feel guilty, when my 3 year old wants me to see what he drew and tell an elaborate stoy about it, but I'm studying for a test that I have to take in about 30 minutes. Or, when the tuition bill comes and we have to figure out how to cut expenses to avoid having to borrow money from people to pay it, Or even just when classmates talk about how they have work on a certain day, but I don't have or even need a job. \n\nI approach it the same way I learned how to deal with failing an exam. Essentially, accept it, and move on. \n\nJust some backstory: I'm otherwise a straight A student, but engineering classes have started to \"put me in my place\" with exam scores or 30-40% here and there and class averages of 60%.",

Luckily in these sorts of situations parents usually want the best for you, we\u2019re both extremely lucky that our parents are able to basically provide an education for us. Truly the best thing you can do is do your best in college and respect your parents wishes as long as you live under their roof.

But don't let it distract you from studying and relaxing.\n\nSee, consider your education and life an investment by your parents so that you can have pursue your passion and have a better life then them. You do exactly that. \n\nAnd in return, be there for your parents when they need you, take care of them after retirement, provide them with a better life then they have currently, etc. \n\nAnother thing which you can do is keep a list of all the wishes, goals, things, etc, your parents wanted to do or buy but couldn't because of financial reasons. Once you have enough money, start making their dreams come true.\n\nLike, suppose they wanted to go to Hawaii but couldn't because of money, then buy tickets for hawaii for their birthday or anniversary gift. Make them happy. \n\nYou can also look for scholarships and get one to ease some of the burden, but I won't suggest a part time job. Keep your focus on your studies, mental and physical health. Score the best and land at a high paying job. Do whatever you want for your parents only then. \n\nI'll tell you about a friend of mine who overthought about this issue. \nI once knew a girl who felt so guilty that she withdrew from mess service provided by college and instead started eating only two times a day and ate cheap junk food, so that she can \"save\" some of the money her parents are spending on them despite having medical issues such as chronic headache and tonsilitis. Shortly, she grew weak, lost weight and couldn't even study properly but she kept going on and got the lowest possible marks in her entire college life. She didn't even tell her parents about this. I tried making her talk to a therapist but she kept declining. She got super depressed after that.\nNo parent would want this for their child. Poor girl. \n\nDO NOT BE THAT GIRL, DON'T THINK YOURSELF TO DEATH ABOUT THIS ISSUE.",

Why else would they have one? It makes me sad that there are some bad parents that throw their kids away. \n\nI am paying for all of my university solo, but my family still sacrifices for me in other helpful ways. \n\nThe way I dont feel guilt is by vowing to somehow return the favor to someone else one day.

I know she just doesn't wanna see me blow through all my savings I've been given but, man is it a depressing guilt trip. \"Would my dad/mom approve of how I'm spending this money, or living my life?\" \n\nI'd say, once it's been given to you, you shouldn't feel guilty on how you spend/use it. If they give you money for college, just enjoy the opportunity you have that many others don't. Make the most of it. \n\n(btw, wouldn't say this to her face, but sis.

And it weighed heavy on me especially when I was struggling with some of my engineering classes, I remember getting bad grades on an exam made me think I was such a waste of resources and the money could have been helping my family with other things.\n\nI suffered alone at the time because I didn't want to be more of a burden. Years later after I graduated and my mother was sharing pictures of my graduation with a friend of hers and she had a beaming smile while talking about them sending me to get my education.\n\nAfter the friend left, I told my mother how I was struggling at the time and of the guilt I felt about them spending all the money on me. I was speaking fast and was avoiding eye contact since mental feelings and such isn't really a thing you talk about because of the negative connotation that comes with. When I finally looked up to see her reaction, I just saw tears running down her cheeks which kind of freaked me out a little (my mother is very strong woman). She just hugged me and said she didn't know I struggled in that way with it, and she said that me getting an education and doing better in life than they did is the dream of all parents.\n\nI then told her that it was so much money at the time, she said yes but it was one of the best investments they made in providing us kids with an education. She then told me I would understand when I have kids of my own. Then she hit me in the feels when she said that the fact that I cared that much about them and their time and money, means the combination of parenting and education had created a good thoughtful person. Then being my mother and realizing I was tearing up, she started teasing about when I will give her grandchildren.\n\nI teared about a little now thinking about all of that. My baby daughter is in her crib a few feet away from me, and now I understand what my mother is talking about. I make good money and would be totally okay living in a van by the river if it meant giving all my money and resources to help my daughter do better in life.\n\nSo, the best thing you can do is keep doing well in school and improving your life, because the joy you give them from that is immense even if you don't realize it.",

I feel guilty that my parents have sunk so much money into my education, health and well-being that it\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m *very* stubborn about being independent and paying for what I can. I asked my mom how I should pay them back and she just says that when I get my degree and have a decent enough job where I can afford to travel like I want to someday, I should take her along on my trips. My dad says that I should just remember to visit and call every other day to update them on my life.\n\nParents just want to see their kids happy and successful. Just helping out wherever you can and showing a little gratitude for all they do for you is enough. When you get your degree and find a job, talk it up to your parents and tell them all about it, and thank them for helping you get this far. They\u2019ll be happy that you\u2019re happy",

I looked for a part time job so I can cover my own living and food expenses while they only covered solely my tuition, or I would feel even worse. Now that I am graduated, I still do feel bad because I do not have a job currently and am living under their roof. I cook for them and clean for them because I felt bad for being out of the house for so long and having nothing to repay them. I know they worry about my job and future so if I were to go back, I wished I tried even harder in school than worrying about financial issues. I kept worrying that my parents are stressing over my tuition and I felt horrible so i would work many hours of my part time job along with school and barely eat because I needed the money to pay rent. \nYou can repay them back in the future. Our parents #1 thing that breaks them is seeing their own children struggle. Your worries are normal and maybe one day you guys can sit down and talk about them. For now, I would invest your time in school and that internship lined up! Make your parents proud with your achievements.",

They said the deal was that they'll keep paying so long as I actually stick to my degree and don't drop out again (which I did the first time due to a massive mental breakdown and the second time to help out the family when my older sister was unfortunately diagnosed with cancer). \n\nOne of the things mom told me recently is that it'll all be worth it when they see me finally walking to get my degree and they can show off to their friends that both their kids are college educated (something both of them value very much because they grew up in communist Cuba and my dad had to drop out at 14 to help feed his family). It'll all be worth it in the long run, dear, and I think the best way to say thank you is not only by keeping up your grades and doing the best you can, is by taking care of yourself and make sure you're doing okay and if you'd like, do little things here and there around the house for them. They only want the best for you and anything you can do/contribute will be much appreciated.",

My advice, take the gift and give back love and whatever else your parents value.  Our student has said and written us some pretty awesome things during their college experience.  Parenting is a really weird, emotional and unexplainable journey.  Sometimes we make choices that don\u2019t make sense from a logical standpoint but make sense from the heart.",
