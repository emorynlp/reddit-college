  "text": "Don't ever think you're too old to complete college!  I just turned in my last assignment and will be graduating Magna cum laude with my Aeronautics degree at 39.  It took me 14 years and 7 months through various deployments, family trauma, several moves, years traveling for work, and a whole LOT of procrastination.  I finally got my act together and got it done.  Hang in there guys and gals, the finish line will be there soon for all of you!\n\nI'm outta here!\n\n\\-PTT",

It's 100% a me thing and I'm my own worst enemy at the VA. I don't do well in trauma docused programs. That said, I have had good therapists. I have a few friends that love theirs. I'm female so they only let me see women with a certain kind of training. Those don't go as well. My all time best counselor inside the system was at a Vet Center. She didn't tolerate my BS and was a fantastic advocate and good listener. The group stuff was kind of cool but it wasn't my jam. I am currently trying something different through the pain management clinic. They offer counseling and group programs as well, and they focus on a lot of alt therapies that reduce physical symptoms of PTSD. Chiro, massage, acupuncture, yoga, etc. I got booted from one group but my doctor is amazeballs. He went to bat for me and got me started on stellate ganglion blocks and I'm using a civilian counselor that practices motivational interview and goal setting. Like all things government, it's not perfect, but there's a lot of resources and good people that want to do good, despite the policies. If you're unsure, I would start with the Vet Center and ask for help transitioning into the VA. They may be able to point you at a good fit provider after getting to know you and suggest programs that would work.",
