  "text": "Thinking about my future stresses me out, one of my fears is job security or a job that I hate. Now that I think about it, I want to incorporate working in the gaming or tech industry with my business degree rather than working at some boring firm signing my life away. Are there any good careers to go into or intern for that is in that industry or any advice/experience from others.
