  "title:": "Is it really worth it to do a 4 year degree?",
  "text": "I'm currently looking at going back to college after dropping out 2 years ago but I'm a little worried. Right now I'm thinking of doing a 2 year business degree online which is available on my old college's world campus. I'm mainly looking at the 2 year online thing because I am the worst student ever and would hardly ever get up to drive to class (I used to commute), but recently my college has made a 4 year business degree available online. I'm really split between the 2 and 4 year because I know I'm a bad student and should probably just get things done and out of the way quick to get an actual life started but also I'm sure my career prospects would look much better with the 4 year. Drop your opinions/advice down below, Id really appreciate it.",

      "text": "Definitely worth it if you really want to go into business. Business majors are some of the most common and so if you only have an associates you'll get beat out for positions every time. I'm not sure if their positions you could try working your way up from that don't require a degree but if there are you should definitely go with a four-year degree.",
