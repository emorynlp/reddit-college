  "title:": "Why do most colleges have strict rules/issues with parking?",
  "text": "Even though faculty, commuters, and residential students all need places to park, I sometimes wonder why colleges don't focus more on making sure that there's enough parking lots/spaces for everyone, including overnight guests and visitors (not affiliated with the university).\n\nFor example, I think overnight guests and visitors should be able to park anywhere on campus during the weekends (with a parking permit including a phone number) since professors and commuters are usually at home during the weekends.\n\nThis would also apply to off campus parking as well, depending on how many parking spots are available at each apartment complex.\n\nHowever, this proposal would go into effect Friday evening until Sunday evening, so that no problems would occur.\n\nCampus security would also drive though each parking lot Sunday evening to see what cars are affiliated with the university or not, which is why a phone number is required with the permit to give them a reminder to move their vehicle or risk getting ticketed/towed.",

      "text": "If your college has a large body then there is a constant battle for spots between students. Its difficult to just build more parking lots since those require land and depending on the location, this could be extremely expensive to obtain. With your plan it would take a lot of enforcement to make sure everyones following the rules in order to work",
