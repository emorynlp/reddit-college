  "text": "So im a history major and in my senior year. I will be graduating in the fall of next year tho. \n\nSo far I haven't failed none of my classes and my gpa is solid. (3.0). But im currently taking European history with a professor that im not a fan of. Throughout the semester we've had 2 exams, 1 paper. First Exam I got a C...1st paper I got a C...Midterm exam I completely bombed it. Atm I have to do a paper worth 125 points which im still reading the book for it and im already not feeling too good about it. \n\nIve thought about getting a Credit or No Credit grade so it won't effect my gpa but im worried that it will look bad on my transcript. My college sent us an email last week that they will allow us to this up until the week of finals which is in 2 weeks.",
