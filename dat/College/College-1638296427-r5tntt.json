  "text": "I'm in my third year of study for a BS in physics. I graduate May 2023. My grades are pretty decent and I mostly enjoy what I'm going to school for. However, I still don't know what I'm trying to do with my life after I get my degree. I have multiple general ideas, but they're all just that, general. \n\nI know I've got time but it always feels like time is running out to figure myself out before I'm just off in the world. Any advice?",
