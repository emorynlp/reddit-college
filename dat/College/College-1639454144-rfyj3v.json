  "title:": "I can\u2019t help but feel I\u2019m a failure to my parents. Any advice would be helpful.",
  "text": "Tldr: my parents worked really hard to try and set me up to go to a top school in the country (eg Ivies, MIT, Caltech, Stanford, etc) and I only ended up going to the basic state school. Title explains the rest.\n\nThrowaway account here. When ive voiced these feeling in person I\u2019m often told I\u2019m elitist, vain, conceited, etc. and I\u2019m sorry if it comes across that way but I really don\u2019t mean to be - I\u2019m genuinely typing this up while crying because ive been upset about this for the past 3 years.\n\n3 years ago when I was applying to colleges, I applied to roughly 13 different schools for engineering, with my state school being my safety/last choice. I got rejected from every school except that state school, and ended up going there. My parents had put in a lot of effort to push me to go to any one of those other 12 schools, and they really expected me to get in (1500+ sat, 750+ on the subject tests, 4.2 gpa, you get the idea). My father definitely took the news better than my mother, who said I was a failure that disappointed her by not working hard enough. Frankly I agree, I do feel like a failure who took her hard work for granted.\nFast forward to today (end of first semester of my junior year) where she just heard that my cousin who she considers an \u201cidiot\u201d (barely broke a 1300, smokes weed, spent the last few years trying to make it as a SoundCloud rapper with no success) just got into an Ivy for Environmental Science. Naturally she calls me up upset, complains about my cousin, tells me I\u2019m stupid for going to this school, and that im a failure. Not wanting to hear it I say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I go to a shitty school mom, and I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a disappointment\u201d, then tell her I\u2019m busy and politely hang up. I then start to cry because I do feel like a failure and I know I\u2019ve disappointed her, and I hate this stupid school that everyone from my high school went to and no matter how well it does rankings wise or whatnot, I still feel like I\u2019ll always be embarrassed of it.\n\nAny advice? I\u2019m so tired of being a student here, and I already tried to transfer out - no success. I don\u2019t plan to go to my graduation in a year and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever not feel ashamed of going to this school. I already know I\u2019ll never hang my diploma up because I feel like in the eyes of everyone who matters to me, I might as well wipe my ass with it so it\u2019ll at least be useful for something.\nAnd no, please don\u2019t say something like \u201coh well ur moms a bitch lol\u201d, I love my mother and I do feel she only wants better for me. I\u2019m just so sad that I\u2019m incapable of not disappointing her. My father tries to be supportive but I know I made him sad too. The difference is that he\u2019s said he feels they both failed me as parents because I didn\u2019t go somewhere better. I\u2019m honestly super happy for my cousin and don\u2019t feel any bitterness towards him, I just wish in my parents eyes I wasn\u2019t a failure and a disappointment.",

After your first job, once you have the work experience, where your degree is from doesn't matter except in some relatively niche fields. All that matters is that you have one and that you can do that job.",

              "text": "That's what I figured.  It always struck me as strange that counter to what one might think, it's usually the immigrant moms who take it harder than the immigrant dads when the child doesn't have a fancy job/alma mater, marries outside the culture, etc.\n\nIn any case, I know this is rough, but once you graduate and start building your life, the whole parental pissing contest with aunties/uncles is going to become less and less relevant.  Good luck finishing the semester!",

At the end of the day it doesn't matter what school you went to, it's the connections and opportunities you gained along the way to help you in the future. Best if luck, keep you head up.",

      "text": "MIT, Ivy Leagues, etc. are lotteries. These colleges get too many applicants to seriously review all of them. Seriously the proof is right there, your cousin with worse grades was admitted when you weren\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m of the opinion that it doesn\u2019t make much difference whether you get into a top-level college or any other decent college, except for your resume. Unless your state school is actually bad i don\u2019t think your education is much different. If you go to grad school, your grad university is much more significant.\n\nWhat do you want to do in life? What were you planning to do when you got into an Ivy League? That\u2019s what\u2019s important.",

Go to your graduation and don't let anyone, including yourself, ruin a memorable experience. Good luck op and please remember to take care of your mental health!",
