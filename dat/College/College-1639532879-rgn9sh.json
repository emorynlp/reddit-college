  "text": "I am a 20 year old student. I am still living with my parents and i am going for my associates of health sciences. I recently got promoted to work as a PA (shift manager) at Amazon Wed-Sat 8:30pm-7am. Work itself is fun and the pay is decent for my age but I hate having to work during the weekend (Friday & Saturday) i wanna go out and party like every other kid my age but im stuck at work. I was promised that I would get put back in days no later then February in my offer but i think they just said that to convince me to accept the offer. I dont need so much money, but I certainly enjoy the money, but i also wanna be able to go out during the weekends with friends. I dont know what to do help please. Some days i want to quit and just find a part time job and party like normal kids. Other days i want to work and save up my money.",

I missed a lot of fun things, but I ended up with enough cash in my bank account to last me several years (living at home), a paid off car, and an excellent resume. The job will get you further in life as long as you don\u2019t burn yourself out.",
