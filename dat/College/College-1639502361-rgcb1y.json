  "text": "Graduated high school in the pandemic, instantly entered community college to transfer to a 4 year. Great first semester, but the past two have been rough and I failed a few classes that I plan on retaking to fix my gpa and everything. Doing better mentally now but I am on academic probation, so there\u2019s a bit of pressure now. Anyone ever experienced something like this and if so what was your story?",

      "text": "Yes I was on academic probation and got honor roll the next semester. Most of it was out of anger toward the assistant dean that handled the probation meeting. She was condescending with her emails. I replied back with the honor roll attached and nothing else once I had that.\n\nThe best solution is to want it really bad. Rage is good fuel but you can't just expect to have something to cause rage. Finding something you want that requires good grades, like an internship, is something you can do today.",

      "text": "Yeah, I had a rough mental health semester a few years back. I was homeless and dealing with that on top of school was near impossible. But I got help from the school to find stable housing and the next semester I only took 6 credits and got A's in both which got me off probation. My first semester I got a 0.8 GPA and I graduated from the community college on the Dean's list. You really gotta dig deep to find your why for staying in college and getting your degree, and being able to ask for help from tutors or anyone else as needed is important.",

      "text": "I'm oldish now, but I had a really rough time in undergrad due to undiagnosed ADHD plus some mental health issues. And it took 10 years.\n\nI was a 4.0 student in high school, but almost immediately started struggling to attend and do work for general ed courses. This eventually filtered to all courses. I failed their entirety of my second year. I was permanently dismissed from that university. I attended three others, one of which I was suspended from for completely failing a semester, but I ended up going back there a year later on academic probation and pulled off a flawless performance that term. I graduated with honors and went to grad school.\n\nYou can bounce back. It's just really hard sometimes.",
