I look back on it and am both proud and shocked that I stayed alive.\nAfter I stepped back and re-evaluated things and took time to care for myself, it's gotten better, or at least more manageable. I know things are hard, and they will probably never be perfect, but I hope everyone finds one reason, no matter how small, to push on for one more day.

      "text": "Not yet. I was pretty excited going in and I\u2019m still pretty stoked to be here. Course there have been hard times, but that isn\u2019t my focus.\n\nIt\u2019s all in your mind, man. You are lucky, you are special, you are blessed. Find out how to realize that.\n\nMaybe try some psychedelic drugs. Not casually, but look into it because they have some serious potential for curing/treating depression. \n\nI had a lot of social anxiety up until a few months ago. I still have a bit, but holy cow it\u2019s like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. DMT taught me how to handle it. It has taught me a lot more, too. Let me rephrase that- DMT allowed me to teach myself what I needed to learn. \n\nIt\u2019s all your perspective. See, if you need to go to school to get a job to grind a 9-5 and then die, of course you will be depressed, that\u2019s an incredibly depressive outlook. If instead you have an opportunity to gain knowledge and wisdom, surround yourself with like-minded people, learn how to make friends and talk to people and have conversations and just generally be more social, while doing things you love like biking, snowboarding, rock climbing- and you\u2019re actually here doing it, it isn\u2019t some sort of fantasy, and it\u2019s going to lead you to a wealthy future... well hot damn, you are probably one of the top 10% luckiest people on the planet right now. Perspective is everything.\n\nIf you\u2019re miserable in college, why tf are you doing it? Life isn\u2019t about being happy in 20 years, life is about enjoying the eternal moment we exist in. That moment has no past or future, it is only, always, now. There will never be a point where you will be fulfilled and satisfied completely. You will die worn and incomplete. Accept this, and move on. Not telling you to quit college, telling you to seriously question why you\u2019re here. Because you want money? Well why do you want money? To be secure and comfortable? Why do you want that? Just keep questioning until you know that you are where you should be.\n\nI might get some flack for this- but fuck hope. Hope is one of the emptiest feelings, it is less than worthless. Quit hoping that you\u2019ll get better and make it happen. If you keep hoping, you\u2019re subscribing to the notion that things will just fix themselves by some stroke of luck. Do you really want to rely on luck? you don\u2019t need to squander hope, but definitely don\u2019t rely on it. \n\nAccept the fact that you will be depressed until you change that. Nobody else can do it for you. I\u2019m not telling you to go find a therapist or medicate to try to fix yourself, I am telling you to accept yourself as you are. Think of it like an addiction. You can hope that eventually it will go away, but it won\u2019t until you change things yourself. Much like addiction, emotions are cyclic. If you\u2019re feeling negative, it is a lot easier for you to perceive things negatively, which will lead to more negative feelings. Compound your happiness and love, not your depression.\n\nQuit struggling. Stop the resistance. You are rhythmic, use that to your advantage. We are creatures of routine, create positive routines for yourself that emphasize self-compassion and cessation of struggle. Do things that make you feel good, and then you will want to do more things that make you feel good. Start somewhere small and easy, work your way up. \n\nYou are not a human trying. You are not a human doing. You are a human BEING. Just be. The rest, will fall into place. \n\nI recognize this monster of a comment is very abstract, so in case you didn\u2019t gain much I\u2019ll give you a few jumping off points that will allow you to form your life however the fuck you want it to be formed. Seriously, you do have that power, you have only yet to realize it. The only issue here is that your toolbox is vastly limited. If all you have is a hammer, everything is a nail. Good luck building a house like that. \n\n- Learn how to meditate. Download the Headspace app and try a 5 minute session. You don\u2019t need to meditate all the time, you just need to know how to do it, and how it affects you. This will put another tool in your toolbox, in case you want to use it.\n\n- Research psychedelic drugs and their effect on depression. This is one of (if not) the most powerful tools known to man kind, it\u2019s kept like a secret because government is literally terrified of humans having this much power. I\u2019m not joking. For a college student, DMT is probably best as the trip doesn\u2019t last more than an hour. But, it\u2019s also the most intense so starting elsewhere is generally advised.\n\n- Look up actualized.org and watch his video about mastering emotions, as well as the one titled \u201cwhat is god? A no bullshit explanation for smart people\u201d. Yeah it might take four hours to watch these both, but what is four hours to the rest of your life? Don\u2019t be greedy with your time, you have plenty of it. Don\u2019t worry about wasting it, all time is wasted in the grand scheme of things. \n\nIf you have any questions, message me or comment. Regardless of my faults, you can learn a lot from me. I\u2019m very expressive, and I\u2019ve put a lot of thought into existence. I feel that I\u2019ve all but mastered this stage of my life; I can help you do the same. It isn\u2019t about relentless self-improvement or cultish productivity, it is about something that can never be put into words. Regardless of what anybody thinks about me after this post, my life is filled with love and joy- not only for me either, I share it with those who engage with me. Reward yourself my friend, I\u2019m trying to make it easy for you.\n\nedit:ed a word",

                          "text": "Sure. I understand that many people have a negative stigma attached to to military in their mind. \n\n1) I have a lot of student debt to repay and the military provides very stable and solid base pay, and then housing and allowance pay on top of that, and then life benefits. If I could go back in time and do ROTC in college I would. But since I missed that chance, I'm looking at after-college options. Paying back student loans can be a lot more doable spending a few years in the military. 2) I prefer very structured and competitive environments and the military is that. 3) I am looking for a sense of belonging and bonding, and the military can provide that in a way many regular private sector jobs cannot. 4) My degree relates to many government/military job positions. I've never thought of myself as a military minded person at all, and there are definitely things not to like about military culture and life, and I know that. I'm not expecting it to be paradise if I join. But it can provide a lot of good things to people as well.",

                              "text": "I gotcha. I am still sort of in the virtuous-fantasy phase, so if it's not my idea of perfect then it's not for me, ya know? From my current view, there's a lot of negative implications for blindly following orders, which is required for a military career. Same deal with commitment. Yet, I'm sort of blindly following orders of my own, I'm just blind to what those orders are or what/who they're from. I mean, I'm here in college simply because when I was younger I had a vague notion that it's something I *should* do. So I picked a path I thought I might like, and committed to it. Of course, after the fact I came up with a lot of reasons for my 'decision', but I think they're just justifications for a decision that wasn't mine to begin with. I enjoy life regardless, so no gripes.\n\nAnyway, I'd definitely recommend trying DMT. As humans, we typically have a lot of mental blocks that prevent us from furthering our growth- DMT will likely either strip those away, or at least make you aware of them so you can work on them over time. It is rapid-fading, so if you don't like what you see, it's just as easy to bury what you've found as it was to dig it up- not that that's necessarily a good thing, but it's an option. The drug is very forgiving to whatever mindset you wish to carry, even if it's for your detriment. But it's still your choice, and typically a conscious one. It's not something that requires constant deliberation either, one single experience can be transformative in itself, though typically there is a buildup to that experience. If you have any questions, I'm here.",

I knew pretty quickly that I didn\u2019t want to work with computers, but comp sci was my third major and I had to stick with it just to get out of school (9 years after I started college with some breaks). The upper level courses were like pulling teeth for me, but this was expected. What began to stress me out what realizing what a dumpster fire the department was. Only one professor actually gave a flying fuck about what people were learning, and the rest sat on their asses and complained about each other behind their backs. Our department head disappeared two weeks into a semester, and the 4 courses he taught became self-guided nightmares. He was actually never seen again, and the university only fired him after someone emailed the dean about a directed study. His position was filled by the next most tenured professor, who was a drunk, and overall a miserable person. Everything from that point was doubly fucked, and I did whatever it took to graduate and move on. Ultimately, I am certain the university would have massive accreditation issues if any of the major events in my last 3 semesters were investigated. \n\nI will say keep your head up. I knew computers weren\u2019t for me, and started looking at other opportunities. I am now training to be a pilot, I love every second of it, and I know the degree will have its benefits when it comes time to apply for jobs in aviation.

Started uni 2 years ago and got severely depressed. I was good at the work and my grades where fine I just couldn\u2019t cope with being there. Figured I\u2019d defer for a year and start over. I was so excited to go back and start things up again. I moved out of my parents home and lived in a house share (First time living away from home). Again I had pretty good grades so everything seemed okay for the first term then I just fell apart. I could barely scrape myself out of bed. I lost interest in everything I was studying and had worked so hard to study. I cried most nights and became a recluse. I stopped caring for myself completely. I\u2019d go days without eating. It\u2019s the lowest I\u2019ve ever been. It got to the point where I was suicidal and called it quits. I stopped attending and filed to discontinue the course. I went home to my father and spent a good 3 months just recovering mentally from the toll of feeling that depressed. I\u2019m still not right now and honestly after feeling like that I\u2019m not sure I ever will be. I\u2019m still dealing with the physical and mental fallout of not caring for myself and am desperately struggling to find work. I don\u2019t really have any advice other that talk to people. Friends, family, counselors, if doesn\u2019t matter. Let someone know where you\u2019re at mentally and if you need to leave there\u2019s no shame in doing what\u2019s right for your own mental health. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this and I hope you pull through.",

You get to choose your own future and all your decisions are your own. More ability to go places to make new friends who are usually more mature anyhow than college age ones.

I went to community college and got my associates. I then got another job that didn\u2019t have anything to do with what I got my degree in. I then got a job through a temp agency that was somewhat related, but the degree wasn\u2019t really necessary...that job lead to a much better job that was related to my degree. I\u2019m now in the position that I had to go back to school to get my bachelors in order to advance. My current position is \u201cAssociate Engineer\u201d, basically an engineer without the degree. I am back in school and working full time to get my degree in engineering. \n\nMy point is, you aren\u2019t going to get your dream job, or even something totally related to your field out of the gate. It\u2019s like you take baby steps and then you gradually make it up to where you want to be. It took me 2 years to get to the sort of related job then another year to get the job I wanted, then another 4 at that company to get where I am now. Just be patient and look for something that requires related skills.",
