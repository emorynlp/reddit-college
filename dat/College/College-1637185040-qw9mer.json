  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am looking to get input from people who own recording devices (other than smart phones) that they use when recording class lectures.  I am looking for input on specific questions:\n\n1. best recording time\n2. ease of transferring lecture from device to laptop/desktop\n3. playback options \n   1. easy to fast-forwarding to a specific point the in lecture\n   2. start/stop user friendly\n4. battery length\n5. other options that might might tip the scale when deciding whether or not to buy a specific recording device.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and respond to this post.",
