  "text": "I\u2019ve been at community college for awhile. If I was at a 4 year, I\u2019d be a senior. I\u2019m so behind and keep dropping classes, even ones that you wouldn\u2019t consider hard. My first semester, I was suppose to go to a college 2 hours away. I could not find housing even after I met people who needed roommates. I\u2019m very awkward and shy and don\u2019t know if that contributed. Anyways because of that, I took online classes. I did so bad in all of them but one. Then I started at a CC near me. I did great my first semester there, with only getting a B in one class. Rest were A\u2019s. Something happened with fam so I got kicked out and moved with my boyfriend, going to another CC. Took a semester off bc of that but then went to the new CC. Everything\u2019s still been online, and every semester I\u2019ve p much been dropping classes. It sucks. Even easy classes. Once I\u2019m behind, I\u2019m behind. I\u2019m doing so bad in my film class it\u2019s bad. I was good at writing and thinking but somehow not anymore. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever transfer at this rate because of all the dropped classes. I retake the ones I drop, but one I know I can\u2019t take again. I just have to switch to another class that fills that part of my degree. Anyways just going off I feel frustrated and hopeless. I feel no college will want me",

      "text": "Most likely somewhere will take you, even with drops. But it seems you did much better in person. I would wait until you are able to take it in person. Financial aid/scholarships can be effected by withdrawing, and for some colleges they may get worried if they see a lot. I'd wait until I was of clear mind and in-person, if you do better then, to take more classes.",
