My students at a large commonwealth campus are dealing with it too.  I dealt with it when I was in college at a large state school.  I\u2019m currently a full time employee at the university and an adjunct for first year seminar and my students are discussing this article and watching the attached video this week: [Advice From a Formerly Lonely College Student](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/well/family/advice-from-a-formerly-lonely-college-student.amp.html) in preparation from a visit from our Counseling and Psychological Services Office next week.  \n\nJust know this isn\u2019t just you, you aren\u2019t alone, and other people are suffering through it right next to you.  You\u2019ll find them and it\u2019ll get better!",

Totally shocked as he was a social butterfly before. He literally decided he's not partying at a party school and focusing on his education and keeping his scholarship. I don't even recognize this kid anymore. Good for him. If you want to make friends, then be a good friend. Join some clubs you have an interest in. Rush fraternities (you don't have to join just go rush and meet people). Plenty of ways. Stop feeling sorry for yourself after today and make an effort to meet people. Go to the gym. Ask for a spot on weights and give a spot. Man so many ways to just meet people. Son met 3 people at McDonald's at 3am and exchanged DM info. People are everywhere. Carry gum and altoids and offer some to people. It works. Now get out there!",

Nothing wrong with not liking school, it might just mean you haven\u2019t found what\u2019s for you. \n\nThese people are not quality friends. These parties are not quality social stimuli, and are more dangerous than ever. \n\nFind groups that match your interests. Go to clubs, join activities. Community service clubs are pretty good places to find a variety of people, who (usually) aren\u2019t giant assholes. Go to the SI sessions for your courses, and meet people in your classes who are putting in extra effort to succeed. Surround yourself with people who would nurture who you are. Not these selfish kids who want to party. \n\nMaybe for tonight, find a really good movie, some fuzzy socks, and snacks? Do something that makes you feel like you\u2019re taking care of yourself, and have a great time hanging out with you. You\u2019re probably great.",

I didn\u2019t make any \u201creal\u201d friends in college until my junior year or so. Now I have only retained 2, and they\u2019re engaged to each other. \n\nYou logically know that bettering yourself is not synonymous with these parties. In reality, these parties are loud, dirty, and usually annoying. I went to one college party and never even considered it again. \n\nAlthough, I had some pretty severe anxiety, and the effort it took to socialize was more than I could handle. \n\nI got a dog, therapy, and spent a year on anxiety medication. I found my passion, and realized that college is for *me.* I was there for an education. Soon into college, I didn\u2019t have much time for socializing, because I had to study. That made my anxiety worse. I changed to a less academically challenging school, moved closer to home, got treatment, my dog, and a whole not more freedom. I realized how much I hated that college town, and the giant campus of such immature people. I had a kitchen, and I could eat real food. I got a job as a care assistant at my pediatric hospital, and that is probably the only reason I got into medical school. \n\nI was so, so much happier outside of that environment. I felt less anxiety and stress when I realized what I wanted in an adult life, and started working towards it. This took *a lot* of therapy. \n\nNow I am definitely my favorite person to hang out with. Being alone is what restores my energy now.",

      "text": "It seems like you have low self-esteem and are hurt by your friends' rejection. \n\nThe truth is people are very sensitive to detecting self-hatred, fear of rejection, and/or desperation in others.  It repells them through an instinct to protect their mental well-being.  Invulnerability mirrors invulnerability. Rejection, hatred, rejection, hatred: it becomes a vicious circle, unless the course is changed. \n\nThe solution is to improve your communication skills, the image you are giving off to the world.  An attractive person is always smiling and talking in a bubbly, light-hearted voice.  Rather than being inauthentic, learning this one skill, an easy-going attitude, will provide space for other people to exist without reservations. \n\nThe development of emotional skills is of course important. If you are open to learning one skill in this area, I suggest seeking out rejection and learning how rejection is good, something that makes you stronger.  As you find meaning and necessity in rejection, you will be more open to situations with potential for rejection, and see that it is bearable.  The confidence will eventually make the chance if rejection less likely, in turn making you less sensitive to rejection. This is a much healthier feedback loop than the one of rejection and hatred.",

I can relate because that's how my evening went too!\nI've found that making yourself less available to others subconsciously makes you more attractive to them. You seem like a person who's okay to prioritize themselves and their alone time or maybe has some other friends and hence are less available or more \"exclusive\". Don't just pretend, though. Go and actually do those things. Spend some time by yourself, especially if you're in a new city or new part of a city. Go for a movie, to a museum, look for free and fun stuff to do online by yourself. And talk to random people - what bothers me most about being alone is not having people to talk to, so it's fun to talk to random people.\nAnd if people are nice enough to invite you somewhere, don't say no. But don't make yourself excessively available to anyone.\nHang in there :)",
