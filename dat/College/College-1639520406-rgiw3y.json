  "title:": "Can my dorms drawers be searched during winter intersession?",
  "text": "During winter intersession, my RA says they are going to search my dorms, and I am just concerned that they are going to look through my drawers, for one I don't like the prospect of someone rummaging through my stuff with me not knowing (with them easily being able to steal stuff). But since I also have alcohol since I am 20 and a half, I am wondering if I could put that in a drawer that they won't search. \n\nTL:DR Is it illegal for them to search drawers, and closed spaces without a warrant?",
