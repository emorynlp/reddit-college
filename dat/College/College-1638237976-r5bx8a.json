  "text": "Hi! I just received an email saying I was approved for the Cares Act emergency aid and will be receiving a refund. Which was quite surprising as I hadn\u2019t even heard of such a thing. However, will this affect how much aid I was already going to receive through the Pell Grant and my state\u2019s aid? Just curious as, if I receive those aids too, I\u2019d be getting a little bit of a refund left over from that as well and it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d allow for that\u2026 Just curious if anyone has been in this situation or has any idea how one might affect the other.",
