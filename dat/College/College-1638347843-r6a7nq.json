  "text": "I'm already struggling with a three course/11 credit load (two 3 credit math courses, one 5 credit physics course), and I'm not nearly as busy as other stem students/engineers who are doing 4 or more courses plus extracurriculars and part time jobs. Seriously, your time management skills are too op. Tell me your secrets (besides telling me to get off Reddit).",

      "text": "Make a schedule and keep to it. Include time off for fun. \n\nStudy often and in small amounts. 30 Min every day will do more for you than 6 hours on Sunday.\n\nSleep. Go to bed early and wake up early. Seeing the sun rise and set does wonders for your mental health/abilities.\n\nLearn to love the process of learning. Don't seek grades but congratulate yourself for understanding concepts. You'll have definitive successes everyday.",

      "text": "- you have to enjoy it. if you don\u2019t enjoy science and math, you\u2019re going to drown. it\u2019s a lot of work that can you really only get through if you have the motivation to do it. \n- stay organized. stick to a schedule, keep all of your assignments and deadlines written down, and take good notes. \n- don\u2019t do it alone. i\u2019m a pretty med major and i don\u2019t know another stem major who does this shit all on your own. form study groups - people who can not only help you understand the material but also will help hold you accountable for staying on top of your shit. \n- sleep. you can\u2019t do this if you don\u2019t sleep enough. instead of cramming 5 hours of studying all on the night before an exam, spread it out. study one chapter a day until the day of your exam, and go to bed earlier. my mom always says, if you\u2019re ever deciding between studying and sleeping, sleep. your notes aren\u2019t going anywhere, and studying is useless if your brain is too tired to retain anything and you won\u2019t even remember it tomorrow.",
