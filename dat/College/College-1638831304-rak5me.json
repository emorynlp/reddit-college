  "text": "I started college during the panorama, so this is my first semester on campus. I\u2019ve always been good at school, but bad at motivating myself to assignments that seem too easy or pointless for me. \nI\u2019ve had like\u2026 no motivation this semester. I\u2019m tired from the moment I wake up until I go to bed. I haven\u2019t checked a single grade on Canvas, when I\u2019m usually obsessive at looking and figuring out what I need to get on every assignment to get an A. I\u2019m doing fine in some classes and awful in others, but I\u2019m so apathetic I haven\u2019t gotten stressed at all this semester. \nIt sucks, but part of me wishes school would go back online next semester so I would have an excuse to take a semester off. \nIs anyone else struggling in this transition from the pandemic (not like it\u2019s over\u2026) to school? How have you guys been handling your first semester back?\n\nNo one say \u201cjust drop out\u201d LOL. Trust me, I\u2019ve considered it, but I need a degree for my career.",
