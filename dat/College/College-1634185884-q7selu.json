  "text": "So right now, I have a Orgo Chem 2 and Biology Midterm on subsequent days next week, Wednesday and Thursday, specifically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though I think I'm more than capable of studying both, and getting relatively good grades, (Bs ), I feel that if I were to devote ALL of my time, I could probably do REALLY well on my Orgo Chem 2 or my Bio Midterm, but do really badly on the other midterm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom this relatively crappy situation, I've realized that I don't really have a handle as to how to handle midterms that come subsequently very quickly, as my previous midterms usually had a few days in between.\n\nSo I just want to ask how you guys handle multiple midterms coming at once?",

      "text": "Study one for a while( 1-2hours). Then take a break. Switch subjects and study(1-2hours). Take a break. Switch back(1-2hours) . Break. Something like that works. Keep the breaks a little longer at15-20 minutes. \n\nYou could also switch between days since you have a bit of time before the exams.",
