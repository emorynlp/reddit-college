      "text": "So I am a a perfectionist when it comes to studying and test performance. More especially when it comes to my science classes because that is my major. I have  terrible pre-test anxiety. However, when I\u2019m taking the test, I lose all of my anxiety and know the answers. When I leave I have even worse post-exam anxiety because I feel like I did really great because I knew the answers, but I\u2019m afraid to be so sure that I passed before seeing the proof that I did. For me, I believe it comes from the experience of taking test and thinking I did well, just to find out I failed.",
