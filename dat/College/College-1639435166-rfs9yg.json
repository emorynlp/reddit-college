  "text": "I am not the strongest person and often dictate my work on how I feel. Long story short, yesterday and on Dec. 5th I attempted suicide, and it has been very difficult to focus.\n\nI have an 8 - 10 pages essay due, another 6 page essay due, a huge project, and a piano final I need to practice for. All of this needs to get done ASAP, and I cant stop staring at my ceiling. I have already been granted extensions after my hospital visit last week, and since this is the last week of classes there literally are no other extensions. \n\nHow do I focus? How do I work during these difficult times when I feel so spaced out? If you suffer from mental illness or struggle with your mental health, how are you getting through (or got through) college? I literally have like 1 or 2 days for the essays and project and tomorrow is my piano final. Last week I even cried during my piano final which is what made my professor force me to take an extension instead of a 0.",

      "text": "First of all- I\u2019m happy you\u2019re still here w us and I\u2019m so sorry for how you have been feeling. It is very hard to focus during times of severe depression when the symptoms debilitate our ability to focus or be productive in any way at all. \n\nIn times like these, I have to force myself outside or to communicate w close people. I know you don\u2019t have a lot of time to do all that you have to do, so all you can do is your best even if you feel that is not good enough. I would go to a public and quiet place like your school library and try to get stuff done there- so you are not sitting isolated in your home w distractions. Along the way (and idk if this helps) HYPE YOURSELF UP LIKE HELL- along the lines of YOU GOT THIS SHIT AND YOU WILL FUCKING KILL IT AND PUSH THROUGH YOU STRONG ASS MOTHERFUCKER (that seems aggressive but it seems to help me for whatever reason lmfao). Try to believe yourself when you say those things and knock those assignments out. \n\nThink of how good it might feel when you finally submit everything. When you know you\u2019ve been through hell and back and still pushed through. Because that\u2019s the kind of person you are, a fucking fighter!!!",

              "text": "I totally understand, it\u2019s super hard when you\u2019re so isolated. But you are worthy and not a burden. I went through something similar and had to take a medical leave on my last month of classes, tuition was reimbursed and all my classes were removed and did not reflect negatively towards gpa. It sucks when you get hit w life like this and you are not less of a person in any way bc you don\u2019t feel like doing assignments when your mental health has depleted. \n\nI hope the best for you and that it all works out. Try to go outside and give yourself a big hug. You will get through this and everything will be okay \u2764\ufe0f",
