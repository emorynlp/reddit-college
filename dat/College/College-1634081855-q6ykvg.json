  "text": "At this point I'm really desperate, I tried speaking to people during the first month and approached people but now its fall break and I have ZERO social interaction. I joined the nerd club and was a total outcast I went to 2 meetings and if I ever spoke I was completely ignored. I am at a party school and have no idea when and where parties are, and genuinely I just dont want to be the only person in the dining hall sitting in the alone section. Is there anything else I can do or is it too late for this year?",

      "text": "First it's totally normal to not have friends at this point.  A lot of students are friendly with their roommate or people on the floor but it takes time to develop close friendships.  \n\nJoin some different clubs that interest you, there's no rule that says you have to stick with it if your not enjoying yourself.  There's no need to limit yourself to \"the nerd club.\"",
