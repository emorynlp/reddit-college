  "text": "Currently I'm a second year student in university. I've been struggling very bad this semester with motivation to even wake up some days because I hate it so much. I was forced by my parents to go to university and even though I am interested in my major (compsci) I still just hate school in general. I know that I need some type of degree to work with computers and was wondering if getting an associates in IT support would be enough to get a job. I haven't discussed it with my parents yet because I'm trying to do research to prove to them that a 4 year degree isn't everything. I've been told since birth that the only way to do well in life is to get a 4 year degree at least and you'll do even better with a masters or doctorate (my dad got his masters in computer engineering back in the 90s). \n\nI'm also looking at it from a cost perspective. Going to a tech school is a lot cheaper than throwing money at the university. I've already had to retake classes and expect to have to next semester because this school's compsci program is notoriously difficult and I'm not doing well. I feel like going to a tech school would offer easier classes and there would at least be a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm 21 years old and it feels like I'm going to be in university forever because I keep failing classes. My estimated graduation date at this point is the December of 23.\n\nI should also mention, I've already went to the tech school I'm looking at once for general ed classes before transferring to university. So I already have nearly half the classes I would need for the  associates degree.",

      "text": "Although CompSci and IT do overlap, they are in fact two different fields. How about just switching to IT? Maybe that would make you happier and you'd have more success in your classes. Most job positions in both IT and CompSci require a bachelor's degree. I wouldn't count on the tech school classes being \"easier,\" probably just more applied in nature. It's true you don't have to have a 4-year degree to be successful in life - there are many paths you can take if you don't want to be at university. But if you want to be in the computer/tech world, it's going to be very difficult, if not impossible. If you want to work in tech, I'd advise pushing through with a 4-year degree. If you hate school more, I'd advise looking at other careers.",
