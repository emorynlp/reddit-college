  "text": "My older brother did well in grade school. He got good grades from the 1st-10th grade. Did pretty decently in 11th and 12th grade. He got very high SAT and AP scores as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe wanted to become a doctor so he went to an average ranked public college. He did very poorly (failed many science classes, got Cs etc.) but eventually graduated with a  2.6 sci. gpa and 3.1 overall gpa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe went on to do 2 master programs but failed out of both. Did a third one and passed due to covid-19(cheating +online tests).  He studied for many years for the mcat and scored a 518(96 percentile).  He lied about his race (he's white/Russian American, but claimed that he was white, Hispanic and native American) and got into med school.  Now he is failing medical school and will very likely have to drop out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe claims that he is a misunderstood genius due to his H.S grades/AP tests/SAT scores and Mcat scores. Is it common to do well in grade school (1-12th grade) but poorly in college science classes? Thoughts?",

      "text": "Lurking college professor here. Yes, it is ***very*** common for students to do well in high school and on SATs and poorly in college. It happens to ***many*** of my students every semester.\n\nThe material is much harder. Many students have enough pure, natural brain power to get through high school algebra without studying much, but then they get to Calculus II in college and it's harder, so they need to actually study, but they never had to develop decent study skills/habits, and they don't realize that they now need to develop them, so they fail.\n\nAlso, many students (sounds like your brother might be one of them) don't realize that the knowledge they need is ***cumulative***. For example, in order to *get into* Organic Chemistry in your second year of college, you need to pass Intro Chemistry your first year. But in order to *have a chance of passing* Organic Chemistry, you need to have ***actually learned*** the material from Intro Chemistry the year before.\n\nSo all of the cheating (and fraud?) that your brother has done got him into medical school. But he has set himself up to fail. He probably is smart enough to succeed *if he had actually developed study skills and learned the prerequisite material earlier*. But since he cheated, he is now in an impossible situation. And he is probably going to end up with a pile of debt from the portion of medical school that he attended, but without the doctor-level salary needed to pay off that debt. Putting the moral concerns aside, cheating your way into medical school is one of the worst \\*financial\\* decisions possible.\n\nStudents who engage in this kind of behavior over many years, and end up screwing themselves, tend to find some way of blaming everyone and everything other than themselves. Much more emotionally comforting to claim you are a 'misunderstood genius', to use your phrase, than to do some genuine self-reflection.\n\nI have a lecture video about how college is much harder than high school: [https://youtu.be/yem9iQVIPbM](https://youtu.be/yem9iQVIPbM)  \nAnd then a series of lectures providing study skills, which I built for my own students: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7YPshZMeLIa2KksLNqmWx\\_SANbSjaUbU](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7YPshZMeLIa2KksLNqmWx_SANbSjaUbU)",

None of those things entail that hard work guarantees success.\n\nHard work is often ***necessary*** for success. But that does not mean that it is ***sufficient*** for success.

I wanted to be a veterinarian since I was a kid, but organic chemistry, biochemistry, and the general stress and expense of vet school hit me hard in my sophomore year. I transferred into wildlife and it was the best decision I have ever made. It makes sense and I do well when I apply myself, hell, I just got accepted into a paid master's program!\n\nJust because you suck at a subject or start realizing your career choice is not what you thought that doesn't mean it's the end of the world. You can still find success elsewhere, we shouldn't be ashamed to pivot into new directions. Sometimes it really is for the better!\n\nEdit to say my sophomore year of undergrad was when I really reflected on my choices and had a crisis. It was not fun, but I'm much happier now!",

And I realize I didn't make it clear, I was in sophomore year of undergrad and was taking organic chem when I realized biochemistry and the general stress and cost of vet school may not be for me. \n\nThe hardest course of the major was a programming course on R and I still got a B+ in it. In comparison, I got a 45% C- in organic chemistry and my grades did not get worse or improve after I gave up at the last few weeks. Studying for hours, attending office hours, getting a tutor, and studying with friends did not make a difference compared to straight not trying.\n\nI just feel better when my hard work pays off. We have ID courses where we have to identify 50-100 species and I got over 100% in those courses. I loved the lectures too and recently got a 105% on a short answer only graduate level disease ecology exam. I'm ready for grad school and just excited about my career in wildlife management!",

Loading up on AP might work, idk. IB though is tough and good.\n\nThe current education system is a bit flawed and most kids can\u2019t move schools to one that is enough of a challenge. Nor do they want to because friends. \n\n(I say this all because I\u2019m glad to have been able to fail in high school. It brought me to realize where change was needed. I\u2019m currently breezing through my first sem in college)\n\nI\u2019m very glad we aren\u2019t blaming it on the system because it\u2019s a cop out, but with a bit of critical judgment, you\u2019ve got to find issues.

I think it was because it was a combination of being challenged and being super interested in what I was studying. Fortunately, I have a lot of interests also.

      "text": "It depends on what university you go to and how rigorous your classes were in high school. Doing well in grade school doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll do well in college. And students that take AP classes may not get better grades in college than their peers. Although it wasn\u2019t researched to say whether or not a student who had taken an AP class in high school and gone to take the same class in college (likely because they hadn\u2019t tested or had tested and not passed), did any better or worse than their peers. I went through about every AP class I could in high school, but I still had no idea how to actually study or what studying method was most effective for me. I got a lot of credit for my AP tests, but the only subject I didn\u2019t receive credit for was chemistry. I had to take it again in college and I did outperform my peers, but beyond the first couple chapters, I was no longer able to rely on anything I had learned beforehand. So I\u2019d attribute my grade to my work ethic over anything else. I busted my ass to get that A; spending many late nights at my desk my freshman year, going through every single problem I could and refusing to move on until I mastered it and understood the questions I got wrong. Didn\u2019t matter if it took me all night and I only slept 3 hours, I\u2019d get up and repeat every night. (Eventually I had to switch it up and begin sleeping 4 hours and 6 hours intermediate between the two, but the point being that I sacrificed sleep and pastime to dedicate myself to it because I was determined I was not going to fail. I want to do what I want in life and I\u2019m not going to let myself fail. It\u2019s about your work ethic more than anything. And that work ethic can\u2019t be hindered by the need to cheat either, because eventually cheating will bite you in the ass when you need that information later and you don\u2019t have it to rely on.) \nI believe the failure on your brother\u2019s behalf was assuming he\u2019d be able to breeze by into and through medical school after cheating the system to get where he is today. It\u2019s an expensive lesson to learn considering I\u2019d assume that, like most medical school students, he\u2019s in a couple hundred grand in debt. But that\u2019s the punishment for assuming you were prepared. But if he didn\u2019t have faith in himself enough to be honest in the entire process, and faith enough to believe in his own worth, then how did he ever expect to make it? There are lots of premed kids that would have loved to have filled that spot that he took up; ones that gave their all every minute of their college career to do so. In the end, they\u2019re the ones I feel sorry for. I don\u2019t feel sorry for your brother. He\u2019s not a misunderstood genius, he\u2019s a med school flunkie that didn\u2019t make the cut because he didn\u2019t deserve to be there in the first place.",

      "text": "College work is just completely different from even the most difficult high school work. It takes an entirely different set of skills and a different mindset.\n\nIt takes discipline and time management skills to show up to class and get everything done, because no one is standing over your shoulder making you do those things anymore. \n\nAnd imo, probably even more importantly, it takes a different type of studying and a certain amount of adaptability. You have to learn to study the material for the purpose of understanding, not just for the purpose of rote memorization and regurgitating information on the test, particularly in higher level classes, and especially in doctoral level classes like medical school, because in the real world patients are never as simple as a multiple-choice quiz. Many of your exams will be testing your critical thinking skills using the information presented in the class, not just seeing if you remember random facts.\n\n In addition, in order to do well you have to be able to quickly figure out how your professor is going to ask questions and handle exams and adapt your study habits to fit what they are going to require from you. You may learn the material perfectly, and maybe even get an A+ from a different prof teaching the exact same class, but if you're not able to handle the tests from the professor you have, you're still gonna fail.",

He can get extra time or more secluded areas to take tests, so he can slow down and avoid distractions. If he knows the material, it's very possible that he just rushes through it and makes careless mistakes in reading or answering the questions.\n\nTo be frank, I think counseling would help him a lot to figure out what he wants to do in his future and to help him cope with the failures and unfinished paths in his life.",

      "text": "As a college professor, this is \\*very\\* common. When people are incredibly smart in high school, they often don't learn good study skills. When you get to college, the speed of information transfer is much higher and requires significant amounts of time spent studying, doing homework, etc.\n\nPeople who don't learn that discipline in high school often have a massive crash course when they get to college, unless they quickly form friendships with people who have learned this skill.\n\nAnother contributor to this is people who are raised getting tons of feedback about \"how smart they are,\" instead of \"how hard they worked to get good grades\" and also have a lot of their personal identities established around being \"smart.\" Procrastination has been associated with fear of failure and identity threats, so when \"smart\" people start to have difficulties, it subconsciously makes them fear they are not smart and causes them to avoid tasks that provide them with this subconscious identity threat (studying, tests, turning in homework, engaging with difficult coursework, etc). You'll see this downhill spiral start when someone \"smart\" doesn't study enough for an exam, does poorly, has a personal identity crisis, and then in response starts to dramatically decrease engagement in school. \n\nSome people shake this off and pull through. Others don't. I've seen MANY extremely smart people flunk out of college. Lots of my high school friends, in fact. And nearly me. I refuse to admit on the internet what my undergrad GPA was, because it's frankly embarrassing. And I fully admit it was due to my own refusal to study for about 2 years. However, I am very competitive and got tired of seeing people with a lot less ability graduating from school when I was just surfing along. So I got my shit together and got it done.\n\nOnce I learned to study, I ended up finishing my undergrad successfully but with a mediocre GPA. I worked outside academia for several years. Went back and got my master's degree with a 3.9. Currently in a PhD program with a 3.9 so far, and teach undergrad full-time.",

For example, professors alone can affect the outcome of grades for his science classes. Some professors are more passionate than others and some are just there to collect checks and focus on their research. Hence, why Grad schools use a GRE, MCAT, and other national tests for admissions. These test basically pin students against other students to see who's got a broader range of learned information based on similar tests questions. For him to get 96 percentile, shows he studied and retained most of the general level of sciences and math for an entry into medical school.\n\nMy opinion: I understand he did really well on the MCAT, but it seems more like he got a high ego and Med school is humbling him. Medical school is no joke and he's learning that now. Just how cut throat it can be is Monday they will learn based on sections (really specific to the T) and tested within the next two weeks from that Monday. These exams end up putting placing you in a ranking system. \n\n(All in all, he's smart but not genius)",

I was also a type of student who never really studied for exams and I often did horribly in them, especially with algebra 2 and pre calculus. Despite this, I never came close to failing to any of my class. I think the lowest grade I ever got for a class was a 65 and that was back in middle school. \n\nMy senior year was a massive joke due to the pandemic. When my school switched to online learning, half of my classes didn\u2019t require that the students do the work and some classes had the regular work be extra credit.\n\nI took three college classes during my senior year which were ENG 101, 102, and I believe a American History one. All of them didn\u2019t really feel like a college course and still felt like high school work. \n\nOnce I enrolled to the 2020 fall semester, that\u2019s where I found how college work was completely different from high school work. My major was computer science and online learning was still a thing and I completely lost track with the work. College doesn\u2019t hold your hand like High school and requires that students do studying outside of class. I never studied back in high school and thought I could do what I did back in HS. I was dead wrong. I bombed my calculus class first semester and barely got a c for my Coding class. \n\nAs of now, I switched my major from Computer Science to Computer Information Systems. I understand that doing my old habits of high school won\u2019t work here in college and I actually have to put in effort to pass.",

      "text": "Yes, thats surprisingly common actually, and its a result of \"gifted child syndrome\".  Basically, a child starts excelling in school due to a natural intelligence that puts them just a bit above their peers (and sometimes an undiagnosed disorder like ADHD or ASD) and starts being told how 'smart' they are, how much potential they have.  This inflates their ego, making them see the challenges as small and their mind as huge, but then they have a very, very hard time accepting failure.  Once college rolls around, you cant rely on a slight bump in natural aptitude, but gifted kids arent used to challenges that big and often underestimate how difficult things will be.  This will hit their self-esteem really bad, they start to see themselves as failures not living up to all  this 'potential' they had.  See, it started with others placing expectations and judgements on them, but eventually they internalized it, and when the time came for independence, they push the expectations and judgements on themselves, often being very self-critical and not allowing themselves to fail without berating themselves for being dumb, or useless.  To deal with failing, their ego inflates, since thats often a way we mask insecurity or identity instability, and it inflames the problem.  Hence, the \"misunderstood genius\" act, which is really just a method hes using to ease the pain of feeling like a failure and a letdown.  This is a cycle thats deeply rooted in childhood, and often leads to a lot of depression and anxiety revolving around expectations, and 'gifted kids' tend to have a hard time focusing on the present.\n\nI watched a video this morning I really resonated with, in [this group interview](https://youtu.be/kPZwR3v_UyI) the guy hit some notes that I resonated with really personally, and have never been able to put into words.  I'm going through the same cycle right now, I was a straight A student, took AP classes and did well on my ACT, yet I'm an average/below average student at a not-so-prestigious college because I never seem to be able to get my shit together enough to put as much effort in as I need to.  It happens to a lot of people, and it's a very hard cycle to break from, especially since you have to corral that ego thats developed.\n\nNot saying your brother is okay for having cheated and lied, obviously thats not cool, but there is an explanation.",

I got an A and a 5 in my Calculus AB class but come Calculus II in freshman, I literally got a C-/D+ on the final and dropped my grade to the lowest B you could get before a B-.\n\nIt's the big fish in a small pond to a small fish in a big pond kinda thing.",

You can always tell because those people tend to be good test takers and they think that will translate to success.",
