  "text": "I know many professors are required to do this so I can't blame them. If you do it voluntarily though, then just stop. Discussion boards are the best example of the failures of online college. Absolutely no engagement or effort because no one knows anybody and nobody cares. We just want the grade for the post so it's always boring and minimum effort. I hate racking my brain trying to think of three responses to these random people just to get a 3 point grade. Just stop assigning them, please.",

Discussion boards rise and fall on student engagement, and if students aren\u2019t engaged, they suck. They suck to read, and they suck to write. So my only advice here is to be the change you want to see in the world. I\u2019ve had some that are awesome, and I\u2019ve enjoyed reading them so much! I give extra credit if you try to help a classmate to understand something or bring something to the conversation from outside of class. Try that. It might help.",

Instead of requiring a discussion post every week, you would have a general \"participation\" category for 10% of your grade. You could get points toward this by participating in the chat during class, doing problems during recitation, or by posting on the discussion board. She would post discussion questions every week, but you didn\u2019t have to respond every week if you got your participation points another way. Also, there were no deadlines and the only requirement was that you \"participate\" at least 10 times throughout the semester to get the points.",

The overwhelming majority shared what most of you have said here \u2014 answering the original prompt was fine, but they hated forced responses to classmates. Many said that they liked the accountability of the discussion, that it made them engage with the chapter materials and think more critically; they also noted that they kind of enjoyed reading what their classmates had to say, just not responding. So, I changed the discussion grading rubric and eliminated the requirement to respond to other posts. \n\nInstead, I offered extra credit. They could choose to respond to up to two students each week and earn 3 points for each post, as long as it was substantive and met some other criteria.  The course adds up to 1000 points, so doing this once wouldn\u2019t really change anything, but it gave students the opportunity to earn up to 30 or 40 points, which did make a big difference by the end of the semester. \n\nIt made the experience better for EVERYONE, including me. Original posts were more interesting and the students who whose to response made really insightful comments that moved the conversation forward.",

The teacher went out of his way to find readings that would generate lots of different opinions amongst the class. It was really engaging to write about our thoughts and opinions after those readings and engage with other people's ideas and thoughts. Most of us went above and beyond our 2 replies because the discussions were just that interesting. I think, sometimes, engaging discussions are reliant on what kind of questions are being asked. I also think sometimes it's all on the eye of the poster too. I try to go out of my way to write a post that's easy for others to engage with. And when I reply, I purposely ask questions and find ways to keep discourse going. I don't just put in token effort, because if everybody does that, then nobody will gain anything from the assignment.",

I'd love to hear your thoughts on alternate assignments.\n\nFirst: I assign discussion board posts because it is one of the few ways to ensure students do the readings. The few semesters I did not, no one read. Really. I'd ask what author X's main point was, and it would be silent. Did discussion boards the next semester, and students at least had to skim enough to pick up the main point. The other alternative is reading quizzes. But I hate writing those and you all hate taking them.\n\nSo: the dilemma is how to get students to read and participate in discussion without having discussion posts. History has shown we can't just trust you to do the readings -- EVEN when there is a large component of the grade coming from participation. It was 15% for my course this term, and even then many students still chose not to read and not to participate (because they had no clue what we were talking about). \n\nI would love to hear ideas from students about how to keep you engaged outside of the classroom. Since we only meet two or three days a week, we as professors need to ensure that you actually do the readings (and trust me, it is a battle every single class). If you have suggestions or solutions, I'm all ears, but \"trust us, we'll read,\" or \"increase participation\" don't work.",

We have to give at least 5-7 sentences depending on the prompts, and we have to provide the reading the answer is from, as sometimes we\u2019ll have 2-5 readings and only like 3 discussions. The kicker is that we don\u2019t have to respond to each other, just to our teacher. However, we are encouraged that if someone brings up a point we would want to talk about, to respond to them. No one is obligated to respond, nothing is forced, but I\u2019ve had more heartfelt discussions in the past two weeks of this asynchronous virtual class than I did in two semesters of virtual synchronous classes that required responses. \n\nI guess TLDR: Take the discussion requirement away and just ask for information, and your students will actually discuss. College kids practically only do what they\u2019re not told to.",

So there's two/three main ways that I've had things due (and sorry about formatting; I'm on mobile!):\n\n- the usual \"Sunday at 11:59 P.M.\" \n\n- depending on how the class was blocked, it would be due at 11:59 P.M. of the last class period of the given week (e.g. TR class, due Thursday at 11:59 P.M.)\n\n- due at the end of class time for the given day, so if discussion ran from 5 P.M. to 8:30 P.M. CST before, worksheets would be due at 8:30 P.M. on day of discussion (this would probably be the easiest to transition to but more difficult to manage).\n\n(Note: this third one would be easiest to use if you end up keeping discussion forums. If everyone has a set block of time to discuss and reply, more people would take it seriously. My professor always told us, \"As long as you're active during classtime you can continue posting if needed/desired,\" which I found to be a nice compromise given she asked for 5 replies to everyone's main posts and at least 5 replies to other replies. The main thing she wanted was significant discussion, and was trying to mirror a classroom discussion best she could. She wasn't worried about requirements as much as she liked us to believe, haha).\n\nOf these three, I personally like the first or second option best. The first doesn't adhere to a specific time and offers more leeway, assuming you decide to go with the worksheets. The second is scheduled and consistent despite offering \"less\" time.",

I recognize that you are in a tough spot with online schooling, just as the students are. Very broadly speaking, the issue is that too many young people feel pressured to go to college and even if they enjoy their chose major, they are then saddled with core classes they don't care about and don't want to pay for. It's an issue I am constantly acutely aware of, personally. I just want to earn my degree,  take my major classes and be out in three years to start job hunting. Obviously I don't need to tell you any of this though, you're a professor and deal with that daily. Back on topic though, I guess I differ from other students because I'd rather do a small weekly/biweekly quiz on the reading so I don't have to awkwardly tap out a response to someone I've never even met in person before. I'd prefer to directly answer questions about the reading (or whatever the quiz is on) and cut out the awkward middle man. This also ends the need for response posts which are absolutely pointless and just make me anxious. \"Nice point Matt. I think that was a nice point, Matt.\" It's like I'm talking to a primitive AI chat bot from 2014.",

Now, something my teacher does constantly in high school is to (idk the way u can do this in college) assign groups based on a persons preference and set up like a group quiz. This ensures A someone will read, B is something that\u2019s both different and has the element of togetherness within it, and C definitely leads to greater interest in your class. You can even make the tests extra credit/offer tangible awards to make it an even more incentiviser for kids who don\u2019t really like the subject.

I personally do not really enjoy doing hw and assignments outside of class, but I\u2019m highly perceived (by others telling me) that I tend to talk a ton in class. Perhaps implementing debates could lead people to talk, but whatever is the case, it rarely the profs fault, it\u2019s just that people do not like work. Think about it this way, would u rather work or go to vacation. This same ideology can apply to us students because we see our place as a student to be equivalent to a job which of course makes us wish of happier places regardless of subject at times.

It's a huge waste of time, especially when we get into ridiculous requirements such as \"Describe the hierarchy of Android layout elements in 300 words, with a minimum of 150-word replies to at least two students in the class.\" (This specific example was taken out of the assignment I'm procrastinating on by typing out this response to you).\n\nOn another note, you seem like the type of professor I would love to have: One that actually cares about their students and their feedback. Unfortunately, that's a rarity in my school, especially in the realm of online teaching.

          "text": "It's a lie that there are no stupid questions. There are lots of them. And many of them are asked as prompts for discussion board assignments.\n\nLuckily, I didn't have to deal with too many mandatory discussion boards. But in the courses where I did, the discussion boards where I was required to \"respond to the reading\" or write about \"questions that [I] had while reading,\" and then respond to my classmates a minimum of X times were the ones that had 20 boring and insipid posts with a bunch of meaningless responses.\n\nOn the other hand, the prompts that asked a meaningful question--and especially the ones that had room for a diversity of answers--were always more engaging. I would rather debate a real question with a classmate, with the argument backed up by the reading, than \"summarize in [my] own words the author's main points.\"\n\n(Which brings me to another complaint. Assuming your students have the basic ability to read and comprehend a chapter of a book or a paper, what possible response would be necessary to somebody else's summary? \"Hi Billy, I totally agree with your points. Have a great day!\" is a waste of everybody's time. Requiring me to summarize a reading in a discussion forum is a lazy assignment. Requiring me to respond to somebody else's summary--unless he actually missed the point or raised a uniquely good issue--is a stupid assignment.)\n\nA boring prompt that is little more than busy work to ensure that students did the reading is never going to be engaging, and you're going to get the kinds of empty responses that you hate reading and that students hate writing. Give them an interesting prompt that requires them to do a bit of critical thinking about what they read, and that leaves room for students to disagree with each other, and it is going to be less soul-crushing for everybody involved.",
