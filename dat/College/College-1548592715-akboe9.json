  "text": "All professors can be divided into one of three categories.\n\nThe rarest and most precious are the teachers: these special creatures actually want to be the best teacher they can be and throw themselves into their work. We love them for it and they know it.\n\nNext are the ethical professors:\nThese special people put equal work into their research and their teaching because they are at the school to do research, but they know they owe their students the best education for their dollar.\n\nFinally there is the slacker:\nThis miserable bastard is at the school for one reason. They want to indulge in a life of research and will (begrudgingly) spend a semester milking a class for tuition money with a bare bones, half assed curriculum. ",

I maintain that a lab which is not graded is a tutorial but that is what you get when the class it taught in English, the professor speaks one language as a first language, all the T.As speak another, and not one of them (T.A or professor) is what I would call fluent in English.",

Those schools don't have the prestige of the main research schools and it does make it harder to land a good job right off the bat. I did University recruiting at my last company...

Liberal arts colleges, for example, mostly make their reputations on teaching. While it's not universally true, most of what we call \"primarily undergraduate institutions\" are going to put more weight on teaching than will large research universities. There are all kinds of exceptions of course. The best way to find out is to talk with current students, ask not only about class sizes but about faculty mentoring and most importantly ask WHO is teaching classes at the intro level. If it's graduate students or adjuncts, that's a sign they don't prioritize teaching. If the department chair is teaching 100-level classes, that's a much better sign that they do.",
