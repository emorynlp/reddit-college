I was also a horrible student in high school and barely passed any math classes. Here\u2019s how I made it through Calc II:\n\nHighly recommend paying for symbolab premium for the semester. It\u2019s only like $12 for a few months I think and gives you walkthrough steps of integrals. Makes homework a lot less painful.\nAlso, YouTube is by far the biggest homie there is. Reading math textbooks is painful. Having someone walk through it for you is glorious. Professor Leonard is my #1 recommendation. Getting frustrated at the homework sucks especially if you\u2019re using Pearson, cengage, or knewton. I don\u2019t have good advice for that, just don\u2019t break your electronics and chill when you need a break.\n\n It\u2019s important to understand that Calc II is the dirty work of undergrad Calc. You\u2019re learning how to integrate and the different tricks used to do tough integrals. You\u2019re basically learning what you\u2019ll be having calculators compute for you later. In Calc III it becomes important to know the various ways of setting up integrals. Be sure to check your progress in hindsight and see what the point of learning it was. I promise learning integration (Calc II) is worth it and will change the way you interpret the world around you. I was a very average joe coming into college but I learned that math is a language that explains why things are the way they are. It feels good to understand. Good luck!",
