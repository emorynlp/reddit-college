  "text": "20 year old freshman in community college. I am a rock musician but plan on learning harpsichord at a conservatory after CC. I can\u2019t mentally afford to devote 2 more years of my life after CC at a money and energy draining university. I want to do something with my life and make money for it. But most new bands don\u2019t make much money at all by simply writing and performing, this all feels bleak and useless if I can\u2019t do anything with the only degree I\u2019d have the sanity to achieve.",

      "text": "Honestly, I went to school for music and as a musician was really disappointed with my experience - I dropped out after the first year. \n\nI went thinking I\u2019d make connections, but instead I was learning things I learned when I started taking lessons at the age of 7. This was university and one of the best in my state for music. I actually had to take private classes so that I was being taught on my level.\n\nThat being said, it depends. There was one guy I was in class with, he was a drummer and went for music production and last time I saw him was at a local concert a few years after he graduated. He was thriving doing sound production, being a DJ and he had the perk of getting to go to free concerts because he worked the sets. Last I knew he was in the works of starting up a recording studio. \n\nEveryone is different. Community college is definitely a safer route though given that the cost will be more affordable. Just because my experience wasn\u2019t what I expected doesn\u2019t mean yours couldn\u2019t be great. Good luck!",

It takes motivation and direction to build purpose and even then we can\u2019t be sure of success, but we won\u2019t know until we give it a try. \n\nI\u2019d say make as many connections as you can and surround yourself with what you want to become - easier said than done right now! However, social media is a great tool for those kinds of things. \n\nAlso - harpsichord is stellar. I can appreciate that!",
