  "text": "My professor is only showing 2 questions at the time and after completing the page you can\u2019t go back\u2026 Why? If the exam is not proctored I understand but if the exam is proctored ( camera and mic on) what\u2019s the point ? I know it\u2019s for cheating but if you\u2019re proctored with camera and mic the possibility of cheating is significantly less and anyways there\u2019s always someone that will cheat so why penalize everyone for a couple of cheater. If we were in person we wouldn\u2019t have this contraint so why put it ?",

      "text": "Mine is the same except it is 1 question per page. Like dude we are using a lockdown browser with video and mic on, if someone was cheating you'd know. It really hurts people with test anxiety (like me) who will skip around a test to do questions they are comfortable with and then come back to later questions. I have the final tomorrow and know it'll be the same way.",
