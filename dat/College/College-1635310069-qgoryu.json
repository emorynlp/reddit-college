  "text": "I feel so frustrated because I feel like I am putting so much effort into my school work and dedicating my whole day to just doing homework but I am still doing so poorly in my classes. In most of my classes, I have like a high C, which is not too bad because I still have time to make it up. But it is just so discouraging because I feel like I am doing everything, going to tutoring talking to my professors, and I'm still doing mediocre. Not to mention I am a terrible test taker so that really does not help my grade. \n\nJunior year is kicking my ass I don't know how everyone else does it. Like I know they're struggling but at least it's paying off you know, they're actually doing ok. But I feel like I put in as much as I can and nothing comes out of it.",

      "text": "I don't know how to help per se, but I do want you to know that you're not alone. I spent two weeks revising for my first biology test, did the required and extra readings, emailed the prof about questions, and studied really hard! \n\nI got a C- \ud83d\udc80\n\nBut I'm also noticing this pattern of working super hard and not seeing my grades reflect the hard work I'm putting in. Makes it hard to give it your all. Just know that you're not alone, and if you need help, you can try asking other classmates (if you know them) to study together with you. Maybe our study methods are just not efficient enough haha",

I try to keep a positive mindset daily and think it's a new day to do good things. Usually at night is when I have my mental breakdowns, haha but then I am good as new. \n\nAlso if you have any studying tips I would greatly appreciate them.",

      "text": "First, that fucking sucks and is disheartening. I'm sorry your struggling and hope you get an A at the end of the year. \n\n\nThe rest of this is just going to be rambling problem solving, so ignore if you don't want that;\n\nI'm going to be honest, spending a whole day makes me wonder if you either don't have good study skills or have another issue. The terrible test taker specifically for the second. If you have something diagnosed, even Depression or Anxiety you can often get private / semi private exam rooms if that would help the stress? \n\n\nOther thoughts for study skills stuff;\n\n\n* Does your school have study skills tutors, can your tutor focus on that for a day or two? Outline how you study and have them suggest things to adapt? \n* Are you organized, are you on time? If you aren't everything suffers. Try to both have all your appointments (class, work) and due dates written down. Schedule blocks of time to study then weekly / day before write down a to do list of all the things to study (and probably adulting stuff like pay bills too) You need to know exactly what to study to avoid wasting time. Personally, I feel writing this down at the end of the day or after studying better. Before studying it kills my vibe.\n* You also want to confirm if your missing any previous knowledge. Math and science is the most obvious place for this. Ask your professors what is needed if your struggling with some physics, do a math placement test and go back and re-read how say trigonometry works if you forgot and it's kicking your ass. Humanities can also suffer for this if your writing is poor or citing isn't up to snuff. I've never been good at figuring out how to fix that, I just enlist everyone to read it and help me. Also comment your code if CS. \n* You need to self test and confirm what you know and don't know. Anki, Quizlet and paper flash cards are good for this. Notion with questions if you hide the answer below. Teaching other people. Reading and going I know that isn't great, as your mind will often lie to you. Actual testing where you can't see the answer is best. \n* Take notes on reading, at least summarize them. Speed reading an article for discussion isn't super useful when your teacher asks the impact of blank on blank, at least mark the important stuff on the edge so you can go uhhh look down and expand.\n* Read related textbook chapter (or wikipedia article, or short YouTube summary) before class, this helps lay the groundwork of learning about the topic so it's not brand new. Personally I try to do this before class or the day before. \n* Try to do all the questions in the textbook / assignments. \n* Go to office hours semi regularly, professors are human and tend to grade nicer if you do. Ask what you missed, how to study blank topics.\n* Don't burn out. I'm off the opinion college is a full time job, which means if your working more then 50 hours on school something fucked up. Give yourself at least one guilt-free day off a week, and some hours of study free time. Obviously this is harder if you work, but if you can study between classes too you can usually have some free time in evenings.",

          "text": "thank you I will definitely take this into consideration. I do have depression and my anxiety has been getting worse lately. I will also admit I have had major issues with procrastination for a long time but I do see myself getting better at time management and I now actually put things down in a calendar. \n\nI also decided to drop one of my classes because I was struggling A LOT in that class and I honestly did not find that class a priority considering I did not really need it for my majors, I just needed to fill a perspective. Hopefully, that gives me more time to focus on my other classes.",
