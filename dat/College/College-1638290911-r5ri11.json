  "text": "College freshman here, I'm considering taking a course over the winter break. I was originally going to take it next semester as it is required for my major, but didn't get into the class due to limited seating. It is available as a four week online course over the winter break, for $1600. The price is outrageous but taking it over the winter would mean I could do 4 classes next semester instead of 5. \n\nI could take the class next year, but I'd like to get it over with as soon as I can. Any recommendations/experiences from taking courses over winter break /",
