  "text": "So  I took a test today on the blackboard but with the google tab open on the side. Being the dumbass that I am I just forgot to close it cause I was just so nervous for the test. The test was not conducted with a lockdown browser or Proctorio, and it was just on google chrome and the blackboard website.\n\nThe question here is: **Can blackboard detect that I have an extra tab open or have switched tabs**? The professor strangely walked towards the end of the room which was where I was sitting. Was he checking to see if I was cheating?",
