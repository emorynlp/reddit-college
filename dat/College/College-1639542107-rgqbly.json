  "text": "Currently I am trying to get a degree for Nuclear Med. Technologist. Right now I\u2019m doing the pre-qualifying courses like chemistry, physics, etc. I\u2019ve read only it might be easier to do Radiography first before getting a Bachelors in Nuclear. Med. Any thoughts? I\u2019m in a 4 year university but don\u2019t want to transfer out\u2026.even though it might be easier to do a community college for Radiology.",
