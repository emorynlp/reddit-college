  "title:": "Too \"lazy\" to do work. Any suggestions? Please help.",
  "text": "Recently, I've been unable to do any of the schoolwork, no matter how much I try to bring myself to do it. At first I looked at it as a sign of laziness and lack of discipline. I viewed the getdisciplined subreddit for some tips. However, when I start doing the work, it does not simply flow smooth for me as people simply suggest. This essentially happens for assignments that I find absolutely boring. They feel like such a terrible pain to do. So I immediately get distracted without any will to touch them. I've read that you have to learn to accept the pain now to be less stressed later on. However, this just doesn't go for me. Even fear, the biggest motivator, doesn't do it for me. The fear makes me stressed to the point of sweating, but it is hard to get myself to do work.   I know that such behavior during education often leads to struggling to survive working a minimum wage or even being homeless. I wish I could be the person who could work 16 hours a day, achieving their goals and dreams. Any suggestions on how to get out of this terrible mental state?",

Something is better than nothing. \n\nHave it in your mind that the due date is one or two days sooner than it actually is. For example, if it's due on a Tuesday, have it in your mind that it's due on Sunday or by Monday afternoon.\n\nSee a counselor or someone who can help you to discover or understand what is causing you to lose motivation.",

Even if it\u2019s here on reddit.\n\nMy two cents other than what I wrote above: \n\nI believe that if you\u2019re prompt about moving forward and getting some assistance, the school and your professors should work with you. Please don\u2019t put this off though. If you find yourself deep into the semester and you haven\u2019t spoken up/sought any help, your professors will be less accommodating to your situation.\n\nIn addition: \nRemember that a house is built one brick at a time. It\u2019s okay to start small and go from there. 16 hrs is a lot of work to do daily. If you burn yourself out, you might get discouraged / not be efficient the rest of the week. If you start off with a couple of hours per day, that\u2019s a bit more manageable to get started with homework/ self-improvement. \n\nGood luck to you, be well!",

      "text": "I still struggle with this. If it\u2019s like me, it\u2019s procrastination. There was an article that circled reddit a while ago suggesting that procrastination stems from fear rather than laziness.\n\nSo for me it\u2019s just fear that I won\u2019t know how to do the homework immediately, or that I won\u2019t do a good job on it, so I\u2019ll shut down and not do it. For things that I know I know how to do, I can do it easily (is this the case for you?). For long lab reports and papers, or classes I\u2019m confused in, I have the same feeling as you.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to do small bits at first. Figure out how to do one thing, and do it. Then do the next. That\u2019s what people talk about when they say you\u2019ll be able to do it once you start. You start to gain confidence that you can do it, and it becomes easier. For a long assignment, it still sucks, but for that just give yourself time and do sections at a time so you don\u2019t get burnt out. \n\nHope that helps.",

Some other kids have been practicing since primary school, so studying in college is second nature, taking a manageable amount of will power.  If you haven't, of course it's normal to run out of will power.  We gotta work with what we got realistically.  \n\nSo, focus on one good habit you know you can easily do.  You can pick an easy-to-obtain studying goal for your worst class and record progress via the r/theXeffect. For example, you can study a class an hour per day, 20 minutes at a time, with 5 minute breaks *off-phone.*  Halfway through the semester, studying will be routine.  When you fall out of habit, be amazed with yourself when you start up again instead of beating yourself up.  It's a rare feat to get back on track!",

Whenever you know you are doing something only to procrastinate, stop it immediatly. Even if you just stay a couple minutes doing nothing.

I'm not kidding lol. It sounds to me like you've put a lot of pressure on yourself, and that pressure is holding you back more than helping you, especially since you also said fear isn't working as a motivator either.\n\nDon't just check out entirely from your obligations, but do some fun stuff, forget about it for a bit, and then come back later. There's a difference between procrastinating, and just knowing when you're wasting time. Staring at the work blankly trying to convince yourself to do it isn't going to get it done, so when you feel like that, take a break and try again later. You'll likely catch yourself in the right mood for it eventually, get something done, feel good for getting something done, and then just ease yourself into it over time. That's what I'm doing right now writing this post at work instead of working lol.  \n\n\nedit: everyone else seems convinced you have depression or ADHD, but that seems quite extreme from the info given. You're probably just stressed and burned out, and ascribing a mental illness because you don't want to do boring and unfulfilling work seems silly and honestly dangerous.",

That's an unreasonable expectation.\n\nI work maybe 3-4 hours a day tops.\n\nAnyway you're psyching yourself out. First let me give you some advice my professor this quarter gave everyone. If you are given a task you really don't want to do or you think is impossible spend five minutes and five minutes only freaking out. It's important to give yourself some time to grieve if you really need to. But only give yourself five minutes. After that get down to it.\n\nWhen I get a task I really don't want to do, I kind of work around it instead of directly at it. For example I'll think of the easiest thing I can do to make the task easier. If I have a large homework assignment, I'll just go through and underline the important parts of each question without actually trying to do it.\n\nIf I have a project to start, I'll read the instructions and underline or mark the important requirements.\n\nThen I'll try to break up the project or assignment into easily done small chunks. \n\nThen when I actually need to sit down and do work I'll only work on that chunk for thirty minutes. I'll set a timer for thirty minutes and make sure to focus only on that thing for the thirty minutes and nothing else. I'll put my phone away and block my favorite websites.\n\nThe reward will be being able to use those items or some other reward I give myself. Have a reward for working thirty minutes straight without distraction.\n\nIf you fail, no worries. Just try again until you can do it.\n\nIf after thirty minutes I feel like I'm on a roll I'll keep going.\n\nTry this out.",

Keep this habit and you can actually achieve everything.

This caused me to shy away from my work and do subpar in classes as I didn\u2019t turn in a portion of my papers. However, the papers I did do and nearly all tests I aced. Figured I was just selectively lazy as I aced my SAT with a high enough score for automatic acceptance into my school of choice even though my class rank was pretty shitty tbh. \n\nFast forward into freshman year in college I failed nearly all my classes because I didn\u2019t show up and couldn\u2019t force myself to go. Branded myself a failure as my parents withdrew any financial support and I was forced to stay home this year. I decided I really needed to do something about it and went to a behavioral health specialist. Took a shit ton of behavioral tests, genetic testing and a DNA swab. Turns out I\u2019ve been manically depressed all along and the avoidance of schoolwork was just a symptom of this issue. I never got tested before because I was terrified of being labeled as such. My personal physician chose to put me on a mild antidepressant to even out my moods and then phased me into vyvanse. Since the beginning of this treatment I\u2019ve become a remarkably different student and am able to work for periods of 8 hours on end with little to no concentration or confidence issues whatsoever. The world now feels like such a brighter place and I have so much hope for my future years.\n\nI hope you get the help you need op, even if it is just a study group or club; no one deserves to live out their college years like that. I wish you the absolute best.",

It also forces you to take mini breaks to refresh your brain",
