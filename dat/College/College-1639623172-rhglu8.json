  "text": "Im a 20M majoring in business \n\nI\u2019m on my second year and I just finished my 3rd semester overall. I\u2019ve been doing very bad from the start. I just haven\u2019t felt motivated but I don\u2019t wanna give up. I know I\u2019m not stupid I just don\u2019t really care. \n\nAt the rate I\u2019m going I\u2019ll have to retake multiple classes in order to move forward (mainly because I didn\u2019t put any effort into my gen ed courses). \n\nHow do I start to change? I currently commute, should I try to move on campus at a different school so that I can be in a new environment ? Should I take a break? Every semester I\u2019ve been overly stressed trying to balance work and school. I started off the year with 5 classes and dropped to 4, but even that felt like too much. \n\nAny advice is appreciated",

      "text": "I would recommend taking a gap year and saving some money, but that is dangerous in your position. I had a friend that said he\u2019ll \u201ctake a break\u201d and 5 years later he is still on a \u201cbreak\u201d. You really need to put effort into college because if you don\u2019t, then don\u2019t bother getting a degree. It takes effort and dedication and if you can\u2019t do that then don\u2019t even try. I have been in university for 5 years and this next semester is my final semester. It took so much dedication, mental and physical energy to get this far. I am proud of my degree because i worked hard for it.  \n\nHonestly start with a community college if you are having this much trouble with the classes. You\u2019ll get your associates which isn\u2019t as good as a bachelor but it\u2019s a degree and shows your dedication. With that degree you can then transfer to a university that will accept your credits and then you will only need to take the core classes for your major. \n\nBut again if you aren\u2019t going to give it your all and put dedication, effort and time to get your degree then don\u2019t even try.",

I have just had a lot of real life stuff happen that distracted me very easily.

If you so, you\u2019ll have to accept that sometimes college can be boring and pointless at times but you have to push through. Throwing money away on dropped and failed classes is just lighting it on fire.",

Do you have roommates or are you trying to live on your own or support a family? Do you have family near a school you could possibly live with to save $$$ and fo us on school? I know it's not an option for everyone but I hope you find some support for your situation.   Also, counseling can be really helpful for clarifying goals and plans.  Best of luck to you.",

But as a public health major, I may be making the Dean's list this semester and am so passionate about my studies.   \n\n\nSometimes it's something internal that you need to address. Maybe your burnt out or just struggle with motivation in general. But it may be worth assessing your studies and determining if you're happy as a business major or if it's worth exploring other options that may make you happier and be easier for you to manage.",

I recommend reconsidering what you want to do after school, like what really motives you to take an extra step regardless of the stress. I personally want to succeed in the med field, but in high school I only took 1 science class, which was bio. I had to study 3x more compared to other students since I didn\u2019t have a foundation in some areas. If you need more time to think about what career you\u2019d like to invest in, then a gap year is definitely something you should consider. Who knows? You might love traveling to the point of wanting to study skill sets and gain a certification online to work remotely. I also get really stressed when it comes to school work, but the method that actually helps my study tactics and overall sanity is to relax and have a good time during the week of tests/exams. If you have a relaxed head and mind, you\u2019ll be more eager to retain information (that\u2019s me though)",
