While my GPA and everything was pretty good in college and I graduated with honors my main focus the entire time was how many credit hours until graduation and how I can get an A in every class I had. If not that it was how could I get into certain programs/internships. While, a lot of my plans were demolished with COVID I still was able to accomplish some things. What I\u2019ve learned is not to have too much hope in anything and as much as you may try to plan stuff things happen in their own time. For instance, I did not plan on being a part time grad student at the same university I got my undergrad for a year but it was a needed break and has helped me to get into grad school. This summer I have been accepted to a fellowship at my dream university that I plan to transfer to next year. So, things will happen don\u2019t rush them.",
