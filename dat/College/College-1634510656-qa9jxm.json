  "text": "Hello!\n\nSo a little background - I attended CU Boulder for a year and studied media production and this was all in the 2019-2020 year. After deciding it wasn\u2019t for me, I was asked to decide in the moment what interests me. I said game design, and that\u2019s what we ended up going with so I left my home state behind and went to another to study game design. After starting classes, I met with my advisor who told me regardless of my transfer credits I had to stay for 4 years (5 years of college total) which I thought was dumb and I clarified multiple times and he was certain that was correct. After that year, I\u2019ve changed majors to game sound design to specialize in something that\u2019s a little less draining (I truly hate game design and the process it\u2019s just not for me) and my new advisor told me that staying here for 4 years was complete bullshit and that whoever told me that was wrong. So imagine my frustration being told that I was gonna be here for 4 years anyway so I might as well change to another major, and then hearing that it was not true and if I stayed in game design I might be able to graduate on time. How I\u2019m here, doing 4/5 classes that I can\u2019t stand, wondering why I\u2019m even bothering at this point. This degree won\u2019t even land me a job I want but it feels like being a second year (should be third) it\u2019s too late to change. What I\u2019ve found is that animals truly light my brain up and that\u2019s something I want to be around but my school offers tech only majors so my question is, what\u2019s the smart decision here? Not asking for anyone to make decisions for me, I just would like to hear what you guys would do in my situation or hear some advice from anyone with an outside perspective.",

      "text": "You hate game design. This will be your career and what you will pursue after college. I'd change majors- or see if you can either make it a minor or double major, if you prefer. If you get financial aid or scholarships you need to speak with them right away (and get it in writing if possible) what your options are, if aid will cover longer etc.  Year 2 out of 4 is really early on. You probably have some courses that could be used towards another degree requirement?\n\nTalk to career counseling if you can and try  to figure out what you're truly passionate about. If you can afford to, maybe you should try to take a class or two in things you may be interested in  if you don't know, so that you can really have a good idea.\n\nDon't be hard on yourself. Think of it as an experience to learn who you are and what you want to be. You didn't \"waste\" a year in it, you learned that you don't want to do this for life. This isn't uncommon.",

It's good to hear that it's not uncommon, I've just been surrounded by only people that have known exactly what they want to do since they were young and it's scary just now figuring it out this late into college. Set up an appointment with career counseling later this week, I really appreciate the help <3",
