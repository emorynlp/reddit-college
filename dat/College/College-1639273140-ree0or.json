  "title:": "Question about proprietary admissions portals",
  "text": "Are there any disadvantages to choosing a college\u2019s proprietary application portal as opposed to the Common Application or vice versa? The reason I\u2019m asking is because I believe that the common app has a personal statement that is not otherwise included in the particular application I am completing which could be beneficial when an application gets evaluated. I feel like any opportunity to write something is an opportunity to offer insight into yourself and your thoughts.",

      "text": "Most schools usually say that they don't care about which application you use, so I'd say it's up to you. Although, I agree that the personal statement gives you the chance to express yourself to admission officers.",

      "text": "That\u2019s a great question. I hope you receive more feedback. You might try contacting the admissions office at the school(s) to which you are applying and just ask them. \n\nMy only other thought would be if you think a particular school might be a stretch for you to get into, then sending the personal statement seems like a no-brainer.",
