  "text": "Hi, I got accepted as an AOI in biomedical engineering at Stony Brook University. I am also waiting for decision from Rutgers NB for my biochemistry application. My college advisor also suggested I enroll at a community college in California called Santa Monica College which she claims would easily transfer me into UCLA. I am very conflicted about which college to choose. Its true Santa Monica College is much cheaper but as an international student who doesnt drive, I would have to live around it which is very expensive since its a beach area, that'll almost be equivalent to me qoing to a 4 year college. What do you guys think would be the right investment/ offer me the most opportunities. (I should probably mention I plan to pre-med).",
