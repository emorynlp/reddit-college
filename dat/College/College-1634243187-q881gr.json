I'm also poor so I get more than enough in FAFSA money. My advice is give up your illusions of going to your \"dream school\" and find a cheaper public university nearby or if you don't have your Associate's yet then community college. Wait until your 24, unless your parents are poor. Then apply for FAFSA and boom! You get a full ride plus extra money in your pocket every semester! You're welcome!",

The cheaper school may not have the resources for certain majors and depending on the area you may have a very difficult time finding internships.

Under those terms, thought it was reasonable to keep my savings for emergency/pop-ups instead of paying tuition with it. For subsidized it's often a good deal in terms of what you pay (financing costs) versus having to work part-time for that money while in school. If you will be making 3x more per hour after college, it makes less sense to pour in 15-20 hours a week of extra work during college in order to avoid an extra $5k in loans a year. Much easier to hit it on a full-time salary.\n\nI did work 10-15 hours a week in school starting my second year. It was pretty reasonable and payed for gas, food, and fun expenses. Over 15 starts to mess with your socialization and school work, though, especially if the hours aren't great.",

Dependency is using IRS rules, not FAFSA rules.\n\nThere are income phase-outs for the AOTC but it's somewhat high. >80% of families should be able to claim it. It's also not a 100% refundable credit (if you owe $1k in tax and get the full $2.5k credit, you can only get 40% of the $1.5k difference in the best case scenario) so it probably makes more sense for your parents to claim it assuming you don't pay $2,500 in income taxes. My mother claimed it for the first three years with me as a dependent because the benefit for her was much higher. She put most of the credit toward what she was giving me for tuition. The final year, I starting working and took the credit because I did owe enough in tax to use all of it.\n\nThere is also the LLC, Lifetime Learning Credit, but it is less valuable. You can't claim both so you should check qualification for the AOTC first.\n\n[https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/aotc](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/aotc)",

Work, explore, and enjoy yourself. \n\nTurns out college, at least here in the California, wasn't really meant for highschool students. Reason why is that if you want financial aid, you will be considered dependent up until you turn 24 years old. This means that, unless you are legally independent through court, you will always be required to use your parent's tax information. This will disqualify you for most financial aid assistance.\n\nI started community college when I was 23 years old. I still remember the bullshit problem with financial aid. I was living on my own, but still needed to use my parent's tax information even though we lived in two different places. I was disqualified until the following year. Most of the friends I graduated with all graduated as they turned 24-26 years old. Most didn't qualify for financial aid up until their last semester. They needed student loans to get through.\n\nAlso, something I learned, but the 150% unit cap on financial aid counts per college. I took a bunch of automotive tech classes before I switched majors to engineering. I had accumulated over 70 units in automotive tech and maxed out my assistance as soon as I started engineering. Had to transfer to another school to finish my transfer.",

There is also an abundant amount of money from scholarships that students don't even use so it can be a great place to start and decide what and where to go from there on.",

You're going to be zapped of time. \n\nWith all of this said, anyone who works full time and goes to school full time is an incredibly hard worker and are worthy of respect.

Do you have a Netflix or Spotify subscription right now that you pay for every month? Paying a loan back will be just like that except it will (obviously) be much more expensive. However, if you go to college and get started in your career when you\u2019re paying them back, your income will also be a lot higher so it\u2019ll be balanced out.

I would also work in the summer and save around $2,000 to cover school and other expenses during the semester. Sophomore and up I was an RA, so that lessened the amount of money I need to cover for a dorm/rent, at that point FAFSA and scholarships covered my tuition easily. \n\nThroughout my 4 years of college I think I asked my parents for about $4,000 total, (around $1,000 each year) Thankfully they could help me out SOME, but I knew they couldn't contribute much more than that.",

      "text": "You want to go somewhere *specific* and *very expensive,* without *any* loans. The way I see it, you have three options. You can take an amount of credits that will allow you to work enough to cover all of your bills, if that is even possible for you. This will probably entail taking more than four years to finish, or an extremely stressful four year graduation.\n\nYou could make applying to scholarships your full-time job. Websites like [https://myscholly.com/](https://myscholly.com/) present tons of scholarships you can apply for. This will not guarantee success, it will just give you a chance. You will need to apply to **a lot a lot a lot** of scholarships if you want your full education expenses covered for four years.\n\nOr, you could be more realistic. I would recommend either finding a school that has a good program for your degree and is affordable (probably in-state), and/or accepting at least *some* loans.\n\nPersonally, I afford college with FAFSA and loans. I also work part-time but that's not strictly necessary, I just want to have money to continuously invest. \n\nI'm not sure why you are so averted to loans. If you graduate with a decently-prioritized degree you will have no trouble getting a job and paying them off. Personally I took out much more than I needed because I wanted to invest. Still, I will graduate with less than $40k in debt, and the starting salary for my career path is like $70k. I currently spend less than $30k a year, so while it would be impractical I could literally pay off my student loans in one year if I maintained my current lifestyle/spending habits. More realistically, I will probably pay them off in about 3-4 years.\n\nEven if I don't get a career-job right after graduation, I can *already afford* to pay off my loans. I make around $14/hr, my living expenses are maybe $800/mo total (rent is cheap  here). Working 40 hours a week, I'd make around $1800/mo after taxes, leaving $1000/mo to cover loans and luxuries and saving. Let's say I put $500 of that toward my student loans- they would be paid off in about 8 years. \n\nObviously this is a different story if you would need like $100k in loans for your school. Your APR would likely be much higher and paying off even just the interest each month would be a challenge without a high-paying job.",

      "text": "I can talk to myself. I acknowledge that my experience may be different from many other people and I am in a very privileged position due to my major and state, but that would still save me some stress knowing that it isn't uncommon. Perhaps, OP is in somewhat similar situation.\n\nI attend GA Tech, CS major. Cost of attendance is around 25K. In GA, there are scholarships that cover most of the price of education, but due to recently moving from another state, I won't have them until next year. I do though have a low-interest state loan for 8K/year, FAFSA need-based grants and loans for 5K/year, and we took a Parents PLUS loan for the remaining money. Unlike other federal aid, PLUS loan is not need-based, and it can be given to almost anyone. And if you are denied, you get extra FAFSA (for a lower amount tho).\nI had a discussion with parents about it, and we decided that they'll take it, but I will have to repay them the whole sum when I graduate. I know it is uncomfortable to approach parents about it, but they may not even know of that option, and they definitely wish you all the best and will possibly agree to take that loan. \nI also decided that I'd rather go to the dream school, and live in a cheaper dorm than get the best amenities elsewhere. That saved like 3K. I am a transfer. In the previous college I also worked, made like 10K per year. That would be helpful here, but unrealistic in this course load. I work much less, the money is just enough to cover everyday expenses. So, just spare money when possible and perhaps consider finding a part-time job. \n\nIn my case, my dream school has a substantially higher starting salary in my profession than a worse school where I started out that gave me nearly a full ride. So, it just financially paid off to take out some more loans and transfer. Realistically though, even if you take, say, 60K in loans and I even blow up the interest, you'll be paying it back for 10 years after college. That's no more than 7.5K per year. It is a lot, but it is bearable, unless you are pursuing a degree that isn't very wanted by the industry. In that case, my experience is probably inapplicable. Try seeing the difference in median starting salary for your major in the dream school and in other ones that accepted you. For me it was nearly 15K per year, so the choice was pretty obvious, it would surely pay off unless I flanked. In that case, however, I think you don't have to repay federal loans, but I am not sure.\n\nIn any case, I really wish you good luck!\n\nP. S.: should've better read your post. If you are international, American education is very expensive. You might want to consider getting bachelor's in your country and then Master's in America, I have many friends who did or plan to do so (I am a foreigner, though a U.S. permanent resident). They say, it is easier to get funded for masters. Also, you might want to consider education in EU, it is ultimately cheaper. The idea of refusing to take loans is unrealistic in American education system, unless you are either very rich or at the same time both very poor and willing to go to a cheap university. Unless you are an elected politician, the position against taking loans is unproductive, it is just the American reality.",

You can either work enough to cover the rest out of pocket while you go, or work and save enough now and put off going for a bit. If you can avoid a dorm that will possibly save you a good bit of money as well depending on the area. I never did the dorm thing and I probably saved a couple thousand a year at least, while having my own place. Getting roommates could make this even more affordable.\n\nA possibility I haven't seen mentioned yet is looking at companies that provide tuition assistance.

(none of them are private luckily) My parents are paying for my housing so I'm thankful to have parents that can afford to help in this way. I see it as a future investment for myself. If I don't go to college, it will be significantly harder for me personally to get to where I want to be.\n\nTaking out loans isn't a horrible idea but just requires planning. I'm majoring in computer science and want to go into a lucrative field so I don't see myself having issues paying off my expected level of debt. If you want to go into a field such as therapy or education, it may not be the best idea to put yourself into 100k debt.",

After your service you get access to the GI bill which will pay 100% of your tuition and they cover your housing. They will literally pay your rent while you go to school and it\u2019s calculated based on the cost of living in that area. It\u2019s not for everyone. The military kinda sucks and you will probably hate your life if you choose the wrong job. I picked Army infantry for 3 years, shit sucked and I almost got blown up, but it was worth it I guess. If you are just getting out of high school it\u2019s not a bad path as it definitely allowed me to mature and figure out what I really wanted out of life. Plus you can knock out general classes on the side while you are in. So here I am in school, debt free, and living in an apartment by the beach paid by Uncle Sam. It\u2019s a sacrifice and it\u2019s not for everyone but it\u2019s an option for sure. You say you\u2019re international so idk if this will help you, but I was in the same boat when it came to college and that\u2019s the path I took.",
