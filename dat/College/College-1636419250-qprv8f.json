  "text": "I know I won\u2019t be with my college classmates forever but seeing them close to each other and having circle of friends, makes me feel so left out and wish I also have friends in my class. anyways, we are block-mates, we will be together for the whole 4 years, and we are on our 2nd year. It\u2019s hard to me to find some friends because I am such a reserve person. Anyone who have experienced like this? Or who are experiencing exactly the same with with? What did you do/what are you doing to make you feel okay?",

I was once a reserve person too (I still am but more controlled now) but I learned to blend with others so that college will be bearable. Start conversing with one or two people during your group work or in your seat then continue from that till you meet their other homies.",
