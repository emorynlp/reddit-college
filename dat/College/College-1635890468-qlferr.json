  "text": "    \n\nI am currently a junior mechanical engineering student and i foolishly took like all 8 of my required electives and maths and now I am stuck with only mechanical classes for the rest of my undergrad and that sounds like it is going to suck, is there anything i could do? I like engineering but i feel like I need those occasional \"fun\" classes like history or film appreciation in order to not lose my mind.",

I\u2018ll (possibly) be taking a drone fundamentals course next semester which is one credit. It will prepare us to take the test to get our professional drone flying license. \n\nIf not, then you could possibly try learning about a fun topic on your own. You could find some free courses online in some topics.",
