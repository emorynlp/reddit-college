  "text": "I promise I\u2019m not posting this for validation. I just honestly want to know how a report card like this is judged for a freshmen who just finished their first semester. For context, at this point in time, none of these classes are related to my major. Additionally the only A I got was from of the freshmen seminar classes everyone first year had to take. So, thoughts?",
