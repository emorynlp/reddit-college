  "text": "I'm a 24 year old drop out. After failing repeatedly, I got diagnosed with ADD. My doctor suggested that I drop out of my course and do something I like. \nAfter giving it a lot of thought, I realized I like cooking, talking about food and everything else about it. I want to produce food videos for a living I guess. \nCan y'all suggest some bachelor's courses that would get me work in companies like Tasty or Bon App\u00e9tit? \n\nP.S: I'm sorry for being all over the place I just popped a ritalin with some coffee. It has worsened my anxiety. \n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",
