  "title:": "Is it worth emailing the professor about taking a late assignment?",
  "text": "Honestly, this was all on me. I was working on an assignment worth 10% of my grade super last minute and it hit 11:59, which is when it was due so, I thought I could still get away with it. I submitted it at 11:59, but it wouldn\u2019t let me. So, now I feel like I wasted a lot of time because I spent a good chunk of time on an assignment that I ran out of time to submit. Furthermore, it\u2019ll drop my grade from a 91 to an 81 ( and I need at least a 77 to pass. I still have my final which is worth 25%). The professor has a no late assignment (unless discussed prior to the due date/time) policy. Do you guys think it\u2019s worth emailing the professor or I should just accept it and move on (I\u2019m thinking this is probably the answer). Especially considering the professor already extended to deadline. And I guess it wouldn\u2019t be fair to my classmates either\u2026I guess I\u2019m just bummed because I was doing so well in the class and then bam!",

Unfortunately, I missed the deadline by seconds.\u201d Worst they can do is say no. You never know, they might give partial, or even full credit. I think it\u2019s absolutely worth a full letter grade",
