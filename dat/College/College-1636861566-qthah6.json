  "text": "I have 5 weeks to go in this semester. The workload is really starting to ramp up and all I do is eat, sleep, work and school. I have mental illnesses and I know I should be exercising and taking time to meditate and be mindful, but I'm so strapped for time I can't do it! Even when I do have a little bit of free time I want to sleep, not do anything. How do you guys make time to take care of yourself and what do you do when you have no/little time? I AM SO STRESSED I CAN'T HANDLE IT, how do you find the motivation to do anything but homework",

First few month were really hard ngl but that runners high hits different. I also have a challenge with my cousin who is in grad school to walk/run everyday until 2022 and if we don\u2019t we have to Venmo the other a dollar for everyday we don\u2019t go for that run/walk. You\u2019ll find your escape.",
