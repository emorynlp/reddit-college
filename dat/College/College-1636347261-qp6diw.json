  "text": "I'm a freshman pledge at a good frat at large state school. The other day, one of my closest girl friends told me that her whole sorority loves me and thinks I'm adorable. I feel like I'm developing a reputation as a best friend, not as a guy that a girl wants to get with. The same kinda thing happened to be in high school. It's not like they think i'm gay or anything, like its not a gay best friend situation, but I feel like they all view me as a friend and nothing more. What should i do?",
