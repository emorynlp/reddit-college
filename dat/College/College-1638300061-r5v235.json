  "text": "Soo I\u2019m a freshman in college and I was previously working before I started school in the summer and I think it\u2019s time to return to working. With that being said, how many hours a week would be good for me to work? I don\u2019t want to over stress myself but I also don\u2019t want to make a small amount of money\u2026.",
