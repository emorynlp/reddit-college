  "title:": "Is it appropriate to ask professors questions (related to their field) that are more about curiosity than coursework?",
  "text": "Hopefully this question makes sense. I know it probably depends on the professor. I'm not trying to have an intense discussion or bother him, I just plan on going into his field (forest ecology) and I want to know more about how forest ecologists can research on protected land.\n\nIt's a plant ecology class, and we haven't gone into any research practices or ethics or really anything about a career in research, so I'm outside the bounds of the coursework. But he's researched riparian forest ecology extensively, and I want to research Pacific temperate rainforest ecology, so is it worth just asking him my questions to see if he has the time and bandwidth right now to give me some information?\n\nMaybe it's also a networking opportunity. I only have one other prof (my forest ecology lab PI) that I'm in one-on-one communication with. I'm getting to the end of my program and I don't want to waste opportunities to learn from others in my field and establish mentorship with profs who are willing to help me. I guess since most of my degree has been online I just don't really know the etiquette with this stuff.",

      "text": "Yes, but not in class or pop in office hours. Email the professor saying your interested in the field and wish to talk about it with them. This way they can expect to talk about it and gear the discussion at a more convient time for them. \n\nMost of the time they will often suggest a time outside of office hours. This way your not taking away office hour time from students that need content help and have a longer detailed discussion.",

Don\u2019t disrupt class with these questions, but if they have some time after class or if no one has class questions in office hours you could talk to them then. Otherwise you could email them the questions or email them to find a better time to talk in person.",

And generally people go into these fields because they geniunely love talking about them, so I think he\u2019ll be happy too. I\u2019d recommend just going up to him after class and asking if you can talk to him sometime about research/career stuff. Then he\u2019ll suggest when would be best, like in office hours or another meeting.",

      "text": "Lack of research practices hurts a lot of majors.\n\nI graduated 3 years ago btw,\n\nI was a history major, on the side (this is a freelance thing) I am a genealogist. I work as an archivist as a assistant over the pandemic. I basically just pull records for a person place or a thing. I can freelance many ways including a historical society etc to get on projects. \n\nLowkey, I am in the area, but I am floating with an idea of getting my jd but that\u2019s not number one priority.\n\nI have to take post bacc classes it will not change much what I need.\n\nMy capstone professor used me to see if I could help him finish a book or for him to make a sequel. 3 years later, I got a 5 books on everything but that topic. generation 1 is dying, their descendants are there, but gen 2 is another topic and the early beginning of iron masons. \n\nBut my kicker was I learned where another documents would help a friend on his capstone 2 years after the fact.\n\nI recognize it\u2019s a setup of the advisor.\n\nI can\u2019t help on ecology, I worked with archeologists tho who are professional.\n\nWhat i learned, it\u2019s not bad to ask the professor but there might be other ways to network. As you can tell my capstone advisor did nothing to help me, the archivist role was because I got luckily as this was my neighbor was my boss. She needed someone and knew I had the qualifications",
