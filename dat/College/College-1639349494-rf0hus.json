  "text": "I failed my college algebra course. But it's complicated. The original teacher that was supposed to teach the class was out due to illness the whole semester.  The school originally had another math teacher from the school teaching the class for the first three weeks. Then the school had a stand in take over the course. I was never given a syllabus, course outline, or told what counts and doesn't count towards my grade. This stand in didn't not assign any homework until the second week off November near the end of term and then the homework she assigned was 5 chapters worth of work designed to be done throughout the course. The class also did not have a midterm, weekly assignments or assessments throughout the course. This stand in also did not have any office hours or a school email and she could not answer  questions in regards to the course itself. I want to complain because I feel like if the original teacher I signed for, or the one from the school had taught the class I likely would have passed. To further argue my point I was taking 15 credit hours and have an A in every other class.",

      "text": "Had plenty of bad professors. Had this math teacher that failed 70% of the class with his stupid tests, no other assignments only test counted. It was discreate math so already he made it more difficult than it is. Its not end of the world, retake the class, if want to graduate on a timely manner take it in the summer or winter. What I heard, employers barely care about it nor care about failing a class.",

Simply complaining about the revolving door of instructors probably won\u2019t be enough.  The Dean or administrator that would hear your case would probably be the same person that hired the professor",
