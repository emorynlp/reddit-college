  "text": "I didn\u2019t realize this until I recently took my first exam. I realized I haven\u2019t learned a thing, I just used my notes the entire time. It was open notes and I did well, but I know for a fact I would\u2019ve done better if I was learning in person. \n\nI\u2019ve realized how much our environment matters when learning. I could do homework and study at home, but I did much better and actually retained information when school was at school. There\u2019s so many distractions at home. My phone, my family talking in the background, chores, etc. \n\nI also feel more compelled to go on my phone because I\u2019m at home. For example, at work I don\u2019t even feel the need to browse my phone because I\u2019m at work, I have things to do and customers to check out. \n\nLooks like this semester (probably next semester too) I\u2019m just gonna have to cruise along and try my best to just get A\u2019s.",

      "text": "Teacher here, crashing the thread. First, I feel for all of you. Online is a big adjustment for students and instructors used to in-person classes. I have taught online for more than 10 years with an asynchronous format. I cannot imagine having to lecture synchronously through Zoom. \n\nFor those of you who feel like you learn better in person than online, please do not give up and accept that you are destined to learn less. There are soooo many things out of our control right now: what *can* you control? What are some things you can change about how you learn? \n\nIf you are used to attending lecture then doing the reading, try flipping it. Finish the reading/watching  videos, etc before the lecture. If you already read first, can you make time to review the information more than once before class? If you do not take notes, start. If you do take notes, try a new approach to note taking (https://www.utc.edu/center-academic-support-advisement/tips-for-academic-success/note-taking.php) \n\nIf your environment is loud, can you make changes to the time of day you study or borrow/purchase noise blocking headphones? If your phone is distracting, can you leave it in another room for an hour? Set up \u201cdo not disturb\u201d for an hour? \n\nThese ideas will not work for everyone and they are not a magic fix. The key is to try the changes possible for you and to work towards improvement.  This pandemic has been a wild ride\u2014be gentle with yourself but work to identify what is in your control.",

The content was so trivial and boring.\n\nInstead, I found myself creating a search program, to search through search engines, so I do not have to worry about retaining temporary and redundant information. I figured if I'm smart enough to find all answers for every exam online. I am already at a point beyond what they could shape me into. So eventually, I went from an open and learning student, to someone just pushing through to get a degree. Turns out I went to the wrong institution.",

With English, math, or other subjects that I'm taking, I learn, but they're easier to understand online. Idk, maybe it's just me. I will say, the one thing I do like about this school at home is I only have 1 zoom meeting per class each week, so I feel like we're actually given time to do our assignments, unlike having to go on campus twice a week and having less work time for assignments.",

What matters is whether you\u2019re actually challenged by the material -and- whether you embrace that challenge (or lack thereof) and seek answers (or better challenges).\n\nIf the material seems easy to you, the course was probably going to be easy no matter what. Maybe it just seems easier because you can attend from home. Maybe it\u2019s easier because it\u2019s hard to challenge students remotely. Either way, the onus is on you to decide whether this is material you care to master.\n\nHurdles imposed by commuting, interacting in-person with other students, and completing closed-book exams are poor tests of whether a person can absorb material and thrive in their chosen field.\n\nTake ownership of your knowledge. If you think the course is so easy, try asking for more. Try posing difficult questions, and, if the instructor can\u2019t provide a reasonable answer, see if you can figure it out for yourself (or piece a reasonable answer together based on different sources).\n\nRegardless of circumstances, **many students just go through the motions. The key to intellectual development is not waiting for harder challenges, but seeking them out.**",

I've been working for two years part time in an industry that is only loosely tangential to my degree path.

I did all of the work for the week on Sunday afternoon and it usually only took a couple of hours. Everything was due Mondays at 8. \n\nIt has been YEARS since I took this class and I still remember so much stuff from it because of how it was designed.

Further, if I write a test with the intention of it being open book/notes, then it will be a much harder test than one I would have given in class. It is not unlike the way in which several well-written true/false questions can be significantly harder than a long page of calculations.",

The exams are proctored so no notes there either. If you want to ensure you\u2019re retaining, I would suggest forcing yourself to study and not rely on open notes and book. Good luck!",

I can definitely tell the detrimental aspects of last year's education are affecting me now and will probably affect me throughout the entire semester.EDIT: What I do, however, is sort of half pay attention in class and take rough notes, then re-watch the class and take much better notes at my pace when I can pause, rewind, speed it up, etc.. Takes hours but in the end I have excellent notes and learn better by teaching myself, essentially.",

All we can do is keep loudly vocalizing our dissatisfaction with the deteriorating quality of education being sold to us at the cost of a house. We have all purchased an outrageously expensive product with certain expectations that aren't being met. \n\nImagine if you bought a luxury car and come to find out you can only drive it 30 miles an hour because the transmission won't go past third gear. You would probably expect them to replace the car or refund your money right? So why do we expect anything less from our universities? Why don't they back up the product they are selling? In my opinion, students are WAY too complacent with their situation right now. We absolutely cannot allow this to become the new normal.",

Where it is easier to stay inside than go outside, easier to talk to yourself than talk to them. Depression where, at times, it feels like you cannot bring yourself to do anything but sit and be. But is this a clinical, lifelong \"mental illness\"? Do you really want to give someone the label of \"depressed\" who is stuck in a rut?\n\nThere needs to be a more clear distinction when we discuss mental health. The average college student's idea that they have a fragile state of mental health is based off of a flawed term. Most of them/us are not depressed, but rather, have lost momentum and ambition. And this is the kind of socially acceptable depression that you are campaigning to have made a part of the college institution, the place where we are supposed to challenge ourselves and grow and be exposed to new and contradicting ideas.",

A lot of my professors don\u2019t zoom very well and we\u2019re just talking to a camera or it\u2019s all independent read-the-chapter stuff. I learn best when I\u2019m in the room with my teacher and they can cater the lesson to how they see the class reacting and we\u2019re all experiencing the same thing. If there was a way to make zoom class more interactive I\u2019d be okay with it I think and it might be that my professors aren\u2019t doing a good job themselves connecting with the students. My school is very small and we have really close relationships with our professors a lot of times. But at the same time the interactive element can be disastrous because we don\u2019t all have access to good WiFi or a quiet room or a number of things. I also think seeing myself on camera makes me a bit anxious and more aware of myself than I might otherwise be. I don\u2019t really know, this was all a bit of a rant, but I hope I made at least a bit of sense",

A on first exam, closed book. She uses Khan Academy videos (least favorite), youtube videos, and her own videos are made with [Screen Cast O Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com) which are my favorite. \n\nZoom teachers don't help tbh.

She breaks chapters into 2 or 3 quizzes (10qs each) because it is so technical and we are expected to understand/be able to explain how it works. I would say she links 12-15ish videos per chapter. Some are covering the same thing. For example, she may write \"Please watch *link*, it is a 2:38minute video. I have also included *link* a 6:28 minute video further explaining the hardest bit of the concept to understand. This *link* 5:15minute video is not necessary but recommended.\"\n\nShe includes these links after the chapter recommended study questions. Being able to answer the questions gives us a strong chance and doing well on the quizzes. So she has the questions in the module and the following page is formatted as \"The following videos will help you answer questions 7 & 8 on the study guide.\" And \"This video is to help you answer study guide question 5.\" Or \"This video explains the potassium pump which you need to be able to explain.\" She breaks down the study guide into part A (Ch1A), part B (Ch1B), and part C (Ch1C) so its not as overwhelming and you can focus of concepts instead of getting a vague understanding of the whole chapter at once. \n\nRealistically, you could watch 45 minutes of videos per chapter. You get a strong understanding of the material and you can watch as much or as little as you feel you need. Concentrating on concepts you need more time on is really nice too. \n\nShe also had us write \"reflections\" to cover our discussion bored the week before exam. Its supposed to be a relaxed 2 page  paper where we explain what we have learned using detail and terminology. I studied and extra hour for my exam to write mine. Having to explain concepts to a professor or TA is a great learning tool. If you can't explain it, you don't really understand it. \n\nPersonally one of the best online classes I've ever had and I've had my share. Study tools > Zoom session where everyone is highly distracted by family, kids, other classmates, your zoom background, whatever else you would be doing at that time if there was no zoom. Myself... I have a better study environment at 5am when everyone is asleep & I appreciate being able to re-watch the videos that I need to re-watch. I also prefer watching pre-recorded videos from my professor which were done well, structured, and tech problem/connection free, and don't have distracting classmates included. Death to Zoom.",
