  "text": "I\u2019m in my first semester and finals have passed, I noticed that in one of my courses, exams make up 50% of our grade. Tests 1 and 2 are worth 15% each, and the final is worth 20%. However, the first test was cancelled, and on the second test the professor handed them back, ungraded, and said that it was final preparation. \n\nDoes this mean that our final exam is worth 50% of our grade? If so, that\u2019s pretty unfair considering the syllabus outlines multiple exam opportunities. At least if a grade is entered, for example if our class average was given as the grade, the final exam would maintain its 20% weight. How do you think a professor would weigh the final in this situation?",
