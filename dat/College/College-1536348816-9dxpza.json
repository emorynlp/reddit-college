Someone painted the words \"literally nobody wanted this stupid rock\" on it and it was still there a couple years ago.\n\nOh, and each one of those slabs cost about $10k.

But this is about the time the college republicans decided to invite Milo Yiannopoulos to speak.\n\nAfter seeing what happened when Milo came to Berkely, where there were hundreds of people throwing smoke bombs and starting bonfires the whole shabang. And naturally our school(which has refused to punish students who dressed in blackface by saying its free speech) decided that they need to protect the school from its own students\n\nSo to make sure Cal Poly kids don't burn their own performing arts center down, my university comes and spends a whopping $55,400 on security for the event. And when the Milo finally does come to speak, only about 150 peaceful protesters show up to chant a bit, show some signs and then disperse. No arrests, no displays of force the school had 40 officers with riot gear for jack shit to happen.\n\nThis is actually the second time Milo has come to speak and the first time there were protest but nothing got out of hand, so everyone was super confused when this number came out.\n\nHuge embarrassment and waste of funds",

These kinds of policies can help prevent or offset that.\n\nI mean, I got straight As my first quarter and got my coach to let me out of the mandatory one-class tutoring, but most guys needed some of that stuff.",

Having had a tiny glimpse of a D1 sports program my freshman year and knowing athletes from a number of sports, the tool that practice, competition, traveling, workouts, team meetings, can have on a person is grueling. There was a stretch where a guy I knew on the golf team was only actually in the state 3 days each week because he was traveling for tournaments with the team for 4 weeks straight.\n\nSome of these sports require up to 40ish hours a week outside of class and hw. You can only practice 20hrs a week, but you can have tons of meetings, and workouts.",

On top of that, you are living on your own for the first time.\n\nYour dismissive attitude is ridiculous. I was in band in high school, worked a job, played two sports, and graduated with a 4.6 and 2000ish SAT \n\nThe golf team\u2019s practice schedule included 4-6 practice round a week, ranging from 3-5hrs, but only counted as a max of 4 for whatever reason by MCAA, plus range time, a team dinner usually, 2-3 5am workouts, 2 5am yoga sessions, plus a minimum of 12 units of coursework, plus homework. The guys that made the traveling team often left Thursday night, and got back Sunday night. Sometimes Monday. Friday would be a practice round, about 6 hrs + travel time. Saturday was a day of 36holes, could be a 15hr day, and Sunday was 18 holes plus fly or drive home. That was if it was a 2 day tourney. A 3 day meant leave Wednesday night, and usually fly home Sunday night, arrive Monday. That mean you missed probably 3 days of classes. And for the guys that were good, that was happening every 2-3 weeks. That\u2019s A LOT of missed class time.\n\nYou need to get off you high horse and recognize that some of these athlete might not be as gifted as you are intellectually, and some might evne have too much pride to admit they need help studying. There's a number of reason for the mandatory study policies many schools have, and many of them don't amount to \"they're too stupid\" or \"they don't belong in college.\"\n\nedit: and remember that most sports are far more physically taxing than marching band: I've done both, I know this for a fact.",

If the athletic department wasn\u2019t going to spend the money on the special academic center for athletes, they would probably spend the money on something else that has to do with the student athletes, the athletic department staff, the gameday experience, or something like that. They would not spend the money on parking for the overall University, although they might spend it on stadium parking.\n\n",

Yes I know about all of these with the exception of alden.

I'm not. \n2. If your friends have never complained about OU they don't go here. It's basically campus culture to complain about this place.\n3.

It's because they can make money on those games.  Also thank you for mentioning women's cross country because the student athletes I know are female cross country runners.

Other buildings are being repurposed and the roads up there are being repaved. I have no idea why you think this is a bad project. The town folk are supporting it, and they are usually very against OU administration.\n\nI'm only going on this because this pisses me off because the ridges are my thing. Yes building twenty is getting torn down that is the one I am talking about, but it has not been \"sealed off for decades\". There were offices there at some point and considering OU has only owned it since the mid 90s decades doesn't even really work. Beyond that its not sealed off at all. It's actually the easiest building to get into at the ridges (other than the kennedy museum obviously) because it connects to the offices next to buildings 14,13,18 and there is a door that goes straight into building 20 that is always open and unlocked. Hell some of the staff there will sometimes keep their bikes in the hall of building 20 if its raining outside. ",

But sadly, my excitement was misplaced, because it's ONLY for the Super Special Extra Holy\\^TM NCAA Div. 1 athletes. Cause fuck all those other fake \"club\" athletes who don't dedicate just as much time, effort, and money as NCAA athletes, am I right?\n\nEdit: let me clarify a little bit. There are currently 10 buildings on our campus that are specifically for NCAA athletes, many of which were built in the last 2-3 years. The university is in the process of building another, smaller basketball stadium right next to our basketball stadium because the current attending crowds \u201clooks too small\u201d. Club sports has one small gym with 6 squat racks. They\u2019re nice, but it\u2019s a space we have to share with a dozen or so other teams. And I\u2019ll be honest, I probably don\u2019t dedicate as much time per week as a football player as a rower, but I don\u2019t get scholarships (I technically lose money to dues each year) and I dedicate between 2-5 hours per day to practice totaling to ~20 hrs a week, in addition to personal gym attendance. That being said, all of this is more than worth it to me, because I absolutely love my sport. \n\nHopefully that explains a bit more why I think that wanting the privilege to use an already-constructed multi-sport athlete training/study/recovery center is not that insane of an idea.",

The difference is club vs varsity athletes, and I think it has something to do with Title IX. I think the difference also has to do with \"sanctioned\" vs \"supported.\" Rowing is a great example, because women's is an official NCAA \"sanctioned\" sport, while men's is not, and often, men's rowing teams are just \"supported\" club sports. This means that they may not get official funding from the school, or it is a different type of funding. Club sports are treated as just that, clubs, which means they have to follow a different set of rules. For example, you wouldn't let the anime club use the astronomy department's telescope, but you might let the Stargazer's Club. Similarly, the club sports don't get to use the varsity sport's facilities. Now, whether that's ok or should change is another conversation, but that's the way it is as of now. \n\nE: h",

Women's also participates in NCAA competitions, while men's does not. \n\n>\tWhy wouldn\u2019t both men\u2019s and women\u2019s be on the same (forgive the ignorance) \u201callowance\u201d level? Such as which, of any other sport?\n\nThis goes back to Title IX stuff, [here\u2019s the NCAA\u2019s page on Title IX compliance.](http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/inclusion/title-ix-frequently-asked-questions). Basically what it says is that all students must be offered equal opportunity, in this case, participation in sports. Most sports have a women's and a men's team, basketball, soccer, baseball/softball, etc. So what happens at a lot of schools, is they have a big football team, so to be in compliance with Title IX, they offer women's rowing. There aren't hardly any sports where they're female-only, which is (one of the reasons) why men's rowing isn't \"officially\" sanctioned by the NCAA. \n\nPlease note that this is a very simplified explanation, you have to be trained in Title IX compliance to work in the compliance offices",
