  "text": "Tomorrow is the last day academic day of college. Next I'll be in college for my graduation maybe and some exams. As this semester has come to end, I'm friendships are on deathbed too. I have almost become a loner. \nToday I got to know that tmrw is the last day and it hit me hard. I never knew I'd be kinda alone this day, this will turn out this way. \nIs there anything that I can do to make it happy? Or not show up? I don't know what to do.",

                      "text": "Of course! Only good purposes. I\u2019m actually very excited to see that neuroscientists are finally studying micro doses of psilocybin for depression and PTSD. I do believe that marijuana does have medical properties & everything within moderation; plus if you\u2019re eating it, you avoid the tar! I think natural substances used responsibly were put here for some reason or another for us to use in a helpful way (i.e. marijuana, psilocybin.) But 100%, I will only advocate the use of such things for good/positive purposes! Thank you for the motivation/encouragement\u2026 honestly, it\u2019s been escaping me lately but I\u2019ve been saying since freshman year of high school that I wanted my PhD. I just always worry I\u2019m not smart enough or cut out for it, but then I think about getting stuck in a job other than what I want to do and it helps me remember why I\u2019m doing all of this. Hence the two undergrad degrees- avoid a master\u2019s & go directly to a PhD program (hopefully!) It sucks, but working a career that I hate for the rest of my life sucks even more. I\u2019d like to teach some college classes as well and be a professor that changes even one student\u2019s outlook/life/purpose positively like many professors I\u2019ve had have done for me.",

      "text": "Graduated about 6 years ago. On my last day, I packed up all my stuff rrom my dorm(I live about 2 hours from the college) and rode one last time in my car around campus, reminiscing the last 4 crazy years on the campus (it was so empty since school has finished). After that , drove home after looking at the main sign from afar. Trust me, your real life is about to begin and you will remember that period for the rest of your life when you could be careless and have 0 responsibility",
