  "title:": "How hard will I struggle in an electrical engineering major if I've never taken advanced math or science classes?",
  "text": "I'm thinking that I want to major in electrical engineering, as it's something that interests me. I'm a senior in high school and the highest math class I've taken is standard algebra 2 and the highest science class I've taken is standard physics. I've taken AP English and History, but engineering doesn\u2019t involve either of those.\n\nI know electrical engineering is one of the hardest majors, so that being said, is it a bad idea to attempt that?",

      "text": "The school you attend will have you starting in the appropriate classes so that you can catch up. Your math level would put you a semester behind, but your physics level should be fine. A semester behind isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things and as long as you work hard and aren't afraid of struggling now and then, you'll most likely be okay.",

In addition to this, you can go a semester behind to catch up and get the appropriate level for more demanding courses. Follow your dreams and get that major, wish you the best.",
