  "text": "So i met a guy through a mutual friend back in 2018/2019 (was in high school he was on gap year) so it happened that i got admitted into the same university as him. But different campuses. We planned on going out for a hang out and we did. I went there to confirm if i really liked him and i did get my confirmation. But now the question is how would i know if he likes me or would like me in the future??\nWe've never greeted eachother with a hug or handshake lol\ud83d\ude02.",
