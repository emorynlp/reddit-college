      "text": "I remember going to orientation with my oldest brother at one of the top tech schools in the US. Speaker said, don't be afraid to take chances. That as CEO, he wanted to see kids who have failed a class. They have stepped out of their comfort zone and tried something they didn't know already, and they found out their limits. \n\nThat's stuck with me. I haven't failed a class, but I'm finding my limits. So maybe you keep that B so the CEO knows that not your limit? That you did not scrape by with a C- which is what a Y looks like?",
