  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019ve been here for about 6 or so weeks. The campus is really nice, but I\u2019m having a really hard time relating to anyone in order to make friends. Everyone is either a douche, super rich, or spend all their free time drinking/smoking - which I don\u2019t partake in. I\u2019m about 2 and a half hour drive away from home which sucks because I can\u2019t really go home on weekends, I miss my family and overall just being back home. I just feel like I don\u2019t belong here and maybe I haven\u2019t given it enough time but I just really don\u2019t like it here. What should I do? Thanks for the advice/help!",
