  "title:": "Should I mention to my professor that assigning our homework on Friday and making it due on Sunday is unfair?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am having a bit of an internal struggle right now on whether or not I should speak up about my professors due dates for homework. Our class meets every Friday for lecture and our homework is due on Sunday. This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if I had access to the module before class, but unfortunately I can only see the module the day of class. This means that I have to complete all of my assignments for the course on the weekend. \n\nLast weekend I said screw it, I want to enjoy my weekend, as I had a ton of plans and wouldn\u2019t have time to do homework. I didn\u2019t do the short paper that was due and plan on turning it in late. Do you believe that if I leave a comment on my submission about how the window of time my professor is giving me for these assignments hinders the obligations I have during the weekend my professor may take it the wrong way? I am a good student in the class and have a 99% but considering that a large percentage of our assignments are short papers, I don\u2019t want to get on his bad side. \n\nNote: Late submission is a deduction of 10%.",

That way students with a busy schedule right before the due date can do it early.",

I don't think that's very fair, I have work due Sunday too but we have all week to do it.

You don't need to be defensive and tell him it's a bad idea, you can just say that you love the class and the work, but your weekends are tied up with family/work obligations and you'd like to do the work before hand.",
