  "title:": "How much harder is freshman year in college than senior year in HS?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a senior right now and I\u2019m taking 3 APs plus 1 regular course and 1 dual credit but the workload is more like an hours course and it\u2019s been difficult but I have maintained all As and 1 B so far. I\u2019m also working 20+ hours a week and am Vice President of MUN and captain of tennis. I would say my schedule is pretty full and I\u2019m not sure how much more I\u2019d be able to handle. Naturally I\u2019m wondering now how much harder do you guys personally think it gets from that jump from senior to freshman year?",

      "text": "If you\u2019re running that kind of schedule with no hiccups, then college shouldn\u2019t be a big transition work-wise (provided you don\u2019t go to like MIT for engineering or something like that). \n\nHowever, you\u2019ll be in control over all aspects of your life, for better or worse. In highschool, you legally have to be there, your teachers are motivated not to fail you (in most cases), and your folks are there to help. In college, there\u2019s no external force to get you to class; it\u2019s on you to study, work, and figure things out. You can clearly handle a busy schedule, so if you can keep your motivation up, you\u2019ll be fine.",

      "text": "college is not really harder than hs imo, and it mostly depends on your class load . i actually think it\u2019s easier. i\u2019m a sophomore with a double major and a minor and i\u2019m currently taking 6 classes, have three positions in my sorority, and work an internship, and i still find that i have a lot of free time on my hands. there is far more free time in college, even for me with the max units my uni allows. it gives you more time to study and relax and it\u2019s honestly so much better than hs. you also get to pick your own schedule. if you do all your classes in the morning, i find that it also seems like you have more free time and it makes me feel productive for the rest of the day",
