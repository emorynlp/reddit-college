  "title:": "Working jobs while getting a BS in Microbiology. Possible or am I too far gone?",
  "text": "I am 2 courses away from completing my Associates in Science, after this semester ends at my community college.\n\nI've been talking with the \"higher ups\" within my family/friend circle who are willing to pay for school once I transfer to university. But unlike the past years earning my AS they *might* (and it very much looks that way) just be willing to pay for tuition and books. Not rent, truck upkeep, food, insurance, etc.\n\nIn the past, when I had money (which I have foolishly blown through in my early 20s when I was dumb) I just always did full time school so I'm not sure how I am supposed to keep myself afloat while going through a BS. Supposing I have to work a 40 hours minimum to keep myself sustained... I might only be able to 1 class at a time and it would take me years to complete.\n\nVery confused about how I am meant to accomplish this as I have never really both worked and done college at the same time... it came to my mind I could take out a student loan and pay it back later with money I will get when I turn a certain age, but I'm not sure how I should feel about loans. I am also scared I might go through college and not be able to do it, even if I do class/study/homework for 60 hours a week, leaving me in debt with nothing to show for it\n\nHas anyone essentially worked full time while doing a STEM degree? I'd be interested to hear your thoughts",

I used to work 60 hours a week as a rancher so I guess I'm used to it.\n\n> I only work part time and it\u2019s tough.\n\nHow many courses and credit hours are you taking?\n\n>Have you seen if you can co-op\n\nWhat's that?\n\n>or work for your school doing academic stuff somehow?\n\nNo, what are the benefits of that? Why choose that over say... working at a hatchery where I can prepare myself in a job that is tangentially related to microbiology?\n\n>hopefully, it\u2019d be easier to get it to work around your schedule\n\nClose too, yeah. Now that you mention it they were looking for people to work in the lab or something.",
