  "text": "I made a post a week or 2 back about asking out a girl and I decided to do it. I asked her out after class and all she said was that she would text me and lmk, and honestly based on her reaction I had already gotten the idea that she didn\u2019t really want to go and and she never ended up texting me. I didn\u2019t want to be weird and follow up or ask her why she didn\u2019t so I was just planning on acting like nothing happened when I saw her the next time in class. When I saw her she immediately apologized and said that she forgot and that she wanted to reschedule till after finals and she apologized again after class. The logical part of me is just assuming that she made it up and didn\u2019t want to seem rude (which is fine) but at the same time idk. What do you guys think?",

And anyway, what\u2019s the risk in following up with her? Worst case scenario she says she\u2019s not interested and you\u2019re in the same place you would\u2019ve been if you hadn\u2019t asked her. Best case scenario, she says yes and you have a fun time",
