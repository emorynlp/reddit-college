The easiest way to explain it I think would be to keep your mind active and encourage your brain to, randomly yet consistently, start contemplating something from class. Try to encourage your mind to make connections to other ideas and fields which allow you to think outside of a disciple as well as memorize information without memorizing. Other people might have better ideas though, sorry for being vague.\n\nIt's not something you can do just before an exam, like a study technique, though. However, it basically becomes automated and applicable to nearly all classes with only minor modification.",
