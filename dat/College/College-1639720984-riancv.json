  "text": "This is a honors lit class and I got a 3/10 for a 2 question response. I made two documents with  both being 1 page and a half. The responses she gave me were \u201cWhere is the answer to question 2?\u201d And she also stated that I wrote something that is wrong when I did not even write that in the essay. I am convinced she did not even read the entire thing. I am also convinced she has not been grading anything fairly at all throughout the entire semester. \n\nI\u2019m looking back at my past assignments and we had a quiz filled with questions. The question states how many nights did Gilgamesh sleep? I answered 7. She said it was wrong even though I got it from the video she sent. I emailed my honors college coordinators but I don\u2019t know if anything is gonna change. She has had complaints before and I don\u2019t think she should be teaching anymore. This is a literature class and you can\u2019t even be bothered to read less than 2 pages.",
