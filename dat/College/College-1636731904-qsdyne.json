  "text": "Last week, the dean of our college announced that we will already have limited face to face classes for my laboratory courses that were postponed due to pandemic. These classes are only \"make up classes\" to cover some laboratory courses. It will only run for 2 weeks, 5 times a week, 4 hours per day. It is not  mandatory because my laboratory courses are already graded and we have done experiments virtually only, but the make up classes will be like a supplement to learn the actual experiments. The question is, should I pursue these makeup classes? Cases of COVID 19 in my country is still there and vaccination rates are already high. I already received 2nd dose of my vaccine. My parents and I are still hesitant for me to go back to the university because the pandemic is still there even though the makeup classes will be just for 2 weeks. Also, I don't have a car and house to stay near my university so I will just commute for 1 hour + like the usual that I do during my face to face classes. My parents will not allow me to go/rent dorms. Do you think it will be a good idea to attend the classes for 2 weeks even though there is still a risk of getting the virus? Thank you very much for reading and for those who will give me advices.",
