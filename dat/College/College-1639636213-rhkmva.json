      "text": "Be open to learning. For practically all degrees, there is a disconnect between what you learn in class and what you\u2019ll do at work. College, then, doesn\u2019t teach you all the content you need. It teaches you how to learn. So try to go in and soak up as much industry specific knowledge as you can.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get too caught up in the possibility of failure. Panic benefits nobody. When you get hired, that\u2019s your employer showing confidence that you can do that job. If you can do it, great. If it\u2019s too much for you, that\u2019s on HR for not catching that in the hiring process. And even if you fail, the job market is white hot right now\u2014it shouldn\u2019t be hard to find another job.\n\nCongrats on graduating.",
