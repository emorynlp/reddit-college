I remember one of the things my HS business teacher said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t expect a pat on the back for anything but when you get that pat, make sure you appreciate the shit out of it because they are very rare\u201d. I was told that years ago and still think of it on a regular basis. Keep going, advocate for yourself, challenge yourself and most important is to take care of yourself. Just from you taking the effort to type this post and the words of your professor, I too agree that you\u2019re gonna do great things in your life.",

I worked so, so hard to get my grade up, like really busted my ass for hours and at the end of the 2nd semester my chem teacher came around and showed us our grades and he showed me mine -  a 76.. \n\nI burst into tears right there and i'd never cried at school.\n\nTurns out he was playing a joke on me and showed me my real grade..\n\nIt was an 87, that was pretty good for my books.
