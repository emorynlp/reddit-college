I don't understand why they would pay so much for this one class just for the professor to be so bad. I wouldn't put up with a class like that even though I go to a community college and pay a quarter of what they do. Sometimes you do need to suck it up when that professor is the only option but overall it is your money and your education. I also had a psych professor who was rated badly on rate my professor but I had none of the problems with her that were stated on the website. Sometimes I feel like you have to take rmp with a grain of salt but if you have a professor you can't stand, sometimes it best to leave and just accept that the class wasn't a good fit for you.",

Add the fact that zoom audio quality sucks, and I could only make out about one word per sentence.The next class he went into lecturing. His slides were everywhere and there was just about no text on them so I had no idea what was going on. It was at that point I said screw it and dropped.

So if after a few classes if you don't like the prof, see about switching or taking the class the next semester. \n\nThough, I would recommend taking RatemyProfessor with a grain of salt. I found that they are a bit like reviews on amazon, you're only going to get a response from people who are sufficiently motivated to do so, good or bad. So you'll end up with skewed information. \n\nMy university has professor evaluations available through academic affairs. that would provide feedback from students and any comments they had on that professor. Check to see if your institution has this as well, its a pretty good resource and at least at my uni the evaluation was \"required\" to see the end of the year grade.

Everything from i think this professor is great/bad/whatever, to in depth \n\nI think it was a great resource, as you got a larger sample size, and could get a more \"middle of the road\" as it avoids students that were sufficiently motivated to rate on rate my professor (good or bad).",

Which you could do for free on your own but the school requires you take the damn course. And make you pay $100 for some crummy software to do homework worth only 10% that only 1/3rd of was even slightly covered in lectures. Mind you, the software is designed so bad that it accepts only one variant of the correct answer. I learned in one of my coding classes how they could fix that, but they never do and still force students to pay $100 bucks for it. That's not being challenging, that's being lazy.\n\nI passed my math course because I had an instructor who cared, who took lectures seriously and made everything clear cut. No extra credit, HW was still a low percentage of the grade but he cared and did his job and I passed learning and holding onto way more than the prior classes I'd dropped. And university should be about learning. Also learning about how to apply all of this stuff to life when you graduate.\n\nI've taken more difficult classes since but they've been taught properly as they should. I'm not going in debt for tens of thousands of dollars because I need to \"get good\" at some course some lousy sell out professor doesn't want to teach (for a course that my information security major has probably only used like 10% of since I finished that course).",
