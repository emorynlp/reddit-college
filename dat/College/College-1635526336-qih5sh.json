  "text": "I literally just finished taking a midterm and walked into the bathroom afterwards. On the floor I found a single index card with notes on one of the readings we did for the exam. It\u2019s possible that this could be a study material or part of a cheat sheet. Should I report this to my professor or discard the index card and assume innocence? I\u2019m not sure would trouble I could get into if someone saw the index card on me and assumed I cheated.",
