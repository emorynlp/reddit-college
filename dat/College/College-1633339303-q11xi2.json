      "text": "The only way to study abroad beyond one year is to solely attend a college over seas. (Most American universities require you to take 60-80 credits at their institution in order to graduate from there) People have done this and the experience is amazing but there is a lot of cons to doing this. \n\n- Depending on your major a foreign degree may not be accredited in the states. \n- You will only be able to come home twice a year (winter break and summer) \n- You won\u2019t make networking connections/friends in your home country (during school)\n- expensive to move your whole life there \n\nPros\n- becoming fluent in a different language \n- new culture exposure/appreciation \n- a unique experience that may offer insight into your career that other students may lack\n\nFor whatever school you attend I recommend contacting them and seeing what the graduation rate is for American (i\u2019m assuming you are) students. This will give you some insight into the transition experience at that school. You can also ask them about accreditation & student support.",
