I'm finishing up a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. \n\nMy experience with all my jobs is that the people make it the absolute worst. I'm really hoping that most the people who I dealt with (none of which ever had degrees) won't be in the professional careers I get into after I graduate. \n\nI think the worst part about it was working the shop floor and all the management seeing us as a liquid resource. I heard it from everybody that shop guys just 'come and go'. They didn't do anything to ever improve the retention or anything, they just continued treating them like shit and turning them over. \n\nI have a friend who works at a wood shop and it sounds like a completely solid gig. Nothing like my experiences. He's making excellent money, great benefits and the company treats him right. I had ZERO benefits, worked under the worse management I've ever seen and just generally hated every single one of them dumb dick bastards. Since I was younger than most people in woodworking, that meant that I didn't know anything about anything. I couldn't have a fucking original idea without somebody breaking it down, reorganizing it slightly to pass it as their own. I got tired of motherfuckers telling me how smart I was in the same sentence telling me exactly how to do everything. \n\nI would still be a woodworker if I had found a job like his.",
