      "text": "What I might do is make a list of the concepts from units 1 and 2 that you didn\u2019t understand well or have forgotten. Study just for unit 3 until you take that test, the study the harder concepts from units 1 and 2 for the remaining days before the final. A day or two before the final you might lightly review the concepts from units 1 and 2 that you feel confident on.",
