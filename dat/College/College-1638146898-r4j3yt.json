  "text": "In high school, I got basically straight C's and B's because I barely studied and just spent my time playing videogames but I got accepted into SJSU and then I decided to take school more seriously. I actually spent a lot of my time on my studies, but now I'm sitting at at a 3.4 GPA when I'm taking easy classes. I know this isn't terrible but it feels like I should be doing at least a little bit better. I'm also taking around 17 credits, I have no idea if its a lot or not but i think it's about 2 more than what I'm supposed to take. Is this just some sort of adjustment period, or is it only going to get worse for me when classes start to get harder?",
