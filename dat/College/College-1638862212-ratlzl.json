  "title:": "Are crop tops allowed in college?",
  "text": "I wore a crop top to class and I\u2019ve worn crop tops on few occasions. My professor had told me when I entered class that it wasn\u2019t very appropriate for me to wear. I didn\u2019t think much because again I\u2019ve worn crop tops to the campus and nobody tells me anything. My professor told me that we have to dress a certain way if we want to be professional or however people view us. I was actually confused cause I\u2019ve seen a few girls at the campus wear crop tops and some even wear the bra crop tops. He asked some girls in the class what they thought and they sort of agreed with what he said, but they seemed unbothered by how I dress. So is wearing crop tops to college allowed? Because I thought you could wear whatever you want now since you\u2019re a grown adult.",

Some professors get really serious about \u201crespect\u201d and don\u2019t like students wearing sweatpants and stuff, so maybe it was more about that? But I think that\u2019s uncalled for I\u2019m sorry girl wear what makes you happy",

I notice some professors tend to treat lazy dressers less seriously than those who at least dress more professionally. Not always the case, but it's common.",

If her professor doesn't specifically have policies about dressing professionally in his syllabus its a bit ridiculous to call out a student about it.",

The protections that would be applicable here under Title IX focus on equal treatment. It could be discriminatory, for example, to prohibit spaghetti straps for woman but permit tank tops for men which have very similar straps. Generally for a public university it is a bad idea to have any sort of dress code with gender-specific language.\n\nRegardless of that, you have the right to complain that it makes you feel uncomfortable even if there isn't a technical Title IX violation.",

That said if you need that specific professor for something in the future you should consider their advice about professionalism in their eyes. \n\nThings such as academic research jobs or letters of recommendation or job references from them are often based on the professor and they are very unlikely to recommend you if they don\u2019t think you\u2019re acting professionally. Of course depends on them but most will think this way since professionalism is ingrained in most after years in college.",
