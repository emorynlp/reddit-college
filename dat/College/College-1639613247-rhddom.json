  "text": "I'm going into my last semester of college in January and this past semester was amazing. I got my labs in person finally, our college's gym was open and I could go do work there in the school whenever I felt. (considering I live in a horrible roommate situation currently in my college city, so it was a good escape and break for my mental health). \n\nCollege just sent an email out announcing that since the new variant is here, and cases are going up all classes will return to fully online for the month of Jan (this means my labs will be online again, the gym and college will be closed). my heart completely sank and Idk how to feel. I can't let my mental health go to shit again just when it was getting better. All of last year my schooling was completely online as well and I was depressed the whole year. plus this is my last sem and I was hoping I could end it off well. Hopefully, after Jan cases will go down again but I doubt it.\n\nMy night was ruined :')",
