  "text": "My physics professor was pre-fired after two entire classes dropped and wrote to the dean because his methods are terrible. I couldn't drop it and just had to endure the stupidity. However, as the quarter has progressed in my class of 12 students, he has started lectures later and later, constantly being late to class. On top of that, he hasn't graded multiple assignments weighted at 40%. We're worried it will unfairly affect our grades because he allows us to do corrections on everything except the final itself(from the syllabus), and the quarter ends on Tuesday.",
