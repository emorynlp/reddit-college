      "text": "I'm doing a bachelors in IT, with a later option to get a masters in IT. For my degree there is a decent amount of programing but it focuses more on systems. A CS degree at my college is very,very math heavy, while for IT all I need is college algebra, statistics, and discrete math 1 and 2. On a very basic level, CS people build the systems that the IT people work on. A CS person might build services from the ground up then the IT people support them. You can still get a job as a programmer with an IT degree but I think it will be a little harder. The MIS at my college has 3 different tracks - Security, Software Engineering, and Project Management. So you do have a lot of options.",
