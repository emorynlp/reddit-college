  "text": "Hey guys, currently a junior taking CS. Been a tough semester as my dad was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (months ago) and recently had to take insulin shots daily. Low blood sugar at night was scary but we made it. On November 20th he was so healthy, he had a bad GERD/acid reflux the week before but it was gone the following week. We went out on 22nd and 23rd, he was so full of energy no more problems. I had tests in that week too, which I passed them all. With all seems well, on the 24th dad had a cardiac arrest outside on the street, he was suppose to take me but didn't (his unselfish die, I told multiple times to take me the day before). Someone was with him and called 911. Sadly he passed away a week after at the age of 52, me, my brother, mom, and grandma are a mess. I really can't focus on studying for the finals. I took a two week break (notified the professors). Theres like a void in my heart that I can't get rid off. Thinking of taking a semester off and take many summer/winter classes next fall but I am not sure if its gonna effect negatively in the future. And does FAFSA allow a semester off? Will I be still able to get the pell grant? I also live in NYC, were we get a TAP grant which I am not sure if they allow it too.  \n\n\nEdit: I was gonna transfer schools next semester so I did not sign up for classes (the good professors taken away). What I heard most of the professors that I have to take, the ones that are open now, are really bad. Hence the reason for transferring, but I wanna be with my mom and younger brother now. \n\nThanks in advance, I know this was wordy, I can't think properly right now",

      "text": "So you touched on a couple things, but I will try my best to answer them. Sorry to hear about your dad, when people we care about get sick, it can be such a detriment to our personal lives. And by extension our academic goals. But if possible, I would strongly advise you to just take a lighter course load if you are feeling overwhelmed. It's better to just take 1 or 2 classes I stead of taking a semester off. Your statistically mist likely not going to return once you decide to skip a semester.\n\nSecondly, although I can understand you want to take specific professors for your courses. The reality is not every course you take is going to be from a professor you like. It is a TERRIBLE idea to transfer just because you don't have your favorite teachers this semester. Take some of that stress off and reduce your course load.",

          "text": "Thanks for the help, it really helps me. For the transfer, my parents wanted to move to a new place, for personal reasons and I want to move with them. Plus the university is bigger and a research university, I also had plans on some tech stuff. I think I will take 1 or 2 classes do you know if it has any negative impact on fafsa? Or if I can return full time the semester after?",
