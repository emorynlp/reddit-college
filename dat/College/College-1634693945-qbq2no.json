  "text": "So my prof came down with a flu that's been going around this week and as a result had her in person class on Monday changed to an online lecture, she sent out an email today saying that our wednesday class would also be online because she \"doesn't want to give it to those of us who don't want it because \\[she\\] doesn't wear a mask\" uh... correct me if I'm wrong here but wouldn't the solution be to, y'know, wear a mask? my friday lectures are already online and my tuesday/thursday prof is having a guest speaker come in on thursday from the UK so that's online too, what's even the point of having a hybrid course if I'm only going to be on campus one day out of the week anyways? I don't want to be screwed out of a proper education because of an anti-masker prof",

      "text": ">correct me if I'm wrong here but wouldn't the solution be to, y'know, wear a mask?\n\nCorrect, wearing a mask would have been a good thing for her to do *before* she got sick, to reduce the chance of getting sick.\n\nBut now that she actually *is* sick and actually has symptoms, wearing a mask while sick isn't really the equivalent of not actually being sick.  A sick person can still infect others while wearing a mask, so the best way to avoid doing that is simply not to come into contact with other people.  So going online seems a smart thing to do to me in this instance, given the fact that she truly is sick.",
