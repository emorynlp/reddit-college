  "text": "For the longest time, I have been a homebody. All I did was stay home, play video games, eat, sleep, and procrastinate. This semester is my last semester of HS and community college and I have nothing to do for the next 8 months. I currently work at my community college's STEM Lab as a tutor. I can work for 29 hours a week max and get paid $8.50 right now (goes up to $9.50 once I graduate). I plan on continuing to work there next semester as well but am unsure how I should be spending the rest of my time. \n\nHow could I prepare for college/career in this semi-gap year? I was thinking about teaching myself/learning a new skill. Since I want to do Robotics Engineering I was thinking about learning to program and build Arduino. I also started reading this book on Robotics and AI but I never read it and have been having some attention problems. \n\nCould I also try and solidify all my knowledge in my previous math classes? I won't really have any math once I go to university (because I have all my but like 1 or 2 higher up classes to take) so could I self teach myself more math?\n\nShould I just work more? I could only get $986 to $1102 without taxes a month. I am not sure if I should be saving money up for college or not. \n\nI was also thinking about doing some of the stuff younger me could never do, like Archery.\n\nTo ANYONE who has something they wish they could have done before college, please help me. \n\nI don't want to be wasting time and I am just unsure about how I can best prepare.",

      "text": "If you're interested in Robotics for Industrial Automation, check out this online course package https://www.plcdojo.com/bundles/five-pack.\n\nIt teaches you the basics of the most common programming language(s) for industrial automation products. I did it after I lost my job offer due to Covid concerns. Best money I've ever spent, it will prepare you for industry, make you stand out from other students who have no field practical skills.\n\nI'd also recommend making a linkedIn and starting to build a network in the industrial automation space. There's a really great community that you could learn a lot from. Send me a DM and I'd be happy to share my profile with you and give you names of the people I would recommend starting to build your network with to get great content and grow quickly.",

              "text": "One of the universities out here has a Mechatronics major. So they would be a little more in line with things like what Boston Dynamics does. You'll get a good mix of electrical and mechanical and programming. But it's sort of a newer specialty so you might have to hint around for a program in it.",
