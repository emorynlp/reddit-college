  "text": " Hi there, I am doing my Masters, and instead of trying to scrape by and have an empty degree, I want to take it seriously from now and work on it heavily.\n\nTo do this, I want to have an environment where I can store class files and also make notebooks of my own.\n\nIs there a good online environment I can do these in?\n\nThanks! :)",
