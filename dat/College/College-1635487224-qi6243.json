  "title:": "How can I make more guy friends in college?",
  "text": "\nI am a 19 year old male, but pretty much all throughout high school my best friends have been mostly girls. Currently I am going to a university not too far from my hometown and I\u2019m having trouble making friends at college. I go back home often on the weekends to see them because they are all going to community college there. I really want to make friends with other guys here but I really just don\u2019t know how to find or talk to other guys which is kinda weird because I\u2019m a guy. I would love to be drinking and going to parties and other college stuff but I haven\u2019t known about any or been invited to any. Any advice would be helpful, thanks.",

      "text": "Join clubs that guys might gravitate to(and if there are any you are interested in). You could join a Frat. Or maybe a gym. My school has a gamers club and intramural sports. If you aren\u2019t interested in any of those, try one of the academic clubs or something that involves one of your skills. Then just try and strike up a conversation with someone about it. It should be easier to do when you are discussing something you are actually interested in.",
