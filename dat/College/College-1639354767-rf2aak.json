  "text": "Hi everyone. One of my classes this semester was asynchronous. He decided to give us a group project which was pretty difficult considering it was all online. My group had 4 members. I emailed them all in the beginning and made a group chat. One of them never bothered to respond and eventually never once communicated with us, never showed up to any meetings, and obviously didn\u2019t do their part of the project. So, I did 2 parts of the project. We got our grade back and my sections were perfect, 1 of the other members parts were also perfect, but the other persons was totally wrong so we got an 80. My current grade is a 92.4 (was 96 before project) and I need a 93 to get an A. Is this something I should talk to my professor about to see if he could bump me up?",
