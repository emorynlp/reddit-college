  "text": "So I just started college this fall. I\u2019m doing community college. My plan was to go for computer science but after taking this pre CALC class I want to change my major. I\u2019ve not only realized how she legit doesn\u2019t teach, I was also unprepared in algebra due to taking online school. I used Mathway and didn\u2019t really care much. (Not lazy, straight As in highschool just find math boring). I did take in person honors geometry freshman year of high-school but I hated it and somehow got a B. It was really fueling my ocd and anxiety. Pre CALC is now doing the same for me. I feel like I\u2019m deciding between my mental health or her class which is now no longer a pre req. because my major is not going to be computer science. Not to mention what\u2019s terrifying is 3 test make up 70 percent of the grade. 25% Unit 1 25% Unit 2 20% Final. Homework is 20 percent but they take sooo long (webassign) and legit feel like test for each homework. Math test fuel my ocd and anxiety to oblivion as well. \n\nHow bad is a W on my transcript. Suck it up or drop?",

      "text": "A single W or even a few W's on your transcript won't really be a problem.  What you want to avoid (for many different reasons) is a large number of W's.\n\nMake sure you aren't past the drop deadline for your class yet.  At many schools, if you drop after a certain point in the semester because you're failing, your grade will be recorded as WF (Withdrawn while Failing).  Nobody likes seeing an F on a transcript, even if it's a WF.  This might not apply to you, or your school might not assign WF grades, but just something to keep in mind.",
