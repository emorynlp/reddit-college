  "text": "I recently graduated college last spring as a communications major and have always wanted to pursue a master\u2019s degree in business. I realized that if I don\u2019t do it now, I\u2019ll never do it. It\u2019s the best time of life to do it. I plan to start applying next fall once I have things in order. The problem is that I don\u2019t feel qualified to take the GRE test and don\u2019t even know if I would make it into a program. It may just be a wast of time and money. In my case, the time may be better invested elsewhere for long term career success. \n\nMy ACT score was 18 (13-15 on the math/science section, much higher in the reading and grammar portions). The only reason I got into college was because I went to a private school that didn\u2019t really care about your academic achievements. I did fine in school, I really struggled the first year but made the Dean\u2019s list 2 years in a row once I found stability and changed my major from English to Communications. I have very poor math/quantitative skills, probably around a 6th or 7th grade level. I don\u2019t even know where to begin in the preparations process, it\u2019s very overwhelming given that I don\u2019t know much about the process. I don\u2019t know anyone who has a master\u2019s degree. Does anyone have advice for how to start?",

      "text": "Depends what school. Some masters in business don\u2019t require gre. Do you know what you want to major in? Do you want an mba or do you want to get a masters in a specific subject like marketing, supply chain, or accounting? A specific masters is going to want job experience in that field. MBA can be your local state school or places like Penn state or Arizona state. I think the online programs would be easier to get in. Either way business does require more analytical skills I would join khan academy and start self studying in math. Get up to statistics 2.",
