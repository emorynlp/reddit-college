  "text": "So my school decided to do more in person school to give the students more option. That\u2019s fine and I am happy for those students. What I am not happy about is that instead of creating more in person classes they canceled a few of my classes and enrolled me in in person classes. It is less than a month before classes start. They talk about giving us options but they say they are taking away online classes. People have jobs and the class time are not accessible because there are no options for one class because it\u2019s the same time as another class and this is supposed to be my last semester. Students were working and taking 100% online before the pandemic but it seems like they are not even offering that and forcing us to do 100% in person when covid is still there and being vaccinated is still not 100% protection for those who are at risk.",
