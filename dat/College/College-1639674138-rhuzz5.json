  "text": "I had a strong start to college with a 3.3 GPA. Second semester I had a 2.7, classes were harder. This semester I'll end up with a 2.7/2.9/3.1 depending on whether one or two classes grades round up. I want to improve, and I think I will especially now that I got some difficult classes out the way. How do you guys maintain a 3.5+ GPA though? Like what are your studying habits? Tests seem to be my issue no matter how much I know.",

      "text": "For me personally, it\u2019s all about the prep work. I study during the summer and winter breaks. I study the next semester\u2019s material on day one I\u2019m already ahead of the game. This is useful for me because I work 40 hours a week so it takes off the load when it comes time for tests and stuff. Also doing every practice problem I can either in the textbook or form YouTube videos really helps. Practice makes perfect just like anything.",

              "text": "I guess it depends mostly on your major. I\u2019m a physics major so I know the classes based on my checklist to get my degree like Calculus 1-3. If I just took Calculus 1 and am going to be taken calculus 2 in the spring , I would read ahead into calculus 2 topics. Pretty much goes for any STEM coursework or any class that has material that isn\u2019t\u2026\u201dabstract\u201d. since it all does build on top of what you previously learned and almost every university covers the same if not very similar material (you can Google the topics covered for a specific class). \n\nPS- when I say abstract, if you were like a psychology major or communications major or even art major then I can see it being a bit difficult since it\u2019s (imo, I could be / am probably wrong) not analytical like some other majors or classes like math.",

      "text": "Review everything you learned for the week over the weekend. Use [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/) to calculate when you need to go to sleep to get a good night's sleep before your test. Your brain retains information while you sleep, too. So a good sleep schedule and staying away from all nighters will help you immensely. Going to sleep at a reasonable time will help you on tests more than staying up late and studying will unless you literally haven't studied at all. Even then, I think going to sleep at a reasonable time will still help you more. Also, if you work out a little bit, short jog in the morning, etc. it will help you have better blood flow and your brain will get more oxygen, making it easier to learn and retain information. Even just jogging 10-15 minutes every morning will help immensely",
