  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m looking for a college course that relates to me building and helping people do things like troubleshooting their PC because pc\u2019s are my my interest and if i could find a related course that DOESNT REQURE high grades and computer science because I\u2019m not the brightest child and didn\u2019t get to do computer science due to all the spaces been taken and I don\u2019t have a good memory for remembering everything that the teacher tells me. I\u2019m more of a visual learner and more a hands on person. I was thinking of doing engineering but not to sure if it\u2019s related to my interests.   \n\nThanks for any help in advance",
