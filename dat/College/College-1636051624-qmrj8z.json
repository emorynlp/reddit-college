  "text": "i feel pathetic writing this. to preface, i\u2019m a freshman. recently, i got a desk assistant job at my dorm and i was so excited to work it because it\u2019s super easy, almost too easy where it\u2019s a little boring at times. but i got paid to just sit around basically. \n\nhowever, the hours are shit. i worked 12-3am saturday morning and that had my anxiety going OFF. it was so hard to get sleep that night so it ruined my sleep schedule and this entire week i\u2019ve had the worst sleep anxiety as well as anxiety in general. i had another shift which was 9pm-12am and it just left me extremely exhausted and antsy. i spoke with my manager to change my shifts and she let me drop my 12-3am but i still work 9-12am tuesday\u2019s and 3-6pm on thursdays. \n\ni just feel super pathetic that i can\u2019t handle this job since i don\u2019t really have other commitments. i just think that the hours i have are really incompatible with me and also having my home become my workplace is a little confusing for my anxiety. it\u2019s only been 1 week in and my mental health has just fallen so quickly. i\u2019m really not sure what to do because quitting would just look shitty on my part since my manager already went out of her way to change my hours",
