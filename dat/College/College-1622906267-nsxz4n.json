  "text": "My mom is making me feel like shit for switching from cyber security to game design/animation. I wasn\u2019t happy with cyber security, couldn\u2019t do the work and was just depressed everyday. I explained this to my mom but she brushed it off saying \u201cYou\u2019re not depressed, you\u2019re just lazy.\u201d It\u2019s tiring. She even told her friends that \u201cOh _____ gave up cyber security. Do you know how ridiculous that is?\u201d Her friends are agreeing with her and she keeps telling me about it, just to make me feel shitty. She also makes a point about \u201cWho\u2019s gonna pay for it?\u201d Since the thing I had with cyber security was paid for by this program I was in previously. I just feel so shitty about everything. The only people who support me about my decision is my friends. I can depend on fafsa for financial aid but depends on other factors but yeah that\u2019s it. What should I even do? Continue with what I wanna do and ignore my mom?",

But making anything out of that? \n\nYou know how saturated the market is with these games right now,  while VR is on the newer side and still has room to grow. There is nothing really left in the gaming scene unless you plan on getting into full dive VR type shit, when it's finally done.\n\nRight now only augmented and VR are the closest thing out there right now. \n\nNot sure if you are thinking this through its fine to go for something you like, but don't make the mistake of going into a field that won't even need you when you graduate.\n\nIf you have something planned out though go for it.",

      "text": "I'm going against the grain (and will probably be downvoted for this) but you need to hear this (this entire thread is already full of the opposite opinion).\n\nGame Design/Animation is a very competitive and relatively low-paying career (compared to the software/cybersec/tech sector). Most people who are successful in this field have had this as a passion for a long time and have gone into this field from the beginning with the intention of making it in the industry, not just switching into it because they don't like their current major. \n\nSecondly, you mentioned your losing out of cybersec scholarships by switching majors. Depending on the financial circumstances, it may be important to re-evaluate. It is never good to graduate in debt, especially if the job prospects aren't spectacular. \n\nFinally, you need to consider the demographic of this sub. It is mostly composed of incoming college freshmen or current underclassmen. Most of these people don't have much experience with being a new grad and many have their college paid for by their parents. As a rising college senior who has friends that have graduated this past Spring, a common consensus among those in less employable majors is that they wish they'd done something more employable or worked harder. I often wished I had switched majors (I didn't in the end), but the money that I'm making through my internship and the general prospects of my major have made me a lot more optimistic about my future (compared to had I changed my major). Had I listened to the \"follow your passion\" crowd, I would be in an objectively worse place now.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are the one left to live with the consequences (both good and bad), so it's up to you. Just as a warning, see all those redditors across reddit complaining about their student debt, poor jobs, inability to afford a decent house/healthcare/vacations? Don't let that be you in 10 years.",

Which means in five years, there will be too many graduates and not enough jobs in that field.\n\nGame design and animation has the flexibility to get you jobs across a wider field (but it\u2019s not the easiest major to get through especially if programming is involved). I\u2019d suggest taking a few art classes (intro to contemporary art and animation art classes specifically to learn about how to reach your viewers and how to take a good game and turn into into a meaningful and impactful experience). I would also suggest a few design courses (there are usually game design specific courses and even animation/story design courses that will help to create player impact in your games). This will make you well rounded and much more desirable. I\u2019ve done these (art major and game design minor here) and it\u2019s crazy how interconnected all of these are and how easily they fit into various fields. One of our design grad students animated a birds bones in flight and got scouted by Disney for it. Our art department now has a functioning virtual reality workshop that we\u2019re creating art, games, and mods in that the design and computer engineering schools are constantly asking for permission to use. The more you understand about video games and their different components, the better you will be at game design and the more fields you can actually work in (art, animation, marketing, story design, interconnectivity design, programming, etc).",

If you're getting into game design, keep your majors more generalized (i.e. computer science). If you can't land a job in game design, you won't be totally screwed, and you can still get experience that is relevant to your dream job!\n\nEducation is expensive as hell. Don't pay for a degree if it's not completely necessary, and have a back-up plan. Internships for game design are practically non-existent. How are you going to get experience? What's your plan if you don't get a job in the industry? \n\nFor the artistic side of game design, portfolio matters more than your degree. Otherwise, you need to have a VERY strong understanding of computer science and math. These kinds of degrees will be more valuable to employers and transferable to other industries as well. **Major in what will make you money (get you a job), minor in what you love.**\n\nBut don't you DARE switch because of your mom! Especially to something like cybersecurity! I could feel the dopamine evaporating from my brain when learning that shit. Know yourself, know what you want to do, but most importantly **know what you need to get there.** These fields are tough to get into but nowhere near impossible! Consider all of your options, be smart, and pursue what YOU want to pursue!\n\n**EDIT:** As others have said, don't pursue this industry if you're \"meh\" about it, or not incredibly passionate. I'm talking **game design** here too, not **gaming**. You will drown. The work, stress, and competition is horrendous. Have a back-up plan, and in my opinion, please don't major in game design.

I never did any side projects related to gaming nor have any knowledge of game development. When people say that the gaming industry is competitive, it's not actual development roles. There are plenty of gamers who want to work at gaming companies, but lack any hard skills. Getting a job at a gaming studio with a CS background is not as competitive as people think.

My parents did not pay infact all their financial support to pay for my education went out the window when I said I was going for film. But I was so determined I did not give a damn. And that\u2019s how determined you have to be to take the harder route.

After being miserable and poor for years, I went back to school for  CS and have a much better life as a SWE. However, at the time my parents didn\u2019t help convince me by yelling at me or spewing negativity. As a teenager I didn\u2019t want to have the same career as them even though I actually find the subject matter interesting. It worked out ok though. I didn\u2019t have the focus back then to do well in a stem program. However, I will say \u201ccyber security\u201d as others have stated probably isn\u2019t a great undergrad degree. To do cyber security you\u2019d probably be better off with a Cs undergrad and cyber masters degree, or Cs undergrad and a lot of certificates. It\u2019s difficult to find jobs as a new graduate in that field.",

      "text": "You're listing three different problems here.\n\n**1) Your mom doesn't support you and is talking shit about you with her friends.** You're an adult. If she's paying your tuition and you can safely be in the same room with her, you need to sit down and have a conversation. Explain what you're doing with the degree and what your plans are after college. Tell her that you've heard what she's been saying, and that it's not fair to you. And yes, you need to establish that you've been having mental-health issues that have caused serious damage to your life. If your mom is a decent person, it may be possible to assuage some of her concerns by reaching out. But don't let this discussion turn into an argument -- and cut it off early if she escalates. \n\nIf she's not paying your bills, it may still be worth doing this, but you don't necessarily owe her that conversation.\n\n**2) You're having major issues with depression that have tanked your grades.**\n\nSwitching majors will not fix this. There are miserable, boring, stressful parts to any major in any college. This is also true for just about every job. If you can't endure and get the work in anyway, then something else is wrong. If you haven't sought out professional help yet, you may want to consider it. See what resources your university has available, and what might be covered under insurance. (I recognize this isn't an option for everyone -- but if you have those resources, *use them.*) There's also things you can do at home for self-maintenance. If you're not sleeping, not exercising, and not eating well, this will make any pre-existing issues much worse. If you don't have a routine, and don't have a study spot outside your bedroom, it'll be that much harder to function. I've been there -- ask me if you want me to elaborate on this. \n\n**3) You switched majors from cybersecurity to game animation, and lost a decent amount of financial aid in the process.**\n\nThis may not be a mistake if you have a solid plan in place. Game animation is an extremely competitive field, with long hours and low pay. That doesn't mean it's impossible to make it, but the major will not be enough to get you into the industry. Who are you planning to work for, and how are you planning to get by? Have you started looking into opportunities to build some experience in the field? \n\nIf you *don't* have a plan, well, it really might have been a better idea to grind through the cybersecurity degree and just use it for something you enjoy. But that's ultimately something only you can decide for sure.",

I wised up after a few years and stopped wearing makeup and doing my hair.  I put on slouchy boy clothes and intentionally tried to look as ugly as possible...then I dealt with a whole new kind of harassment, still gender based but not sexual.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, there's not a lot of women mechanics, it just felt so incredibly toxic and uncomfortable for me.  I would come home in tears many, many days. I switched jobs 3 times in 10 years and it really never got any better for me.  \n\nAs far as the actual, physical work went...aside from the constant exposure to dangerous noise levels and scary chemicals, I truly loved it.  I loved airplanes.  I enjoyed fixing broken things and watching them take flight afterwards.  Now imagine your heart soaring along with a plane you just fixed, then having the next customer come in and tell you he doesn't want you touching his plane because this is a \"man's job\" but that he'll happily pay you extra to wash it in a white t-shirt.\n\nIt fucking sucked. 2/5 stars.

People who are highly successful and have good lives leave out the fact that someone put a voice to choose the higher paid passion. I once knew a guy who asked \u201cshould I become a lawyer or an actor\u201d. People said become a lawyer. And he does not regret grinding for an established profession as opposed to being a 34-37 year old grown man delivering pizzas and going on auditions because you need a flexible fast job and you have to go to a bunch of free callbacks before you book anything. I\u2019m saying that as a former actress. It was awesome in my twenties. I\u2019m in my thirties in school for a completely different high paying career.

It\u2019s clear that what your mom thinks is important to you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beneficial to just tell your mom to fuck off and do your own thing.

I completely get why you\u2019d feel depressed as I struggled with the same thing.  \n  \n\nI\u2019ll revisit this thread in a bit but just wanted to leave this note here and make sure you know that a lot of others go through the same problem that you are going through and it can be addressed.",

My grandma is currently extremely resistant to me attending grad school because social work \"is so unlike you\" despite me having studied both my original major and psychology in undergrad. When I told her I got accepted, she literally said \"oh... that's interesting.\" I am home right now for summer and really want to attend but every time I bring it up, she tells me to think about it more and asks if it's really what I want. It's extremely frustrating and discouraging because I was 100% set on it all of the spring semester, and only have doubts because my family is so unsupportive (and a tiny bit because of the cost). I don't like living here bc of an abusive sibling and am extremely anxious not having a definite date when I will be leaving again. I don't want to ruin my relationship, but it's making me feel constantly anxious and stressed.",

Why do you think your grandma is concerned about you going into social work? \n\nWhat makes you want to pursue Social Work? \n\nWill you go into debt by pursuing grad school? \n\nIn regards to the sibling abuse, I strongly recommend seeing a counsellor or psychologist to just talk through it at the very least.
