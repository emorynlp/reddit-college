That can seriously cut down on expenses and even if you go to this other school, you'll be there for 2 fewer years and save thousands.  Your degree will say the same thing and it's possible that you will get better teaching at the CC (though without knowing the school it's a crap shoot.)",

I ended up commuting and organizing my schedule so I only had classes on Tuesday and Thursday. The ride sucked but it was only twice a week. I didn\u2019t go here long, so I\u2019m not sure how sustainable that would have been. But it\u2019s a possibility if you have a decent vehicle.",
