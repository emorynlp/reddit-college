  "text": "Just a heads up that this is my first post ever on Reddit after reading so many! I apologize for the tangent.\n\nSooo I\u2019m a junior in undergrad and on a Pre-PA track, but I don\u2019t feel happy enough? :/ \n\nMy GPA has gone up, but it\u2019s low compared to competitive averages. I don\u2019t feel proud at all. Even working my ass off during this pandemic I feel like I won\u2019t reach my goal of getting into grad school. It\u2019s weird cause I say \u201coh it went up\u201d but it\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s went from a 2.8 to 3.2 in two years\u2026 I hope someone here gets me it\u2019s hard to put into words. \n\nI plan on taking a gap year to gain clinical experience and study for the GRE before applying, but the numbers I see weigh me down so much. I\u2019ve gone suicidal many times yet I know how AWFUL the consequences will be if I do. I have/had a therapist but I ghosted him for whatever fucking reason. \n\nSome days I feel optimistic and this being a day where I feel unhappy. I feel so overwhelmed and hate it a lot. I genuinely have a passion for pursuing in the health/medical field, but my GPA doesn\u2019t look like it. I learned about what quarter life crisis\u2019 are and it definitely feels like I\u2019m in one. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nI\u2019m such an off/in person and was recommended to take depressants\u2026 couldn\u2019t afford it and overall couldn\u2019t see myself taking them anyway. I\u2019m a first gen so I was thrown into college with zero guidance and flopped terribly freshman year. I\u2019ve definitely grown but my mind is just saying it isn\u2019t enough. My friends have phenomenal GPA\u2019s and I feel nothing at times lol. \n\nI\u2019ve done tons of research about PA and many associates have said you can do it, but I can\u2019t believe it? Why? I genuinely want to be one but I don\u2019t look competitive. I feel so messy and don\u2019t like it. My family aren\u2019t supportive either which sucks even more. :/",
