  "text": "Just failed my first exam of my college career and I feel terrible. I\u2019m currently a junior and failed a cost accounting exam. I seriously feel like I haven\u2019t really learned anything this semester which worries me about my future career. What happens when I\u2019m applying to jobs and have no real clue what I\u2019m doing. I currently have an internship lined up this summer but worried I\u2019ll be clueless the entire time. Any suggestions?",

It ain\u2019t rocket science, it\u2019s accounting. Some people struggle with audit, some with tax, some with cost. But none of it is incomprehensible with effort.",

Later down the line these will all be useful. \nJust the fact that you are pushing on through all this, still determined to get the education you deserve, shows how resilient you are in a changing world! \nNo paper can demonstrate the challenges Covid has placed on us college students!

This year I haven't been learning much especially everything being online. Don't give up it's gonna be okay. You guys gotta push through. Failing is a great part of becoming better at something so don't stress to much about it. It's all good. Learn from your mistakes and move on. I've meet engineers that have failed more than I have personally and they have become amazing people and engineers, so it's okay to fail it's not the end of the world :)",

If you fail, all that means usually is you have to pay for the class do it again. The grade gets replaced. Maybe this class will be a B for bullshit. Thats okay. \n\nNever let a single grade send you packing. If you do that you would never last in the real world. Go get it whatever it takes. \n\nIf your disillusioned in general - and I am saying this as a one time accounting business major who spent 4 years getting a bachelor of science after almost graduating with a ABM - if you want to change do it. Everyday is a new day. \n\nIf you think your struggling with the class - go take a learning style test. Then change some study habits around your learning style and get creative with new approaches to the martial. If your tactile in learning like me I always take the notes from lecture and rewrite them all with my own doodles so I can learn the way I learn best - doing. Thats a good trick if your super visual too. Make notes in drawings. \n\nPS: no one \"likes\" accounting \n\nPSS: I also got white Russian mix ... and it helps with that I'm a failure type studying sessions",

Doing well in cost accounting will not make you feel any less clueless during the internship. Trust me. Its better you know now. But you will learn a lot and feel less clueless every day.

I don't think any departments really use it though, they'll give an incomplete or an F in most circumstances. TBH, I wish they would use it. I think it's good to differentiate between incompetence and absenteeism.\n\nSo I guess we've got A/B/C/D for decreasing 10 point increments, and some classes use +- too. Anything less than a 60 is an F, but if the class is in your major most programs require you to achieve at least a C (70%) so D is effectively failing, it just doesn't damage financial aid as much. IN or DF for incomplete or deferred, these are replaced within a defined time limit with a real grade. NG indicates an unevaluated completed requirement (usually an accompaniment to another class). I actually misspoke earlier. P/F classes will give a gpa-damaging F if you fail; students don't choose P/F, the whole class is structured that way. C/NC is credit/no credit, it's super similar to P/F but students choose it on an individual basis to try a class beyond their grad requirements without threating GPA -- also used during corona crisis. NB for failure to complete the class. W for withdrawal. A for audits. I can't think of anything else.\n\nI assume all that stuff is not standardized at all and anybody looking at transcripts from outside institutions would also have a key that indicates what these grades actually mean.

But the online, alternating days, random zoom sessions are killing me. I\u2019ve been A-B every class I\u2019ve taken till now, sitting at a 64% and a 70% in Physics and Organic Chemistry. It\u2019s been a brutal semester, but keep your head up. Everyone\u2019s suffering and hopefully you\u2019ve got a decent Professor that understands this and is curving the grade.",

She switched the exams to open book so I can probably manage that one. The lab is hopeless though, I can never keep straight what day I need to be there and the instructor has a super heavy accent.",
