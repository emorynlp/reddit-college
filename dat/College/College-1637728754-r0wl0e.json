  "text": "Ok might be a silly question but when a new semester starts, you\u2019re obvi in classes with more different people and so do people usually start to get to know and hang out/spend more time with the people they\u2019re currently in classes with or do they still stick around most of the time with their friends from the past semester? \n(Asking so ik if I need to make an effort to become social again for meeting new ppl next sem)",
