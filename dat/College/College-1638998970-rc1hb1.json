  "text": "Very long story that I will try to keep brief. \n\nI'm a junior at a 4 year university that originally started in engineering, but has since moved to finance after getting my ass kicked by the courses. I never planned on going to college; my original plans were to go to a tech school for a certificate or something in cybersecurity. The only reason I went here was because I sent them my ACT score and they offered me a full tuition scholarship, so I decided to go since that's quite the opportunity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then, I've lost track of how many times I've lost, or have come close to losing my scholarship. I've appealed once, and it worked, on the grounds that I had gotten Covid and there was a visible drop in my grades following my illness and the game of catchup once I recovered. That appeal the end of the Fall 2020 semester. I lost the scholarship again this last spring, and took a summer class to get my credit hours high enough to continue. With the class withdrawal date passed (unbeknownst to me) and my GPA abysmal, I'm not going to be able to keep the scholarship for the spring. I can try and appeal, but I'm not banking on that working. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question.. should I plan on taking out a loan to cover in the in state tuition and fees (if I get them) totally around  $6,000+ for the spring semester, on top of the roughly $20,000 I had to take out for fees and mandatory on campus living and meal plans, and enroll in classes where attendance is mandatory so I actually do my work, or should I finally take this as the sign I should drop out and figure something out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: I'm going to lose my scholarship for the 3rd semester in a row because I hate school and only enrolled because it was an opportunity very few have access to. Do I add more debt for in person classes that I MIGHT get my shit together and do, or should I just take this as my sign to take some time off and either pursue a career in something I want to do (law enforcement)/get my shit together without being in school and coming back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry about the the wall of text. I'm just at a loss and I can feel my parent's disappointment (first in my family to attend college, even the first to graduate high school), so I don't know who to talk to anymore.",

      "text": "You haven't lost your scholarship yet, have you? There's usually a probation semester first. Use up every gift before throwing in the towel. \n\nMy brother found that online asked at ASU were cheaper for him than in person classes at our in state schools. He had a bad first year of engineering (2e kid) and was only good for 11 hours transfer out of 30, all scholarship. We've all been impressed with ea.asu.edu classes and this spring there will be some upper level. You might grab some of those of they fit your degree plan later... $425 each seems like a bargain. I'm looking at taking the intro 1 hour Google certificate class ($25 total) in the spring.",
