  "text": "Does anyone have any experience or advice with appealing a grade? My professor is pretty much trying to fail me off assumptions and observations of the feedback from members of a group I was in. I did my part of the group project and tried to communicate with team members. He reached out stating concerns they had on the peer evaluation form that were never communicated with me. Now he\u2019s giving me -5s and -8s as grades (yes literally negative grades) on assignments, and not caring about my point of view.",
