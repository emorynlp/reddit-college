I have to attend the entire time because I am one of the few people in my Aunt's support system. \n\nBetween that and work I get one full day to finish four different projects. \n\n^(panic.)",

I need to write 2 lesson plans for 2 lessons I taught at a high school a few weeks ago. After that, I need to fill in a 3 page chart that\u2019s over the lessons I taught this semester. Finally, I need to answer a questionnaire. All of these assignments are for the same class and I have only 1 day as well. I plan to wake up tomorrow at 5 am and work on the assignments nonstop until I\u2019m done.",
