  "title:": "how do i tell my roommate to be more quiet and considerate nicely?",
  "text": "i (19f) share a 2 bedroom apt with 3 other girls who are 19-20 years old. the one who is my roommate (19f) is really nice and chill. she\u2019s super sweet, always offers to drive us to places across the city, and usually keeps to herself. however, she is always so loud and inconsiderate and when i tried telling my other two roommates, they just would brush me off, thinking i was just talking crap and over exaggerating. it wasn\u2019t until it started affecting one of them (cause they share the second room together) that they started to notice. it\u2019s been going on since we all moved in during the last week of august before university started up that she started to slightly annoy me. but more recently it\u2019s gotten worse as she\u2019s gotten more comfortable. a couple weeks ago, i told her i was going to bed cause it was 11 at night and i had an 8 am and she just happened to be on ft. all she said was \u201cok\u201d and basically ignored me and went back to talking and loudly playing minecraft. and since she\u2019s naturally a loud person, she was essentially yelling on ft. it went on for 10 minutes where i was trying to sleep and she rudely stayed in the room until i turned off the timed wall lights in my room and she got the hint. then, our other roommate was in the living room trying to study and same story. this has been going on for the past many weeks. i say i\u2019m going to bed and she continues to ft in the room or continues to be loud. i always leave the room when she goes to bed because it\u2019s basic decency. recently she purposely stood in front of the mirror on our closet taking her sweet ass time to put up her hair and take off her makeup as she continues to be on ft, while i was trying to sleep\u2026. and there\u2019s another mirror right down our little hallway right outside the door in the bathroom\u2026 and she walks in and out of the room so many times at night, making so much noise and leaving the door open with light and more noise coming in. she also leaves every weekend to go home and my other roommates and i are always in class when she leaves so she puts all her dishes in the sink and leaves us to wash them. one of my roommates and i noticed this and just started doing our own and leaving hers there, but then it would just pile up and it was really\ngross, especially cause she leaves on friday\u2019s and comes back monday\u2019s or tuesday\u2019s. i get that it\u2019s her apt too and she should be able to take ft calls and all of that, but not past 10 when we all have classes and need time to study. we did roommate rules together when we first moved in and all agreed that from 10-7 would be quiet hours. i just think it\u2019s really inconsiderate and rude and i\u2019m not really sure how to approach her about it cause i don\u2019t want it to build cause i genuinely want to like her but it gets hard when there\u2019s this and more she does. there\u2019s so many other things she does that is also wtf but i think this bugs me the most and i just don\u2019t know how to approach her. ideas?",

      "text": "I think that this will just progress into you resenting her if you don\u2019t address it! I think you definitely could just ask her if she\u2019d mind making an effort to be a bit quieter during your previously discussed quiet hours as it has been bothering yourself and your housemates\u2019 sleep/ study schedules. It really isn\u2019t a huge deal to ask for and if she is sweet as you\u2019ve said I\u2019m sure she will be pretty understanding. Maybe have one of your other housemates address the dish situation so that it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re coming at her for multiple things all at once ? Also I\u2019ve lived with housemates at university the last 3 years so I understand the struggle lol- it\u2019s easier to nicely ask for more effort from them than to start hating their guts for the annoying things they do ahahaha",

      "text": "nah you all need to confront her about it, but you need to do it together. if one person complains people like this will just call you a bitch, if you all complain and say you've ALL noticed the same bad habits, they'll be more likely to get the hint that they are, in fact, the problem. and like honestly don't be afraid to be confrontational. I know it's hard when you're living together but my sense is that this person is happy to walk all over you guys if you're not going to stand up for yourselves.",
