  "text": "The title says it all.\n\n I'm currently taking pre-cal 5 credits, and I have to study all the material on my own. I go to class, sit down, open my laptop, and study on the textbook because I can hardly understand and keep up with 10% of what my professor saying. \n\nI'm getting an A, but not with the rest of my classmates, more than half of them are struggling deadly because they can't understand what he's saying. But it makes sense, because when the students can not study on their own, they come to school looking for help from teachers, and now they're fucked up because they can't understand the professor neither. \n\nI'm looking all over the classes of calculus 1, calculus 2, sta, and I find out that almost all of the professors have very heavy accents. And with the current experience, I would not like at all to take any class if the professor has an accent. \n\nSo why? why are they so many, and how is that even fair for students? fair for those who are not even native American like me, fair for those who have to work their ass out to pay for the class I don't understand.",

And I think it is not fair for students who take the classes.  \n\nThen change your major to Math, complete your PhD in Math, take a Professional Certification course in Teaching, and become a University Math Professor, so you can teach accent-free.  \n\nWhat? What's that you say? You don't want to be a professor? You don't know anybody who wants to be a professor?  \n\nHuh, sounds like your university is hiring the best people they can find who are good at the subject matter and are willing to teach (at the offered salary).  \n\n\nIt's a global economy now. Employers can hire specialized talent from anywhere on earth via the H1B visa process if they are willing to work for low-salary and the promise of a Green Card.  \n\nIf your university isn't offering appropriate salaries for Professors then they are hiring what they can find for what they are willing to pay.  \n\nYou are right to want to be able to understand your professors & instructors.  \n\nBut don't be mad/angry/upset/frustrated by the Professors. They were hired to do a job, and the people who hired them understood who they were hiring.  \n\nMake sure you target and direct your frustrations in the correct directions.  \n\nAs written, your thread comes off as a rant about professors not speaking English with an accent that you find easy to comprehend, which to be honest, kinda makes you sound like a racist.  \n\nMake sure you understand the entirety of the problem.  \n\nMake sure you direct your frustrations and any advocacy for corrective actions at the actual sources of the problem(s).",

      "text": "School is probably not investing in people in that field, poor pay, or not enough professionals in that area so they higher overseas. Could also be the university/college is not offering good enough benefits to bring in people with 'crisp english' or that the field itself lacks people wanting to educate.\n\nAlso English speakers are not native to here (I assume you referring to the US).",
