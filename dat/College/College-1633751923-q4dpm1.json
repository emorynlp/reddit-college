  "text": "Hey guys i\u2019m a freshman and I live in apartment complex. I don\u2019t live in one of the regular dorms. It\u2019s been a real struggle to meet people. I have tried clubs and other things and cannot meet to many people. I\u2019m not really into the whole partying of college so it\u2019s a little difficult to meet people. Does anyone have suggestions on how to meet people?",
