  "text": "So this week is my last week of school (yay!). So today I took my last in-person final and all semester I\u2019ve sat next to a guy that has barely been in class. \n\nHe strolled in like 15 minutes after the exam started and sat next to me. By this time I was already done my final and was checking over my answers. He slowly slipped me a 20 dollar bill, pulled his mask down, and whispered \u201cCan I get some help?\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd74 I was pretty impressed by the level of boldness of this guy, especially considering the fact that this was the first time in 15 weeks that he\u2019s talked to me. But I shook my head \u2018no\u2019, quickly got up, and submitted my final. People are wild!",
