  "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI\u2019m currently in the debate of going to college before trade school or going to just  college overall. \n\nI am still in Highschool but graduating 2022\n\nTo note:\n I do have the opportunity to enroll in electrical trade school completely sponsernd for but have been advised by many to go to college first\u2026. I\u2019m currently in a Highschool trade school program that would shave a year off a 4 year trade school term. This sponsor ship and many other sponsorships for trade school will not disappear, even if I were to go to college and decide to enter the trade later on.\n\nI am still in Highschool but graduating 2022\n\nThese are my current thoughts for options for college \n\nFirst option: I have the option of going for an associates degree at my local college around 8-10k a year (I have not looked into financial aid yet.) I would have to pay this entirely but have a very stable job. I would have to think if I want to transfer out for a bachelors after my associates. \n\nSecond option: Go get a bachelors degree from some larger online college through my current large employer who will entirely sponsor/ pay for my bachelors degree with a decent but limited options of degrees (no strings attached or any special requirements) \n\nWhat would you do in my position and why? What would you advise ? \n\nAny opinion or thought is very much appreciated, thank you.",
