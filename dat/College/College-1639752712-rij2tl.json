  "text": "I\u2019m a senior and my major is physic I should graduate next semester but that will delay me two semester. The reason why I am happy with it, is that it the first time I even the book or try to study like(serious study), I have failed multiple semesters before because I would be too depressed to even attend or respond to my professor.
