  "text": "This is my first time finding a professor like this. His assignment can take hours to finish because he never taught them and it\u2019s due that day he gave the assignment. Does he not realize we have other assignments to do and quizzes/tests in other classes?\n\n I already have a bachelor\u2019s degree so I have known many professors. I changed my major in computer science now. That bad professor is \u201cteaching\u201d c++. He never really taught us and the slides are in the book. The assignments cannot be found in the book so the book is useless and he expects us to finish it that day.",

I can't remember ever getting an assignment of that sort in my many years of education and I've certainly never given one of that type.",

The assignments are random difficulty so you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s difficult or easy. If it\u2019s difficult, it could take hours to finish it which is not really fair when we have other work to do that day.",
