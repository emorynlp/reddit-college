              "text": "I was thinking if you took piano lessons you could have access to the practice rooms so you wouldn't need to buy a keyboard. Your school could also rent you out an instrument if you need a guitar. This would definitely lessen the costs. \n\nThere is a big difference playing piano and keyboard depending on the type of music you want to play. If you want to learn more modern music like pop and rock you'll be fine with a decent keyboard, but for classical you would be better off using the real pianos. If you do want to get a keyboard checkout Yamaha or Casio.",

Also, its likely if you take lessons it will be on a real piano as well so I highly recommend using the practice rooms so you can get used to how a real piano feels. \n\nIt will give you the proper technique and finger strength needed to play. Also if you decided after the lessons to get a keyboard it will feel much easier to play because keyboards are lighter than pianos. You don't 100% need to play on one in the beginning but I reccomend it.",
