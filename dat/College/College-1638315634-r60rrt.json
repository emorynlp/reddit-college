      "text": "I started in Psych because it interested me and I figured it would lead to working with people on an individual level which also interested me.\n\nI figured career stuff out by visiting my campus Career Center and talking to people who worked in the fields that interested me.\n\nI did NOT listen to people who know little to nothing about Psychology-related career stuff like other students in different majors.\n\nDoing my own research from the government-run U.S. Occupational Outlook Handbook: https://www.bls.gov/ooh helped a lot. I also kept my eye on job posts to see what I would be qualified for coming out of college with a Psych degree. I also worked some jobs and internships before graduating that helped me get experience and learn more about where I wanted to go after graduation.\n\nSo far so good!",

That's literally what GEs are there for beyond broadening your breadth of knowledge in general.\n\n> I\u2019m pretty sure I want to to something in the health field but don\u2019t know anything past that.\n\nProbably something related to healthcare then, depending on your goals.\n\n> How did you narrow down what you wanted to do and major in\n\nJust a note that for a lot of people in most fields, what you study does not mean that is what you will do. Most people who study biology are not biologists nor are most people who study literature writing literary criticism. You can think of your major and your career as independent but correlated.",
