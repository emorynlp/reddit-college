      "text": "A good second job is **virtual** tutoring with your school- they'll be flexible hours, decent-ish pay, and you don't need to waste time/money rushing around. You can do it in the library, in between classes, even at your bed (just don't aim the camera low lol). Plus, it counts towards leadership hours if your school expects you to \"serve\" in any capacity. I know Kaplan is hiring $15/hr and they're giving employees free testing materials (up to $2500 or so) in the off-chance you're interested in grad/law/med school later.\n\nI also work multiple jobs and am a full-time student, and in stressing about $ I was neglecting classes (I am a stem major taking multiple hard sciences). **The golden rule I've created: You can work as many hours as you want, so long as you study for an equal amount of time**. You want to work for 20 hrs? 35? 10? cool, then study for at least that long too. It really helps you balance time and consciously avoid burnout.\n\nAs for **efficient studying**, watch YouTubers using pomodoro like StudyMD- it'll suck you right in and make learning a relaxing process instead of exhausting. After all, work is draining enough, and if you aren't careful, it will become your excuse not to study.\n\nAt the end of the day, having good grades opens doors. Make sure you prioritize academic success, and if you need to cut back on something, cut your work hours. You can always pick up a short-term house-sitting gig or something over a break to make up for the \"lost\" income.",
