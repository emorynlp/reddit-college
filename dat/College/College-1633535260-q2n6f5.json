  "text": "Hey all! I\u2019m a freshman at a fairly big campus this year. It\u2019s been my dream school ever since I knew what college was but now I hate it. I have friends, work, and do really well in class but it is not what I expected it to be. I cry near daily over how sad I am to be here and regret coming here with all my heart. I\u2019m transferring at the semester but right now it\u2019s so hard to push though and do what I have now. Is this normal? I feel close nobody else that I know feels this way and that like maybe I\u2019m defective lolololhelplololol\n\nEdit- I feel like I should mention that I\u2019m transferring due to financial reasons, not emotional or any of that jazz",

If accessible, you can also use the mental health resources on campus to help ease the adjustment. Hang in there; I dont know a single person who wasnt in the position you are describing now.",

      "text": "Yo. Stick around here for a while and you'll see that just about EVERY freshman feels this way. \n\nYou will get over it. It'll start to feel normal. It's just like moving to a new place alone. It takes a good 6 months for stuff to start falling in place and about a full year to feel like home. It's normal. \n\nI'm guessing this is your first time out on your own? That's why you feel this way. \n\nI'm 32 and have moved across states and all over those states. It's like this every single time for me. It takes me 6 months to get settled and 12 months to feel like home. \n\nAll I can say is hang in there, you'll be alright. You have to get through it.",
