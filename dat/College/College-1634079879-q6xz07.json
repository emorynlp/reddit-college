  "text": "I\u2019ve done it before but ended up quitting a job since it was so stressful but now I\u2019m determined to make it work since I got into a minor car accident and need to pay a lot of things back. I already have a job thats giving me 30-40 hours a week but I\u2019m not full time there. (Mind you, i don\u2019t want to be, although I wish they would cut my hours Just by a little bit tbh) I recently got a second job and they agreed to have me work only three-four days a week with much shorter shifts. Like four hours. I just want to know if anyone else has managed to make this work, and if so, how did you? I already made sure to tell both jobs I need certain days off for school and they both agreed but idk, I\u2019m already starting to feel overwhelmed. I would just like advice lol. I rlly just need to make as much money as I can. And most of my classes are asynchronous so I\u2019m hoping I can make it work but I\u2019m so unsure of how to make it work that it\u2019s making my eye twitch lol.",

      "text": "During the summer I was working two jobs and a full time student taking the maximum units for summer school. I worked about 20 ish hours for my first job and 12 ish hours for my other one. I worked 6 days a week and occasionally 7 days. I feel like you should definitely cut back down on the hours if you do not think you can handle the schedule. I feel like the only reason why I managed to survive was because one of my jobs was very flexible with the hours and my classes were manageable because they were just GEs. If you're like on a tight deadline with paying your bills and stuff and having 2 jobs is a must, I would suggest to take easier classes and even better if they are all asynchronous. Also idk how your university works, but if you can, try to take the classes pass/no pass. It will take off a load of stress. \n\nAs for your work, idk where you work, but I worked at Mcdonald's and an office job. The office job was definitely more chill. Mcds was overwhelming at first, but honestly over time, I got used to it. I kind of got good at the job and at working longer shifts. Also the people were fun to work with so that made the whole job better. In the beginning, coming home from work and having to immediately do homework was torturous for me lol but my mindset was that I gotta do what I gotta do. I will have to get this assignment done either way. Not great advice, but it got me through lol. \n\nI think overall, it's all in the mindset. I think being overwhelmed is the first sign of saying that you are doing too much and you should cut down a bit. If not, I think it will just mess everything up and the thing that you wanna resolve in the first place will not even be your only problem. Balance everything out. Do as much as you think you can handle, and then later on see if you can handle more. Having a consistent routine/work schedule down is definitely helpful so you can map out the time that you have free time or time to do schoolwork and stuff.\n\nsuper long and probably not helpful sorry lol. i hope that you will find a way to manage everything",

I'm about to get a full-time job and do school full-time and although I'm nervous about it I know that if I just stay calm and manage my time better I'll be able to do it even if only for a little while",
