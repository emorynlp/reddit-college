  "text": "I'm a public admin major and we have to take 1 statistics class. Outside of that, there is zero math which I love since I am horrid at it. \n\nI did very well on all the assignments and got a 91% on the midterms.  And had  a 96% in the class overall. \n\nJust totally failed the final exam. Everything  I studied was not on the exam and the few subjects  I did not understand *at all* were about 98% of the exam. And since most of the questions where essay, some just got random numbers thrown in them. \n\nNot sure if I want to cry or just sleep for the next week and not look at my almost perfect GPA go down the drain",

Opened my exam on wednesday morning, looked nothing like the previous years exam and was mainly problems from our last unit, where the class average was a 40%. I cried in my car when I left but I was sitting at a B going into it so i\u2019m hopeful I still pass, lol.",
