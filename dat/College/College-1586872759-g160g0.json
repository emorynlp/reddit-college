  "title:": "Is a professor allowed to threaten a zero on an online exam solely for taking the exam in bed?",
  "text": "(USA) I completely understand the need to mitigate cheating during this transition to online classes, and don't plan on cheating but it seems absolutely inappropriate for a professor to dictate where a student can take an exam in the comfort in their own home. Her email stated \"A grade of 0 will be awarded if you are in bed or lounging on a sofa.\" so even thought the webcam scan before the exam shows no possible signs of dishonesty, she refuses to let a student be comfortable...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis witch of a professor has been impossible since the start of the semester but i seriously feel she has crossed her boundary.  Thoughts?",

If your eyes wander, or you talk to others, or you open [google.com](https://google.com), the proctoring software would tell.\n\nSo just explain your situation.

Tell him working from home is new to you and you dont have a proper surface but that youve learned, ask him even if he wont reconsider the initial grade he'd let you retake it under appropriate circumstances. Idk how it works at your university or college and policies vary by location but change of grades are possible, and failing a sympathetic esr from the instructor you might be able to jump his head and appeal to the department chair with a well worded email and screenshots/evidence of unfair treatment. I would generally recommend you visit the department office in person, but obviously thats not an option in our current circumstances. Perhaps if the department is working remotely they might still have a procedure for students to call in so that you might turn a sympathetic ear before finding out who to email.",

While there are some general policies they are held to, in most four-year US institutions tenure-track/tenured faculty have almost absolute power over course design and delivery, the broad exception being for shared courses (like multiple sections of Bio 101 or freshman comp at big schools) and general policies like the semester calendar and how grades are reported.  This is usually spelled out in faculty handbooks or union contracts. While department chairs often have significant influence in hiring, evaluation, and promotion they are unlikely to intervene in a conflict with a student unless there's been a clear violation of policy or ethics on the part of the instructor.\n\nThat said, this instructor is ridiculous. As a department chair I would indeed want to know about this and would have a conversation with my colleague about what is an appropriate exercise of her authority and what is not.",

Even for me, my desk is too small to hold my stuff so I sit at the kitchen table and everyone can see my kitchen.\n\nThere are better and more absurd reasons to give someone a zero (refusing to put on webcam, etc). If it becomes a problem where she some how noticed that you are on the couch or bed and give you a zero for that email and official. Take a screenshot of your self, provide proof, etc.\n\nMy solution is to drape an white sheet behind you and pretend to be upwards on the webcam",

If all else fails, there\u2019s always the associate dean of your college as well. Good luck! You\u2019ve got every reason and right to report the professor.\n\nIf the professor isn\u2019t tenured, these types of reports go into their file and are taken into consideration whenever they\u2019re up for tenure and can probably make or break their case.

As a department chair I had a long meeting with my faculty before we all went online to discuss exactly what is reasonable to expect from students, and what is not. This is not.  If  the instructor's preferred pedagogy doesn't work without imposing on students to this extent, the pedagogy should change. I have a student, for example, living in a camp trailer right now...I would never ask her to turn on her camera at all, much less demand that she sit on some specific sort of furniture.\n\nI think these video-proctored exams are appalling in general. Why give exams at all? Find an other way to assess learning that doesn't impose on students who are living in the middle of a pandemic.",
