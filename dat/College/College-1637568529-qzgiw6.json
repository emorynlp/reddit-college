      "text": "Technically yes. I brought in a paper where the professor said I didn't make a point clear enough and that's why I had points deducted so I met with them during office hours and showed them where I had made studying statements and they apologized for missing them and gave me the points. Which raised my grade a small portion up.\n\nI mean not too much but still. If you ask straight out without any reason most will say no. I remember as a TA a student asked me if I could bump their grade on two of the reports and their reason was \"I am a straight A student, I need to get an A in all my classes\" ...  okay? But why?",
