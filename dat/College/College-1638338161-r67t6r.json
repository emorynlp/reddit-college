  "text": " Highschool was great. I was an excellent student, with the best grades in my school, without having to provide that much work, only what i was told to do.\n\nNow, I'm in my first semester of college, and everything is falling apart. I can't bring myself to work by any mean, and when i do i can't focus for more than five minutes. It is getting worse every single day. I constantly switch between stages of denial, and stages of high anxiety.\nI don't know what to do. My grades are getting more than horrible. If i drop out, I don't know what i'd do instead. I'm lucky enough to have a wonderful study environment and yet I'm a big failure, and ruining my life all alone.\n\nHas anyone gone through this or something similar ? How did you manage to cope with it ?",
