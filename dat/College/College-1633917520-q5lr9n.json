  "text": "I am currently taking a generalized course for a bachelors of science in computer science. Im staying at a local community college for a bit until i get accepted in midterm next semester to a university. I am basically doing a 2+2 but only for one year cause I want to take Japanese as my minor (current college doesn't have it) and study abroad quicker.\n\nI am putting so much effort into this as much as i can, i have over 100% in half my classes and straight A's, but I am very very nervous for the coming future of my classes, specifically Calculus. I know its not easy and I know what im getting into, but I can't help but feel hopeless (hell i feel hopeless with the classes I have now) about how hard things are going to get.\n\nFor those who have taken Calculus, how was it for you?",

      "text": "The best thing you can do for yourself heading into calculus is make sure that your foundational skills are in place. SO MANY TIMES I have students who struggle not because of the calculus itself, but because their algebra isn\u2019t up to speed (or fractions. Fractions are a massive problem for a lot of people). Khan academy is great for something like this - go all the way back to the beginning (yes, all the way) and just take a run through it. You\u2019ll fly through material at first, and that\u2019s great, but the second you\u2019re not sure about WHY something works the way it does, never mind the HOW, that\u2019s when you slow down and start watching the explanation videos. \n\nPay particular attention to fractions, division/grouping, and all that middle school math-as-language and pattern work. It\u2019ll be reinforced hard in Algebra II. On the \u201chigher\u201d end of HS math, spend some time actually understanding what the heck trigonometry is. \n\nYour school probably offers free or low-cost tutoring - take advantage of it! They can definitely help you with current classwork, although if you want someone to help guide/teach you as you shore up foundational skills you may have to find someone elsewhere (shameless advertisement side note: yes this is my specialty and yes I\u2019m taking new clients) as diagnosing weaknesses is a specialized skill that your average college-center tutor just isn\u2019t trained to do. Best of luck!",

      "text": "Don\u2019t put so much pressure on yourself or worry too much. When the time comes, you\u2019ll be able to learn it. I took calc 1 and 2 in HS and did poorly. High school in general was just a bad learning environment for me. Once I got to college as a CS major I got As in Calc 1, 2, and 3. Khan academy is your friend and don\u2019t be afraid to come to office hours to ask your professor for help with questions you don\u2019t understand. Just do everything that is assigned, attend every lecture and do as many practice problems as you can on your own time and things will come together!! Have faith in yourself!",

      "text": "It was easy at some parts a little difficult in others, when I did precalculus it was a bit difficult because I was not as experience with trig, afterwards calc 1 was pretty easy as it is basically an intro, calc 2 was maybe the most difficult as it was not as specific as calc 1 or 3 (meaning calc 1 was derivative and limit based with integrrals , and calc 2 is kinda everywhere if I can make it sound eligible to imagine). Calc 3 rn is pretty fun, only reason why I may like it is that I like the math, of course, others don't really agree with me, but that is just others' opinions. Overall the calc series is pretty standard, meaning that there is tons of help when it comes to this area of mathematics. Just remember if you don't think you are a math person, it is a stigma. Personally I believe a wide variety of people only need to practice their math skills, probably one of the main reasons why people like engilsh linguistics more because we read and write a lot more than we do math and handle numbers. Personally in my precalc class I had a classmate with down-syndrome in my class and heb was also in my psychology class, and he would talk about making a study group. Dude was determined as I asked him once what his percentage in the class was and he said a 95%. This was asked towards the end of the semester ofc. What I am trying to say is that there is nothing to be feared unless you don't plan on studying and actively trying to figure out the actual math.",

      "text": "Calculus felt like a natural extension of algebra to me, so I'm all honestly not too bad. (I will say I'm one of those people math comes pretty easy to)\n\nMy big price of advice though is figure out if Calc is for you or not early, cause if you're struggling with calculus, the rest of your computer science degree will be rough",

      "text": "When I took calculus years ago, having a study group helped me a lot. In the end, I had a instructor who used only letters like algebra for their exams instead of those real life arithmetic problems that would had destroyed me.\n\nIf you practice, understand the mathematical rules, and (as needed) go to tutoring, you'll survive. \n\nOpen source websites like PatrickJMT and Khan Academy may help supplement your learning. If you use an IDE like Python, you can type out your own equations and use the debugger feature to understand the steps better.",
