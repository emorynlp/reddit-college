  "title:": "Dropping Out of College Advice",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am seriously considering dropping out of college after this semester. I am currently finishing my third semester and would have 5 or 6 semesters left after this one finishes in a few weeks. Over the past year, I have started a few successful businesses that I enjoy running. Of these two are more trend like businesses and one is a longer term cash flowing business. As of Today, I have around a $225,000 net worth (Money for taxes is not included in this). Throughout my life I have been very good at making money and can see myself making $100,000+ a year easily for the long term. \n\nThroughout this last semester, I have lost a lot of motivation for the reason that I am going to college. The classes that I am taking are very easy to do and seem like a waste of time. Furthermore, having experienced what is needed in taking risks and the various parts involved with running a business, nothing I learned in college in 3 semesters was useful. The school I go to is also a commuter school and thus finding like-minded people has been tough to do. \n\nOver the past few weeks I've been giving deep thought into what my next plans in life are. Dropping out of college and going to travel and experience new places and activities seems like such a better option than taking what seems like meaningless classes. Furthermore, not having to worry about money has played a large role as well in thinking this is the right decision. A lot of threads that I have seen have had people recommending to suck up College so they can get a high-paying job. However, in my case this past year has allowed me to develop multiple high paying income streams. I have achieved nearly all of my financial goals which I initially thought would be many years after I graduate.\n\nAnother concern that I have is meeting new people and finding a place to live. One benefit of being in college is that you are always surrounded my many people who are the same age and attending the same classes. If I were to drop out, meeting new people would be a significant challenge which I am looking for advice on. Choosing a place to move to is another concern that I have. I am unsure of where I should possibly move and what factors I should consider when choosing a place. The businesses that I run are all online and are not tied to being in a specific location. One idea that I saw was traveling for a year to different places for a few weeks or a month until I find a place that I like. However, in this scenario not having a familiar home or set base for over a year or forever in a sense is a daunting thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any insight or past experiences that may be able to help me I would greatly appreciate any advice. \n\nThanks!",

Or B start up your new life.\n\nIf I were you, I'd look at learning about stocks and bonds. Pretty much about personal finance as a whole (insurance house and car buying, budgeting, time value of money, CREDIT). \n\nI dropped out and went back in college for financial reasons. I had to learn a lot about personal finance to unfuck myself from my father's doings. Ill be graduating debt free with a home and 3 vehicles with a good nest egg for retirement. Thats my advice though.",
