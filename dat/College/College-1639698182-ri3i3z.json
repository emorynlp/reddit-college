  "text": "So it's finals week, and I've been sitting here all day waiting for my Spanish test to post online so I can take it. No test, I decide to text another classmate to see what's up because I took this week off of work for finals. My classmate informed me that they took it in person at 8am today. I never got a email from the professor, attached is a screenshot of the syllabus stating it will be online, I did miss the review that was optional the last day. I emailed her about it tonight, but if she refuses to let me take it what action can I take about this, and will there be a chance the head of the department can do anything about this?\n\nSyllabus: https://imgur.com/a/fFHZzqQ",

Is it at all possible that the professor mentioned this change several times at classes you didn't attend?  Apologies if I'm off-base, but it seems very unlikely for a professor to make this change at the very last minute and announce it exactly once, at the review session.",

It is usually advised that they include the class in on the decision, but a syllabus is not cast in iron.\n\nThat said, in this case, if the professor said one thing and then changed it without notifying everyone involved, then OP has a legitimate beef, and should reach out to the department chair.  If the professor here is the chair, then go to your college dean.  My concern, though, is that the professor will say that 'this was addressed in the review you missed,' but still - it's on *them* to ensure that every member of the class knows what's happening.",
