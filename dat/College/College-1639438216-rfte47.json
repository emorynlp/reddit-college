  "text": "I have done pretty well this semester given all the circumstances. I have studied hard and have had to make certain sacrifices to get good grades. My good friend is also in my major. She's great, but didn't study nearly as much as me. I consistently did better than her on exams, and this made sense\u2014my constant studying and her lack thereof made the results clear. Even so, her final exam grades were better than mine. Granted, I was sick with mono the week before, but I feel kind of...peeved? Idk, I still got good grades but I feel like all my work was for nothing. Is it normal to feel like this? I have always had super competitive tendencies and I also find myself comparing my successes to others. Any advice?",

      "text": " In these situations I tend to remind myself not to voice everything I think.  Stress can play a huge role in ability to focus and work. I recently went through a very personal loss.  You managed to do pretty well right. Passed every class?  Then your work was not for nothing. All the credits you were taking are done. You are allowed to feel this way.  Don't risk losing a friend over one score. Finding people you share an interest with can be difficult.\n\nI once lost a friend for this when I was in high school and it felt awful. I learned from the experience and haven't behaved that way since then.",
