If you are dealing with this in all of your classes so far, and need to take a break from higher education, look into late withdrawals due to exceptional circumstances (and if you don't qualify for that, academic renewal for the semester if you fail most of your classes).\n\nI do want to say, at the end of the day, one bad grade is not going to really matter. Life happens. Everyone knows this. It's about repeated patterns in your academic history. If this is a one off, you felt unprepared, there was a shitty teacher, etc, then don't be too worried. If you are routinely going through these things, it'd be best to reassess if college is the right next step for you or if you should work on other things first.\n\nGood luck!!",

          "text": "First of all, it is very refreshing to see a comment that actually sympathizes with the original Reddit poster\u2019s concern as opposed to igniting an endless argument-turned-\u201cdick-measuring-contest\u201d about who can show they are more knowledgeable in the nuances related to failing outcomes/causes. \n\nI am about to graduate this December\u2026after starting my freshman year in 2014. Go ahead and insult me all you want, but I had 2 close friends die within months of each other early in my sophomore year and another pass a year later in a very publicly covered car accident that was said to be a result of extreme fatigue of the driver behind the wheel of his vehicle related to \u201chazing\u201d that had occurred in a ranch trip the night before. To stay on point though, I was pretty mentally messed up throughout college and resorted to drug and alcohol abuse to cope. I didn\u2019t give two shits about my grades and eventually just failed all of my course load, including previously failed classes I was attempting to retake. \n\nAfter being put on academic probation for the second time (after 3 you permanently are expelled), I moved home, worked for 10 months, and returned once my academic probation was lifted to complete my degree. \n\nI was constantly concerned that I had damaged my GPA so much that no matter how well I did in these classes, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to even reasonably consider me a viable candidate in companies\u2019 recruitment efforts. After three semesters and one summer session of retaking several of my courses, I am about to graduate and have a job starting In January with a very good management consulting firm. I retook all my classes and finished with a 4.0 every semester AND openly talked about my experience and how my failure helped drive my will to come out on the opposite end of my shitty college experience. Companies loved hearing that and honestly the best thing that you could do is continue to show up regardless of failing. Mainly so your professor recognizes your failure isn\u2019t necessarily related to your effort. This will USUALLY yield a more beneficial outcome when grades are submitted. No teacher enjoys failing a student, and in my experience, 99% of the time, they will pass you based on the fact you are exhibiting resilience in the face of failure and striving to complete the course/content being taught. \n\nRegardless, keep showing up. The outcome definitely won\u2019t be worse than NOT showing up. Given the low retention of students in the course, professors tend to show much more mercy when the survivors fight it out, regardless of the failing grade. One bad grade won\u2019t dictate your future either. I had failed over 7-8 courses which I have retaken for a all A\u2019s upon my return and have a great job waiting for me in January. I got lucky with the way my university\u2019s course catalog changed to replace any F\u2019s or D-\u2018s in courses with the retaken grade in only business related course. This allowed me to significantly bring up my Business GPA and essentially gave me a 4.0 standing in my major-specialty GPA and minor-GPA (Supply chain Mgmt/MIS).\n\nLong story short, just fight through it. Like I said, Can\u2019t hurt (unless it is actually affecting your ability to contribute time to other courses effectively, as someone else mentioned). Wish you the best of luck regardless and try to stay positive.",
