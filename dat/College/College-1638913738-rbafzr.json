  "text": "I want to go to SJSU, and I'm completing a AAT in psychology. Thing is, I don't know if I want to do Psych anymore. I am seriously considering english teaching, which is a specialized degree that SJSU offers. Anyone have any experience with something like this? I'm feeling a bit lost considering that I've already gone so far with my psych AAT degree.",
