  "text": "I (21M) have absolutely zero clue what to do. I'm going to be starting my junior year as an undergrad and I don't know what my true passion is because I have too many interests. I have an interest in business, or at least I think I do. I've been thinking about Marketing, but there is also a part of me that is interested in the medical field as well. I have been thinking about Physical Therapy as the end game. But that will leave me in crippling debt into my middle years. My family is not rich at all, which means I might struggle. \n\n\nI don't want to be at a desk all day. I'd lose my mind. I'm natually good at writing and somewhat good at working with computers. I've always been told that I would make a good doctor, by my family members but I'm unsure if I am willing to go through the debt to do it. I'd like to think of myself as a creative person. \n\nI have two \"working ideas\"\n\n A business-in-mind route where I major in English and minor Computer Science and eventually get an MBA. Maybe in marketing. \n\nOr a medical route where I major in something like kinesiology and do the pre reqs to get into PT school or whatever. Expensive. But maybe a bit more satisfying in the long run. \n\nOr third plan. I say fuck all that and do something completely and utterly different and just wing it.",

      "text": "\"I don't want to be at a desk all day.\" So, Marketing and Business is out then, yes? Because that's what Marketing/Business people do. They work at desks all day.\n\nMedicine is not desk work all day, but it is often clinic/office work.\n\nSounds like you need to do a lot more career exploration. Meet with a Career Counselor, maybe shadow some job sites. There are tons of creative careers.",

          "text": "Well I guess I'm more interested in the way a business operates than anything. Will I enjoy working in a big corporate operation in that setting? Maybe, maybe not. That's honestly up for debate I guess. Again, like you recited. I don't want a desk job, more specifically a desk centric job such as answering phone calls all day. \n\nThe medical field has always interested me in one form or another. Again the biggest and largest drawback for me is the pricetag. I have had an interest in being a doctor of some kind since I was a kid. But I realize that it is a difficult education and at times an even more difficult lifestyle. \n\nWhile you are right that there are creative careers out there. Many of them simply don't pay the bills. \n\nI feel like with anything I may be interested in there is always a \"but\" in there somewhere. I guess that is life, yeah?",
