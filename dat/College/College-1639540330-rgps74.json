  "text": "Okay so I have the option to go at ASU online for free and I\u2019d like to go for CS degree. I\u2019m a high school senior and I\u2019ve taken AP CS so I have a very very basic understanding of the topic and am wondering if it would be a waste of time or not. My fear isn\u2019t the understanding of computer science but rather the commitment that we need to be given to complete a 100% online degree. What do y\u2019all think? Lmk if you need any clarification If I was vague I\u2019ll respond because I\u2019m genuinely wondering\u2026",

      "text": "Honestly looking back, granted I\u2019m an older student, 100% I\u2019d do it. Especially if it\u2019s free. CS is one of those weird subjects where if you watch the lecture, cool, but you still gotta do some work & practice / teach yourself. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll succeed. I\u2019ve found that my in person lectures are not helpful really. This is bad and I don\u2019t recommend doing this, but no lie, the passed two semesters I can count on one hand how many lectures I watched and/or attended. I\u2019m still doing ok as far as grades go. Decent gpa and everything. So if that\u2019s possible, then I don\u2019t think having a person there showing you matters too much.\n\nLol but then again free is free. You have that extra spending/life $$, I\u2019d imagine you\u2019d still have access to sporting events. As long as it\u2019s ABET accredited, Seems pretty good to me man",
