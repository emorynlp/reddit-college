  "text": "The buses around these parts are\u2026not great in terms of sticking to a schedule, being on time and the hours are sort of limited, so I was wondering, if I wanted to independently move on and off campus, what ways of transportation would be good? A car would be too much for me right now, I\u2019ve looked into like, a Vespa, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to be seen riding around in something I\u2019ve heard is pretty loud and makes me stand out on campus. Are e bikes good? What about hybrid bikes (since they\u2019re less expensive)? Ubers and taxi\u2019s have cost build up, which is something I\u2019d like to avoid, so any advice would be helpful!",

      "text": "How far are you from campus?  Are you typically-abled?  If you're under a mile, I'd say walk.  If you're 1 mile to 15 miles, bicycle.  If the weather is too bad, Uber/Lyft/taxi.  \n\nYou can also make friends with classmates, roommates, or look in subs for your college and find a carpool.  Offer to pay gas, for the trip or something equivalent.",
