  "text": "I just got summoned for Jury duty during finals. in about a month. It's a criminal trial so I doubt it gets resolved before hand, so I'm probably not going to be able to get out of it. I've never been in this situation before and the trial is right during my final exams RIP. Any advice on how to work with my professors or get out of Jury Duty?",

I'm reasonably confident most states allow this, and in California you can even do this online (at least in some counties).\n\nIf you can't get a deferment by mail, phone, or online, when you show up for jury duty, tell the judge this is during your finals and you cannot afford to miss those. I would be shocked if he didn't dismiss you from serving.",

      "text": "I jury duty rules depend on state, so it probably depends on where you are. In some states, just being a student allows you to get out of it. In others, being a student isn't enough, but if you call up the court and tell them you're a student and have finals that week, they'll cancel your jury duty date and send you another notice in a weeks or a few months (or just forget about you). \n\nIn other cases, you can't get out. Because this is a possibility, you should notify your professors ASAP so that you can work out when to take alternative exams. Since jury duty is a legal requirement, they understand that your power in this situation is limited, but since they're in your state, they may also have some advice about how you can get out of it, too.",

If you have to go be sure that you enail your professors ahead of time with the summons so you can arrange to take the final at a different time. \n\nIf you have to report for jury duty you'll go to a process called Voir Dire. This is jury selection where the lawyers and judge ask you questions. One of the questions asked is typically do you have any personal reason you can't be on the jury. This would be the time to bring up you are a student and it is finals week. When I was summoned in the middle of the semester I got a form from the registrar that confirmed I was a registered student. I took it with me to court but didn't need it. I'd suggest that you do the same.",
