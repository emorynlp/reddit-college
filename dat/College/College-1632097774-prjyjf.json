  "text": "Honestly, I have always been terrible at math. I never paid much attention in school, I wish I did though. If I could go back in time and redo school, I would in a heartbeat! I'm just curious, for those of you who struggled like I do, what did you do to get better or good enough to pass college? Is it of much use in your career? I'm wanting to be a forester or something along those lines",

How did they solve those problems? What was their though process. \n\nIt's also important to understand that your confidence in your mathematics skills plays a HUGE roll in your performance. Believing in yourself is half the battle. Cause if you believe in yourself, even when you're failing, you can view that failure as a step toward understanding.",
