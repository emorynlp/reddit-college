  "text": "I'm pretty sure I failed three exams that I had this week because I had been out of my ADHD medication for a while. Which had also made studying for all of those exams really overwhelming. Plus both my grandma and my mom got sick with covid and the world felt numb. To make it worse, my family is withdrawing care because she has no quality of life anymore and won't get better. I just found this out, and I still have to study for next week's exams. How am I supposed to do all of this? There's just too much at once.\n\nUPDATE! So I kinda had a breakdown in one of my exams that I had today. I don't really know what I did but know that I ended up in the bathroom bawling my eyes out, never even took the exam. I went to the counseling office after and they are helping me take a leave of absence. I'm hoping that includes the exam I ran out on, I had reached out to the TA for an extension on something that was due for the test. He said yes but each day it's late it's 10% deduction (or something) so I wound up working on that and not studying...ANYWAYS, I'm hoping things are going to go good now at least school wise. I'm going home tomorrow",

      "text": "I'm also going through a lot of overwhelming events and I \\*just\\* finished emailing one of my profs for an extension on last week's assignments. \n\nI highly recommend getting in contact with your professors/TA's and informing them of your situation and ask for an extension on the assignments that you need. A lot of people are being compassionate due to overwhelming stress especially involving COVID. If it would help with the stricter teachers, you could submit a copy of your mother's/grandmother's positive COVID test (some profs will ask).\n\nMany colleges also have student support where you can get counseling sessions if you need it.\n\nI hope that everything turns out okay!",
