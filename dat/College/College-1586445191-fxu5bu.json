  "title:": "Undergrads: Would you want text reminders about class deadlines?",
  "text": "During the chaos of online instruction, I know a lot of students are having problems with deadlines (I'm being pretty much completely flexible on deadlines at this point as long as people do the work) but it got me wondering: Would you want text reminders about deadlines? Reminders from the LMS sometimes get lost.\n\nI'm doing course planning for an upcoming class and looking at doing text reminders.  It would be 100% optional and in addition to content pushed out through the LMS/email.  I would encourage students to use a bogus phone number (ie, Google Voice number) if they want to keep their actual number private.\n\nThoughts? Is it worth my time to set this up for students?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the input!  I will definitely be incorporating this AS AN OPTION for students next year to opt-in if they wish.  Based on your suggestions, everything will still ALSO go out via the LMS (where I have weekly posts of what's due etc).",

Sometimes things take precedent and things get in the way, i know out of all the assignments i had to do for my online classes the only ones i ever was late on or missed was discussion board comments as i lost track of the days they were due or where i had finished an assignment but hadn\u2019t submitted it yet as i wanted to take one last look at it to review after i took a break from looking at it and would come close to forgetting to submit it that night. \n\nObviously it would help a lot with the current situation but even in normal situations students have jobs and families and most are involved in some type of club or athletic event where sometimes those are up in the air. I know my practice schedule was constantly changing so that would sometimes throw me off. \n\nBut i think it would also benefit professors from getting many emails about students who forgot a deadline but did the work etc. \n\nDepending on the class/assignment I think the idea of sending out one reminder 24 hours before the due date is helpful.",

Sending out an email reminder is already being kind, as most of my professors say that if something is in the syllabus, we\u2019re responsible for it, end of story. I\u2019m still a student so I can\u2019t speak from personal experience what the \u201creal world\u201d is like, but I can\u2019t imagine the same kindness being awarded to us in the workforce. I don\u2019t want to come off as unsympathetic for those who find themselves back home with dysfunctional families, lack access to technology, or have recently lost loved ones, but I just wanted to give a dissenting opinion since no one else has.\n\nI\u2019m extremely opposed to professors who try and make their courses difficult for the sake of difficulty, but I see this as the polar opposite. Regardless, I really appreciate professors like yourself who care about the success of their students and are willing to do more work so that we can have less. We all have a duty to be kind to one another in these difficult times and help each other in any way we can (Just don\u2019t let your kindness get taken advantage of!).",
