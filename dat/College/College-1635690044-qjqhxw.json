      "text": "Schools are there to make money, and its so easy when the federal government signs thousands of dollars over to a student that the school gets first. They'll more than likely tell you loans will cover it and give you a spiel on focusing on your studies and maybe making friends. \n\n\nAs for exceptions there is but it almost always involves living with family already in the area or being a transfer student. Even if they deny you keep fighting it, even if it means going up the ladder to a dean. Advisors will tell you there is nothing you can do but just ask to set up a meeting with someone in registration office. If they tell you they cant, work your way up. If eventually you get nowhere give up or consider advise below. Consider doing community college to save money if it's an option.\n \n\nPart of this is probably hindering on illegal and part of it probably is but this is what I did...\n\nI new a guy who already lives in town. Got him a case of beer and used his address as my official address for school. Basically set it up so it looked like I was living with an uncle. Just be careful with how you submit the paperwork. Usually ends up being a single person in the office that handles that specific thing and there is a good chance they'll recognize your name or see in the records you've already been denied once. Same goes for applying out of state or district. Get in state or distract before starting classes. The paperwork is surprising easy to fudge if you have to and saves you thousands.",
