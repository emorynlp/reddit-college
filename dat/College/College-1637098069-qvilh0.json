  "title:": "how to get out of a single class that has graded attendance",
  "text": "my girlfriend wants to come home this saturday and stay home the entire week but she\u2019s in an orchestra class that has graded attendance on tuesday. if she says she\u2019s sick she needs a dr. note to confirm why she can\u2019t be in attendance. i\u2019m pretty sure her grade is a low A and attendance is most of her grade so there\u2019s no way she could just skip one class. \n\n\nwhat are some possible ideas to get out of one class?\n\nedit: she studies 4-5 hours from home and hasn\u2019t seen her family since the semester began. she just wants to spend thanksgiving week with her family.",

      "text": "Even if attendance is most of the grade that doesnt mean you cant skip 1 class. First of all, in any attendance taking course ive been in they have at least 1 miss free/no points off. If thats not the case, if theres 12 or so class meets, getting an 11/12 for something thats worth 75% or so of the total grade isnt that bad.\n\nBut to answer your question no, she cant get out of unless she fakes sick and gets a doctors note.",

              "text": "11/12 is 92%. Assuming she gets 100% in the other things her grade would be a 94. And yes it could be the difference btwn those grades. She has to decide if missing class is worth that. Theres no getting out of it. Im just saying its possible to get an A even with missing one class, its not impossible as OP claimed.",
