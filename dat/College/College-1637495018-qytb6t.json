You get much more choice during the other quarters, so you can pick which professor you believe to be best for you given reviews from other students.",

I took a Jterm my freshman year and I had 8+ hours of homework each night, 5 days/week and that was for a gen-Ed philosophy class. Additionally, unless you have a pretty extensive chem and bio back ground, the material takes some time to think on. Some of the homework problems are best done over many days because they are difficult. \n\nMy advice would be to take the important classes during regular term so your brain has time to soak in the information- you\u2019ll learn it better. Use summer and J-term for gen-Ed requirements.",

I also enjoyed the smaller class sizes - most my friends came from summer semester classes. You can do it if you set your mind to it- just review the instructor on rate my professor first. The classes are not harder - the content is just taught quicker, typically 5 days a week instead of 2-3 days.",

      "text": "Like everyone said, it\u2019s condensed to a shorter time so it\u2019s harder because the professor will be breezing over difficult topics if it\u2019s a traditionally hard class (like general sciences tend to be). Be aware that this isn\u2019t going to be easy going in and consider making it your only class that semester if you can. You cannot take 12+ hours in a summer and be fine. One class preferred, 2 max IMO. Summer classes are an \u201coh crap I needed to have this class done before this fall semester starts\u201d they aren\u2019t a luxury type thing.",

      "text": "I cannot comment about bio or chem, but can simulate a perspective. \n\nI have taken a grad school engineering statistics course over last summer (I have to say, it was quite stressful, and the instructor is named grim reaper in the college) \nit was the only course I enrolled- if it were fall I\u2019d have plus at least one other. \nI\u2019d be required to do a project- although it is a theoretical course- if I had taken it in fall. \nAll in all, summer enabled me to learn complicated concepts within a short time, and escape the project.",
