  "text": "I am heading into finals seasons with about 6 papers with a word count of 3000 each, and the topics are not remotely connected so I can't use sources or information from one for another. I am really stressed, and when I get stressed, I tend to forget to eat because I'm just not hunger. It got pretty bad during midterms season (which was 2 weeks long) to the point where I would remember to eat a my proper meal at 7 or 8 at night. Sometimes, when I try to eat earlier, I just really nauseous (which I also attribute to stress and anxiety - it's why I can't eat before exams).\n\nI know it's really unhealthy not just metabolism-wise but also regarding cognitive function and brain fog. I'm only just really forgetful when there's no biological reminder so to speak.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? What are some tips to remind myself to eat and not get nauseous?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I've gotten myself some protein shakes and now keep snacks in my room - it's actually helped a decent bit so thanks for all the advice!",

      "text": "So I'm recovering from an eating disorder and lots of these tips get me through the same finals crush:\n\nStart small. Get a high protein, high fat granola bar (I recommend kind protein bars, peanut butter is best lol). Eat these when you feel truly out of time and right before exams.\n\nIf you're forgetting to eat, drink your nutrients! I don't mean sodas, I mean protein shakes if you don't mind them, and smoothies! They don't have no necessarily be healthy if you're picky, like peanut butter and any fruit or even something chocolate. Tons of recipes online for good smoothies for picky eaters lol.\n\nDon't feel guilty about using a 15 minute break from writing to get fast food. Whatever gets you through finals and you can worry about calories later. \n\nIf you have time, meal prep something quick and easy, like I can make 5 quesadillas in an hour and that's five quick and relatively dense meals depending on what you put in. Even just a meat and cheese.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to add: pick a time to eat and set an alarm. Use it as a study break so you can look forward to it as a bit of free time. If you truly have no time, still use the alarm as a reminder to get a granola bar or something",

      "text": "I have trouble remembering to eat when I get into exam seasons, but I always keep a snack within arm's reach for convenience. Granola bars are good, nuts, even something like cheez-its. Setting an alarm for a study break or for taking a moment to eat is something I like to do too. ALWAYS listen to your body and what it's telling you too, even if it's just you thinking \"hm maybe it would be a good idea to eat\". If you feel hungry, get up and find a quick snack, no matter what progress you've made or haven't made. One big thing I've learned is that you can't treat food as a reward, like saying you'll eat after you finish this or do this assignment. It's okay to set alarms as a reminder, but eating is necessary no matter how much you feel like you've gotten done.",
