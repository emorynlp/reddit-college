  "text": "I\u2019m not one to to make a big deal out of small stuff. But this is my last semester, I\u2019m taking a course that I need to graduate. And the Professor is killing my grade because of attendance. \n\nLong story short, her syllabus states we have three free absences and everyone after that we lose two percent of our final grade and every three late counts as an absence. \n\nSo this semester I was later 12 times and absent 13 times in her book. So that 28 percent of my grade I\u2019m losing.  But of those 13 absences 6 of them I was sick. \n\nThe syllabus states that if we\u2019re six I need proper documentation and submit it to the dean or something. I thought that was a bit excessive so I emailed her about it and she said if I shared it with her she would excuse it. I have that on email. But now she\u2019s saying she can\u2019t because I didn\u2019t share it to the dean. Her syllabus states that a late is after 15 minutes. I have instances where I came in ten minutes late and it was counted as an absence and I couldn\u2019t even debate because she posted them a week after and I forgot by then. \n\nLike not making any excuses, I was not a stellar student this semester.  But I did my assignments so there\u2019s no reason for my grade to go from an 88% to almost failing because of so my absences and a couple lates. She was a terrible professor that did not teach well. You ask a question and her answer is because that\u2019s what it is. \n\nWhy would I wanna show up for that? Waste of my time. She also had the audacity to brag the last day of classes that a lot of us will fail solely on attendance alone. \n\nI\u2019m not one to complain but this is her first semester teaching. And this is a 100% bs. What you guys think?",

You knew the requirements, and still chose not to attend half the classes.\n\nAssuming she gives you those 6 sick absences back (3 of which are your free ones), you still have 13 lates and 7 absences. The lates would count as 4 absences, bringing the net total to 11 - or a 22% grade reduction.\n\nIf you\u2019re at an 88%, the lates and absents bring you down to 66%. That a D. Most universities don\u2019t count that as passing credit.\n\nNext time, just show up to class.",

I get that you were sick for 6 classes, and you should absolutely not lose credit for that. But that means you still decided to skip class 7 times and show up late 12 times. You did that with full knowledge of her attendance policy, you knew it would affect your grade, and you still decided to do it. I understand you may have issues making it difficult to get there on time, but the burden would fall on you to discuss that with her. Honestly her attendance policy isn't unreasonable at all, 3 free absences is pretty solid.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean or insulting, but (not including the sick days) this is ultimately something you brought on yourself, and administration will probably say the same thing.",

Sure some of the days you were sick, but more of the absences were because you didn\u2019t want to be there. That would be on you no matter how much the class sucked.",

      "text": "I'm having a similar issue and am trying to backtrack for as many Dr excuses as I can. I've gotten ill SO MANY TIMES this semester. All of my professors have said they absolutely don't want you showing up to class sick. So, when I'm sick I've been sending emails to them to let them know. Covid has seriously changed everything and most mean it when they say don't come. \n\nMost of my professors have been really good about it. I have even mentioned getting drs excuses and basically all of them have just been like \"thank you for letting me know\" \"I hope you feel better soon\" \"this is where you can find the work you need\" \"you will have all the flexibility you will need\" ... Almost none have wanted them. \n\nWell, one prof in particular (who I actually really love despite the fact they they confuse and drive me nuts quite a bit) was probably the most upset about a student coming in with the flu. The professor got sick and was out for two weeks and she was really upset about it. She's also an older professor with asthma, so probably high risk. She even emailed me personally saying something about it and telling me she wouldn't let anyone in the class come in sick, covid or not. \n\nAnywayyy... I took that very seriously. I didn't want to get her ill. Every time I was sick I would email her and send in my work. It never seemed to be an issue... But now she's telling us that most of us aren't doing well in her class. some of us because of all our absences. Now, I'm trying to see how many times I went to the Dr so I can try to get documents sent over. \n\nI feel kind of stupid for not doing that right away, but she made it seem like everything was fine. That, and I can't afford to go to the Dr every time I'm sick. I'm a little upset because I thought I was doing the right thing and the university hasn't been very clear on procedures with covid and sick students. \n\nFrom now on I'm immediately going to try to get Dr excuses as much as I can. That, and try to get something in writing (if it's not mentioned in the syllabus) if the professor tells us we aren't allowed to come in sick. I'm just hoping I'll be okay for her class bc I really tried. She told me I was one of her best students in turned in the best work in the class. :( I just get absolutely wrecked when I get sick and don't want that for anyone else.",

I've spend time in the military and nothing has halted common sense functioning and productivity quite like a religious unbending belief in \"I don't get it either but those are the rules so we gotta do it this dumb way\"",
