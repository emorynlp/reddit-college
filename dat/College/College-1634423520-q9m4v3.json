  "title:": "What normally happens to high school relationships when college starts ?",
  "text": "We have been with each other for about a year and a half and now we have both been in our separate colleges across the country for about 2 months. We still text and never really discussed if we were doing distance or not, just cried when we had to say bye. And say like i miss you and stuff. \n\nIdk i guess I\u2019m kind of just confused. What normally happens with this? I know we aren\u2019t getting married or anything. But like in winter break or summer break I wonder what it would be like seeing her. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m holding on to something that isn\u2019t worth holding on to. Cause I\u2019m only going to see her like 10% of the year at max.",
