  "text": "So I was set to graduate with a major in criminal justice major and a minor in public administration. After taking my first final yesterday, I was pissed because nothing I learned this semester was on my test. I go to speak to my advisor afterwards and he tells me I\u2019m missing TWO MORE CREDITS. I end up having an anxiety attack in front of him. I go home and this man emails me again saying I\u2019m missing 12 credits!!!! What!!! Please keep in mind I\u2019ve checked my advisor about 6 times this semester, and had to be approved to go through my capstone class last semester. Why are they approving me to get into graduating classes if they\u2019re missing shit like this??? I did the math and I should\u2019ve been good!! Anyways. At this point I\u2019m willing to drop my whole minor (which only consists of 4 classes, 12 credits) I\u2019m more than sure this is the schools way of getting more money, but wow; what a waste of hope and effort. I\u2019m lacking sleep and suffering the worse of my health issues right now. I can\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m in so much psychical and mental pain. My whole family knows I\u2019m supposed to be graduating this semester and they\u2019ve even planned me a huge party. \n\n\nI guess why I\u2019m asking is because I don\u2019t know if this is possible. Today is holiday where I\u2019m from so I can\u2019t call the school. I\u2019ve been so invested in my studies and I have no one to ask on whether this is something I can do. Can I drop this minor just to graduate? \n\n\n\nI am going to a college that is accredited and on a U.S territory.",

Even though you may have been poorly advised, you should yourself be cognizant of graduation requirements and whether you are fulfilling them. This information is probably available on an online transcript.",

              "text": "Just because you have the credits doesn't mean you have the right credits. Most schools have a sections marked \"my academic requirements\" or something similar under your academic records online that will show you exactly what classes you're missing.  They require a specific number of credits in specific subjects and if you're short then you don't qualify.  You could be missing some history, life sciences, or math credits and if you don't take the right classes then you can't graduate.\n\nAs for the minor, check your requirements.  The school I'll probably be attending when I transfer requires either an internship or minor to be completed in order to qualify for graduation.  Not all schools have this requirement so you need to check with the school. \n\nAlso, be sure you're looking at the requirements from the year you started there, the requirements for the same program could have changed and be different for students who are just now entering the program.",

      "text": "Assuming all of the requirements of you major are met, you should be able to get your degree. If any of them aren't met, you may not be able to, you'd have to ask your advisor. It depends on the class that's missing, sometimes they may overlook 3 credit hours of an elective or something, but its pretty abnormal for them to do so in my experience. My first college I went to didn't even offer one of the required classes for the pre-med degree, so they just overlooked it when giving out the degree.",
