      "text": "im the only latino in all my classes, in cs, and one of my classes this semester, a professor was latino. He made small coding sessions to learn more about the chapters we went over class. It was easier for me to talk to him, because we both had similar accents and it was great to interact with another latino this semester. I will miss this teacher, and he helped me understand object oriented programming in c++, and helped me to finish strong during this semester.",

      "text": "This mostly happened in later courses or courses in the major, but it was common for at least the last 5 minutes of the last lecture to be the teacher sharing their experiences, telling an inspirational story, thanking us for being good students, etc. I had many classes that ended in applause for the professor and at least a few misty eyes. But there were also plenty of others where it was just business as usual.",
