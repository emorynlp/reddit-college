  "title:": "Not judging. I just need to know. Why would someone turn in nothing all semester and show up to the final?",
  "text": "I want to understand. I don\u2019t like failing people. But I am honestly shocked at who showed up to my final this week. People I have not seen in months and who have less than a 30 in the course. You could score 400/100 on the test and still fail. \n\nWhy are you here? Why didn\u2019t you write any papers? What would better motivate you?\n\n\nEdit: was not expecting this large of a response!\n\nAll I want to say is, thanks. I understand college is hard. It was for me at times. Very much so. I\u2019ve been through the mental health ringer, health events, family crises, and had it derail school. I failed classes, hit academic probation, but eventually bounced back and am now a professor. \n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but I do encourage you to reach out to your profs when things go south. Some are more receptive than others. I generally accommodate these things. The counseling/mental health centers and academic advisers can sometimes be helpful advocates too. The earlier you reach out the better. \n\nAlso, if you have ideas, let me know what we can do better. I hate knowing students are flying under the radar with this, when I\u2019m more than willing to help.",

I've tried sending emails explaining how I'm struggling with my mental health and that my medication is not helping. Literally 1 professor responded. I have a gastrointestinal condition and I've had to get accommodations for them but it's only applicable to testing. I'm not going to come to your class when I'm struggling to focus because I'm trying not to shit my pants. I'm sorry that I'm a fuck up but I have no control over this. If I'm leaving every 10 minutes to use the bathroom, how am I learning? A lot of professors, especially engineering professors at my school, treat students like robots. I wish they'd realize their treatment just makes things worse but it is what it is.",

Things were great in the beginning because of the thrill of it being over, but at the time I didn't realize how badly what I had gone through had affected me. One professor wrote me off as a complete failure and waste of time, which didn't help. It wasn't until two years later when I started counseling that I was diagnosed with PTSD from what had happened that had gone untreated for a long time. I ended up dropping out of school completely at the end of that year because of some other things that ended up happening, but for me I felt a sense of \"justice\" (I guess you could call it that?) when I ended up going to that teacher to explain what happened when I'd taken his class three years earlier and he apologized for making the judgment that he had.",

Especially if you are on any kind of Financial Aid. Perhaps these people think they can get Financial Aid indefinitely. Not so. The usual requirement is that you must maintain at least a 2.0 GPA.\n\nNot only would I ask, but I'd also hand him or her a piece of paper with something like: \"You did not fulfill the requirements of this class. Your final grade is F\\[U\\].\"  .......... (that's an actual grade term for \"Fail, Unearned\")\n\nGoing to college is **hard work.** If you're not motivated or want to keep making excuses, don't waste yours or everyone else's time.",

Also not going to the final, at least in my school, gives you an INC or an incomplete which doesn't allow you to enroll for the class the next semester.

Anyhow, I also really dislike listening to a professor (he had a strong accent, also adding that) reading powerpoints. I mean... I can just do that myself during my spare time. Lastly there was a 20 page research paper due at the end of the semester (25%). I wrote that overnight, and studied for all my exams in less than 2 hours and ended up passing with an 83%. I spoke with some students that literally went to every class, and were flunking. So...Could I have done better?  Possibly, but I just don\u2019t care enough to put the effort in it.

The rest of that semester was a fog of depression, and to this day I don\u2019t recall a lot of what happened during those months. My mom at least finally got the hint and stopped asking me questions about that semester. A lot of what I did that semester did not make logical sense. Why did I turn in some assignments and not others? Attended certain classes and then skipped the next? Or would go for weeks and then not go for weeks? Why did I take finals for classes I knew I was going to fail? Honestly, it was all due to severe depression. It\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s just how it was. I paid the price academically that semester, and while I did not ask for mental or educational help during those months, I did take the following semester off of school and got the help I needed. It didn\u2019t ease the shame, or help me regain that time lost, but I did get myself back on track. Obviously everyone\u2019s story is different, but I think there are way more students struggling with mental health issues in college than we even begin to realize, and for some of your students, that might be why they have behaved this way.",

Like I saw it as paying for a little piece of paper at the end and felt like around 85% of my classes were bullshit and I was not going to be pursuing any further education after my bachelor\u2019s. With that in mind, I did the absolute bare minimum in order to scrape by enough to pass most of the time. If there was an attendance policy, I would typically drop a class because I\u2019m great at exams and papers and didn\u2019t want to waste my time filling a seat. \n\nI\u2019d typically feel out the first week to see if attending the course would actually matter (in liberal arts.... it really typically doesn\u2019t as long as you can comprehend whatever source material is going on in the class) and drop in from time to time (just important days and when things were due if I could get away with it). I took finals where I didn\u2019t have a midterm grade or paper grades back where in all reality I may have been failing or on the cusp of it but didn\u2019t know better. Probably wouldn\u2019t have wasted the time taking the test otherwise though. \n\nAnd unlike anyone citing people doing it out of embarrassment, that was never my reasoning. If a prof called me out at the time and told me it was a waste of time to take the test, I would have been happy about it because I found college a very expensive waste of time in general. (And just to add: I love learning & don\u2019t think college is a waste for everyone!!!! Just didn\u2019t feel like I got a lot out of it, which was probably as much my own doing as anything else!)",

      "text": "I know for some schools, it's a financial aid thing. My school doesn't do it the same way, if you miss more than a number of classes (usually it's around 3-6 depending on how frequent the class is and reasoning for absence) you get a 'FA' or failure to attend, so it doesn't matter if you miss or take the final. \n\nFor some of them, it could be a chronic illness or mental illness thing. I missed a lot of classes because of my Chronic Illness which would require an ER visit to bring me back to normal, it flared up pretty bad with stress, although I managed to not miss too many, mine only happened 3-4 times a semester (where I had to miss class, sometimes it flares up mildly). And I have a friend who wound up turning to online school because she had such severe agoraphobia that she'd have breakdowns going to class. Both our problems were low occurrence issues, but for some of them, that could be it. \n\nAlso, I think some people just feel so bad and wretched by the end of the semester that doing a final, regardless of the impact on their grade, alleviates some guilt.",

      "text": "I did this for a few of my classes the first time I tried going to college. At the time, I had severe anxiety and depression that made going to lecture nearly, and on some days, 100% unbearable. The anxiety also crippled my ability to write, and the depression made trying insurmountably burdensome and pointless besides. Not turning in assignments and missing lecture was NOT due to a lack of motivation, it was because I had so overburdened myself with expectations they were crushing me. My family was pretty clueless about mental health, and I was too humiliated at my own struggles to ask my teachers for help. \n\nHowever, I still showed up for exams because they were a small, finite (vs a paper that can always be turned in 1 day later), low-interaction thing I could do to prove to myself I was at least a tiny percent capable of facing the work, that I wasn\u2019t fully and hopelessly paralyzed. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve gotten a lot of help for my mental health problems, and am back at college getting mostly As/Bs. But it was a really long road. Having teachers like you that genuinely wanted to understand my struggles and offered empathy, instead of being mad at me for being \u201cirresponsible\u201d and confirming my then-held belief I was garbage, made a world of difference. Thank you for wanting to better understand your struggling students.",

I was freezing in my flat, not eating well and hardly sleeping. Eventually you feel so out of control that you miss every deadline but still feel the anxiety of missing that deadline. At least turning up to an exam I achieved something.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not up to the lecturer to help. But if it\u2019s happening to multiple people and you really can\u2019t get your head around it, you could ask them. If you really care, you could find a way to help.

If he passes the final, he learned the course material, and therefore deserves to pass. Maybe assign him an essay on the value of hard work or something to make up for the other stuff.\n\nNow, I know you won't even consider it because it isn't fair to your other students, but seriously, think about what the whole point of a final exam is for the future.

The reality I think is mental health and the fact that they aren't taking good care of it, probably because they were not taught how to (i.e. recognizing the signs, meeting with professionals, getting medicated if necessary) because they are all on their own now.\n\nThey aren't admitting to themselves yet which is why they continue to use these excuses rather than getting help, so I'm not sure that they'll have the self-realization to tell you in this thread why they are doing what they are doing.",

I can personally tell you, as someone who has TA'ed for a few years, this kind of stuff happens. I've had students who should have failed no question but ended up passing because the professor overseeing the class let them retake the exam or make up all bunch of work last min (which I had to grade...) or gave them extra credit. Sometimes these kind of students have legitimate excuses. Sometimes their excuse is something like \"I didn't have the textbook\" (an actual excuse I was given by a student who only handed in 1/12 assignments all semester...Edit: the professor let this student make up the work and the student passed)",

I submitted all my other assignments this semester and the only reason I didn\u2019t show up was because I spent the entire morning crying.   \n\nMy advisor contacted me and I was honestly surprised that she was more worried about me being okay than having missed the presentation.  The point of this is that I didn\u2019t intentionally miss the presentation, I just had no idea that I could\u2019ve avoided all this mess if I had talked to her sooner.",

As I have stated my view, and the views of most professionals, is testing does not prove knowledge so I wouldn't put much weight into said exam. Now if said student had a failing grade going into this exam yes that student would fail the course, there are consequences for our actions, or lack of action.

I have also been in courses that a 95% was considered a B, and a 65% was a fail. That determination has no effect of a test.

Ended up with Cs on the exams and a D for the course because material was different. I later learned to show up at least some of the time to boost my attendance and grade. Hopefully your students learn the same. I dont think they are evene necessaripy a bad person for doing this, because I told myself I would start going back but it becomes a snowball of bad attendance and it becomes harder to go back after missing a couple sessions due to just general anxiousness",

After the third hour covering the same material, a number of us decided to take a week off of some of the classes because it was too redundant.  The problem is, once you get into a new schedule for a week, it's hard to break it.  And then you pop in for one class and it all still seems pretty easy, so you take another week off.  Next thing you know it's the end of the semester and you're gulping energy drinks asking that friend who loves calculus to catch you up.\n\nI'm not better than my friend in this case either.  I skipped physics 2 and favored calc 3 and statics, while he skipped calc 3.  Our GPAs ended up worse than they should've been because we couldn't find the time to put into the classes.  College was an expensive way to learn time management, but the overall story ended well as we're now both doing pretty well in our fields.",

I made myself go to my finals because giving up completely and skipping finals seemed too much like a cop-out, and I thought that maybe the embarrassment of showing up at the final after being M.I.A most of the semester would motivate me to take better care of myself and stay on top of things next semester. Looking back, it didn\u2019t really make any difference but it made sense in my head at the time.\n\nBut I would be willing to bet that some of those students may not realize they\u2019re failing as badly as they are, don\u2019t know how or are too lazy to calculate the grade they would need to pass, or have somehow convinced themselves that they might get a curve or extra credit that will help them pass.

I'm not really sure if there's anything my professors could have done to help with that, it's kind of just a personal thing.\n\nI'm also far too used to the attitude that my high school teachers had, which was something along the lines of \"I've heard every excuse under the sun; if it's not on my desk by the start of class then it's a 0 no matter what your reason is.\" I know they were just trying to teach us responsibility, which I appreciate, but it kind of conditioned me to think that if I fall behind then it's no use trying to catch up. As I'm getting older, though, I'm realizing that the real world is typically more understanding than that. Obviously deadlines are extremely important, but most of the time people will try to accommodate if you have extenuating circumstances as long as you communicate what's going on. I know most of my professors would be understanding, I just haven't got to the point where I can be understanding towards myself, if that makes sense.\n\nI think next semester I'm going to register my mental health diagnoses through the university, whatever that looks like, and if it works out I'm going to encourage my friends with similar issues to do that same.

They don\u2019t always have to pay the aid back for failure, but will require the last date of attendance to prove they tried in the course. If they fail, they may also have the option of retaking it later for a grade forgiveness. I\u2019m assuming they realized they were struggling after the drop date or they would become part time by dropping the course and have to repay money for that.

If I had failed too many classes Financial Aid would have dropped me altogether. They wouldn't have extended the money. I know someone who tried that. She got away with dropping 2 classes, and they hauled her into the office and told her she'd be cut off if she did it again.\n\nIf you know of a college like that let me know.

I just have a different perspective on why he may have chosen a failing grade. Additionally if this is the only class he\u2019s done that with and he wasn\u2019t a freshman, he probably didn\u2019t lose his financial aid  because his pass/fail rate and gpa could have been high enough to keep it",
