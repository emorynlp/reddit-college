  "text": "I\u2019m (23/F) going back to school at a local college for a graphic design degree. I work full time and live with my boyfriend on our own completely. Up until now I\u2019ve worked a Monday-Friday 8:30-5 job, lately with a ton of overtime because my company was acquired by corporate. I am leaving the company next month, so I will be job hunting soon. My problem is as I\u2019m trying to enroll in classes, most all that I have left require some type of in person class for a couple hours a week, no online options. From anyone else\u2019s personal experience, would it be easier for me to find a job first and then see if I can work a class schedule into it, or vice versa? I like Monday-Friday work just because it keeps my life scheduled, and I like online classes because I can work them around my life, but this local school doesn\u2019t seem to offer evening classes or anything on a weekend. I\u2019m also wondering if I\u2019d be better off finding a completely online graphic design school, or if future employers may not view that as a legitimate degree? Any and all advice is appreciated, I\u2019m feeling kind of lost right now!",

I only work two days a week and arrange them around my classes. \n\nIf you like Monday-Friday maybe you could do classes Monday and Wednesday, and work Tuesday Thursday Friday. Part time will probably be the best option. \n\nFor full transparency I've only ever had the one job :D So, those are just ideas!",
