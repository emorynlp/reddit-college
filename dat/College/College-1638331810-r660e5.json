  "text": "I started studying for finals the other day (I have one on the 11th and another on the 15th), and I try to study for about 2 hours daily for each (starting two weeks in advance for each respectively), but I tend to alternate between studying all day and not studying nearly enough due to test anxiety which ultimately leads me into a downward spiral where I don't feel like I'm doing enough to really be ready come exam time, it also doesn't help when I also have term papers due that I have to get done (a 3000 worder due on the 9th) which makes the anxiety that much worse and tends to contribute to my freezing up when it's time to study, anyways because of the aforementioned anxiety I never know how much studying is enough for an exam, what's a normal amount to study for a final? is 2 hours a day 2 weeks in advance enough?",
