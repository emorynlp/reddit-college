  "title:": "Is this normal behavior for college roommates?",
  "text": "I have had a lot of problems with my college roommates (3 other guys) and would like to know if this is normal behavior from roommates.\n\nTo preface this, we are freshman, but the school ran out of dorms, so we are staying in off-campus housing.\n\nThese roommates never clean up after themselves. My roommate in my shared bedroom, it is an obstacle course just to leave. He stuffs everything such as trash and old clothes underneath his bed. The shared closest, he just throws everything into with no organization. He also leaves the bathroom in terrible shape-the shower and sink are covered in his hair, which he never cleans up.\n\nThey leave their old dirty pots and pants once they are done cooking sitting out in the kitchen for days and they leave the floor and counter covered with the scraps of food they were cooking with. In the living room, they leave out their old dishes once they are done eating. In this same space, they will just leave their shoes in the middle of the ground or use the sofa to store random objects like sheets.\n\nFurthermore, they drink alcohol and smoke marijuana quite literally everyday. Like EVERY single day. They also roll joints all the time, which stinks up the house of marijuana. They will throw parties at least twice a week and totally trash the house with alcohol bottles, pizza boxes, etc.Often there will be some random person  that they invited over throwing up in my bathroom because they got so drunk.\n\nThese guys literally started a fire at one point and the fire department had to come to put it out! Luckily nothing bad happened.\n\nIs this normal behavior from college roommates? Is the lack of cleanliness and the constant alcohol and drugs common? I have texted and told them in person many times to try and clean up, but to no avail. Are these valid reasons to contact the school and try and change rooms?",

But certainly they are around.\n\nSee if the college housing office has a list of students that prefer to live neatly. Likely there are others like you.  Not an unusual issue.\n\nRoomies suck.  Look for neat ones.\n\nOne clue if YOU're doing the searching is to look inside their car.  It will look like their living space.\n\nMaybe an ad in the student paper.\n\nBest\n\nP. S.

My husband and I met in college and we're the same about leaving dishes in the sink until we can fill the dishwasher, leaving out clean clothes instead of putting them away immediately, things like that. But we both can't stand actual food left out, dirty dishes anywhere but the sink, trash around the house, etc. Clutter, yes, filth, no.\n\nI got extra lucky I lived with my parents and my only roommate situation has been with my husband.",

      "text": "Hi,   \nStudent housing professional here.   \n\n\nYour situation is not uncommon but certainly not something that would typically be described as \"normal living conditions\". There's generally a few people like this who end up being the focal points of parties and social activities, but the reality is most people don't live like this. You just don't hear about it as often because they aren't the ones your see making headlines.  \n\n\nThe sad fact is at your age few people have been brought up with the skills to properly care for themselves, and fewer understand how to manage themselves with the newfound freedoms associated with moving away from home for the first time.   \n\n\nIf off-campus housing is in any way managed by the school you should absolutely contact the school to see if they can intervene in some way. Know that changing rooms is usually the last resort when it comes to handling situations like these as it's not common that rooms are just \"available\" elsewhere for you to move into.   \n\n\nHowever, starting the process sooner than later is likely your best course of action to having a successful year in school. This is why I generally recommend, if the option is available, people stay in student housing with dedicated staff to help resolve these issues early and prevent them from getting to this point. I realize that wasn't an option for you but if help is available you can seek it out.",

Sadly this is a result of their parents cleaning up after them and not holding them responsible. But while doing this also look into moving out. Good luck my friend. Roommates suck but you have some extra sucky ones.",

It\u2019s a shitty reality but it\u2019s our reality. \n\nThose \u201croommate talks\u201d have never ever ever amounted to anything for me. And I consider myself a somewhat persuasive / compromising guy. I\u2019m not gonna type it all out again or copy / paste it cos I\u2019m on mobile, but look 3 comments before this in my post history for a little bit more of an in depth explanation.\n\nThe whole \u201cdo what I tell you or your shit is gonna end up in the trash\u201d is not the way to handle this. Sure it works in theory, no one wants their weed thrown away and not leaving it out is a simple solution, but this method WILL cause a massive amount of tension and resentment in the household. I\u2019d rather deal with a messy household than having to deal with the constant uneasiness, paranoia, and tension that accompanies having beef with one of your roommates. Not to mention throwing away someone\u2019s weed for leaving it on the table is a great way to get your ass beat.\n\nI get the feeling that you haven\u2019t had to deal with many messy roommates, but let me tell you how your \u201csweeping shit into the hall\u201d method would turn out: a pile of clothes, sitting in the hall, for the same amount of time that they would\u2019ve been sitting on the bathroom floor. Messy roommates are some of the most uncompromising group of people I\u2019ve ever had to deal with.",

Then, 3 of us (our 1 roommate was a lazy POS) snapped out of it and cleaned often. Deep cleaned once a week, etc. \nKeep in mind, we did this while throwing ragers, smoking and drinking all the time. \nWhen we talked to our 4th roommate about him needing to hold his weight in regards to helping us and he wasn't about it, us 3 got a place together the next year and let him find his own living situation. \n\nThis is definitely not your scene, but talk it over with them. They'll realize that it's a big relief and easier to enjoy your time together in a cleaner environment.",

There are always bits of egg everywhere, including the pan that he doesn't wash. \n\n>Furthermore, they drink alcohol and smoke marijuana quite literally everyday.\n\nMy housemates drink beer (as do I) but we aren't out of control about it. One of the housemates smokes weed but not everyday, however, he used to smoke cigarettes right outside my window so I had to talk to him a few times before he finally smoked somewhere else. \n\n>These guys literally started a fire at one point and the fire department had to come to put it out! Luckily nothing bad happened.\n\nWe didn't have an actual fire luckily, but one of the housemates left a pot of beans on the stove and I was able to catch it before I went to bed (it was around 1-2am). Most the water had evaporated and the beans on top were burning so it could have caused a fire had I not caught it in time. \n\nOverall I would say my experience has been similar to yours. My housemates aren't very social so we don't have any parties thankfully, and they tend to keep most of their mess in their rooms.",

      "text": "Yes it\u2019s gross. But YES, it is also common. \n\nI\u2019ve had 10+ roommates during college, scattered across different housing situations. Lived under 5 different roofs. Every living situation I\u2019ve ever lived in in college with an all guy household has been pretty messy / gross. I used to be one of them until I moved out of my old house (a satellite fraternity house with 3 other roommates) and into one with my friends who were already graduated. I used to live in that house in pretty messy conditions, not only because the common area was gross from having people over all the time, but also because it\u2019s *hard* to find motivation to clean your room and common area when you know the rest of the house is just going to be gross again in like 3 days tops. Living with college-age guys, I grew desensitized to living in gross conditions and was at a point at my last house where my room was also pretty messy / gross most of the time. Visiting the many houses that I did during college, theirs generally didn\u2019t look too different from mine most of the time. \n\nThat being said: get out of your living situation if you don\u2019t want to deal with it. I\u2019ve tried to talk to roommates about cleaning more often before, MANY conversations (offering ultimatums, rewards, common sense, you name it), and have also seen other roommates try to have that same talk with the group, but it always boils down to either 1) constant arguments and tension between roommates 2) being the \u201cmom\u201d of the house and having your roommates talk shit about how \u201coverbearing\u201d you are (again, more tension) 3) accepting you\u2019re gonna live in a gross house, or 4) doing ALL the work yourself. Pick your poison. Even when the talks \u201cwork\u201d, they still end up being messy roommates after 2 weeks tops. People aren\u2019t down to change their lifestyle for a roommate and I\u2019ve been convinced of that. Some people like to reserve the right to live in disgusting households for some reason. \n\nIf you want to live in a clean house, you HAVE to find clean roommates unless you\u2019re okay with there being constant tension and maybe even resent in the household constantly. And clean, college aged male roommates might be nothing more than a star to wish upon. Either that or live on your own, but not everyone can deal with that especially when dealing with the stress of college, and many more will not be able to afford it. My situation didn\u2019t change for the better until I started living with people who aren\u2019t college-aged anymore, and even now, I still do a hefty portion of the cleaning (\u201copening\u201d and \u201cclosing\u201d shifts as I describe them). \n\nSo yeah. If you want to live in a clean house with your current roommates, you can try to have a conversation with them, but just know that when we were that age it always amounted to either pretty much nothing, or constant tension in the household. Might be time to find another situation if it bothers you, and I don\u2019t blame you. Messiness in a household is a cancer that can spread to you and your own space.\n\nEdit: The weed and the alcohol are pretty much the same story. If you live in a situation with more than 2 roommates total including you, there is going to be drinking and smoking in college, no ifs ands or buts. You can try to have a conversation with them about it, but expect it to turn out like I described above. If you don\u2019t want to deal with that, same deal, you have to move out or find new roommates. Again, people are not down to change their lifestyle for a roommate.",
