  "text": "So I want to sleep over at my boyfriend\u2019s house this Saturday but I don\u2019t know what to tell my super conservative roommate. We share a dorm so she\u2019ll know if I\u2019m not there and she\u2019ll probably freak out if I just don\u2019t come back for the night. A big problem here is that my family is also conservative and she\u2019s also in contact with them. We go out together, I see her conservative parents too. I\u2019m definitely the odd one out here. \n\nWhat do I tell her? I have to say something",
