They are very much under the impression that being a doctor is more rewarding, prestigious, and financially good, but I think engineering can be the same way. Is there anyone who can help me out?",

      "text": "The main thing I would do is show them the financial advantage of not going to school for an extra 6 years of whatever it would be. As an EE, you could make easily 60k per year, more if you're a top student. So in the time that you are going to medical school you could make 300k+, and avoid 6 figure debt, so you're coming out half a million dollars ahead in the short term. So while a doctor may come out ahead in the long term, it will take you 15-20 years to make up the difference.\n\nAlso, without too much semi-informed political commentary, I feel like the medical industry is stable in that you'll always have a job, but if there's major reform coming who knows how doctors will make out. As an electrical engineer, there are many industries on the up and up like EVs, renewable energy, traditional energy, semiconductors, industrial automation, etc.",
