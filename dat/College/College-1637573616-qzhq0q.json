  "text": "ive been working on this computer programming assignment for eight hours straight and im completely stumped. it is currently 4:30am where i am, its due at 8:00am and i have an 8:30am class this morning. my uni computing professor said he would only count the best 5 out of 6 assignments this semester, and this is assignment number 5. ive been doing okay in the class so far and currently have about an 83%. should i just skip this assignment, take the 0, and go to sleep? im starting to feel physically sick from the sleep deprivation. but i also feel super stressed about the mark. any advice (or some support) is appreciated :)",
