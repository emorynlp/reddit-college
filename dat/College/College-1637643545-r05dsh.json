  "text": "I'm writing a paper about the effects that the war on drugs had on the US, and my idea is to show a few graphs about incarceration rates, murder rates, etc. and correlate it to the years prohibition of substances was the most prominent. To do this I will obviously need some graphs, and I have taken a few from some websites which I have sourced when it occurred to me this might be plagiarism. I will be explaining these graphs verbally, but the graphs still make up the meat of the project. Do I have to plot all the data points myself or can I just use the graphs?",
