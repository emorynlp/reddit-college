You can still do great things!! For the semester I ended up with an F for that class, I also had two withdraws. (I was going through it that semester), now I am on track to start applying to med school and I make straight A\u2019s. \n\nKeep. Going. \n\nYou can do this \n\nGood luck!!",

I withdrew from a class earlier in the semester because the teaching style didn\u2019t work for me, and the class I failed was the one I dedicated my extra attention too. But all I can say is that failure is a part of learning! I\u2019m going to retake the class, and you should too!",
