  "text": "Unpopular opinion: Being alone, or at least choosing to be alone, most of the time is the best thing ever. Being around other people and going to places in a group gets exhausting for me at least. Being by myself when I eat, go for a walk, and study is so peaceful to me. No need for a forced conservation, no need for drama, no need to talk. \ud83d\ude1a",

I had roommates last year when I lived on campus who were real pieces of work so it\u2019s SO nice to no longer have to deal with them + I\u2019m an introvert and need time alone and privacy. My apartment is my safe space for when I need to retreat somewhere so it\u2019s so nice :)",
