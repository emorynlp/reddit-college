  "text": "so obviously we all know internships are super important to have while in college. the problem im having is that while i can find a few that seem good, i dont have the money to get housing or transportation to be able to participate. i dont have a car, and i cant afford one. and to be able to be part of an internship that is not located near my parents house, id have to have housing and im not sure i can afford that either. has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you combat it?",
