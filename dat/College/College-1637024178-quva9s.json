      "text": "Similar story here. Last semester semester the fire alarm kept having issues and would go off twice a week, super annoying. One evening at about 9pm I was playing Apex with one of my buddies at another college across the country. We were in the top three teams left and tithe fire alarm went off... My buddy asks me what the sound is and I told him it's nothing, my friends came and knocked on my door and asked if I was going I said Frick that I'm getting this dub boyyyysss. While I was standing at the door my buddy got downed and I had to 1 v 3. Safe to say best fire alarm I've skipped to date, got the fire alarm clutch.",
