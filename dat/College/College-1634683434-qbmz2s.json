  "text": "So it\u2019s currently my freshman year in college and I feel like a workaholic right now. I can\u2019t see myself having fun because I think it will get in the way of studying and if I do go and hang out with the friends I made I just feel like I wasted my time. All I think about are my job and studying half the time I want to just enjoy myself but I just can\u2019t. I never really studied in high school and did fine but I came to college started studying and now I feel like all I need to do is work.",

          "text": "I dunno if my comment got through the first time so: \n\nI\u2019m not a workaholic. I just get anxious. I can relate to what you\u2019re saying about feeling like you\u2019re wasting time by having fun. I felt the same way when I was going to school. I didn\u2019t necessarily say no to going out with friends, but I did feel anxious about what homework, or projects, or studying I \u201cshould have\u201d been doing\u2014 and I was very on top of things already. \nThe difficult thing with school is, unlike a job, there is no set amount for how much of your time you have to dedicate to it. When a work day is done, you can go home and not think about it. But with school, and studying, this obviously isn\u2019t the case. \nWhat helped for me, was to schedule my time for friends. So that I could have a dedicated block of time devoted to hanging out, or doing hobbies, or whatever I wanted. And I made sure to still keep on top of my assignments so that I wasn\u2019t behind on anything that would cause me to be overly anxious about it. This can be as often as you like, every week, two weeks. Whatever works with your course load, but I think for most folks a bit of time to relax or have fun can go a long way for maintaining mental well-being and relationships too if you\u2019re spending that time with friends. So taking that time is hardly a \u201cwaste.\u201d\n\nNot saying that this will definitely work for you, not all the same things work for everyone, but I think it might be worth giving it a try. \n\nIf it\u2019s causing you distress, I would recommend speaking to someone you trust about it (aside from Internet people), or perhaps through resources offered by the school if you\u2019re comfortable with that.",
