  "text": "i am currently a commuter student in college and a freshman. i have been realizing that it\u2019s been hard to get involved on campus and my commute is about 30 mins. i also take 8ams which make it really hard for me to get a good amount of sleep and study at the same time. I was planning on moving into one of my dorms for the spring semester but the cost is really expensive. I also don\u2019t want to regret the decision of moving on campus and not enjoying it. What do you recommend?",

      "text": "It's hard to be involved on campus, but it's not impossible. Dorms tend to be a rip off, but many colleges require first-year students to stay in them. You could live at home and save and try to find an apartment just off campus for your second year with a roommate. That would cut costs. Generally speaking, though, you need to do some calculations. What are your expected earnings when you graduate based on the prestige of your school and your likely major? How badly do you want the on campus experience? How far in debt will you have to go to get it?",

      "text": "Get a dorm with your own room. If you don\u2019t have your own room it\u2019s not worth it tbh. But if you do get a from then get super involved on campus like a club or sport. I worked in the library as well as joint a few frats. Totally worth it. But if you are antisocial just stick with commuting it\u2019s gonna be hard until you get into your major because general education classes suck but when you get into your major you really just stay in the Sam building all day so it\u2019s fine.",
