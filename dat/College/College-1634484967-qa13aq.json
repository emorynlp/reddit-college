  "text": "Hi guys. I\u2019ve never posted in here before so let me know if I did something incorrectly please. \n\nI previously had to drop out in my second semester at community college due to losing my job, and a few years later, I returned to school full time. I\u2019m now in my fourth semester (final semester in the spring) and I am struggling. My first semester back to school, I did really well, all As and Bs, which is great since my GPA tanked to a 2.0 when I dropped out. I\u2019ve been trying to push myself to reach a 3.5 by graduation, and I\u2019m only taking 16 credit hours this semester so I thought this would be attainable. I\u2019ve even been inducted into my school\u2019s honor society chapter, and I\u2019m really excited about learning the material and honestly enjoy being in school again. The problem is that I feel so burnt out that I dread doing the work, and a lot of times, I just don\u2019t have the time. It feels like all I do is study and go to work. \n\nI work 30-35 hours a week on average at my PT job, and I don\u2019t make enough money to support myself right now, and honestly, I need to work less to be able to spend more time on my coursework, but that just isn\u2019t in the cards for me at the moment. On top of financial problems and a lack of time, I have a chronic pain disability that also requires me to have more sleep than the average college student, like I actually need 8 hours of sleep to function - so pulling all-nighters makes me physically ill and more in pain than usual, and I just can\u2019t seem to find enough time in the day to do the same amount of work I used to do while working 40+ hours per week. \n\nDo you guys have any tips that can help me stay on track and motivated? I have all my assignment due dates in a spreadsheet so I don\u2019t forget about deadlines, but other than that and spending a lot of time at the library, I don\u2019t really have many other study skills under my belt. I appreciate any suggestions you guys might have, and thank you in advance!",
