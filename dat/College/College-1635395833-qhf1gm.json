  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am interested in research in pure mathematics. In order to find a research advisor though, I am constantly advised to go to office hours and make lasting connections with my professors, but I am wondering how really people do that? Whenever I have a confusion in class, I feel like it is a stupid question, so I come home and I do research myself, and try to figure out what I don't get from sites like Math Stack Exchange.  I don't understand the point of going to office hours just to ask questions. Any suggestions?! Help will be appreciated!",
