  "text": "I'm a college student living in an apartment with a full kitchen. I have plenty of money for food - the problem is, I find it very hard to *spend* that money in general, and as a result, I spend the absolute bare minimum on food.\n\nI have barely enough to eat at any given time and most of the time what I do have is so unappetizing that I don't cook anything and just scrounge enough random things together so that I'm not hungry. I either wait too long to buy food and almost run out, or I keep buying the same cheap things over and over again and end up not wanting to eat it. Usually both. This results in weird meals like a bowl of corn and two pieces of toast for dinner, or eating carrots until I'm full.\n\nI want to stress that I do eat, even if I don't really *want* to, but I don't really feel interested in it most days. I promise it's not as bad as it sounds, and it's not like I have an eating disorder or anything. I think mostly it's a combination of lack of variety and my own inability to spend money on food that's causing this - plus generally poor mental healthy does make things worse sometimes, of course. That's really all it is - some sort of weird mental block I have going on.\n\nBasically what I'm asking is does anyone have resources or recipes they could share for easy, affordable meals, so that I'm not stuck eating random stuff for every meal? I feel like it might help me feel motivated to make food. I have no recipes of my own that I can make with what I have here. Thanks.",

Then when it\u2019s mealtime, scoop some mac and cheese on a plate and heat it up in the microwave. Take a slab of raw salmon and squeeze a little bit of lemon or lime juice onto it, then a spoonful of water. Add seasonings to taste. Put it in the microwave for 2-3 minutes. This is a quick way to cook the salmon, it should be fully cooked after only a few minutes in the microwave. Put your salmon and mac and cheese on a plate and enjoy :)\n\nI, too, am living on my own in an apartment with my own kitchen. This meal is something I\u2019ve made several times this semester and it\u2019s one of my favorite easy meals to make :)",
