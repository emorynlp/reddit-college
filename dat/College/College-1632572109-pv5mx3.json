  "text": "I\u2019m in my junior year, and I will be graduating in May 2023, but I\u2019m lost. I suffer from social anxiety, and it was worse during my freshman and sophomore year (Pre-covid), so I didn\u2019t have a college experience as I was always in my room. \n\nI also changed majors last fall, so I\u2019m pretty confused. I\u2019ve never volunteered, nor worked, and I don\u2019t know where to start. I tried joining clubs at my school, but I never attended the meetings( I\u2019m trying to now). \n\nAnytime I look at volunteer opportunities, I doubt myself, and the anxiety appears, so I end up not doing it. I want to change because I want to go to grad school. Although my GPA is good, I don\u2019t have anything to put on my resume, and I feel I don\u2019t have the skills to work. I\u2019m also pretty lonely.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a junior too and some things I\u2019ve done was that in classes there might be a review session so I would go to them and I actually started talking to someone from there when walking back to our dorms. Also in things like recitation you can try discussing questions with other people in a mini-group. For volunteering, just remember that nobody expects you to be perfect and as long as you\u2019re trying you\u2019ll be fine! I got to talk to a lot of different kinds of people that are always pretty friendly. In terms of putting stuff on applications, just keep an eye out for opportunities that might interest you (like flyers). I can\u2019t really talk about having anxiety, but I hope these ideas might help.",
