I got the worst time slot for a final which is Saturday at 8 AM, my Professor even apologized to the entire class for it. I\u2019m fried from studying, I don\u2019t have any way to watch sports, I\u2019m starving and all the dining halls are closed, and last but not least it may snow where I am tomorrow which would mean I\u2019m stuck here until fucking SUNDAY. If anyone wants to talk feel free to message me, I\u2019m a little bored over here \ud83d\ude05",

I think the main reason is because exams are online they start them all at 1pm so its still an okay time for people in other time zones. Because they can do less exams now, they put them on Saturdays as well. I\u2019m getting my train home on Monday",
