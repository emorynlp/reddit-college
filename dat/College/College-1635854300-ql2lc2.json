  "text": "Hi, I'm a freshmen as BSIT (information tech) student and these days I feel like I lost too much interest 'bout in this course..I didn't know why I chose this when I rlly actually like the fine arts course. \n\nI need someone's anything advice for a student like me who's thinking either to shift a course in the middle of midterm or drop my school and take a rest for 1yr and explore everything I can. Please I'm having mental break down these days and I do not know what to do:((",

      "text": "Take a deep breath. Another. One more. \n\nOkay, here\u2019s your plan: \n\n1) Finish the current semester\u2019s courses with good grades. Do whatever it takes to do that, including seeing a tutor, forming a study group, watching YT videos, going to the prof\u2019s or TA\u2019s office hours every day, anything \u201clegal\u201d. \n\n2) Do some research on other possible majors, and compare to yours. What courses would you have to take? Would it make you need an extra year? Could your current courses fit in as electives? What sorts of careers are possible with that major? Would you need a graduate degree? What\u2019s the start salary? Investigate a few different fields, not just one, so you have choices. \n\n3) Look for free confidential counseling at your school (Google \u201cYOUR SCHOOL counseling services\u201d) and get on the waitlist, or look for stress management support groups. If you don\u2019t want to talk to someone else, try a mindful meditation app, such as Calm or Headspace. Or if you have too much nervous energy, start working out \u2014 the school gym probably has some free classes, or you can start running. These sorts of resources can help you deal with the stress and burnout. \n\nHow does this sound to you?",
