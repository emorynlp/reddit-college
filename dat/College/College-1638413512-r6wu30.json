  "text": "So my sleep schedule has been wack bc of me being a dumbass and staying up late until 5 am and my depression which has been creeping up again. It\u2019s finals next week and I really need to study. I want a quiet study space in my dorm where I can actually get motivated and do work but I don\u2019t want to disrupt my roommate who is sleeping. What do I do",

      "text": "there's probably libraries or study rooms that are open 24/7. i usually go there so i don't have the lights on when my roommate's sleeping and it helps me focus more. \n\nthey're usually jam packed around finals time though. my schools lets us reserve one in advance so i'd look into that too.",
