  "title:": "Is it possible to start (and maintain) a relationship in college?",
  "text": "To start, I (19F) never dated anyone, I want to, but I've always felt like it would be too much work (or too much of a risk that someone could hurt me) so I've always turned down guys who ask me out. But now that I'm in college, I want to try, but other than dating apps (which I've tried and failed to use) idk how to meet people romantically. Like, I go to class, study, attend clubs, work out, and go back to my dorm. Ik how to find hookups if I want to, but that's not all I want. However, in all the places I go (classes, work, etc.), I stay professional and keep to myself. How do I meet people to date in college?",

Say if you have a difficult major and they don't, they might want to hang out a lot and it'll distract you from your studies. I'm studying electrical engineering which provides little to no free time and my ex wasn't even in college, just worked at a bakery. I would come home from work and want to do homework or study but she would want to have sex, snuggle and watch TV all the time. It was very hard for me to focus and I lost a couple years of college from it. I'd imagine something like that could work out if you both were doing similarly difficult majors since you'll both need that time to study and do homework.",

For me, it was completely on accident and at a bad time (I was moving away, across the country from him). But we really had a connection, so we tried to make it work. And it did! \nI will say, part of what helped us connect so much was my willingness to take a chance and be vulnerable. If I had said \u201cno thanks, I\u2019m moving away, it\u2019s not worth it to me,\u201d then I would have missed out on a wonderful man. This isn\u2019t to say I was the only one opening up, he was taking risks too. He flew 6 hrs to come see me in a state he\u2019d never been to before just 6 months into our relationship. I could\u2019ve left him at the airport, or argued with him the entire time, or a whole host of things. But I didn\u2019t, because I was committed to him. \nDeep, meaningful relationships don\u2019t just appear because we want them to. They appear because we actively dig ourselves into them. Both people have to be willing to dig just as much. At 19, there\u2019s not a lot of people out there looking to do that just yet. You\u2019ll meet a lot of people who just want a casual relationship. And that\u2019s okay. But if you find someone who\u2019s willing to be open and vulnerable with you like that, then you also have to be prepared to be open and vulnerable. It\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s amazing when it\u2019s reciprocated. I hope you find that!",

Some were classmates, but I also know 2 couples that met on tinder and have lasted for a long time. Most of my relationships were people I met at bars or parties, or friends of my classmates - things from Tinder or Bumble usually didn\u2019t make it past date 2 for me, so I hear you about your struggles with dating apps.",

If I were you, I would just be friendly and start talking to guys in your classes, study groups and clubs and see who you would maybe like to date. You don't have to be stiffly professional, just friendly. This may sound counterintuitive, but if someone asks you out, you should probably say yes if you aren't getting really creepy vibes from them. It takes a lot of guts to ask someone out, and if you ask me, that merits a first date (which is not a commitment to a relationship, so the guy can't hurt you). You can always say no to the second date, but at least say that you tried it out.",

Ik it\u2019s odd for women to make the first move in a hetero dynamic but starting to talk to someone could help a lot. Being a little flirty might give the message that you\u2019re looking to date. But be careful, men often willfully misread and take it as something else. Make sure you have a friend who won\u2019t get absolutely wasted so if it goes south, you have someone to leave safely with and can workshop the night for better luck next time. Good luck!",

In college, since I major in biochemistry and have so much hw, I literally have zero social life and I never thought that I will even date. However, I happened to meet someone through a common friend and to be honest I never would have expected him to like me. We really did click and dated two weeks after knowing each other and it has been a wonderful period of time for me. So all I wanted to say to you is that, just open up your heart and be yourself, you shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to have to date someone right away. If the person is meant to be with you, they\u2019ll appear when the time is right.",

      "text": "I think college is a great place to start as you have the highest amount of variety and people in general in which you share something in common. Additionally, I personally view dating as a number's game so the more people you meet the higher odds of finding someone you like and in turn a higher chance of finding potential partners. I go in with low expectations that way anytime something good happens it is more than expected and I am happy with any results. Lastly, I think anyone who is single and looking should commit to a very low degree because trying to force relationships has a low chance of working out. Just know you have plenty of time and that you get what you put up with. Know your worth and find a partner who treats you how you want to be treated.\n\nWith all of this advice in mind, I'm 22 as a Senior at Auburn and have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year. \n\nGood luck to you!",

A big benefit was us both being the same discipline, so she will be working in the same area I go to grad school in. \n\nI was in a similar boat to you, as I had not dated anyone prior to college, but started looking to try my freshman year. I personally met my girlfriend through Tinder, but from talking to my female friends, it seems it can be a much different experience for women.\n\nIt might help to be a bit more casual while on campus instead of always professional. I'm not sure your discipline, but at our Computer Science department we had big meeting/study room. If you have something similar, it wouldn't hurt to start doing homework there, and striking up conversations with the people inside. It would allow you to get familiar with not only people in your major, but also you might meet someone you like. \n\nIf you want a more \"active\" style of dating, I found it fun to just go the campus coffee shop and chat with people in line. I would either make a joking comment about the line or being a freshman and not knowing anybody. This usually led to some nice conversations and dates afterwards. \n\nHope this helps, feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer to the best of my knowledge. Good luck!",
