  "text": "*sorry if the grammar is off I'm doing voice to text because I'm lazy. I talked pretty clear so I think most of it will make sense*\n\nAnyways, needless to say I had quite the college experience. Initially I went to a CC for general studies, this was not a school I wanted to go to but I was pressured to go by my parents. LEven though this was a CC I did not live at home, they had dorms and I lived on campus. I attended two years but did not graduate, I was short a math and PE class. I did overall well,  my last semester I didn't really care because I was miserable/depressed  so my GPA went down a lot but i was pretty solid on my science and english courses. \n\nI then transferred to my dream school to study engineering. Without doxing myself I'll just say this is a very good school, it is known for its success after graduation, professors, courses etc. Overall I had a good time here and succeeded academically  but during my 3rd semester there I  started dating a guy and my grades totally flopped and I had an idea I was just going to be with him and not care about school so I totally didnt do any finals and winded up being kicked out of the school for poor academic performance.\n\nI took a year of of school doing absolutely nothing but discovered my local CC had a program with something that very much peaked my interest. So I enrolled! I am now on my second semester and I am thriving. My GPA is 3.8, I'm involved in extracurricular activities and I'm happy. Now with this major I would need to transfer again but I'm scared that this will just look really bad to my future school.\n\nI want to transfer to either Parsons, Pratt, Road Island Institute of Design or FIT. All are very good schools in terms of what I want to study and I really don't want to mess this up.",

      "text": "It depends on a lot of things. The school/program you are transferring to and from will play a big part. How long has it been since you got kicked? It might not matter much.\n\nI have transferred a total four times, and it didn't make any difference in my case. It was more of a pain to get a bunch of transcripts sent, but once that was done it wasn't any different than if they had all come from one school before transfer as opposed to multiple.\n\nI would reach out to an admissions rep or advisor at a couple places you would like to go and just talk to them about it.",
