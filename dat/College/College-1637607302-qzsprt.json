  "text": "I attend a small 4 yr college and my first semester is almost over. I\u2019ve found it to be a bit of a disappointment. I haven\u2019t met many people and it\u2019s been pretty boring. I want to transfer to a bigger school next semester (spring 2022) I\u2019m excited to go to parties and meet new people but I\u2019m worried that me being older than everyone will be weird. maybe I\u2019m just worrying abt nothing",
