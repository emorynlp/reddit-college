While a C isn't awful, in my experience most C students don't really understand what they're doing beyond the basics. Sometimes \"the basics\" is good enough for a person's goals. Sometimes it isn't. If your major is something like engineering and you only understand calculus and physics on the most superficial level, you're probably going to struggle a lot later on, which is why they may want you to get a B+ average or higher.\n\n>  How is this even possible?\n\nSome students come in with stronger backgrounds than others. Some students have more time than others. Some students have more focus and/or more work ethic than others. Some have better time management skills than others. And some have more natural aptitude than others. If you hit the lottery on those things, then you can get straight A's with ease. If you don't have any of those, you'll fail out pretty early. Most people are somewhere in between, and those people get B's and C's. If you're doing worse than that, you should work on figuring out why, and address the root cause of the problem. My experience is that in many STEM majors, lack of math skills is the root of most problems that students face academically, so perhaps you're one of those people and need to go back and work on your math skills. But there are many other possible causes of low grades, too. It's something you'll have to explore.",
