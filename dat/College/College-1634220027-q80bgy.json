  "text": "Hi! I am seeking some advice regarding my education and degrees. I am currently a first year student in college, majoring in Chemistry, minoring in Environmental Studies.   Not completely sure what I want to do with my BS degree yet. I have been wanting to double minor in Geology as well, but have done the research, and it would be impossible to graduate in 4 years with both minors and the major. I am wondering what my next steps should be after college. Could i pursue a masters in Geology? a PhD? I considered double majoring but it would be too late as I am already about to enter the second semester of my first year. I cannot double minor because my Chemistry major is so course heavy, I can barely complete my EVST minor, I am at the max credit hours.",
