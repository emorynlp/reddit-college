      "text": "In the NZ university system you can skip the first year of college and go straight into second year courses. This usually happens by default in New Zealand. In my experience though any skipping courses usually makes things harder later on.\n\nIt was differcult for students in there first year to grasp complex organic chemistry and write up lab reports. Something that overseas would be done in second year. In this instance you can skip the course but it doesn't mean you should. \n\nThree year degrees are a thing but you have to be prepared to work damn hard to get them.",

I only need two levels of biology (I'm a biochem major) and then I'll get into physics, orgo, and biochem courses",
