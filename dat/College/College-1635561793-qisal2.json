  "text": "I am currently majoring in CS & minoring in stats and on track to graduate in 4 years. If I chose to double major in stats, I would need an additional 5 classes which would take me about 2 additional quarters. Would you say this is worth it or would sticking to a minor be sufficient?",

      "text": ">  or would sticking to a minor be sufficient?\n\nDepends on your career goals. Most careers that actually require you to use more than basic statistics require at least a master's in statistics, anyway, so probably the stats major won't help you that much. Still, if you want a data analyst job, the double major will help you be better at it. That being said, if you want a data analyst job, a CS major and stats minor is probably good enough to be able to land a job, tbh. \n\nFor any run of the mill programming jobs, the stats stuff doesn't matter.\n\nSo... chances are the double major isn't worth it.\n\nIf you have a scholarship or something that would make it free or cheap, though, I'd say go for it because free money is free money.",
