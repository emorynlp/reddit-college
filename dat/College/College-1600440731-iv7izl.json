      "text": "Some of it is because people are looking at us 100% of the time, potentially, which is not how a classroom works. AND they aren\u2019t looking directly at you, they are not looking directly into the camera so it looks like you\u2019re talking to someone who\u2019s not making eye contact which can be uncomfortable. It\u2019s usually something that signals extreme social anxiety so our brains are registering this.\n\nSo, realize people aren\u2019t looking directly at you most of the time. Don\u2019t feel bad if you can\u2019t have your facial expression in constant rapt attention. That\u2019s too much to ask. If you get called on, don\u2019t be afraid to say, okay hang on. Let me think about that for a second.",

      "text": "Yuppppp. My single zoom class I have is an absolute nightmare. Our prof doesn\u2019t \u201cteach\u201d whatsoever lol. Instead makes us get in groups and present the material ourselves lolol. \n\nI mean, I took him before and it was an easy A. He\u2019s nice and all. But damn part of me is like why in the fuck is that allowed?! I am paying almost $3k to take this class - an advanced professional level course mind you. For graduate students who are studying project management- yet the \u201cteacher\u201d doesn\u2019t do one single instance of teaching anything whatsoever lol. \n\nI\u2019m cool with the easy A. Just kinda disappointing based on the cost, the purpose of college and specifically grad school, plus how can you consider yourself and educator- let alone a professor who also holds a Doctorate mind you- when in reality you do not teach one single thing lmao. \n\nAdditionally, he assigns two papers and one research paper for this class. The other course I took, over a completely different subject debatably, had the same requirements. Upon studying our list of approved sources I realized they\u2019re literally the exact same damn ones from the other class. So in a way, it\u2019s a win. I already have them written. Got 100 on them. So yeah fine by me. But still, that was like a 3000 level junior-level course and this is meant for postgrads pursuing their master\u2019s degree and whatnot. \n\nSo like yeah easy A is fine. Less work is cool. Presenting is easy and also easy A\u2019s. But I can\u2019t help it that there is a part of me that is bothered by the fact I pay that much money to teach myself and my classmates and vice versa, the assignments for our research papers are the exact same as from a class intended for undergraduate juniors, and the professor does absolutely nothing besides sit there and listen 99% of the time, barely speaks English as well, and if he does in fact have any sort of comment it is almost only to refer to himself in third person and remind everyone he had his Doctorate degree. lol \n\nSo yeah perhaps I\u2019m just picky and a bit of a student most others hate- I just kinda feel cheated considering how expensive it is and I\u2019m getting a professional degree and whatnot. An easy A is cool and all but I think for me personally, especially at the postgrad level of masters and above- there should at the very least be a distinct difference from a class meant for students two or three years under us. Plus, I might be a little overbearing but still my goal in doing this is to actually learn and prosper professionally. Getting an easy, automatic A is great don\u2019t get me wrong and eases my stresses by a ton. But still at the same time it does not necessarily provide me with any sort of professional skills or knowledge I am seeking by pursuing my masters degree. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just crazy. Shit, I\u2019d be absolutely fine with it if he would actually just teach. Or if they lower the cost to sub $1k lol. Wouldn\u2019t bitch at all then. Yet as it stands currently in the setup of the course and the requirements, it\u2019s simply the same exact course I took two damn years ago to get my bachelors sans the final research paper which is over a different topic and the material in the textbook we present is different. \n\nOther than that, literally it\u2019s the exact same shit. I turned in a paper I wrote in thst other class. Once I noticed the list was the same, because I knew I made 100 on it before. Got myself 100 again lol. \n\nLove having good grades but I\u2019d also like to actually learn and benefit from the courses I\u2019m paying good money for in order to become a business leader one day and more qualified in many areas. \n\nJust doesn\u2019t seem right to me. \n\nPlus, requiring the class to present is super annoying and always has some sort of technical issues due to zoom. Never fails. It\u2019s literally doing more harm than good in my opinion lol I\u2019d rather just fuckin teach myself the class, then take my exams and write my papers - all of which have been written in the past- and get my A and move on. That would be possible to do in a maximum of 2 weeks working at a slow pace. One week if you simply engaged yourself and got the work done. \n\nI just believe it truly is a fantastic representation of the flaws within our education system - specifically due to the expense and the increased need for a postgraduate degree. Kinda pointless to me to pay nearly $20-50k if the professors do not teach, use the exact same material from undergrad courses, require the students to teach the material, and simply just sits there and speaks only to remind us he has a doctorate degree. That, to me, does nothing whatsoever to increase one\u2019s professional aptitude or knowledge and simply is a waste of time, money, and resources entirely. It defeats the entire purpose of getting an advanced degree and also proves that it\u2019s simply a piece of paper at the end of the day which for whatever reason makes those who can afford to get it or wind up having their company pay for it seem more knowledgeable or qualified for advanced or high level positions when the truth is they simply just paid a ton of money, learned arguably nothing that will actually make them a better leader or more qualified to do said jobs, or ensure they are of a higher intelligence level compared to those with simply a Bachelors degree, or even some with no degree at all and a ton of experience.  \n\nIf nothing else, it shows that our education system and the ways some companies require their workers to possess such degrees is beyond flawed and arguably pointless. Because this course is not the only one I have encountered like that during my studies. It\u2019s quite sad and honestly it makes me mad honestly. Because I could learn more valuable information that would actually be applicable and beneficial to myself and my company if given the chance to mentor someone with multiple years of experience. Then, at least one would actually get to see how things should be done, how to do them, and ultimately learn more useful and relevant info compared to what some of these courses present. \n\nIt\u2019s laughable really. A waste of money for us students as well. I personally am thankful more companies are beginning to realize this as well and are shifting to more experienced based promotion and training verses what a piece of paper says about your abilities lol. Frankly, there are students in a number of my masters classes who cannot even properly put a presentation together nor communicate the information in a manner consistent with high level course work. Some simply struggle to speak whatsoever. It baffles me how someone that is incapable of basic communication skills managed to obtain a Bachelor\u2019s degree to begin with - but also will be able to get a masters degree and as such a leadership based or higher level position as a result. If one cannot even properly speak or communicate, then how in the hell are they going to effectively lead a team or be capable of performing their day to day duties the job may require. I myself cannot think of many jobs, especially on a professional or advanced level where communication is not vital and something used every single day while at work. \n\nSorry y\u2019all. Rant over. I just feel as if it helps demonstrate that just because one may look impressive on a piece of paper - it doesn\u2019t not necessarily guarantee they\u2019ll possess the qualities, abilities, or knowledge to succeed in a job; in fact, in some instances there would be some people with no degree whatsoever who would out perform them in nearly every way if compared. \n\nI just do not believe that should be allowed to happen. I think that we should re-evaluate how we go about hiring people into those types of jobs and consider experience and abilities just as important as a piece of paper they managed to pay a lot to receive yet can\u2019t speak correctly. \n\nJust is frustrating to me personally I apologize. \n\nHad to get it off my chest lol",

      "text": "I hate *giving* Zoom lectures. One of my classes voted for a fully synchronous one. I really, really hate not being able to play off peoples' reactions and the energy in the room. If the energy is slow and dull, I pep it up. If it's excited or eager, I find ways to carry it. \n\nThe little funny moments during classes are what I live for, and nothing is more rewarding than making my students laugh with dry sarcasm and stupid jokes. I really, really dislike not being able to do that. Looking at people's disembodied heads on my computer just doesn't cut the mustard.",

Even with my glasses, I still sometimes end lectures with headaches, but that's just because I have four 3-hour lectures that are taught in ASL and the incredible amount of concentration required for me to see, translate, and understand the material in real-time puts a great strain on my brain and eyes.\n\nIs it possible you also need glasses (if you don't already have them)? Is the ambient light in the place you're watching the lectures in too low or too high? Are you drinking enough water? Finally, have you considered having some other things to do while you're in-lecture (taking notes, playing with a little fidget toy, etc.) that will help keep your mind occupied and clear that mental fog?  \nIt can be super frustrating to deal with this stuff, so I feel for you. I really hope you can find something to help you out!",
