  "text": "So even though I started college almost a month ago, I still need to work on procrastination as it became a habit since I suffered from seniorities badly, and turned almost all my work in late for my senior year of high school. Now it has become a bad habit to the point where I'm 3 chapters behind on the textbook that I have to read for my psychology class, 2 essays due for my English class, and 3 worksheets due for my algebra/precalculus class. The thing is I just can't bring myself to do the work and I need help in doing so since procrastination has become a really bad habit that I suffer from now due to my last year of high school.",
