  "title:": "I've lived in dorms since 2017 and had 9 different sets of flatmates. Heres some tips for ya",
  "text": "So yeah as the title says I've lived with a tonne of people since moving into halls, I've lived with some truly awesome people who I consider close to family and on the flip side purely psychotic people who affected the health of everyone in the flat. \nI know a lot of freshers are nervous about moving into halls for the first time so I'm here to impart some wisdom, some of it may sound harsh but from experience it helps in the long run. \n\nSet your boundaries early on, don't wait until after freshers week to tell them what you are and aren't ok with, they'll just take the piss. Be as strict as you need to with them, only after they've proven themselves should you ease up on them, its better to be told 'hey I thought you were a bitch but you're actually ok' rather than 'why you such an arsehole, you used to be fun'\n\nWhile first impressions are good you won't get to know what you flatmates are truly like until they're stressed and under pressure. So try not to get too attached early on, they could change into very different people over a few weeks.\n\nIf drama doesn't directly involve you, do not get involved and that includes asking what is going on cos that can be used as ammunition as you know what going on so they'll want your opinion. It's fair easier and better for your mental health to be on the sidelines.\n\nStuff in the communal areas WILL get messed with and sometimes broken, if its valuable to you don't leave it where others can get to it.\n\nIf pans get scratched or glasses broken or something else of yours gets broken, dont hesitate to demand it be replaced.\n\nGet to know your RA or the caretakers or people at reception, if you get to know them they'll be more willing to bend the rules. Just don't take the piss\n\nGet a support network set up as soon as possible, personal tutors, guidance tutors, academic mentors, whatever you need, it's far easier setting it up in the beginning so it's there when you need it rather than trying to find out who to talk to when your swamped with work or really down mentally \n\nDon't be intimidated by the hard man, they more often than not all bark not bite and tend to show off to their posse. Dont be threatened.\n\nSome freshers tend to go off the rails, it's the first time away from home without mum and dad to tell them what to do, if they're being shit, tell them and call them out, you're all living in that flat together and you gotta cooperate and sometimes a few people need to be knocked down a few pegs.\n\nIf you're not ok with something, speak up and stand your ground and don't let it be dismissed, it's your house too and you deserve to feel comfortable and be respected.\n\nIf someone ends up being an arse, feel free to give them a second chance but if they take it for granted feel free to just ignore them. You're under no obligation to interact with them, sometimes a sudden change of attitude from you will get them to realise they've effed up. If nothing changes oh well.\n\nWatch out for local pets wandering around, especially cats, they tend to jump in windows and get stuck or people start feeding them and they hang around, if you can contact the owners to see if they're aware or lost pet pages if you can't. Sometimes they don't come home for a long time cos the students have ham.\n\nIf you don't feel safe in your flat or you don't feel like you're meshing very well, there is no shame in switching flats. Chances are if you're not meshing well or if your flatmates are arseholes they aren't really gonna care. Look after yourself and your health and safety.\n\nTry and find your people, some of the best friendships I've had are from a single common interest or thing about ourselves and we could be completely different otherwise but join clubs, go to student union meets, post on the uni facebook group, do everything you can to find your clique, it'll make settling in a lot smoother.\n\nGet to know the local area especially shops, you may feel inclined to go to chain stores you're familiar with, e.g.  aldi, morrisons, whsmith, hobbycraft. But often theres local shops and food markets that sell much better quality and far lower prices and if it's a student town often with decent discounts. Save the high street and all so shop locally!!!\n\n\nI may update this as I go but knowing me I'll probably forget, but if you have any specific question just lemme know and I'll do may best to answer",

And I *was* the RA.\n\nAlso, with a cleaning schedule, always include a list of things that need to be cleaned because some people will only do the bare minimum (like only doing the toilet/shower, forgetting the sink/mirrors, kitchen table, sweeping/vacuuming the floor, etc)",

I left a bin of my stuff, marked with my name, in one of the cabinets, and for a long time there were no problems, but eventually somebody took one of my forks and used it. I know it was mine because I got these cheap antique forks with intricate Queen Anne designs on the handles, and it was a perfect match. I also found the bin itself tampered with of course. Anyway, they used it to eat their bowl of macaroni and cheese, and then left the dirty bowl with the dirty fork in it on the counter. They just left it there. After more than a week I gave up waiting and cleaned rotten cheese sauce off the fork myself. I left the dirty bowl. I never found out who did it, but I transferred universities that summer anyway so it doesn't matter now.",

      "text": "It's been decades since graduating but I have two kids not far away from college and I will impart the same knowledge to them when they go. All of this is excellent advice from both points of view. Here are a few more...\n\nAVOID political discussions (especially if views are different) until you've gotten to know the person. It's been interesting to see friends from college come out politically 18+ years later with views completely opposite of what I thought.\n\nHang around common areas. If I hadn't done this my first summer (got a head start) season would have been miserable. I also got an invitation to rush just from hanging out and talking to front desk/RAs. It was a complete coincidence but one of those encouraging rush was talking to one of them and in the process we discovered we had lived only a couple of miles apart.\n\nI guess it's not a concern now but be careful with your stuff when \"visitors\" you don't know are hanging out. I had almost 20 CDs stolen after my pledge brother/roommate left the door unlocked during a party. Knowing the types of people your suite/roommates like to hang around is one of the most important things you'll learn to do.\n\nI spent a year in a 3 person room, a year in a suite (in a private room), a year at the house, and finally 2 years in an apartment with my future wife. All were completely different experiences. Of my suitemates one was my best man and another stood up in my wedding. Great guys.\n\nLittle things add up so stand your ground and negotiate if you need to. I wish I had been given this advice before moving in. The biggest everyday thing we argued about was heating/cooling. It eventually worked itself out but at first we split on purpose temperature. It escalated with swinging between st at 60 and set at 80. (It was eventually settled by meeting at 70 after almost a month of micro aggressions.)\n\nAs the OP said, be assertive and don't be a pushover. Do your best to see things from both sides. DO NOT be unreasonable. Diplomacy will take you a long way when navigating your college experience.",

People have very different ideas of \"clean.\" You don't want to get into a \"tragedy of the commons\" situation because that will happen. Decide how to split the cost of communal items like toilet paper and cleaning supplies.\n\n*Good house rule to have: Everyone has to ask before taking food out of the shared spaces, unless it has explicitly been stated the food is to be shared. I didn't know I had to have this rule, but people can be assholes and assume if it isn't labeled, it's fair game. That was a rough year.",

I was originally nice about it, but you give people an inch and they really do take a mile.\n\nMy bad roommates always said \"they would clean when it got dirty,\" but that ended up meaning never. I rarely cooked anything major in the kitchen, but they left a mountain of dishes in the sink to \"soak\" for so long that we got roaches. They had every excuse in the world not to clean. It was really ridiculous. I assume their parents always cleaned up after them at home before they went to college. I ended up cleaning everything at the end of the semester so that the school wouldn't penalize us.",
