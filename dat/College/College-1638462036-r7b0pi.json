  "title:": "Calling Out Because of Burnout",
  "text": "As most of you can attest to, the workload for these next couple of weeks is pretty intense. I\u2019m usually very motivated, but this past week, I\u2019ve been suffering from burnout. To be honest, this week has felt more like a finals week than my actual finals week (I hope that makes sense). This has caused me to not complete assignments in the time frame I would like to. Technically, I\u2019m not behind, but I feel like it. I\u2019m scheduled to work this entire weekend, and I am considering calling out from work, which I feel guilty about. I was wondering if any of you could relate to this and if you think \u201ccatching up\u201d on school work would be a valid excuse for calling in.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve been attending college for two years. Many are experiencing burnout hard this quarter/semester/trimester. I also usually expect this before holidays, because naturally many are attending family gatherings and spending more than they usually want. I have struggled a lot this quarter.",

      "text": "I quit my job last Friday because they refused to cut down my hours. I told them from the beginning that I only want to work 20 hours a week at most but they always try to schedule me more. These three weeks they had me scheduled 38 hours per week, including finals week. They refused to fix it so I quit. Thankfully I\u2019m well off enough that I can afford to not work for a couple months.",

      "text": "ask. Say it\u2019s finals week and you need more time. This is 100% reasonable, getting better grades is more important than working one weekend. But some employers are insensitive, if they say no you can decide whether to say you just won\u2019t show up",
