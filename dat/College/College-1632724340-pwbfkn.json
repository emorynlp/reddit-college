  "text": "I am struggling so hard in my classes right now. Over the past few years I've really struggled with being able to focus on anything for long periods of time. I can't do anything for longer than an hour without feeling anxious or restless. It takes my double the time that it used to to finish assignments. I have mental health issues and had to miss a lecture to meet with a counselor at the student center. I also missed another class due to a mix-up in my schedule and I've had such a hard time catching up. \n\nI have to maintain at least a 3.0 to keep my scholarship, but I just don't think I can stay in the school anymore. I feel like such a failure. I used to be so much better at focusing in high school and now I can barely do half of my assignments. I have 2 quizzes and a test this week and I was so overwhelmed catching up on work that I just gave up. I don't want to go to my classes tomorrow or show up for ng tests because I know I'm going to fail. It also doesn't help that I don't have any friends here and I have to go to a bunch of social events that I don't want to go to and put on a fake bubbly personality to find friends.",

      "text": "You're working so hard, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.  You may want to try talking to your school's Accessibility office about accommodations for your classes- you may be eligible for a range of supports that could help you. They may also have guidance on strategies and resources to help you with focus and advocating for yourself with your professors.  \n\nYou could also talk to your advisor about being part time (be sure to check on your scholarship terms if you go that way). Try not go stop out entirely.  It's harder to go back if you do. But give yourself permission to change the plan so you can feel more like yourself, and get some wins, and learn some things you want to know.  You don't have to get through college on your own- nobody does.  \n\nSource: former advisor,  now head of student services",
