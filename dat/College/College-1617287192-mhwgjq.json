There is always something to do:\n\nStudy for a test\nStudy for a quiz\nRead 2 chapters and complete a 26 question review at the end\nStart working on that assignment that is due in 2 weeks\n\nI also work, although it's PT it still takes up all my energy cuz im pretty much dead at the end of the day. My sleep is NEVER enough, I could get 8 hrs but I still look and feel like I got 4 in the morning. Oh, and I'd I want to wake up at 7 to get started on studying? Nope, more like 11. The beauty is that at the end of this semester I'll be done with everything I need to get into my program. That means I'll get the rest of the year off to finally feel like a person again at least until next year. \n\nI have to tell myself \"you're almost done\" everyday because if I don't, I'll quit. I used to be in peak physical shape, now I look like a fat slob because there is no time to train, much less to meal prep. Maybe there is time, but motivation and energy is lacking. What's worse is I've taken 5 classes many times and it's never bugged me as much as this semester has. I'm only taking 4 classes and I feel worse than I've felt ever. I literally feel dumb and stupid everyday because I say the wrong things, and I do the wrong things, minor mistakes here and there but damn I feel so incompetent on a daily basis. I KNOW my brain is tired because the other day I had to switch the tip on a pipettor 3 times because I either kept sucking up air with the sample or I kept discharging the tip into the sample. \n\nThey say take time to help yourself but damn, how the fuck are we supposed to do that when there are a million things to do everyday?

If you think your time management is seriously getting out of hand though, then you should probably consider having a lighter course load (quitting honours for instance). \n\nMake sure to take care of yourself as well: reorganize your sleeping schedule and cut down your coffee consumption. Also, remember that you can take your time to finish college. If you find it hard to handle a moderate or heavy course load, adjust your schedule to your own needs. Keep believing in yourself :)",

Not out of college at least. And this is coming from someone in honors. Don't deride someone else for leaving if it doesn't work for them.",
