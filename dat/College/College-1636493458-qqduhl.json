  "text": "I go to school in California, and my car is registered to Utah. In Utah, it is legal to drive w/o a front license plate, and in California it is legal to drive with however many plates are legal for the state it was registered in. I used to drive with only 1 plate, but recently I put my front one on the Dashboard -which is also legal. Still, everyday my school tickets me $100 for blocked plates, even though it is legal to drive like that in California. I appealed them, and my school said since it is private property they still have the authority to ticket me for that -even though it is 100% legal. Do they have the authority to do this? Does private property mean you can create and enforce your own laws? While disregarding the state laws? Please let me know I am trying to battle this.",

      "text": "Do you go to a state school? If so \u201creal\u201d tickets can be issued by the campus police because they are considered state troopers. \nAlso, as for the front plate on your dashboard. California state law states that all license plates must be securely fastened to the vehicle. In theory a police officer could argue that a license plate put onto the dashboard is not securely fastened and issue a ticket for it.",
