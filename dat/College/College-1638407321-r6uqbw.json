  "text": "My college offers a joint program in which I can dual major Physics and Mechanical Engineering at the cost of it being a 5-year program, 45 credit hours of which will be at a different college. I was told when I transfer to said different university, i will still be considered a student at my college therefore all my scholarships and grants get transfered over as well as needing to only pay 69% of the other college's tuition.\n\nI'm decently passionate about engineering but idk how much stress dual majoring will be as well as I kind of want to graduate with my friends. My other option would be to go into Secondary Education for Physics as there seems to be a demand for physics teachers in my state. All of my friends also tell me that I would be a good teacher. Having summers off also sounds nice. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",
