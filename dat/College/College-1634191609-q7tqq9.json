  "text": "So I (20F) do know that sleep is super important and I should prioritize it because it helps your memory and everything, but honestly I really need to be able to stay up tonight and get work done. I haven\u2019t been procrastinating (I promise I just hopped on here to write this and ask for advice), I\u2019m just in a difficult major with a busy work schedule and everything seemed to land on the same day. So how can I stay up to study/do homework/learn more? I have already tried drinking coffee through the night before and I still fall asleep, and I want to stay awake. Any help would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Be careful with caffeine and energy drinks, take but in moderation. Personal story: years ago when I was in exam season I had to pull all nighters. I went to study with a friend. I bought 2 big cans of red bull because I was really tired, I managed to study relativley okey but I felt like shit, it was like having hangover, horrible. I managed to do the exam although I was really nauseous but when I returned home I had to throw up. Really bad ecperience.\nSome tips:try to not study in your room or near a bed. Have a cool shower if you start feeling sleepy. Plan what you are going to do with your time, and! Plan when you are going to sleep. If you pull an all nighter, set a time the next day in wich you are going to go to sleep",
