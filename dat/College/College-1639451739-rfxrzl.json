  "text": "I have an A in one class for sure, thought I could get a A/A- in two others but it'll likely be a B+ in both (depends on how this essay goes in one class and in the other, whether or not the other class will get a 1% roundup). My next two classes the highest I could end up with are a B- and B, but I'll likely end up with a C+/C and C/D. \n\nGood news is I'm going to pass. Bad news is I'll be just under a 3.0 (cutoff is 2.0, but still) even though I out a lot of effort into this semester. I just seem to struggle with the tests no matter how much I understand because of how they're formatted. \n\nI'm upset at myself. I shouldn't be but I am. I had a 3.3 first semester, dropped to just under a 3 last semester and the same here. Maybe I'm applying too much pressure on myself. Doesn't help that I'm the only one in the house who goes to college.",

          "text": "Oh I know, but I'm focused on grad school. No guarantee I decide to go to it, but I'm keeping my options open in case something arises. \n\nHoping it'll be easier next semester when I begin taking three classes directly related to my major. I also learned how to notetake with textbooks so that's a major help. I've learned a lot this semester.\n\nI just don't want to let anyone down. I don't think my parents would be happy with less than a 3.0 (although not mad either). Maybe this pressure is all in my head.",
