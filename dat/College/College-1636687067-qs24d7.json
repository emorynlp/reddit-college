  "text": "Bad Semester of Classes\n\nI don\u2019t want to write a novel so I\u2019ll try and keep this short. \n\nI\u2019ve done pretty well since I began my undergrad as a Biomedical Sciences Major. (I swapped majors very late which put me behind by a good bit). I\u2019m in my first semester as a 5th year (and I have 2 more semesters left). I currently have a 3.7 GPA. \n\nBut this semester has been my worst by far. When it concludes I will have 4 A\u2019s and 2 C\u2019s. My 2 C\u2019s are in Physics I and O Chem II lecture classes. \n\nMy question is how damaging will this be to my competitiveness and ability to get into med school? How worried should I be?",
