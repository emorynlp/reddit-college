  "text": "This is my first year of college and i took a rather difficult and heavy work loaded course (chemical labratory technician), so heavy that its super overwhelming. I have 3 hard classes with their tests always syncing up in the same week plus having 2 lab reports every week. \n\nI have very little motivation but i need to study cause i have no idea whats happening in chemistry (my teacher is hard to understand) and my test is this friday. \n\nAny advice on how to study/motivate myself to want to study and stay studying.",

      "text": "Are you taking advantage of any tutoring services your school provides? Are you visiting your professor's office hours?\n\nI would also recommend that you find a place outside your dorm/home to study. Find a coffee shop or maybe the school's dining hall to study. Grab a drink/snack and get to it.",
