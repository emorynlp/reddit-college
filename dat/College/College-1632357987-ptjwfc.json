  "text": "Lately I am struggling hard to go to class, I haven\u2019t been to it for 2 weeks and very behind, still not going. I am too lazy and don\u2019t have motivation, the funny thing is I am in my senior year too. I feel like I cheated all my classes though. I don\u2019t pay tuition so it is not a factor. When you feel like this,how do you overcome it? Sorry for the dumb question lol",
