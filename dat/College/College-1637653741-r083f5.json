      "text": "The job outlook is good. If CS is too hard try a business major. It\u2019s easier, with a great job outlook (unless you major in MIS, management information systems). I would say that is the worst business degree because, in MIS, you only learn the fundamentals of computer science. You would be competing against people who have full blown CS degrees when you enter the job market. MIS is basically a business degree with a little bit of computer science. One of my brother friends got that degree and it took him 2 years to find a job. It\u2019s kinda a jack of all trades, master of none degree. IMO.",
