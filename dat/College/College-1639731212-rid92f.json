  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman living in the dorms and it\u2019s finals week so not a lot of people are still here, but I had to stay until Friday for my physics final. Anyways, I guess these people across the hall thought because it\u2019s pretty empty they could play music really loud all night. I tried to ignore it but after like an hour it was 3:30 and needed to fall asleep for my final in the morning. \n\nTheir music was very loud and they were playing the most god awful frat songs. Anyways, I went over to knock on their door and there was a guy coming back from the bathroom in the hallway so I just asked him if they could turn it down a little. I really wasn\u2019t rude or condescending and I don\u2019t understand why they would be mad. He nodded his head and went in and by the time I got back to my room the music was off. \n\nA few seconds later, I hear one of them in the hallway screaming \u201cwho the fuck came out here\u201d \u201cfucking bitch\u201d \u201ccome out here pussy\u201d. Obviously I wasn\u2019t going to go fight multiple drunk guys so I just ignored them. He did this for probably like 5 minutes. I was honestly pretty shaken up because I did not expect this reaction at all and I\u2019ve never really gotten into a fight before so I was scared of what could\u2019ve happened. I\u2019m also worried about running into them in the future and them wanting revenge or something. Only one of them knows what I look like but still I don\u2019t want to get beat up over something so stupid. \n\nThankfully I\u2019m going home tomorrow but still I\u2019ll be back next semester. What would you advise me to do in this situation. Should I just do nothing? Should I tell the RA. I really don\u2019t want them finding out who I am or what room I live in. It\u2019s honestly really surprising to me that people would act this way over me just asking them to turn down their really loud music. It\u2019s not like I called the police or reported them. It was pretty hard for me to even ask them as I don\u2019t like confrontation with strangers but now it\u2019s become 1000 times worse.",

      "text": "Good job standing up for yourself a d not getting drawn back in. Call the RA or police next time, and don't let it go on for an hour that late. It's their job to take the heat so you Don't feel threatened.\n\nThere are dorm finals quiet hours for your benefit. Don't be afraid to have them enforced.\n\nThese guys will have forgotten about their drunken/stoned rampage when they get back. If they ask you, look at them blankly and say you don't know what they are talking about. Don't let them get a rise out of you. Bullies want us to react.",

      "text": "Yeah. Next time, call campus PD and the RA. You can confront them directly as well.\n\nIf you don't mind getting your ass kicked a little, let them beat you for a bit and have them arrested. They'll get kicked out of university, have a felony assault record and the clearing house will red flag them so they'll have a hell of a time getting accepted to any other university.\n\nSometimes, it's a good idea to make sure others understand that actions have consequences and getting your ass kicked by the \"bros\" across the hall is a small price to pay for making sure that bullies go to jail.",
