  "text": "Long story short: my roommate got arrested for 64 grams of weed, 2 knifes and a bullet + his friend who didn\u2019t even go to my school got arrested for 7 stolen cellphones, weapons charge, and a warrant for stealing. Do you think he will get expelled? Or at least won\u2019t be able to live in my dorm anymore. Forget to mention we live in Georgia if that matters. And according to cops that arrested him it was a felony amount of weed",

      "text": "Short answer: yes, most likely\n\nTake it from me, I have been expelled for a drug arrest and it wasn't even at a dorm (it was apartments off campus). I probably had that much weed and more plus about 91 hits of LSD. The acid is what really got me. But the entire experience of getting expelled is really sucky because they make you go through this bullshit process to make sure you've had a chance to \"defend yourself.\" It's not like you get a letter and you're automatically expelled like in some TV shows and movies. He asked me a series of questions and he was recording the entire thing. It's rough deciding if you should answer or not because the courts do have the option of subpoenaing the tapes. I didn't answer most of them because I didn't see the point. They don't take anything else into consideration and just want to beat the courts to see if you are guilty or not. At the end he said we can either have an \"informal decision\" where he expels me or we take some sort of \"college court\" where a faculty member, a student, and someone else from the college judge if I am guilty or not. I didn't see any point in wasting time so I just chose to get expelled. \n\nHowever tell your roommate that there is hope. I was hit with some strong charges (first degree felony among them) but today I am on probation. Don't listen to all these idiots saying he's going to prison. He will most likely get probation since it's a first offense. \n\nFinally, other schools will accept you even after an expulsion. I'm going to SHSU right now on my last semester. Never give up!",

That is enough to possibly get him on intent to distribute (if your university has a policy like that, mine did). Also, marijuana is against university policy if the university receives federal funds. Between the marijuana and the large knives (which sound longer than allowed on the usual campus), your friends would be extremely lucky if he was allowed to stay on campus. Also if this isn't his first issue with university housing then he is more likely than not going to get kicked out.\n\nIf he was arrested outside of the hall and on university land he might have a better chance of staying on campus. It all depends on how police reports are shared between campus departments. Make sure that if the university reaches out to you for a statement/meeting that you attend so that your roommate doesn't put any of the blame or possession on you.",

Basically, a grumpy neighbor reported us suspecting drug activity because we had high traffic through our house (5 college kids in 1 house, different lives ad schedules, etc.). That put us on the radar. Then one day a \"buddy\" of ours got pulled over with weed and instead of taking the possession charge decided to take a snitch deal (we had no idea of any of this at the time). With no one to snitch on, one day he asked my roommate if he could toss him a few bucks for a bowl to smoke later and my roommate was just like \"yeah man whatever\" and gave him like .3 for a few bucks. The dude had a wire on him and that's how they got a warrant. The whole situation was bullshit.",
