  "title:": "HELP! My boyfriend copied my lab reports. What should I do?",
  "text": "We\u2019re in the same class and lab partners so I shared my past two lab reports with him thinking he was doing his own and asked for help. Tonight I discovered that he copied them both and only changed about twelve words between the two. I am absolutely livid and have no idea what to do. I threatened to email the teacher if he didn\u2019t as soon as he woke up in the morning but he said he would just email to say that he used mine as a reference although they are exactly alike. I\u2019m afraid I could get in trouble for something he has done without my permission or me knowing. I have screenshots of our messages showing I was just trying to help him out and thought he was doing his assignments by himself. I don\u2019t want to ruin our relationship or friendship over this but I can\u2019t risk losing my scholarship over a mistake that he made. How should I go about reporting him or should I just try to get him to report himself?",

I talked my boyfriend and he also emailed the professor confirming he was inebriated and had taken his new medication that makes him sleepy and confused (this is the truth because he was acting weird at the time). I am still beyond angry at him but now he understands the error of his actions. He also stated that I had no idea that he was going to copy my work and just sent it to let him proofread. As for our relationship it really depends on how the situation turns out and how he acts. I am worried about how much he will get in trouble but I\u2019m hoping that since he admitted to his wrongdoing without knowing I sent the message the professor and that he was inebriated may help him from getting in too much trouble. Overall I\u2019m just upset that I could get in so much trouble for something he has done without my knowledge or consent.",

Getting a call from school because he didn\u2019t pick up your kids.\n\nTheir choices and behavior can very much impact your life.  Real love is about character.   You are going to make a choice  , with this one or someone else, that your life , your bank account, your job, health and kids are going to be dependent on this person.",

I wanted to reach out regarding my lab submitted on mm/dd. \n\nI allowed my partner to view my report as reference when putting together their own because they asked for help with the assignment. I realize that this was a mistake because I now have reason to believe that they submitted a nearly identical paper. \n\nI am concerned because I worked really hard on my lab and wish to earn a grade reflective of the quality of work I submitted. I am reaching out directly to apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. I am hoping we can meet this week to discuss what happened further and ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my email. Please let me know your availability. \n\nHope to hear back from you soon, \nxxxxyyyyzzzz",

Best case scenario Professor doesn\u2019t notice. Next best case scenario is they notice but boyfriend realizes no matter what he\u2019s screwed so he fesses up to protect you. Neither happens if you try and force him to fess up or try and break things off because of this.",

If the professor seems to be the type of individual who can understand your situation, he/she may just punish you with a penalty in assignment grade.\n\nAs for the boyfriend, his punishment for this action could range from grade penalty to expulsion. I would say dump him since he should have understood the consequence that his action would have caused you.  If he takes his punishment like a man, talk things about and see. If he doesn't, just dump him.",

If it doesn't get through, you have to go to your professor.",

Your boyfriend will definitely breakup with u after this. And I don\u2019t know if the professor will blame you for allowing your bf to copy your work.\n\nMaybe you two can apologise to the professors together and ask him to extend the deadline so your boyfriend can redo the assignments? I think you share some of the responsibility. If I were the professors I would be glad to see my students know their mistakes and trying to make that up.",
