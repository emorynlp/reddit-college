  "title:": "Burnout and lack of motivation",
  "text": "I'm in my Final year of college, and I've already secured a full time job offer for when I graduate this spring. I've always been an above average student, but ever since I got the offer, my academic motivation has been much lower. I realized that as long as I passed my classes, there's no difference in getting an A- or a C-. \n\nI'm not sure whether I'm just feeling lazy or uninterested in the final classes I'm taking, but I'm simply not as motivated as I was in my first couple years of college. I have projects due this week that I'm barely finished, and finals in the next couple weeks I haven't even reviewed for. \n\nI'm beginning to worry whether this lack of motivation is because of end-of-semester burnout, or if it's more my lack of organization this semester (or both). I don't dread the classes I'm taking, it's just I wish I could fast forward to graduation and begin my career already.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? If so, how do you push through?",
