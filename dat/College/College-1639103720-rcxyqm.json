If these are your strengths and they come naturally, it will still be a lot of work tbh. intro to stats is super super easy. If it\u2019s only 2 labs then it\u2019s much more manageable but if it\u2019s 3, I\u2019d try to take one lab in the summer if possible. (im a biochem/stats double major). If you find yourself with more free time than you want, fill it with clinical/volunteer experience. I\u2019m not so worried about the classes without labs it\u2019s just that ones with labs end up adding a lot of extra work and time.",

Physics 1 i got an A. the inorganic is just lecture at my school, no lab and is only a 200-level course (for context\u2014only pre req is Gen Chem 2), so i\u2019m thinking there is less involved in comparison to higher level at other schools which they said involves group theory (ours says it\u2019s just an introduction to like periodicity, valence bond theory, etc.) They say Diff Eq is similar in difficulty to calc 2, which I got an A in. For context, all courses are 200-level besides Physics which is 100-level. My school does courses from 000 to 400 level. also just tutoring job that is low commitment, so that doesn\u2019t have to be a major concern for spring semester. Have some clinical experiences already and a good amount of hours but there is always the summer too to get up in those more. also, am a part of service clubs on campus that help with make a wish and raising money for cancer patients. in addition, also am in clubs that spend time working with underserved youth.",

If you found yourself busting your ass for the grade then just stick with 4 because your GPA matters for grad school",

Some of the professors may be lenient, some strict. It may be better to take four courses if you can figure out if they\u2019re all very difficult plus one fun class. I did that a few semesters and the fun class was always something art or music and it was very relaxing.",
