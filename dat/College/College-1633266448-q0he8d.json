  "text": "I spent my entire life loving music and aspiring to be a music teacher so that ai could share that love with other. After my first year in a music department, I changed my major searching for happiness outside of myself. There is nothing that I regret more and that I feel like changed the course of my life in a negative way more. I desperately want to go back but I don\u2019t want to graduate any later than i already am",

      "text": "I have a degree in music education. Never changed my major but graduated and worked for a while and realized I didn't like it as much as I though I did. So I quit my music teaching job and went to grad school to study a STEM field. Zero regrets.\n\nHonestly, I think it was good I \"got it out of my system\" because if I switched majors early on I'd probably always be wondering \"what if.\" But now that I know, I feel comfortable with the choices I eventually made.\n\nIt's hard to know what you \"really\" want unless you try it. What's important to realize is that if you find you graduate with your current degree and aren't happy, you can always go back and study to become a music teacher. Your undergrad major absolutely does not determine the path you'll take for the rest of your life.",
