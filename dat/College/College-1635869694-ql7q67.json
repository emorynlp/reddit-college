      "text": "You can always look at a local goodwill or thrift store for appliances and furniture. As long as you clean them well before you use them, it should be fine. \n\nMaking a registry/event and not hosting an actual house warming party but still asking for stuff is weird and probably not going to be well received. I mean a lot of us are in college, not getting help from parents, taking out massive loans, and generally struggling financially. But if you think your friends and family wouldn't care or wouldn't find that event odd, go for it? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nJust to add, normally when college students have a house warming party or get together, people usually bring food or drinks because your peers are also in the same boat (generally).",
