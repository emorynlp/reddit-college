  "text": "Hello there! I'm in no shape or form giving the impression that obesity is healthy. It isn't! Anyways, recently I've been struggling with my courses considering I take bio, chem and psych and my physical health seems to be getting in the way of my education. I suffer from repetitive brain fog, poor impulsive behaviour and lazyness from the pressure on my joints etc. I'm starting to change my lifestyle but I know it will be a long journey before that I need to persevere through college despite my current situation. \nAre there any other obese/ overweight students who go through the same things and if so any advice that you could share?",

      "text": "I would recommend you look into the book Intuitive Eating by Evelyn Tribole. You seem to have quite negative self talk about yourself, which does not help with weight loss in the long run. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re at but this was truly a life changing book for me in regards to weight. \nBut being that you just need to push through right now, I would say to email your professors. Don\u2019t take offense but you don\u2019t know how your professors feel about overweight people, they could be completely judgemental, so I would suggest you just tell them you are having certain health issues and would appreciate some leeway.",
