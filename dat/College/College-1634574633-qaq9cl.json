  "text": "Firstly a bit of background info: I live in a small country where university admission only depends on national exam scores. Students make a list of programs they'd like to enroll in, and they get into a program based on their exam performance. \n\nI graduated from high school in May 2020. I'd known for a while that I wanted to study chemistry. When making my list of programs, I found out that one of the top universities in my country was offering a chemistry program in English. I thought this would be beneficial to me in the future to get further education and to work abroad. Therefore, I put it at the top of my list, and got in with a full scholarship.  \n\nOnly 2 other students got into this program. Chemistry isn't very popular here I guess. It was really weird to have only 2 classmates, but we got along and it was fine for a while. Then, last semester, one of my classmates dropped out. Now there's only 2 of us left. Today, my remaining classmate texted me that she's also thinking about changing her major, because chemistry is making her miserable. Hearing this gave a bit of a panic attack (lol), but obviously, I can't force her to stay. I talked to my advisor, who said he doesn't know what the administration will decide.\n\nI'm at a loss. They could close the program, in which case I will have to transfer and continue studying in my native language. This is a problem, because the curricula are wildly different and I could be looking at an extra year of study (which will cost money that I don't have). If they don't close the program, I will be the only one in most of my classes. I don't know if I could handle such a thing.\n\nI could also transfer abroad, but unless I get a scholarship (which is unlikely), I don't have the money.\n\nI don't even know what I'm looking for here, I just wanted to share this with someone. If you have any advice, I would really appreciate it.",
