  "text": "I'm currently at community college and I am studying Business, but I am going to change it to Biology. *However, I also thought about getting a certificate in Medical Assistance at another community college while I go to my current community college at the same time.* I ultimately want to become a Physician Assistant or a Speech Therapist, but the thing is, Graduate Schools **require** patient care experience. Becoming a Medical Assistant is one of the ways to gain this experience.  Is this possible? I'm thinking about attending the certificate full-time while going part-time for my Associate's. Any advice is appreciated! :)",
