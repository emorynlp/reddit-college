  "title:": "How can I form better relationships with my professors?",
  "text": "Hi all\n\nI'm having trouble with getting to know my professors.  There is an internship I want to apply for but I need two letters of recommendation by Jan 2022 to do so.\n\nI always sit in the front of the class where the professor can see me.  I have no problem asking questions during class but thus far I've been making really good grades, especially in my major classes, so I usually don't have any questions.\n\nFor homework and other out of class assignments, I find it much easier to Google what I'm confused about rather than scheduling an appointment for office hours; an appointment can be a few days out depending how the profs schedule or how many students also scheduled office hours.  Then once I get to office hours, I'm not guaranteed the required amount of time needed to learn if the appointment only lasts so long.  Google is always there anytime I need and I can spend the 5 minutes or 2 hours required to grasp a concept.\n\nLike I said, I have really good grades (so far, knock on wood) and don't run into many problems. Sometimes I feel like pretending to not know something just so I can go to office hours but obviously that isn't a good idea at all lol.  Waste of both my and the profs time.\n\nAny suggestions?",

I like to email my professors with updates and questions and that\u2019s how I have been able to build a relationship with them when I\u2019m not seeing them in person. Besides that going into their office hours in person or zoom.",

On the test the correct answer was C and she said C.  On the next question, it was B and she said B.  I don't know anything about her personality, but she can regurgitate information really well. 10/10 recommend.\"",

To me, it's like working on the bottom rung of the ladder at a company, and then asking not your boss but your boss's boss for a reference.  Like what are they supposed to say? \"I haven't worked with them personally but my subordinate says they're a good worker and I trust that\"? I'm sorry if I'm being stubborn but I'd like any letter of recommendation for myself to have both truth and substance, ya know?\n\nTo make my analogy more clear, it's like the prof saying \"I've never worked with them personally but my gradebook says they're good\"",

Also sounds like there's a lot of competition for the professor's attention in your class. Your professor might be too busy addressing students' needs to establish a personal relationship. They still should be willing to write a letter of rec on your performance in class alone. If they are busy it would be better to ask well ahead of time.",
