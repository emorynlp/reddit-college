  "text": "Hello! I'm working on a project to help people buy a skateboard for the first time, and I'm hoping to learn about the struggles they might face. I wanted to get some insights from college students, since a lot of y'all might buy a skateboard to use for campus. I'd appreciate it if you could fill out this survey to help me gather some insights- it should only take around 3-5 minutes and will be anonymous. Thank you :)\n\n link: [https://forms.gle/b8PThqypKYygnioa6](https://forms.gle/b8PThqypKYygnioa6)",
