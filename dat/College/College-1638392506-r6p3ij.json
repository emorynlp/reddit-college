  "text": "Okay so I took a week break for thanksgiving and flew home. I just came home yesterday and I can't stop crying today because I miss my family so much. (And I'm flying home next Thursday for Winter break LOL)\n\nI feel so devasted because I haven't seen my parents in two months and I'm heartbroken after leaving them again after a week. I don't know how I'm going to react after the three weeks of winter break.\n\nTT\\_TT\n\nI want to transfer to another college closer to home but let's be honest, I can't because my parents wouldn't allow it and that seems like a lot of work TBH.\n\nOkay that's it. I just wanted to be sad.",

      "text": "I feel the same way, I\u2019m 2 hour drive from home and I only got a 4 day weekend for thanksgiving and as soon as I got back to school, I just started sobbing. Thinking about how I need a break, miss my partner and my cats, never get to do anything I actually like. I decided to start making foods that I would eat at home and I feel a little better. I also keep a blanket from home close by and facetime my partner regularly and sometimes he will just sit the phone in front of a cat and I\u2019ll keep it on in the background while I do hw. Just try to incorporate some familiar things and it should help. And of course, this gets better with time, just try not to dwell on it too much because chances are a few months from now you won\u2019t think about it as much.",
