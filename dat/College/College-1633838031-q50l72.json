  "title:": "How normal is it to hate your roommate after a few weeks?",
  "text": "I actually met my roommate before we chose to room together which I now consider a mistake (should have gone with someone random) and my issue with her is basically that she says some really passive aggressive shit sometimes but whenever I get annoyed about it she'll talk about it like it's my fault for getting annoyed and \"not everything someone says has meaning.\" She says this so much--if it doesn't have meaning, why did you say it in the first place?? Anyway today she was a hypocrite and tried to tell me I'd said something in the past that I've never said, so I suggested she misheard, and she said she was annoyed/offended that I said she could have misheard?? So I'm not allowed to get annoyed at the fact that she basically accused me of lying when I didn't but she can get annoyed about my suggesting she misheard? What is this bullshit.\n\nSo anyway, I was wondering if it's normal for roommates to have so much friction when it comes to basic conversation.",

      "text": "Are the passive aggressive comments related to you being roommates? I'm surprised you guys are having trouble getting along when you met prior to agreeing to share the room. I think it is pretty normal to be unable to get along with someone. Is the conflict related to sharing the room, or are you guys just generally unable to get along anymore even outside of the room?",

          "text": "No, they're not related to us being roommates but more the consequence of us being in the room together and her talking a lot, which means some of it ends up being crap that really gets to me. We didn't talk a whole lot before becoming roommates, but she asked if I wanted to be her roommate and I thought it would be better than a random one. She even said before that if she says something that offends me I can just let her know, which was a lie, because that's exactly what I did and she tried to make it sound like it was all my fault. I really don't understand how it's all my fault for being annoyed when she never takes into consideration anything I say about communicating in a way that isn't passive aggressive and still talks to me so much. (I don't start conversation with her much, mostly just saying one or two sentences here or there).",

If she doesn't seem to understand that she is speaking to you in a passive aggressive way and keeps doing it, then I'd just kindly tell her to stop talking to you so much or try wearing headphones to avoid conversation. Hopefully you can both come to an understanding eventually and not feel like you have a stressful relationship.",

      "text": "Honestly it's quite normal. I did the opposite of you and just got a random roommate, and he's... Not great. He loves talking about his problems, whether it's classes, mental health junk, his job, etc., but never would even let me talk about anything, or if I do he'll just give me a passive aggressive response like \"just don't be stupid\" or \"well I'd never get into something like that\". \n\nThere's a ton of things I dislike about him as of now;\n1) He's sick atm and doesn't cover his mouth when he coughs, and gets all up in my face whenever he can. He also doesn't clean anything ever (despite cleaning when he's \"stressed\").\n2) He steals my food. Straight up, when he doesn't have any, he'll just take mine without asking and tries to be discrete about it; though I can obviously tell. \n3) My friends are his friends. When I started going out to meet people he insisted on coming along. Fine, whatever, but now my main and only group of friends have him in it, and they all like him more than me. That's fine, but I just don't enjoy the dynamic if that group anymore. \n4) He clips his nails all the fucking time and never cleans up the scraps. Literally will just clip and drop it all on the floor leaving it for me to vacuum. \n5) He relies on me for everything, whether it's finding where classes are, understanding certain things online, talking to people, being a therapist, and even shopping. He'll give me money to go buy him stuff, which is just a pain in the ass. \n6) He lives in the dorm. Obviously, so do I. But he LIVES here, as in he never leaves. He'll only go out if it's for work, or if I'm going out with \"friends\", he insists on coming along. While I could go out to try and find places to study or just distance myself, this is sorta our \"safe space\", or it's supposed to be. With us both here all the time, it just gets to be irritating. \n\nI could go on, but TL;DR, you're absolutely not alone, and it's totally fair to just despise your roommate. It is what it is sadly, and sometimes you just gotta deal with it.",

          "text": "Thanks for the comment; I do worry a bit that next year when I go for something more random maybe I'll get even more unlucky. I feel bad about talking to people around us about my roommate because then I'm basically talking behind her back, but I really needed to vent and low-key yell about how I hate her. Part of what gets to me is that the way she talks to me always sounds like it's 100% my fault even though she's always the one starting the conversation that gets us into a conflict.\n\nYour situation definitely sounds worse though, sorry to hear about it.",

              "text": "You're totally valid. Trust me, everyone gets into stages where the people they live with can just be insanely obnoxious, or you just need to yell about it, so I get it. As hard as it may be, I'd truly just try to ignore her in any way possible, whether it's distancing yourself or just flat out acting like she's not even there. When her actions become a disturbance, bring them up to her. If she still decides to be petty about it, reach out to an RA or housing manager and have a discussion with them about it. That would be my advice at least. \ud83d\ude0b",

      "text": "Totally normal. It happened to me too in my sophmore year. In my case my roommate originally reached out to me on room sync and I explicitly said I have a boyfriend and like to have friends over sometimes and work late. This was precovid  back in 18' mind you. She said she was the same. Fast forward and she actually doesn't like it when my bf visited for the day because culturally unmarried men and women weren't allowed to hang out. She would glare at my lgbtq friends and made it clear they weren't welcomed. \n\nAnd then she would wake up at 6am and fall asleep at 6. When I got out of classes I didn't even have a chance to be in the room (we shared a bedroom) I could only work in the living room. Basically everything she said she was cool with she wasn't cool with. I think she only reached out to me because I was asian and she was asian. But looking back, in my senior year I lived with other Asians, this roommate from my sophmore year wasn't a culture difference case, she was actually very passive aggressive and rude. \n\nSometimes it's not the randos that are the worst roommate stories sometimes its the pychos that seek you out because they seriously can't imagine giving up control to the universe or living with someone who is more assertive. So they seek out people they can try to push around.",

Sorry that happened to you.\nI honestly didn't like my roommate a lot when we first met but thought she was fine, so I'm regretting a bit that I didn't set the bar higher before accepting. She talks down to me whenever there's a conflict and says shit like, \"other people have feelings\" or something when she gets annoyed while being completely ignorant of the fact that she stomped all over my feelings and is basically telling me it doesn't matter.\nI think maybe one reason she asked to room with me is because she didn't want someone random and didn't have a lot of options yet because we're sophomores and the first year wasn't great for meeting people because of covid. But I was okay with random so I guess I shouldn't have let her take it away from me :/",
