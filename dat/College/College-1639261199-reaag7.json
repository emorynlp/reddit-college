  "text": "I am transfer student studying in the business department. I will be transferring as a Junior. I\u2019ve visited cal poly many times and have met a lot of cool people down there. I understand USC is a very prestigious school, I have not got the chance to visit though. Money isn\u2019t an issue I just need a clear cut reason of which one is better.",

      "text": "Both schools have a wonderful business school. I don\u2019t know USC\u2019s stat off the top of my head, but Cal Poly business majors make the 3rd highest starting salary out of business majors across all UCs and CSUs. Only behind Berkeley Haas and UCLA BizEcon.\n\nI\u2019m a Cal Poly SLO business student and I\u2019m heading into a $41/hr internship. I can expect around $100k when I graduate. The big4 recruiting presence is absolutely gigantic here and you can get some amazing opportunities from the business school.\n\nThat said, USC does have better exit ops. The name is known better in finance, IB, consulting, etc. Cal Poly has a better name in tech. If money is a factor, Cal Poly 100% because you\u2019ll literally pay like a quarter or what you will at USC. I\u2019d only pick USC if you\u2019re targeting IB or MBB. Cal Poly SLO is almost as good at everything else at a quarter of the price.\n\nAsk me anything about Cal Poly and our business program.",

              "text": "Of course, ask anything. I landed the internship myself. I\u2019m not a god but I\u2019d say I do a very good job of setting up resumes and I\u2019ve done quite a lot for an undergrad so I have an impressive work experience. Cal Poly as a brand name was my ticket in, I led myself in after Poly opened the door.\n\nThat being said, our career center is pretty helpful and almost all of the student peer career advisors are previous or incoming big4/FAANG interns. Cal Poly also has a pretty cool website called Cal Poly Career Connections, not sure if this is at other schools or not. This website allows you to connect to thousands of alumni for mentoring purposes, and it\u2019s super cool since you can look up alumni by company, major, etc. so it\u2019s cool since you can look for alumni who did the path you want and you can ask them questions.",

I got into schools just below Ivy League (USC level) but they wanted $40-60k a year in total, and I ended up going to a MUCH cheaper option (still a top engineering program, but not as prestigious of a school) and ended up saving money while also landing several job offers with Fortune 500 companies. So it\u2019s mostly just weighing how much the name on the degree means to the individual. To me, USC isn\u2019t good enough to justify an extra $10k+/yr, but MIT would",
