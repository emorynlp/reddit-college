  "text": "at the beginning of the year, my sleep was perfectly fine until maybe late october when i picked up a temporary job. it kinda messed with my sleeping schedule since it had graveyard shifts but that was only for a week. my sleep anxiety has been more intense ever since then. \n\nit\u2019s now november and i haven\u2019t been able to sleep consistently well in a month. it\u2019s usually that i have trouble falling asleep. the funny thing is, i notice that it\u2019s only in college where i can\u2019t sleep. i went home twice within that time span and on weekends/breaks, i slept perfectly fine at home. i also went on a family vacation over thanksgiving break and had no trouble at the hotel. it\u2019s so weird!!\n\ni feel like i\u2019m missing something. it\u2019s really interfering with my daily life since i\u2019m constantly tired and it\u2019s frustrating not being able to move around since i have roommates.  \n\ni\u2019ve tried seeing a therapist but she said sleep problems like this are out of her control and since i\u2019m out of my medical care area, its taking me awhile to speak to a physician. any tips would be appreciated. \n\n(also yes, i would say i\u2019ve improved my sleep habits as well. i now don\u2019t drink caffeine, \u201cgo to sleep\u201d before 1am, wake up around 8-9am, and try to go to the gym when i can)",

      "text": "My guess is that you have either trained your brain to be awake while you're in bed or you have terrible sleep hygiene.\n\nDo you do homework in bed? Do you use devices or your phone in bed? Do you hang out on your bed? Do you eat or drink in your bed? Stop it. Only use your bed for sleeping and sex.\n\nOtherwise, try a sleep mask to block light. Try earplugs for noise. Try to stretch or do yoga before bed to relax and get comfy. Avoid eating 4 hours within bedtime, and drink any/all caffeine in the morning (before 10am is best).\n\nIt may take 3-7 days to retrain your brain.",
