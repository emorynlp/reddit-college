  "title:": "Is it normal for a prof to make an announcement saying they will not allow a specific disability accommodation?",
  "text": "Professor was willing to give everyone a one time, 24 hour extension on any assignment as per the syllabus. Most of us saved that extension for finals week. It\u2019s one week until finals and now there\u2019s an announcement from the professor saying there will be no 24 hour extensions under any circumstances\u2014not even for disability. My schools disability policy is that professor and student have to discuss first\u2014and then go to disability services for a reasonable accommodation. Accommodation can be made only after disability approves. They mentioned they\u2019ve been behind on grading and most of the TA\u2019s are busy in their personal life right now. I just feel like 24 hours can make a huge difference for students but I\u2019m not really understanding why 24 hours is such a big deal for a prof and their TA\u2019s when they have almost 2 weeks to grade? This prof has been inconsistent with disability accommodations in the past too. Anyone else had a similar experience? Did you say anything?",

          "text": "It\u2019s a bit unreasonable though to tell people to not even try going to disability about it though. My schools accommodations on extensions are that it has to be reasonable\u2014usually with a 2 or 3 day extension. Sometimes it can\u2019t happen because of group work which would be impossible in some cases, which would be unreasonable.",
