      "text": "\n 1. Explain the situation ( multiple assignments in different classes; didn't realize how involved the assignment was)\n2. Take ownership ( I should have compared the syllabi / assignment dates and realized the time crunch , but I didn't realize until too late; I think I've learned my lesson and hope it doesn't have to be too painful) \n3. Clear request ( may I have two extra days ? I don't have to work on Saturday so I know I can get it done then) \n4. Concession ( i know this is a big ask and I totally understand if you say no, but I'd really like to do my best work in this class )\n\n\nof course this won't work if the instructor has been actively reminding people to start early on assignments , but worth a shot",
