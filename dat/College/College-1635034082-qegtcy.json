  "text": "My first few weeks of college were horrendous. I slept through the majority of my classes because I was so mentally exhausted. Because of this I have flags from my professors and am at the point of failure due to attendance. However, I\u2019ve just been diagnosed with ADHD and started medication. I feel brand new, but there\u2019s still the lingering anxiety from possibly failing those classes. Has anyone went about excusing absences through a psychiatrist/school counseling services? Because of my scholarship I cannot afford to drop anymore classes.",

A study buddy may help you stay focused.\n\nIf you do fail completely, then you may be able to request leniency via an official process with tour school. I can't remember what it's called. I wound up having to do that one semester (my eating disorder fucked me over grade wise) and ut was accepted, though I had to make sure I got my GPA up to the minimum required during the next semester (eg you get a 2.0 now, the scholarship requires a 3.0, so you'll be forced to get a 4.0 next semester)",
