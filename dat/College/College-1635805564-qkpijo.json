  "text": "So I go to an online community college. I have title 9 due to severe ADHD and am being tested for autism hence why I'm in online. Recently I have broken both of my legs and it has made it so hard to get to class. I can't do it on my phone due to technical issues and getting around, doctor's appointments, rehab, surgery, is getting in the way of school. I told my teacher I broke my legs but I don't think she gets how bad my situation really is. \n\nI've torn my ACL, torn or severely injured the cartalige and dislocated my knee and on the other foot they think I tore some ligaments and I've broken the foot. I can't work, I am struggling in school and I don't know how to approach my teacher or title 9 lady without feeling like a failure and a charity case. Like boo hoo me I broke my legs. Idk I'm just struggling in school a lot and am worried about how this year will end.",
