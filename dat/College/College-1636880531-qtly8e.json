  "title:": "Can I Take German While Going to Vet School?",
  "text": "Hello! So I\u2019m planning on taking German next term since I\u2019m currently taking my prerequisites for vet school. But when I go to vet school, and if I\u2019m still learning German, can I take it even though I\u2019m attending a veterinary school? The one I plan on going to has a vet school, but is overall a university with all kinds of programs and classes. I\u2019m in the US and specifically in Oregon state. Please let me know, I\u2019m still very new to all of this stuff.",
