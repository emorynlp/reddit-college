Then when I had about that much time left to work on it, it was finally game time. For larger assignments, I would just work through it nonstop for hours on end, sometimes over eight hours. \n\nFor *very* large assignments you are forced to plan a work schedule. For group assignments, you will meet progress checkpoints along the way. And for exams, study at least one day before the exam and review again the morning of the exam.",

      "text": "Try to give yourself breaks so you can concentrate as much as you can. Typically you should study in 60-90 minute intervals and then give yourself a break. If you're remote, take a dog for the walk, get a snack (my favorites are smoothies, oatmeal, rice bowls, and apples and peanut butter), go for a run. If you're on campus, there are other ways of taking breaks. What also works for me is putting time limits on myself to complete certain tasks. So I tell myself that I want to finish assignment X in one hour, then I'll be more productive in that hour so I can accomplish that goal. Also put your phone away! There are apps that can help with this (my favorite is called Bakery) and remind you to not use your phone during your studying. \n\nIf you're seriously struggling, then talk to your RA or your TA's. They would probably know good ways to manage your work.",

When i go to a coffee shop my brain switches into work mode as if to say i can go home if i finish. The further the coffee shop the more work gets done. Train your brain to associate different places with work and other with relaxation. It really helps.",

I did my fluids homework in 30 minutes flat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo really it just depends on your mood and the exact assignment.
