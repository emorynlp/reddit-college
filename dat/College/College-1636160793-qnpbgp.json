  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior at the University of Florida studying international studies. I\u2019ve had the same job at Starbucks for a while now and I\u2019d like to get a job that\u2019s somewhat related to my degree. If there\u2019s anyone who had a similar major to international studies and had a job while still in college that had some international aspect to it please feel free to give me some ideas. I know graduating with some experience in my field will be better than making a good cup of coffee.",

      "text": "International studies and similar fields are very competitive and there are not a lot of jobs.  Especially in a place like Florida, there are not a lot of opportunities like you would find in DC or New York.  You could look for internships but most of those will be competitive and probably unpaid.  The field itself is pretty broad too.  Are you interested in diplomacy? Security? Law?  You're best off trying to develop a range of skills, quantitative and qualitative, and find jobs closest to your interest that are available.  But finding a job in the field as a junior is tough.",

      "text": "Fsu poli sci Major here, not the most experienced as I haven\u2019t finished my degree yet but I\u2019m a junior as well.  To begin with our family of degrees don\u2019t really have many opportunities period let alone as an undergrad.  I for one have had to use tangental work opportunities instead of really working on what I\u2019m passionate about.  Closest thing I think you\u2019ll find here in Florida is interning with politicians or with the state/local government.  I haven\u2019t looked to much into it as I wasn\u2019t interested, but there are a lot of advocacy groups that hire virtually as well that could have an international component to it.\n\nAnother commentator recommended internships and I fully have to agree. That is the only way you\u2019re going to be able to find something.  They are super competitive (though in my experience they do all usually pay).\n\nOnly advice I can give you is that the jobs are out there, but you really need to be looking for them, and most of them (95%) are summer internships related to the IR field.",
