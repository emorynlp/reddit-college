  "text": "i\u2019m going to a cc so hopefully that helps, i\u2019m still choosing my major and it will most likely be polisci because i can\u2019t do stem. I really wish i could but my math base is so weak and i did so terrible in high school chem..i\u2019m in precalc right now and i\u2019m struggling. I just want to come out with a degree that gets me a decent paying job and i\u2019m stressing badly even though i know i still have time at 18.",

      "text": "This may be tangential but you absolutely have time to get your math in order! \n\nI HIGHLY recommend Khan Academy - totally free, basically endless practice problems and they do a great job of breaking down large concepts into bite-size skills. \n\nGo all the way back to the beginning (the beginning-beginning, I mean it) and just start charging through problems. You\u2019ll fly through material at first, and that\u2019s great, but the minute you\u2019re not clear on WHY something works, never mind the how, that\u2019s when you slow down and start watching the explanation videos. Pay particular attention to fractions, division/grouping, and all that middle school \u201cmath-as-language\u201d material (it\u2019ll be reinforced hard in Algebra II). \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard a lot of \u201cmath builds on itself\u201d and that\u2019s absolutely true, although not in as linear a fashion as people sometimes make it out to be. Filling in any skill gaps you have and shoring up the foundational overall will make whatever math class you have to take in the future much easier! \n\nYou can absolutely get a tutor to help diagnose weak spots and simultaneously fill in those gaps (shameless advertisement: this is literally my specialty and yes I am taking new clients) and help with current classwork, but it is definitely possibly to do self-guided learning successfully as well. Best of luck!",

      "text": "This post is a month old but I figure any bit helps. But as a junior polisci major I will say that you don't need a whole lot of math for this subject (Gen Ed requirements may vary from school to school though). The only math I've ever had to do was some basic statistics but even then, it's honestly not that hard compared to something like Algebra or Trig since the numbers you're working with are easier to relate to more tangible things/concepts instead of just being wholly theoretical.\n\nWith polisci you can always focus hard on the qualitative side of research where you don't deal with numbers so much. In fact, qualitative research is actually a lot more rewarding in my opinion since you're using your own head instead of a calculator to draw your conclusions. And if you're worried about money, don't. There is a way to earn a comfy living with every degree if you just play your cards right and take the opportunities you are given.",
