  "text": "For all of my fellow students out there that manage to keep their rooms clean and organized - I would greatly appreciate your input.\n\nI have my own room at college because I\u2019m an RA. Because of this, I can keep it as messy or as clean as I\u2019d like. It tends to get really messy and really unorganized very fast (dishes piled, clothes everywhere), and then I\u2019ll work up the motivation to do a deep clean several days later. I hate this cycle and envy my friends who keep their rooms clean at all times. I am trying to be a better person, and I feel I can stay more focused living in a clean environment. However, as I mentioned, I\u2019ll clean, and then everything looks like the aftermath of the Nagasaki bombing within a couple of days. Tips on staying organized and keeping things clean?",
