  "text": "Like, I feel guilt since maybe I should try and go and push through it since it\u2019s an important class, but like I have an appointment tomorrow with a doctor and if they say not to Id just be hiding it from my prof if I went. They\u2019re not going to like be checking on my health at the door, but obviously if I tell them I\u2019m sick that I should stay away. I can watch the recording for it later but still. Like, I\u2019m not doing well in the class, and I feel guilt and anxiety over not going, at the same time feeling sick and it being so close to break I just feel like going home. \n\nAny advice? I tend to over think these things and I don\u2019t know which way makes more sense\n\n\n(Edit) - I don\u2019t know if I have the flu, it could be something else, I just have a bad cough, congestion, headaches, all that fun stuff, and when I made the appointment they said it was likely what was spreading around campus\u2026",

If they believe you're ill, they'll tell you to focus on getting better and give any inperson specific resources. If they dont believe they, they'll probably still tell you to get better soon and provide resources for the class missed.",
