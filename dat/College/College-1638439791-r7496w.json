Most people consider cramming to simply mean studying a lot of information in a relatively short period of time before an assessment. It doesn\u2019t imply that you\u2019re only going over the information once, like that author talks about.",

Write down any equations you need, and try to work through the problems or at least get an understanding of the process (hopefully getting you partical credit). \n\nIf it's open note then spend your time making your notes easy to look through. For paper notes get post it's and flag important information. For online notes you're already able to ctrl f those, so work on adding anything that might be helpful. If you teacher has lecture slides then make a key of what lecture/slide important information is. Any extra time after that you just review review review. \n\nIf it's a closed book test that is fact/term based, like history, then try to see if someone has made flashcards on quizlet and study those. If it's not available then make it yourself and some some information should stick as you're doing it. \n\nAnd remember that tests are a numbers game. See what questions you know and answer those those as best as you can. Then bullshit where you can bc partial credit is better than no credit.",

Then wake up and go to a friend who has actually studied and ask him some concepts that he thinks might be more relevant for the exam. Study them for 1.5-1.75 hrs. Off to exam then. This has actually worked well for me multiple times in my engineering degree. You can adjust this study-sleep-study timings as per the syllabus or tiredness.\nPS: I know the exam is already over I'm just sharing this since this is also one of the many strategies that can help in these kind of situations.",
