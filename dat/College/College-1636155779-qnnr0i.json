  "text": "I\u2019m at a relatively small college, 3700 undergrad students total. I\u2019m currently finishing up my first semester of my second year and I\u2019ve not made any real friends. My roommate and I joke around a bit, but I that\u2019s really it.\n\nIt\u2019s really shocking to me because I had a TON of friends in high school, and even in my senior year I was constantly meeting new people and making new friends, but as soon as I got to college I just can\u2019t make any new friends. I know that my other friends are going out making huge friend circles and dating and doing activities, and I feel left behind and like I\u2019m missing out on the massive opportunity that is college. I did go to a few clubs but there aren\u2019t many options at a small college like this and when I went it felt like they were closed off with already established groups. \n\nI dunno, I need some advice",
