  "text": "I\u2019m at that point of my life where I\u2019m struggling making self-improvement. Still in college but I feel left behind by many. Ngl having this existential crisis at twentysomething blows up my well-being. To mention, it affects me not only in emotional state but also physical and mostly my mental well-being. It made me think if I have a disorder or it\u2019s just this ongoing pandemic that made me feel jaded at almost everything I used to be active with.",

      "text": "As for everyone, change is gonna happen wether you like it or not, but going through change doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. When coming across those situations where your thoughts just goes in to chaos mode it\u2019s important to find a way to ground yourself, and a good way to do that is to remember that what you are experiencing happens to millions of people. Thinking your the only one only contributes negatively as it actively reinforces that nothing can be done as the situation can\u2019t be fixed. \n\nFurthermore try to tackle it like this, when you all of the sudden get those thoughts which turn in to episodes that ruin your day, try to first and foremost step out of the situation that may cause it. As cognition is often an effect of the situation your body is in, if your stressed you start thinking more short-term and your ability to think objectively is reduced. After having done that try to write down or talk to someone you trust about the specific feeling you have and try to in as much detail as possible analyse them. Why did they come up, what effect do they have on you, what benefits do they bring to your everyday life. Often just sitting down and analysing this gives you time to break bad mental habits that can reduce the risk of you spiralling into a mental loop, which after a while becomes incredibly hard to break (as cognition affects the body, and the body affects the cognition). So getting a baseline understanding of the effects of certain thoughts makes it so that when those thoughts come up because of triggers in your environment, you have the tools to break them down and answer them and put them aside, ultimately avoiding a mental loop and thereby slowly avoid the risk of furthering a existential crisis. \n\nNote that not all thoughts are bad, and not all thoughts should be ignored. Ignoring them often leads to more stress further on as you\u2019ve put it on a pile that ultimately becomes too much to handle. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always a good idea to analyse every thought that you feel is weighing you down and try to get an objective understanding. Some thoughts may even after an objective analysis indicate that you need to do something out of this world, that for example it\u2019s reasonable to feel weighed down by rising crime levels, but then that objective analysis becomes even more important because it gives you the option to find the most effective solution to tackle problems that are completely reasonable thoughts to have but that seem impossible to fulfill. Because having this skill set gives you the option to find the ways in which you can make an impact and understand that you can do everything all on your own no matter what you do. Ultimately understand that it\u2019s better to start small and with a longevity, in a way which is healthy for yourself, than to go all out and crash after a few days. \n\n\nHopefully this helped out.\n\nWrote this at 12 pm with like 3hrs of sleep so excuse any grammatical errors lol :)",
