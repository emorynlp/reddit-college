  "title:": "How should I write this essay?",
  "text": " \n\nI am applying for a full-tuition scholarship and need to write an essay. My dad keeps telling me that the judges won't care about it if it is not personal. However, the prompt says to use evidence from an article. How should I write this essay? More personal? Or more like an AP essay?\n\nPrompt:\n\n* Consider the following questions: What are the benefits and/or drawbacks of using podcasts in addition to or in place of textbooks? What are the benefits and/or drawbacks of assigning podcasts instead of a more traditional written assignment, such as a research paper?\n* Compose a brief essay *(750 words maximum, single-spaced, 12 pt font)* that thoughtfully examines the issue above and uses evidence from the article to discuss the complexity of introducing podcasts into the college classroom.",

      "text": "That sounds like a private scholarship, often sponsored by what sounds like an attorney office or a marketing group. With my 5 siblings, when we entered stuff like that, it seemed to put us on more scam lists and my phone was flooded with telemarketers. The best way to get a good scholarship is to score higher on the SAT or ACT and apply to schools where your score is in the top 10%. If that means you go to community college first, that's fine! That will save a ton. You can also use modernstates.org to study for CLEP tests that transfer in as 3 hour classes and you pay nothing for it if you use the website. Take dual enrollment that's paid for by your state too. Or look at oral Roberts uni online dual enrollment, which is about $70 an hour credit. Doing these things makes a lot more dollars and sense than an essay that smells scammy.",
