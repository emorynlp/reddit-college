  "text": "Those who have experience with this, how do professors usually feel about students asking for LORs for transfer purposes? I have a (possibly unfounded) worry that profs will be upset that their student is leaving, and thus will stop putting as much effort into their student's education. \n\nAre professors generally supportive? Is this an unfounded anxiety? \n\nThanks :)",

Professors are professionals. They should be enthusiastic in helping you in whatever way you need. Anything else would be unprofessional. Honestly, as a college professor, it is part of their job to help you in such an endeavor.",

      "text": "Professors normally understand students, perhaps throwing in a bit of an explanation as to why you are transferring (unless you are at a community college, then they are more than happy you are transferring, you are one of only a handful of their successes!) could ease the process and your conscious. Professors were once students themselves, but were students for far longer than you will (most likely) be a student, so they know to expect transfers.",
