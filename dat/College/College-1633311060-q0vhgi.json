  "text": "I\u2019m trying to figure out what to study and was wondering if these two majors would pair well together? The school I\u2019m planning on transferring to also requires you to pick a Business Admin concentration in one of the following categories: accountancy, finance, management, information systems, marketing, human resources management, international business, and supply chain management.\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure what I want to do with these degrees, but I\u2019ve long had an interest in graphic design and business as a whole. I\u2019ve heard marketing is not a super practical minor though. Which of the concentrations/minors seems most practical? Thanks :)",
