      "text": "You should really consider getting a tutor, your college likely has something. And go to office hours. The first semester is always hard but if youre studying adequately and still doing poorly on tests, somethings wrong. Are you reviewing the relevant textbook chapters before its gone over in class? Sooo many people dont do that and I think its essential. Are you roughly studying 1.5 hours for every hour spent in class? Are you continuously reviewing older content?",

      "text": "Hey so if you understand the concepts is it just tests you\u2019re struggling on? Tests often stretch the concepts you learned previously, so u also have to know how to apply the same thinking in slightly different situations. \nOne thing that might be helpful is, See if you can get a copy of a previous year\u2019s test, or if not, there are practice tests/other resources online that work pretty gd as well. Sit down, set a timer and work. After the practice test, review how you did. If you struggle from the pressure and limited time of tests this can be good practice, and it\u2019s also super helpful for improving your ability to adapt and practice answering questions (that may not have been on any hw or practice problems but still stem from the same idea/concepts) on the fly",
