  "text": "I am 35 returning to school for a Pre-Biochemistry A.A. The last time I was in school was 4 years ago. I was doing fine, but I hit a major mental health roadblock and had to drop out because I couldn\u2019t balance work and school.\n\nThis time around, I *really* thought I had things under control, but partway through the semester my depression and anxiety started to return. Work started getting stressful and I found it hard to make time to study. I started sleeping less (I should be sleeping now) and the effects of sleep deprivation started to kick in. I began sleeping in and missing class, or was so tired that I couldn\u2019t focus on the material in lectures. I\u2019ve missed multiple assignments in my physics and organic chemistry classes. And I feel like I went into my physics class unprepared for the material.\n\nThis is my third time back in school. I have a 4.0 so far, but I have so many W\u2019s from past semesters. And there is a possibility that my grades will not be high enough to make it to the next classes required for my major.\n\nI\u2019m starting to get this impending sense of doom that all these hours I am putting in are just not going to be worth it in the end. I am glad that I haven\u2019t completely given up yet, but there is a part of me that is constantly telling myself that I am just not good enough or smart enough to accomplish my goals and that I should just throw in the towel for good.\n\nI need some resources to pull me out of this slump because I feel like I am going into self-destruct mode. \ud83d\ude23",

      "text": "I feel you 100% I\u2019m a 23 year old junior that transferred to a state school after completing community college. And I\u2019m starting to realize why the school I am now attending is considered harder than the other state schools in my area. Im in school because I get my tuition paid for my service in the national guard and that\u2019s it. I have no hopes and dreams in life sadly I\u2019m just goin through life trying to make it. From what is sounds like is that you do have dreams so I fully believe you can finish this semester out strong. The  bug that has entered your brain saying you might not able to do it you need to squash it out with another bug saying that you\u2019re a god and you can accomplish anything. Within reason I lie to myself daily to hype myself up and motivate myself and honestly it helps. If you can\u2019t continue with the future coursework so what? Do you like your job right now? What is it you want to accomplish in life? School certainly isn\u2019t the end all be all. Half of the people that I went to high school with graduated and still are working at entry level positions struggling to find jobs. Perhaps doing a online degree will help you with your busy schedule I\u2019m contemplating going online myself but I know not every school has that option for every major. Good luck man.",
