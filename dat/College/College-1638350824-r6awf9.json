      "text": "My boyfriend transferred from a big SEC school a community college and had to live in a dorm. It was separated, girls were across the entire campus and guys were in the other side. \n\nThey had super strict rules, so I would have to wait until he came home (class, football workouts, meetings) so that we could go to the bathroom together. I couldn\u2019t wait that long so I peed in his bathroom sink multiple times a day for like 3-4 days and made sure I bleached it so it wouldn\u2019t smell like anything \n\nHAHAHAHAH",
