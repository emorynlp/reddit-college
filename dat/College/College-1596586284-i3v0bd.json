  "text": "hey everyone! i dropped out of school completely towards the end of 8th grade, but after that i never really got a \u201cproper\u201d education. i won\u2019t get into details about my situation, but i\u2019m finally getting my life somewhat together. problem is: i don\u2019t know how the fuck college works.\n\ni got this GED prep book and i\u2019m actually doing amazing at it (except for math..), but i\u2019m starting to wonder if getting my GED before going to college is really a good route to go down. is there a way i can combine high school with college? like a dual-enrollment type situation? do you already have to be enrolled in high school to apply for dual enrollment? i am so confused about all of this!  i just want to get college done with fast, mostly because i\u2019m so academically behind my peers. \n\nany alternatives, explanations, advice, or anything at all would be greatly appreciated! even if it seems like basic knowledge, i could benefit from it. thank you! :)\n\nEDIT: thank you guys so much for all the advice and the support. :\u2019) not gonna lie i cried a little because i\u2019ve never gotten so much support about this and have always felt extremely isolated and inadequate about it. i\u2019m definitely gonna work *extra* hard at my GED studies now and try out all the awesome advice!\n\np.s. if it means anything, i live in florida!",

      "text": "So. Colleges will take your money. Many won't take you without a GED or earning your GED there if it's a community college that does that. Honestly, don't worry about college right now. If you ever want to succeed at it focus on the essential of the foundation you need for that. Find remedial courses for basic math and English. College gets hard fast. Plateauing in education is bad. \n\nCollege is really about skills. Studying is a skill. Writing is a skill. Reading is a skill. Speaking is a skill. Know what questions to ask and how to ask them is a skill. Knowing how to know what you do/don't know is a skill. Knowing how to organize your life and manage time is a skill. Knowing how to prioritize and strategically plan and stick to it is a skill. Being aware and realistic about where you're at is a skill. Smart people fail college because they fail to consistently execute multiple skills effectively. Average people can ace college if they're disciplined and practiced. Knowing how to tell people to fuck off when you're busy is a skill. Knowing how to be independent and undistracted is a skill. Anticipating the future is a skill. \n\nGet your GED. College is about setting goals and making them happen. Set your goal to ace the math on the GED. And the essay.\n\nPatrick JMT on YouTube. Math is a skill. My grandfather was a mathematician. He worked very hard at math. It's not you're inherently  good/not good at it. You either worked towards your ability or didn't. It's that simple. But not easy. College is like this. Smart people can be not good at shit and has to truck through. \n\nFocus on math and focus on basic writing. How to write a sentence. Use commas. Proper grammar. Specific and clear thesis. 3 body paragraphs with topic sentences that support thesis. Supporting details in paragraphs. Conclusion that summarizes and illustrates how the thesis followed from the discussion into something generally worth thinking about. Being able to do this spontaneously through organizing your thoughts and not having problems with grammar and punctuation. \n\nI've had college courses where you literally have a few days to read an entire book. It's your job to be able to know what's important and what is not. And remember it. And then walk into class and answer a previously unknown essay prompt  right then and there. You have to answer the question. Proper spelling, grammar, punctuation. Paper has to be neatly written without shit crossed out. \n\nMy point is don't put the cart before the horse. GED isn't college prep. But it's better than not getting it. It's a stepping stone.",

Once I had a two year degree people stopped asking questions about high-school and I transferred to a University. I recommend CLEP tests to save time and money, they helped me prove I could handle science and other college level classes.\n Edit to add: I recently found College For The People, a supposedly free online school. I haven't looked into it much, but it might be worth getting a GED and checking it out, it might be the cheaper way to go.",

For one, it would probably help you learn what you would've in high school a bit better than you would on your own, and two, I think it would probably help ease you back into being a student and learning how to study before jumping in as a full time student and/or higher level classes. After that, you'd be well prepared enough that I wouldn't see any reason not to take the test and get your GED, but as people have pointed out, there are CCs that'll let you enroll as a degree seeking student without one. \n\nOne other thing, if you do decide on something like this and do a semester as a part time, non-degree seeking student, afaik you won't be eligible for federal financial aid. As a rough estimate I'd say two courses at a CC would be about $2000 (you can Google tuition for schools in your area to get a better idea). I'd recommend reaching out to the financial aid department of the school(s) your looking at to see if they offer or know of any grants or scholarships you'd be eligible for. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I would recommend getting the GED first, even though some people are saying you don\u2019t need to in order to go to college. I didn\u2019t get my GED until I was 23, and didn\u2019t start college until 25. Life happens and sometimes you have to quit school for a while and work; sometimes you have to work while you go to school. Either way having a GED first allows you more employment options. I would also check into your financial aid eligibility to see if you can get help for college; if you don\u2019t qualify for it then you\u2019re definitely gonna need the GED in order to get scholarships (and some states even award scholarships to GED graduates, my state gave me $500), and to get a decent entry level job in order to pay for school. Also, having a GED can prevent you from having to take a lot of remedial courses. I scored high enough on my GED in English and science that I didn\u2019t have to take any remedial courses when I started college. I did have to take a remedial math class though before I was allowed to take any regular math courses. Remedial courses don\u2019t count toward your degree and it\u2019s basically something you have to do to satiate the school; but they still cost money so if you can avoid them by doing well on your GED and placement tests then do it. Also a lot of community colleges offer GED programs and help with job placement; I took my GED at the same community college that I\u2019m currently enrolled in and it was a super smooth process because the departments are all connected.\n\nI dropped out in 6th, 9th, and 11th grade so I totally understand. Whenever I was in school I made great grades and my teachers loved me. Sometimes bad crap just happens and we lose our way. But I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re on track, bud. Kudos to you.",

      "text": "I agree with the majority of people here who recommend starting with the GED first. I think another good alternative to college courses would be CLEP and DSST exams, which have been explained here really well ([https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/hi14tl/psa\\_dsst\\_and\\_clep\\_exams\\_earn\\_actual\\_penn\\_state/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/hi14tl/psa_dsst_and_clep_exams_earn_actual_penn_state/)). They're considerably less expensive than college course tuition, so I highly recommend looking into them if you want to save money. I'm currently considering taking some of them myself as a rising sophomore in college due to the cost-effectiveness. I think there are three main things to consider when deciding whether to take these exams:\n\n1. Different universities have different policies on whether they accept credit from these exams, so make sure that the colleges you want to apply to will accept them beforehand. \n2. You will have to self-study or get a tutor or investigate online resources to help study for these exams. I'm sure there are prep books out there, and it seems like you've had success with self-studying for the GED, so as long as you're okay with self-studying you'll be able to handle the preparatory period before the exams.\n3. If you plan on entering the premed path, most med schools don't accept online credit and/or exam credit for fulfillment of course prerequisites. As such, I'd mostly recommend these exam options for courses outside of your prerequisites -- but only if you're premed. If you're going into a different career path then you should be fine to take online courses in the place of prerequisite courses, especially given how the pandemic is affecting the way colleges teach classes in general. I haven't heard about other fields that are as particular as premed about prerequisites, but if you look through reddit I'm sure you'll find better explanations of the pros and cons of these exams.\n\nI wish you lots of good luck on your GED and beyond! :D",

          "text": "Oh also! Here are two youtube channels I really recommend for help with math:\n\n* The Organic Chemistry tutor is SOLID. He has videos ranging from math to science to everything in between, and could probably carry you all the way through college. His videos are formatted like a step-by-step worksheet, in which he'll explain the concept before giving you practice problems one at a time. Usually my strategy is to pause the video after his explanation, make sure I understand it (if I don't then I go back and take notes), and then I try the practice problem myself until I either get stuck or finish. Once I reach that point, I watch him complete the practice problem and check it against what I did and problem solve from there! His explanations are so clear and free of any fluff or confusion, and it's all 100% free and accessible. I just cannot say enough good things about his content.\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOLMfFuH7d4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOLMfFuH7d4)\n   * If you search \"GED math lessons organic chemistry tutor\" in youtube, a bunch more videos will pop up, so you can look through those because they have even more practice problems than the summary video I've linked above.\n* Patrick JMT is another channel that has saved my grade in math time and time again. His video format is similar to that of the Organic Chemistry tutor, but this playlist will be really useful for review because it goes through some of the tougher problems that are given on the GED to look out for.\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqpGZp2tzZI&list=PLANMHOrJaFxNPB0dHFRJKiDkrAuQqkBs3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqpGZp2tzZI&list=PLANMHOrJaFxNPB0dHFRJKiDkrAuQqkBs3)",

I really didnt learn anything in school past 7th grade and was in the 99th percentile for reading. Albeit, reading  has always been my strong suit. Everything else was pretty high too, except for math where I was in the 42nd percentile. I dont think the GED is designed to be too difficult tbh. I studied for a week --my state requires at least 12 hours at a local prep center-- and then signed up and took it. \n\nAnyway, I had to take a high school level math course prior to taking a college level course; and spent the first semester in a writing class as my grammar was horrible. Also, I struggled a little bit the first two semesters, but other than that I was good. \n\nLong story short - take your GED and sign up at your local community college.",

If you have any math tutoring resources available to you (including Youtube!), use those and level up your math skills as cheaply as you possibly can. If you end up needing to take remedial courses in college, they most likely won't count toward your degree, and it will take longer to complete your program. Most bachelor's degree programs require at least one quantitative reasoning class of some kind - even the totally non-STEM disciplines like art and language and history and such.\n\nI encourage you to think hard about what you want to go to college for - not like, what do you want to do with your degree, although that is also important. But as in, what are you hoping to get out of the experience? Especially considering the \"traditional college experience\" like you see in movies is likely to be put on hold for at least this upcoming academic year, if not longer. When everything is online, the classes at Local Community College will be pretty much the same as at State University, and Local CC will definitely be significantly cheaper.\n\nA note about paying for college, from a financial aid person: unless you meet certain criteria, you will need to provide tax information for at least one of your parents in order to get financial aid for college. I don't want to make assumptions about your relationship with your parents, and I understand if you don't want to get into the details of your particular situation in a public forum, but you can PM me if you have more questions about this.",
