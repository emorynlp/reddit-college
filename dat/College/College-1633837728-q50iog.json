      "text": "It's like that with everything. You move to college, your hometown doesn't feel like your home. You move somewhere for work, your college area won't feel like home.\n\nI always enjoy going back to my hometown and college/university town (even though there's almost no reason for me to be there). \n\nPiece of advice, don't get too attached to your college/university town, you're only there for ~4 years. Enjoy it, but remember, you're going to leave quite shortly (those 4 years go fast asf).",
