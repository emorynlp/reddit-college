  "title:": "Feeling Hopeless. Funds are running low.",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am 22 years old attending a Flight School at a community college. I recently have run dry of my funds and do not know what else to do anymore. I applied for student financial aid and found out that I have been denied of student loans to help me with paying for school. I currently work at a warehouse to keep myself barely scraping by.\n\nI have never felt this hopeless before in my life. I used to be driven and hard working. Ever since early 2021, I lost the drive and motivation due to finding out that my funds are running low.\n\nRight now, I do not know what to do at this point. I feel like ending my flight career path pretty much throws away countless hours of studying flight theory and learning how to fly a plane.\n\nI feel like dropping out of college is the worst thing I could do. I can't be happy with myself knowing I dropped out. ",

It\u2019s more common than you think for people to stop attending, work to save money, then return when they can afford it.\n\nMaybe once you have more money, try enrolling part-time in 1-2 classes to progress while you continue working.",

And some have annual fees attached to them. \n\nAs long as you do your research on the card and bank, pay (more than) your minimums, and keep your balances to 30% of your limit, it could be a good idea. Especially with building credit for future loans, but if you make it a \u201cquick fix,\u201d it might just do more harm than good. So err on the side of caution my friends\n\nEdit: not to say this isn\u2019t a viable option. Also you could look into personal loans, but as with credit cards, there are pros and cons so do the research before you decide.",
