  "text": "I\u2019m currently failing a class, the essential class for my major Data Structures and Algorithms. Everyone I know in that class generally works their ass off, sometimes 6 hours in a day, and we\u2019re all getting screwed, me the hardest.  \n\nMeanwhile, my friend over at another school just took a nice, regular version of the class where it\u2019s just about learning the concepts. Not about applying them to crazy curveball questions\n\nSame thing with MicroEconomics, where for me it was easy, for other friends it was extremely tough. Just different classes under the same name\n\nCollege is so clearly random and unfair",

      "text": "I mean maybe you're smarter then me. I know I'm not smart and absolutely stink at logical thinking in general.\n\nI thought I was the only one that would be the slowest of the slow in a CS major, and it seems like everybody is so smart and able to figure things out super quick (even if I was never in any CS classes with anybody).  I know it's stupid to make this assumption, but this is the vibe that I get even when I've never taken any CS classes. What's worse is that I go to a mediocre state school (however I don't know how difficult the CS classes at my school are, but I heard from another student at my school that CS is difficult).  Granted I'm not a CS major, but I don't think I'm intellectually capable of it. I mean what made me think this is me struggling with a introductory programming class as I remember sitting in front of the computer and not being able to figure anything out. Maybe you're better than me at it, so don't worry and you're definitely not the only one struggling.  \n\nBut this post makes me feel better and discover that either kids struggle hard in their classes or the classes are made easy by making kids only learn concepts but not apply it. Maybe I'm not below average after all for struggling with logical thinking.",
