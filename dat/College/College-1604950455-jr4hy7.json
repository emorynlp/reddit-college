He would even comment on what I was wearing the day before and how it complimented me. After weeks of this I had enough and left a message on my car for him to find asking him to meet me. He left me his phone number and I called him and told him the f\\*cK off. I never knew who he was and I always felt paranoid walking outside my apartment knowing he was probably watching me from somewhere. He left me alone after that but that was one of my most creepy experiences ever.",

He says this because he feels he has a right to make his assessment of her desirability known. He is therefore making his view of her as a sexual object known (because simply existing as a woman is somehow an invitation for unwanted male attention) in an attempt to assert dominance over her. That definitely sounds predatory to me, it doesn\u2019t matter that there isn\u2019t intent to physically hurt because that\u2019s not the point.",

If this was done the other way around and a girl was judging how short a guy is for example, it wouldnt be appropriate dont you think? Im speaking on behalf of this situation at least.
