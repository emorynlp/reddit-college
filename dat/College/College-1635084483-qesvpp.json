  "title:": "Terrified of Graduating",
  "text": "By May of next year, I will be officially done with college. College has been the time of my life. High school was a big rough for me, but college was amazing. For me, I never felt the stress of academics that so many of my peers felt. I found that by studying a reasonable amount, I\u2019ve gotten the grades and job opportunities I\u2019ve wanted without much stress.\n\nWhat I\u2019m scared of is my social life after college. It\u2019s been tough enough for me to make friends. My freshman year friend group didn\u2019t work out and it\u2019s been so tough to make friends since. I definitely have friends, but not a lot of friends in my year or what you would imagine to be a typical college friend group. \n\nI\u2019m trying my hardest to enjoy every day I have left on campus, because COVID took so many of them and I\u2019ve been told these are the best years of my life. I\u2019m really afraid of missing college and never getting it back again.\n\nTLDR: Graduating soon, scared of what comes next.",

After graduation, taking enjoyment in pursuing new long-term goals involving your career, family plans, a hobby, and the like will become important.",
