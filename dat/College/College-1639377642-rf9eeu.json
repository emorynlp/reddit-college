  "text": "Like what the title says. I want to become a wildlife biologist, but from what I read it a really unstable job and I would need a second job. So I want to get my dentist assiant certification, so I can pay my way through college. Plus it would be my second job. It only a year course, I already tried getting hired at a couple of places... but no response. Have you took a course in college, just so you can get a better job till you got the job you wanted?",

      "text": "I think it would be great if you can use it to graduate debt free and then hopefully only work one job. I don't know how much dental assistants get paid, or how much your school costs, but if you're already thinking you'll need 2 jobs to survive, limiting student debt as much as possible should probably be your #1 priority.\n\nI'm also glad you're looking to the future enough to be thinking about your future cost/style of living. But thinking about working 2 jobs for the rest of your life would scare me. Is there some sort of typical career progression in wildlife biology that will eventually let you make enough to work one job only?",
