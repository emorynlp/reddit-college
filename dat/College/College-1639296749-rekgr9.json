  "text": "My parents don\u2019t believe in me. My advisor doesn\u2019t believe in me. My \u201cfriends\u201d probably don\u2019t believe in me but I stopped hanging out with them a little bit ago.\n\nMy only teammate is myself. It\u2019s a little sad, but you gotta accept the reality at some point. \n\nYeah, I do have a 2.1 gpa as sophomore cus I was a dumbass last year so I get why one wouldn\u2019t have faith in me. Not to mention I\u2019m pursuing a BS in physics and I need to be one of the best students in my major which will only get exponentially harder in the next 2 years. But there\u2019s something about the massive odds pinned against me that fuels my passion more than anything else and it\u2019s been showing in my grades recently. Call me crazy but I\u2019ve been enjoying studying 12hrs a day for finals. \n\nDoes anybody else feel this way? I will admit, it does hurt sometimes when I think about having no one by my side, but all I need is to see a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.",

Just keep working on it and you\u2019ll do great things. Grades aren\u2019t the only measure of a person regardless. Sometimes we all need a kick in the ass to get us going again. Don\u2019t lose that passion.",

      "text": "You're killing it. It's hard for me to study over 5 hrs a day and you're out here giving it your all. Your hard work will definitely be rewarded. When recruiters see your transcript and they see a huge jump in your grades (even if your overall is average or below average) that will be a positive thing for them. The most important thing is that you believe in yourself, but fyi I believe in you too",
