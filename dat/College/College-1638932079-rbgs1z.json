  "text": "I'm currently a sophomore at UCSB. I enrolled back in 2019, spent about half a year there before COVID. Honestly, my life at UCSB was quite miserable. The environment just felt wrong to me. I don't wanna go into all the details, but I'm distressed and miserable there. I ended up having depression and anxiety there and had to see the therapist every week. I couldn't concentrate on anything and sometimes had to take sleeping pills. I felt relieved when I went back home after everything moved online. \n\nNow I'm back, and that anxiety and depression come back. During COVID, I constantly tried to convince myself that everything would be better, the school isn't that bad, I just didn't try hard enough in adapting, and I only need one more shot to fall in love with the school. But none of that happened, so I tried to transfer. I grew up in Hong Kong and I always love city life. I applied for several schools in NY and Boston and got accepted to Fordham Lincoln Center with 20k scholarship. I've lived in NYC for a couple of months before and I definitely love it there. But what keeps me from taking the offer is the ranking. Fordham is somewhere around 60th and UCSB is a top 30. I'm worried that prestige would hurt my chance of getting a job. I wanna study finance or Econ, and I plan to stay in the east coast after graduating. Even though I know that Fordham has good job placement in the Wall Street, the ranking still bothers me. Money would not be an issue. I pay out of state tuition at UCSB, that's 44k, and at Fordham I would be playing 35k. Living costs would be higher in NYC but my family can afford that. So what do you guys think? Should I transfer to a lower ranked school for happiness?",

I think in terms of reputability Fordham and UCSB are about the same (at least for business).\n\nPlus, UCSB\u2019s rankings haven\u2019t been consistent over the years which is also important. They were like #37-40 only 5 years ago. That means their reputability isn\u2019t established compared to other universities who have had similarly higher ranks for 20+ years.",

      "text": "To my understanding, (and I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re studying, maybe your degree is in something different than mine), employers in the U.S. really don\u2019t care where you went to school, unless it was somewhere like Harvard or Yale. Your references, your experience, and your assets (like being bilingual) are much more attractive to employers.\nA graduate with a high GPA, extensive relevant work/internship experience, extra certifications, and top notch references from a no-name private university or state school is so much more valuable than a graduate with average qualities that attended a \u201chigh ranking university\u201d according to niche ranking system. At least where I\u2019m from. (Rural Midwest) As long as your university was accredited, you didn\u2019t opt for a pass/fail Covid grade, and you do your best in your program, you\u2019re pretty much golden in a lot of the U.S. Plus you\u2019re doing all of this as an international student, which is even more impressive.",
