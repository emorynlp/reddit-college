  "text": "hi! I'm a senior in college looking for participants to interview for a research project about college-aged students' opinions on going to counseling as a way to manage their stress and symptoms of anxiety/depression for my health behaviors class.\n\npreferably looking for students who have symptoms of anxiety and depression, and I'd be asking 10 short questions about counseling. also you don\u2019t need to be going to counseling to qualify for the study. just need any college students who have symptoms of anxiety/depression. \n\npls lmk if anyone would be interested in helping me out!! I'm lowkey stressed trying to find people to interview before Tuesday....pls help ya girl out! either comment or DM if interested \ud83e\udd7ait would mean a lot and the interview would be very short (15 minutes) over phone call or discord or whatever's easiest for you and you wouldn't have to show your face, and you don't have to reveal your identity/name.\n\ni'd be willing to venmo/paypal like $2 for your time! I'm desperate lol and need a good grade on this :P",
