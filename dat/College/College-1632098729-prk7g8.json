  "title:": "Insane roommates / I want to move out",
  "text": "Title says it: I have insane roommates and I want to move out. \n\nEvery single bloody night, I'm in bed by 11 because I have to be up by 7. Every night, my roommates are up, yelling and banging shit till about 2 or 3am. Even with earplugs, it's impossible to drown out the noise. I have asked them to stop at least once a night since move-in (six weeks, I think?), and they agree but then do the same thing the next night. \n\nThey've thrown out my (labelled, still good) food because it was taking up space in the fridge, so I just end up going hungry those nights. I'm on food stamps, so I get extra concerned when my food goes to waste or vanishes mysteriously.\n\nThey go through my things, they steal my things, they steal my food. They are rude and hurtful to my face. They made me sleep outside the room twice because they wanted to keep socializing late at night and I wanted to sleep. They bug me and follow me around constantly so I can't get anything done. They use my cooking items without asking and return them in horrendous condition. \n\nI've started spending more time at home lately (I live close enough to commute, just chose not to), and I end up not wanting to leave because at least my mom actually respects me enough to behave like an adult human being around me. I'm very much considering just moving back home for the rest of the year. I have a lease I can't break, but my financial aid is paying my rent so it's not like I'm losing any money if I do so. I'm just friggin tired of it all. \n\nIt's not like I've never talked to them about boundaries and all of these things. They are aware, just don't care. The landlord doesn't seem to care, either; it's like the friggin wild west out here. \n\nThoughts?",
