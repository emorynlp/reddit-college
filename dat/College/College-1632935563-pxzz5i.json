  "text": "Hello all! I\u2019m going to try to keep this short and simple. Got accepted into college, filled out FAFSA, Got government loans, unsubsidized and subsidized loans, and after all of that, I still have a balance of around 4k. My school offers payment plans but it is only broken up into fours. I can\u2019t just pay $200 one week, and then again the next week, the system only allows for the installment plan of $1,000 until balanced is fully paid. I reached out to Student Aid (twice!) and haven\u2019t heard back, BUT I keep getting emails that if I do not pay, I can no longer attend my classes. I can\u2019t take out a student loan because I don\u2019t have a credit worthy co-signer. Can\u2019t do the parent loan since I am 26. I don\u2019t know what to do! Any advice is greatly appreciated! Please don\u2019t state the obvious and suggest I just don\u2019t take the classes, I\u2019m hoping to get some logical advice :) \n\n-on mobile",

      "text": "Sounds like you chose a school that was unaffordable. If you\u2019re an independent on FAFSA (which you are at 26) you were offered $9,500 in loans, if you\u2019re a first year student more if you aren\u2019t. You\u2019re already facing a lot in student loan debt if you do this for 4 years. You need to either pick up a job (or a higher paying job)and pay more out of pocket or find a more affordable school",
