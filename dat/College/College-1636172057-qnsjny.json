  "text": "This semester I\u2019m taking a programming class and it\u2019s required for my major although I\u2019m a secondary math education major and we have TA\u2019s (they are actually called PLA\u2019s for this specific course I\u2019m taking) but play a similar role and assist the main professor for this course (we have one professor who teaches all the content but PLA\u2019s answer questions outside of class and grade assignments) and my PLA at first graded assignments really quick and would give feedback so I know what I\u2019m doing right/wrong when I code but for the past month they haven\u2019t graded my assignment and all the PLA really needs to do is test my code, see if it works and then if it works I get a 100 but my PLA like I said for a month hasn\u2019t done that. Is it rude if I contact them asking when will they grade my assignments? Especially this is possibly concerning since the feedback they provide could be helpful when we do other coding assignments.",

      "text": "you said \"when will you grade X\"\n\ndo not ask this. this question implies they haven't started, meaning they are procrastinating/lazy. If you have a boss (or anyone, really) that asks you \"when will you do \\[X that I asked you to do\\]?\" they think exactly that. Like asking a child \"when will you do your chores?\"\n\ninstead, ask \"when will you finish grading X?\" which implies they are working on it (which they probably are)",
