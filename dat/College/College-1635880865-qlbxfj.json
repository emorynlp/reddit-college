  "text": "Recently I just got a very good paying job that I\u2019ll be happy to do for years to come. It\u2019s in the same field as what I\u2019m going to school for. If I already have a job for what I want to do, is there any point in spending more money on an education that won\u2019t mean anything to me??  \n\nTo me this is a no brainer, but I\u2019m fortunate to have parents who make decent money and they have decided to pay for my college. How do I bring this up to them after they have spent the money for this year? I\u2019ve lost all motivation to keep going to school",
