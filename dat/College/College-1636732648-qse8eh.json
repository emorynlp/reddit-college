      "text": "People try to go to schools that are a reach that they can get into - don't. Get some money as a scholarship from a school, and don't pull your hair out trying to not fail, because all those big prestigious schools will do is put you in classes that set you up to fail in the beginning. Big schools (high attendance) are nice because there are lots of people to meet, chances are sports are prominent which is always fun (its even more fun if they win a lot), and the student services are (GENERALLY) better in big schools.\n\nFor me, the priority goes:\n\n1. Scholarships/opportunities for scholarships\n2. Student services (especially the websites, you'll be doing a lot of scheduling, paying bills, library services etc. online. make sure they don't suck.)\n\nAfter that, your priorities can be whatever you're looking for in a school. Prestige is 100% unimportant to performance and experience when it comes to getting a job.\n\nThe only relatively irrelevant suggestion I have is, if you're stuck between two programs that are offering a very similar experience in terms of what I've said above, and you're stuck on the decision. Pick the warmer one. You'll thank me in January when you have to walk to your 8AM in your PJs instead of 40 layers.",

Also had a supposedly good program. I am working in my field of choice so no complaints? Honestly where you go to school probably won't matter as much as being socially competent, that's what's gotten me the farthest. An extra 40k-80k of student debt won't give you a better education, especially since most learning is based on you teaching yourself the material anyways.",

Even then, most people don\u2019t care after your first or second job.",
