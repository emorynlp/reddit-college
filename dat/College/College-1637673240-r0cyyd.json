  "text": "if you care about your grades sm, obviously not. I'm also sharing my experience with this\n\nMy motive was to learn how to handle people I can't control and work with people outside my group. I thought I was really doing something with this decision before I decided to do it, it's a 3 person market research group for the rest of the semester.\n\nSo far, everything is going my way, I'm kinda nailing it right now because I'm sort of the leader, and I'm self-aware that I lack leadership skills and I was freaking working on it. We got green grades (we using blackboard) on the first two research but the effort for me is fcking EXTRA than usual!\n\nwe're on our 3rd research right now and writing this is just to get my frustration out there, I'm supervising the entire paper and stuff. And the pros is.. I just order them around and giving them their own tasks and shit and I check their work... although i still feel like I'm doing most of the work. I did this to myself though.",
