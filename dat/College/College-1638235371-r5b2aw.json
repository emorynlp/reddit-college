  "text": "I (19 F) am a junior in college I only have three more semesters until I graduate but I still have a lot of requirements to take before hand which is why I\u2019m trying to get everything done now so senior year can be a breeze the only class that\u2019s currently kicking my ass is pre-calculus I\u2019m usually not bad at math but this course it\u2019s just not it for me. The professor goes very fast even if we ask him to slow down and the homework is super tedious and we flyby chapters in every session. I\u2019m not the type of person that will learn super quick I have to practice over and over and over the thing is that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing I have attended the study sessions going through the review sheets and still these past two exams I failed miserably (in the 30s) we have one last exam before our final and I really need to get a semi-high score because right now my average is an F I\u2019m just very overwhelmed and overworked I\u2019ve been dedicating at least an hour every day to do a few problems from the review sheet but the professor purposely makes the exams harder he even told us this himself I know that retaking a course isn\u2019t that big of a deal but I really want to graduate on time because College has been so demanding and I think I\u2019m running low on energy for it. Any advice?",
