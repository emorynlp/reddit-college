  "title:": "I feel almost weird that I\u2019m happier in college than in high school",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman (class of 2025), and I\u2019m exponentially happier now than I was last year. My homework in college is so much more difficult than it was in high school, but it doesn\u2019t make me miserable like it did for the past 4 years. Now I don\u2019t mind spending the weekend just doing homework. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m interested in the content or if it\u2019s because I feel like I\u2019m working towards something, or even if it\u2019s because I have more time. It\u2019s just bizarre; I used to have mental breakdowns in high school when I had like 2 hours of homework in a night. Now, I\u2019ve got much more than that but im not really bothered by it. Those are just my thoughts, wanted to know if anyone felt the same way?",

And knowing that I\u2019m working towards a degree where the education continues to motivate me to study hard and do well.\n\nHowever, my stress has only increased and the mental breakdowns have amplified tenfold. My perfectionist has worsened because I\u2019m afraid my GPA won\u2019t be good. Constantly worrying about whether my work is good or not. And afraid that I won\u2019t graduate or get a good career if my GPA is a 3.0 or below.\n\nIt\u2019s been hard, but I\u2019m pushing through. I need to reconsider therapy though, at least for my stress.",

In college, there are barely any assignments (in my experience anyway) that would act as a cushion to my exams\u2019 grades, and my exams combined are at most 50% of my grade. I already failed the first exam in my major course, so I have to work extra hard to get 90% in the next exams.\n\nDoes your college have free consulting sessions?",

College is a lot more free in terms of choosing your path and feeling more like an adult because there are a lot more choices you can freely make on your own. And high school feels a bit more controlling imo, waking up at a certain time everyday and everything about high school to me was just too repetitive and the same. Not only that, I didn\u2019t have much friends in high school and never really socialized. Now that I\u2019m in college I feel a lot more confident and it\u2019s fun as well because there\u2019s so many things you can become involved. Even if you have more homework it\u2019s probably because you do like what you\u2019re learning which is great!",
