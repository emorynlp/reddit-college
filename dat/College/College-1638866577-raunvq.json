  "text": "I had a short assignment of 200 words that I have submitted already, and now I\u00b4ve realised it was at 196. I can\u00b4t imagine having any problems with that word count as the differences are so small, but  I had read earlier on this forum that sometimes word counts are very strict and that by missing a couple of words I could be penalised. How would this word count be generally graded?",
