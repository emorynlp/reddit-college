  "title:": "How to ask professor if I can redo some homework assignments?",
  "text": "Hi I'm currently a freshman and I fell behind in one of my courses and got zeroes on some homework assignments. Do you think it's a good idea to email my professor and ask if I can do them for partial credit? Should I apologize in the email or would that be weird? I'm only wanting to ask because the homework assignments were worth a lot more than I thought (20% vs 10% for quizzes), and even getting a 50 on those assignments I received a 0 on would bump my grade up to an A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I should wait until the end of the semester to ask?",

They aren\u2019t there to help you fail, they are there to help you succeed    A little encouragement goes a long way,  especially for a freshman. Good luck.",
