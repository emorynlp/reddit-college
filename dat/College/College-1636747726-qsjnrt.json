  "text": "If you are approaching subjects with dread, your body is already telling the truth about the experience.\n\nTeachers will sell you their classes, advisers will sell you whole course loads, counselors will manage you into the schools desires professing that is what academic success is. And navigating all of this without disdain is how to succeed. In computer science we call this inheritance, take from and form into your own version. \n\nBut if some zealot professor is barking you down about what you need to be, the rich kids parents already taught them, that they aren\u2019t there for opinions, but the skill, you don\u2019t need to impress or satisfy anyone. \n\nThis is your experience, with the internet everyone could easily learn any undergraduate online right now and overnight collapse every university/college.",
