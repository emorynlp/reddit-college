  "text": "I hate this damn schedule. Everything I do is either determined by my class scheduled or roommates sleeping habits. I love playing music but my damn roommate sleeps in all day. I try to compromise my playing later at night but have early morning classes. Then on the weekends life is rinse and repeat. Go out to a bar or stupid club and drink excessively. What a way to live! Honestly I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be saying this but zoom classes last year make me really miss online school. At least then you could mess about during the classes and have a program to join them for you. Now I have to actually go to class and sleep next to some obese moron.",

How does one go about \u201clearning\u201d to enjoy something. Isn\u2019t the definition of enjoy to derive pleasure or delight in an activity. Do you expect me to trick my brain into deriving pleasure from completing the same tasks every day without fail? It seems like that paradigm is attempting to address the unhappiness through the wrong mean. Opposed to finding more fulfilling work your suggestion is to merely \u201cenjoy\u201d routine. By that logic every mathematician before the advent of the computer and calculator should\u2019ve learnt to enjoy the mind numbingly boring process of computing data and thus would have never increased computing power. Needless to say I appreciate your advice but disagree with it wholeheartedly.",

But it still usually starts and ends at the same times, and that work/sleep schedule is often far less flexible than the one you find unpleasant in college. \n\nI\u2019ve learned to enjoy many things in my life, it really is about mindset.  I found my career very fulfilling & retired at a young age, but even with the freedom of retirement, I embrace routine.  \n\nBut by all means, best of luck to you.",
