  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman at a top #20 school (UCLA equivalent). I feel guilty about spending so much for tuition / I\u2019m not getting anything out of the college experience. Yes, parties are fun. Kind of gets old after a while. Doesn\u2019t seem like I\u2019m growing much as a person. \n\nI\u2019m scared to leave such a good school behind but feel like it would be much smarter to attend a cheaper option and invest my tuition as savings. Maybe join the armed forces. \n\nShould I just suck it up and stay for the reputation or is reputation overrated anyway?",

      "text": "Go to college but change your approach, actively seek to do new things and change things up. College gave me the time to experiment with things such as psychs, which in turn set me on this path of self growth, both spiritually and in my daily life. But if you already have an idea as to what you want to do in life and are 100% certain of that then I'd say do online and actively pursue that. Whatever you do though, do it with consistency and certainty. (By certainty I mean do your research in whatever ya do before you do it, get prepared.) Shape the world around you, don't let it shape you! \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc\n\nOn a side not I went two years regular college and 3 years online and I much preferred regular college mainly because of the experience but online is really fun too because if you're motivated you can get your work done well ahead of time and just college road trip when ya want.",

          "text": "I appreciate the advice and understand where you\u2019re coming from. Honestly, I\u2019m just not that motivated to branch out right now. None of the student organizations seem that interesting to me. No one I\u2019ve met has really changed my outlook on anything. Just feels like I\u2019m spending a lot of money for not much in return. I enjoy the social aspects but feel like I could recreate this elsewhere. Renting an apartment, going on tinder, nightclubs etc. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m at a point in my life where I just want to settle down and pursue financial security. I don\u2019t care about making friends that I\u2019m going to lose touch with. I don\u2019t care about learning information I\u2019m going to forget. Kind of a dark place to be in",

You save so much money, get to do everything from home or anywhere you want really at your own pace etc.\n\nThats why I'm gonna do it and besides, I am very shy and a massive introvert so I really don't care about missing out on the whole \"college life\", I'll take being at home any day lol",
