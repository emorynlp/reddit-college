  "text": "For context, I started my first year of college a little less than 3 weeks ago. First week was fine, more introductury than anything. Then second week came, I already became pretty lost but this week is the worst.\n\nIt feels like I'm actually stupid, not understanding seemingly simple concepts since it's the start of the year. \n\nI finished high school with minimal studying and never failed anything so coming into college and not understanding a thing is destroying my morale.\n\nAm I just paranoid?\n\nedit: thank you all for nice comments, I'll try to manage my time a bit better and start checking the material ahead if time",

      "text": "Welcome to college where minimal studying will get you an F, and maximum studying does not guarantee even a B. \n\nYou have to break away from two things:\n1-The idea that studying will guarantee you good grades. \n2-The idea that barely understanding the material is enough. \n\nYour still early so you have time to correct your mistakes. Don't worry.\n\nWhat you must do from here on out is grab the material the professor gave you, sit in the library or wherever you study, and begin to practice. Practice, practice, practice. Mind you, not practice to learn the looks of the process but to learn HOW the process goes. Doesn't matter the subject, you have to sit down and read over the material given in class, read it on the book, and look up practice exercises and do them. The book usually has them scattered on the chapter and at the end of the chapter too. \n\nIn high school you are tested on how well you retain knowledge. In college, you are tested on how well you understand the topic. \n\nThe test will probably not look anywhere close to what you study so, you have to prepare for the worst possible outcome by studying how it's done and going over many exercises so you learn the ins and outs of the subject. \n\nHere's a summary of all of that but from a veteran's view:\nThe further you go, the less professors teach, and the more homework you are given. The way you learn is by doing the homework, because that's what truly shows you how the cookie crumbles. \n\nWelcome to the big leagues. I'll spare you the pain and let you know right away: college teaches you to teach yourself. It's do or die.",

For history (at least in the gen eds I took), there's not much you can do there besides memorize events and important people. I'm a chemistry major and sometimes just looking at notes and doing practice doesn't guarantee that you know how exactly everything is happening. Sometimes my professors would slide in a \"why does this occur\" question for the short answers on tests/quizzes.",

You need to read the relevant parts in the textbook *before* class, take notes, during class add to your notes where its relevant. After class you review the notes and interact with it in some way whether thats practice problems, flash cards for vocab, watching extra videos on the concept, etc. You cant just learn shit by osmosis like you can get away with in high school, it takes a lot of effort. Its totally normal to not be an expert studier in your first weeks in college, but you do need to change up your habits if what youre doing isnt working. Good luck",

Fuck that date. Everything is more difficult, quizzes, tests, material everything. Some professors become stand-offish and become less available.\n\nAlso, you will learn the nature of paragraphs from your English 101 class, and you can use this information to your advantage. The first sentence is typically the statement, and every subsequent sentence offers supporting and backup to the first sentence. As a result, you can just read the first sentence of each paragraph in your textbook. Works great for history and politics/government classes, some art and phys education classes where there is a lot of reading.\n\nIn math, do you homework, and then if the homework is every other question in the back of the book, just go ahead and do all the questions. The more you do the work, the more information will be retained for tests and quizzes, and more importantly, advanced math that build on those topics. If you aren't good at math, it is best to do as much of it as possible as quickly as possible - don't leave gaps where you will forget, so like, if you take Algebra I, don't wait until next year to do algebra II, just do all your required math in sequence as fast as you can.\n\nGood Luck!",

I would like it if *more* people dropped my class early on, because it means fewer papers I need to grade later down the line.

      "text": "Nope. My first freshman semester I hit a road bump. I was put in a class that I truly shouldn\u2019t have been in that early on, and the class absolutely rocked my shit. Coming out of high school, I don\u2019t remember studying except a few instances where I had done so for AP tests (beginning a month before the exam with a review book). In other words, I had no idea how to study effectively. \nAnd I poured myself into the work, spending as much time as possible on the subject, and getting curb stomped by every single test. It crushed my sense of ego and self esteem. I thought about how stupid I had to have been, to study for hours and hours and make dozens of flash cards only to scrape by with a D. *but I learned*\nThe spring semester I got put in a class with a 70% fail/drop rate, and I passed. Every single test I scored within the top 10% of the class, ending the semester with an A. And I attribute the success to 3 things: (1) nearly failing that class my first semester which made me reevaluate how I study, and reflect on how I study best, (2) taking 2 courses my winter break that allowed me to see how I studied best by allowing me to experiment with ways of studying and seeing how I did on the tests, and (3) being stubborn and quite literally refusing to fail after being told by the department director I would fail because of an SAT math score. *My advise for you?* Do your best. Come out the wiser with even more determination than you had before. I get the mentality of feeling dumb and not understanding what you\u2019re doing wrong because I was there my first semester. I went from a 4.2 (4.5 gpa scale) in high school to a 2.8 my first semester of school. I\u2019m currently sitting as a junior with a 3.7. But rather than tearing yourself down, begin to build yourself back up. A grade doesn\u2019t define you. It\u2019s going to take a lot of drive and grit. If you\u2019re like me, I noticed I took longer than my peers on the work, but I also did better than they did. It\u2019s a process. Understand that and start working now to figure out how you best study and how to maximize your time. Best of luck. You\u2019ve got this though.",

My attitude towards myself underwent a major shift from feeling like I was helpless and unable to do well in my class regardless of the time and effort I put into the subject (which actually wasn\u2019t a lot looking back into it. As I still thought studying 2 days before a test was an effective way to study), to me building an ego-of-sorts because I had attended every lecture, took notes, did dozens of practice problems, took weekly quizzes, and spent 1-2 hours every day of the week, every week going over the subject matter, and knew that I was going to crush anything that class shoved my way. I also had learned that group study sessions weren\u2019t for me and that studying on my own was key to my success.",
