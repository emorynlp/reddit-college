  "text": "\nMy roommate is in a sorority. You can already tell where this is going. Every weekend she goes to party. Friday into Saturday morning and Saturday into Sunday morning. She always says she\u2019ll be back early, that midnight is her deadline. But she always comes back at two, three. It\u2019s just not fair. I get it\u2019s the weekend, but I have to wake up at 6 for classes every other day of the week while she gets to sleep in. I just don\u2019t know how to go about this, even when I tell her that she wakes me up. What do I do? Is it horrible of me to tell her to sleep over at the sorority house if she wants to party?",

If you are just waken up by her opening the door and tiptoeing through, that\u2019s a you problem, consider melatonin supplements to help you sleep through. Telling her to sleep somewhere else or come back early is not something you can ask her do regardless.",

She also dropped a metal water bottle, coughed, just generally not being mindful. I\u2019ve talked to her about it before, but she just said sorry but? I would think sorry means that she would try to improve on her behavior but guess not",

Dropping a water bottle/coughing doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not being mindful. \n\nFirst thing first, you honestly need to learn to be a bit more understanding about these situations. You can be bothered by them, but to then take these situations that can\u2019t be helped and have such animosity towards your roomate is a major problem. If you can\u2019t afford to live on your own you need to learn to tolerate inconvenient living situations and not start hating people for it.\n\nSecondly, if you really can\u2019t tolerate it, don\u2019t get upset with her but seriously consider a room change and make sure to properly vet future roomates. You are someone that needs a roomate that also abides by a strict bedroom and doesn\u2019t go out. That\u2019s not a bad thing that you should be judged for, just the reality.",

I don\u2019t hate her because she parties every weekend. My disdain goes into some territory that I don\u2019t think is too on topic so I\u2019ll emit it.\n\nAnd totally! That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. I have a meeting with my RA tomorrow so I\u2019ll discuss it with them definitely.",
