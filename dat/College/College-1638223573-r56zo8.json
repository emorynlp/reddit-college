  "text": "Basically, I have unlimited attempts on this assignment. I know for sure for 4 of the problems the number value is between 0 to 100, and I am willing to just sit there iterating up to 100 until I hit the right value. If I \"check my work\" 300+ times, will my professor know?\n\nI really really need to eke out like 2-3 more homework points to pass this class LOL desperate times and all that",
