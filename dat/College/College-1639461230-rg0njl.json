  "text": "Do you guys think taking trig, precalc, bio  2, and Chem 1 at the same time is too much? I would also be taking a speech OR American history class. So my schedule would look something like this \n\nBio II,\nChem I,\nTrig,\nPre-Calc, and an elective\n\nI know I can handle trig, precalc, and bio II at once since bio I was a breeze for me, but I haven\u2019t taken Chem and it scares me a bit because I did not have good Chem teachers in high school so now I have that stigmatized view of it. \n\nJust looking for some opinions/direction here, thanks!",

      "text": "Hello! \n\nBased on my experience, Chem and Bio are a pretty heavy workload in one semester, but manageable (I did it lol)! However, if you believe you can handle precalc and bio II together, I would take that with chem. I had some friends who took those three classes together and managed to get pretty good grades. I haven't taken trig (I'm a bio major) but you could probably take that in the summer and still be on a good route! \n\nBe careful with time management and don't fall behind! I think chem is one of the classes where you'll have to try to be on top of everything. I was in the same spot you were in- my high school teacher quit halfway through the first semester and I had subs for the rest of the year. However, I attended office hours, lectures, and study groups and received an A my two semesters. \n\nI think another tip to succeed in chem is to just understand and do practice problems since there are a lot of calculations in general chemistry. Also theories, which in my opinion were way easier to understand. Overall, it's pretty manageable. If you are not sure about doing well in chem, maybe try to see if your university/college has any classes that teach you the basics of chem (kinda like a chem101 class). Some of my friends took that and it helped them before taking gen chem.  \n\nAs long as you believe in yourself, you can achieve it! \n\nYou got this!",
