  "text": "Wow just typing that was painful. But I\u2019m a sophomore in college, I spent my whole freshman year at home and online so I lost the ability to socialize sometime during that period. Most of my classes are online still but I am on campus. Do I just walk up to someone and say \u201chey\u201d or what? I literally don\u2019t know\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Alright, here\u2019s some practical advice for introverts who want friends: ask another classmate that sits near you in a class if they wanna do an exam review before the next big text. Then, ask again before the next test. Then, ask if they want to just meet up to study some day after a normal class day. Ask if they wanna meet up in a study area near class, at the library, or nearby cafe. Easy, peasy and no pressure. Works with guys and gals cause everyone needs to study and if you\u2019re not a weirdo around the opposite sex, you might even find some good study buddies you wouldn\u2019t have talked to otherwise! \n\n\nAnd to answer your initial question, yes, greeting people by saying \u201chey\u201d is very okay, but maybe lead with a little more substance.\n\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re in Dr. Smiths class, right?\u201d \n\n\u201cHey, are you a Pre-med/English/Biology student too?\u201d \n\n\u201cHey, how do you like taking notes on the your iPad?\u201d",

      "text": "Try planning something that brings people together. Get a deck of cards or a party game and invite people in your classes to a game night. If you have access to volleyball or basketball courts try to get a game together. This has helped me turn acquaintances into friends. Good luck!!",

      "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and have pretty bad social anxiety so I completely understand how you\u2019re feeling. Definitely look into some of the clubs at your school to find ones that interest you, common interests are a great conversation starter! Also, don\u2019t be afraid to just go up to someone and try starting a conversation. Most people are in the same boat as you and are also looking for new friends! :)",

Talk to your roommate or neighbors and invite them to lunch or dinner. \n\nIt can sometimes take time to make friends but you\u2019ll find your community!",
