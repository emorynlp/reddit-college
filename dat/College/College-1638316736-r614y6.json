  "title:": "So finals are coming up for the end of my first semester in college and I need to finalize my major with my advisor and discuss what are my plans with him. So I am wondering which major between Industrial Engineering and Electrical Engineering? Discussion",
  "text": " I am into engineering as a whole and so far love it and plan on being an  engineer after college but am intrigued in both of these disciplines.  Course plan wise they have different courses obviously but they both  look very interesting to me. I would just like to know what internships  and jobs I can be getting into both and just overall help in picking  one. Pay isn't worrying me cause they both seem to be decent salaries  wise but I ain't doing engineering for the money but more for the  passion.",

You can see what kind of companies are offering and responsibilities they're looking for.\n\nIn my experience IE was more like manufacturing process efficiency, EE was more like circuit design or anything along those lines.",
