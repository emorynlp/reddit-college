  "text": "Here's the thing, my cs professor gave us a code assignment and one of the instructions said to go search in google for a particular term. I mean I know that google is efficient enough to study, but aren't we supposed to cover this during class? No offense against my professor, I just wanted to ask if this happens a lot.",
