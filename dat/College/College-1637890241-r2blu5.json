  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a 23(F) who just got their GED last week. I know everyone graduates HS literally once in their lifetime but I was one of the people that the education system failed but I was able to pick myself back up! Enough of the lil back story. I\u2019m just a bit confused on which career to pursue. I\u2019ve always wanted to do work that had to do something with animals (Animal science/Bio) but over the years recently I got in touch with art again and I just enjoy it so much that it\u2019s giving me the thought of becoming a digital art/art teacher of some sort. But I\u2019ve heard so many mixed things about about anything in the art industry. Super competitive, less respect and really depends which school you\u2019re dispatched at. My mom told me to just do what I enjoy and love the most and the money will come later but I want to look at it in reality lol is it possible to pursue both animal science/bio for any sort of animal care taking and art teaching? Do I put all my cards on the table for art or not stress myself too much and just pursue the stable route. (Animal science/Bio) for vet. I apologize if this is all a bit messy, I\u2019m just super excited to keep on moving forward and growing and love to hear everyone\u2019s input! Thanks!! Btw I am aware I need to go to community college before university :) I just need a little nudge to the path of no regret as I have many already.",

      "text": "just because you like it in your free time as a hobby doesn't mean you'll like it with pressures from a boss and deadlines and money and having to do it 5 days a week for 7 hours a day without choice of taking a break (except for using PTO).\n\nalso, just because you like the basic parts of it doesn't mean you'll like the advanced parts.\n\nalso there's always going to be some part of your work that you don't like or is really hard. mature people deal with it. immature people quit when they become disinterested and are in a never-ending pursuit of their \"passion\" (which always fizzles out when they come across an obstacle).\n\nand no offense to your mom, but \"do what you like, money comes later\" is foolish.",

I\u2019m super aware that it\u2019s not going to be all daisies and butterflies.. I\u2019m not sure if you just skimmed through what I wrote but it\u2019s obvious what my mom said is silly lmao. I\u2019m asking for advice and knowledge.",
