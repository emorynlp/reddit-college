  "text": "I am a sophomore and I\u2019ve always done well except I\u2019m having a ton of trouble in my Econ 201 class. I studied for hours and tried to understand the concepts by doing practice problems but the test still went horribly. I did poorly on the first test and instead of asking for help I just studied harder. There are still two more tests in the class so I can still manage to pass if I do well but I\u2019m look for tips so I don\u2019t get another fail.",
