  "text": "I am about to start my final semester of classes towards a degree at one university. However, I just got a fantastic internship opportunity in another state. The problem is that I am unable to take one of these classes in an online form and would be required to be in a face-to-face scenario. Is it possible to enroll as a non-degree seeking student and take that class for a transfer credit towards this degree so that I am able to procure the internship?",

      "text": "Probably. People do that all the time (I teach online and always get a handful of students doing exactly that). \n\nConfirm with your uni that they take transfer credits, especially for your last semester (make sure there isn't a \"residency\" requirement), and make sure that particular class will transfer in and meet the specific requirement.",

              "text": "It's hard to say. First you need to narrow down a few options that offer the class you need online and would be willing to take you. Then go talk with an academic advisor or someone in the department to confirm the class would count.",
