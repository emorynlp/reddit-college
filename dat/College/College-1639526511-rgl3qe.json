  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore and my cumulative gpa is 3.81. Unfortunately, I had a lot of difficult classes this semester, one of them being a 5 credit course which really sunk my gpa. My grading system is on a 4.0 scale and only does letter grades, like only As or Bs, no A+. I can\u2019t figure out the math, but is it still possible to graduate with a 3.9 gpa?",

                              "text": "Yes, it is possible to go over 120 credits, because you can finish the credit hour requirement before you finish your major course requirements.\n\nIn the case that you do... Um... I think you would just change the total number of hours you are expecting from 120 to whatever you think you will end up with. So remaining hours might be 130-57 rather than 120-57. You would also divide your total estimated quality points by this new higher number.\n\nSo yes, taking more classes can mean having more chances to raise your GPA, but you still need to pay for them, and at some point you will need to actually graduate and start getting return on your investment.",
