  "text": "I had an overall horrible college experience, had a breakdown during my early years and almost died and had to be hospitalized in the ICU for a week because of it, absolutely despise everyone in my major and my friends are in other majors, my closest friend which is my sister can\u2019t even make it to the graduation cause she\u2019s doing her masters abroad, and to top it all off, I am a year late because I switched majors and everyone my age has already graduated, which means if I do attend I\u2019ll be surrounded by people younger than me that I absolutely hate lmao. \n\nI don\u2019t regret anything at the moment, but I\u2019m worried I will in the future. If there\u2019s anyone here didn\u2019t attend their graduation and doesn\u2019t regret it, please interact with this to make me feel a little better about my decision",

If you have something else memorable you could do, like have a great day with some friends to personally celebrate, do that. If it\u2019s going to be a forgettable day like any other in bed\u2026 why not go?",
