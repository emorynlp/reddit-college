  "text": "hi!\nits been exactly 3 weeks since i got to college. in highschool, i was shy and didn't have too many friends but was in a tight knit group that got bigger post graduation and over the summer. i knew i wanted college to be different, and for so long, i looked at college as a fresh start. to build a new repuation for myself, to meet new people, and to be known for myself and not the friends i was associated with. i struggle with social anxiety, but i wanted to do anything to work past it and get a strong start to being here, even though i was worried of being in the exact situation i am currently in. the first few days went great! i would be meeting a lot of new people (sometimes with my roomates and sometimes alone) and i would be going out of my comfort zone. i was constantly doing something the first few days, and i was always very social. sometimes i would be intentional to go 'solo' to the dining hall, ask if i could sit with random people, and have a conversation with them. i'd also leave my room door open. i did this going solo for the first week or so. i would say hi to everyone i walked past, and i never said no to plans. as a result of this, i have made a good number of acquaintances but not many friends at all. past the first week, i noticed people quickly form into groups.\n\n\nout of the many people i met, i had a hard time finding people i clicked with or would want to hang out again with. i am not picky with friends, but it's hard to find anyone i vibe with. for this reason, i didn't settle into friendships right away. i didn't want to commit to anyone or any groups too early. im still friendly with a lot of these aquaintances and say hi. both of my roomates were able to find their circles and now they have friends they can spend time with, but im always in my dorm alone. i hung out with one of my roomate's friend groups a couple times and while they were great, i felt myself out of place hanging out with them. id love to hang with them every now and then but i'd also like to let my roomate have her own circle/core group and me to have mine. my dorm building (and especially floor) isn't too social and neither is the lounge but ive tried going out where people are. people didn't really go around door to door saying hi and me and my roomates never got to it. i leave the door open here and now but people just walk past. because my roomates are pretty independent (and i respect that and want to branch out), i've been left alone a lot of the time, especially on nights. it sucks because i hear people having fun through the window and hanging out with their friends in dorms. i'm joining clubs here, and have gotten closer with some people from classes (we will go get a meal after class), but no one i really have other than one person and my roomates. i don't really get invited out. its just hit the three week mark and it feels everyone has found their place. the dining hall feels less welcoming to sit in with random people (but maybe its in my head). i'm worried i missed my chance to find a core group, and now groups are getting closer and less welcoming to bring in a new person or that people are less welcoming to be making other friends now they have their circle.\n\nim not really sure what i did wrong! i am feeling like i should've settled in but i have honestly only met a very few amount of people i'd really click with as close friends. i didn't want to commit to people because i knew i'd have a lot more people to meet. i am thinking (and probably will) reach out to two people i met a few weeks ago and ask if they'd like to hang soon. i do feel myself being less social, its just feeling a bit tiring being alone all the time. are these groups set? a lot of people here are just sticking with their roomates but a lot have also branched out. weekends are getting painful and this fear of mine has been taking up a lot of time in my head. i convince myself and then unconvince myself that its fine i haven't found my people or a group, but then i hear crowds of people out my window walking past, and then again i get worried and stressed i haven't found a group. im just worried i somehow missed the deadline for joining a group or making friends since people have gotten a bit less desperate and as a result less friendly. i am going to keep going to club meetings and talking to those in my classes. maybe others are in the same boat here but it doesn't feel that way a lot of the time, seeing people hang out in their groups. whatever friendships i have are a bit scattered and would love to have a central group on campus, or even a few more friends i could make plans with and go out with. im seeing some people got lucky and found people to be in a group with on their floor, but mine keeps to itself for the most part. my family tells me to give it time, but what if i never find a group :( if any of you have been in the same boat or have any advice to offer on making friends and finding a group, i'd really appreciate it!!\n\ntldr: i was very social first few days of college, friendly to everyone i meet, made a lot of aquaintances, but had a hard time finding people i vibed with. i have never really said no to plans. three weeks in and i have only one friend and people are starting to form groups and im feeling like they are less frinedly. im getting involved with a few clubs and am working on getting closer to those in my classes. how do i find a group/friends at this point? what should i do?",

      "text": "Firstly, I want you to know that what you are feeling is extremely normal and that I felt the same way as you when I was a freshman. Those people you see in groups who seem really close? They're not as close as you think they are. Many friend groups from the first semester of freshman year will fall apart by virtue of drifting away from each other or realizing they were never that close to begin with. Three of the people I was closest to when I was a freshman I rarely ever talk to now. Your friendships will change greatly throughout your time in college, and there is nothing wrong with that! There is also nothing wrong with not knowing where you quite \"fit\" yet. I'm a junior and I'm *still* finding my place on campus. The difference is, I'm more comfortable and confident in myself since I've been in uni for two years now.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t have any advice but I just wanted to say that I am in such a similar position. The first week of college was so fun and I met and (at least I thought) got along with so many people. But everyone started branching off and now i\u2019m eating alone in the dining hall for half of my meals. I feel like i\u2019m getting more and more isolated too, like the opportunities to meet people are dwindling. Hopefully joining clubs helps out",
