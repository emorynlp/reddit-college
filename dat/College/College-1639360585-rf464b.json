  "text": "i took my college algebra final on tuesday december 7th. the deadline for professors to submit final grades is tonight at 11:59, but my professor still hasn\u2019t posted my grade for the final. my roommate is also in college algebra (but with a different professor) and she got her grade back within two hours of finishing the final. our exam was on a scantron so literally all you have to do is stick it in a machine to grade it. i don\u2019t understand why my professor is taking so long. i\u2019m really concerned that my grade won\u2019t be posted in time because there are only a couple hours left for her to submit my grade. what do i do??",
