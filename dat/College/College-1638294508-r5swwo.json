  "text": "I'm in english 101 and I just fucked up doing online course. I didn't really retain much and did horrible on my essay. At this point if I ace the essay and exam(two things the teacher brags no one has done in her 10+ years) I'll get a 73%. I need at least a 75% to pass to 102 so rn I'm not gonna pass no matter what. Is it gonna look worse to have an f or to have a dropped class?",

If you've made up your mind the course is hopeless, you've got no stress attached to getting a grade. Finish the class, not caring about any assignments or tests, and get a idea idea about what essays, literature, or test subjects you'll have next semester.",

Cuz if you retake this course the next quarter will have different essay/books so it's not a retake.",

If not, you'll receive an F if you just stop showing up because you'll technically still be enrolled.\n\nIf you can't get the W, you might still get a C- or D, which is better than an F. If I were you, I'd see about getting the W unless it messes with your Financial Aid status (you have to complete 75% of the classes you take with letter grades to continue receiving Financial Aid. Usually the first time you drop below 75%, you just get a warning).",
