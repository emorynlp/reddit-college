The F1 is a non-immigrant visa, and if you give them any indication that you intend to try and stay, it will not look good. \n\nFor example - having a long distance partner in America would be grounds for denial, since the implication is that you want to immigrate and settle.\n\nYour essay should outline why you want to come to America and then go back home. An accepted reason is that the college specializes in a certain field, or has an outstanding professor you want to work with. You can speak about wanting to work with American companies in your country, etc. \n\nIn general, outline what education in America would do for you back home - through the lens of business and culture. feel free to DM me about F1 stuff",

No college is worth 60k per year, I learned it the hard way. Essentially international students are subsidizing scholarships and financial aid for domestic students. Don\u2019t let anybody trick you into thinking that paying this much money for college is ok. And there are much less opportunities for international students in the US. The labor market is already so competitive and without citizenship or green card it will be close to impossible to find a job in US if you are not engineering or cs. Many of my friends left the US because they could not find a job here and were forced to leave. If you don\u2019t have a clear path to a citizenship or a green card but please understand that you will most likely not find an employment here. If you can afford to pay 60k for college rather invest that money and choose a cheaper country to study.",

We do want to spread that knowledge fast and wide, but we want some to return here either immediately, or after returning to your home country to apply your lessons, and then returning with unique experiences to teach others new applications.\n\nThis is true not just of countries, but companies, where graduates go off to become doctors and engineers in a field, and then return to academia with knowledge that cannot be found in a classroom to build, grow, and adapt academia to the real world with each new generation of graduates. \n\nThis is one reason for the high quality of the US university system to begin with, the seasoned professional returning to teach.",

However a lot of international students come from extremely wealth families. \n\nAlready rich international students, taking a bulk of the opportunities from current, sometimes less privileged residents doesn\u2019t 100% sit right with me. \n\nAt the same time, its not fair that international students are mostly taken advantage of by the university to make extra income, but then are expected to go back home right after.  \n\nSo honestly I\u2019m completely conflicted but thats something you can right about.",

This way you can establish citizenship and gain a U.S. passport too. (Although Canada would still be the best passport to have) \n\nBest of luck!",
