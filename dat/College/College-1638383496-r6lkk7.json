  "title:": "Advice for a CS Junior who switched late",
  "text": "Hey guys,\n\n(this post is aimed towards experienced CS majors)\n\nLong story short, I switched to CS last semester (4th semester sophomore year). **I am seeking advice on how to maximize my next 3 semesters in college given the following information**:\n\n**THE GOOD:**\n\n\\- I will be helping with a small start up some student made next semester\n\n\\- I have a SWE internship next summer as well (not for a huge company, but its not a startup either)\n\n\\- I am an e-board member for a CS club currently\n\n\\- I am attending 2 hackathons before this semester ends\n\n\\- I am currently working on a personal project and learning through udemy\n\n\\- I will be pursuing internships and research during my senior year\n\n**THE BAD:**\n\n\\- I have a 3.16 GPA (poor study habits as a business major in my earlier years, but I will increase it as the semesters come and go)",
