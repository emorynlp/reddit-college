  "text": "I am an upcoming senior in high school and I am torn\nbetween 3 career paths. Obviously I know you guys\ncan't make the decision for me, but help/advice would\nbe much appreciated!\n1- Nurse Pros- Only a bachelor degree (straight into the\nfield), nice schedule, would preferably work nicu/1&d\nCons- Very competitive to get into, lots of nurses\ncomplain about getting burnt out, most schools I want\nto apply to don't have nursing as a major.\n2- Physicians assistant Pros- Easier major for\nundergrad, would want to work in derm, like the field\nCons- Grad school (debt and very competitive)\n3. Speech Language Pathologist Pros- Easier major for\nundergrad, nice schedule, Cons- Grad school (debt and\ncompetitive), field isn't as diverse, not as much\nmedicine based\nThis is my first time posting on reddit and i'm on my\nphone so sorry if the format is weird! Thank you!",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think undergrad is easy for PA. Most schools have so many prerequisites, more then medical schools. However , you are right , it is highly competitive. Statically more competitive then medical schools. For PA school , you also need tons of hours of patient experience. Speech language pathologist undergrad might be easier and it has really high job prospect.\nI\u2019m sure you know this already but I\u2019ll rank these three based on some aspects.\n\nFor job prospect and growth\n1.\tPA\n2.\tI would say SLP\n3.\tNursing (it\u2019s third compared to the other two but has better job prospect than majority of the careers out there , it\u2019s booming right now due to the pandemic)\n\nFor salary\n1.\tPA (no question, they make around 110k)\n2.\tVery close but for SLP (~80k)\n3.\tRN (~75k)\n\nFor undergrad major (1 being hardest)\n1.\tRN (since it\u2019s directly nursing, it will be hard)\n2.\tPA (lots of prerequisites, will probably have to take on a bio major or so)\n3.\tSLP (less prerequisites but there are a few)\n\nBang for buck\n1.\tPA (you can make around 110k in six years . You can also change your field easily and work In a different it there is burnout)\n2.\tRN (if passionate about nursing then you would make the same money as a SLP but in four years)\n3.\tSLP (great job prospect and growth but a lot of years of debt for a low salary job.\n\nGood luck",

              "text": "Ahh I see but you don\u2019t need to get into a pre-pa program to attend PA school so that shouldn't really a factor. Just choose a major you enjoy, (bio, chem, psych) being the common ones and look up pre reqs for the school and incorporate them into your degree plan. I would assume a major like biochem would already cover all pre reqs !",
