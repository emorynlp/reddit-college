  "text": "I am an upcoming senior in high school and I am torn\nbetween 3 career paths. Obviously I know you guys\ncan't make the decision for me, but help/advice would\nbe much appreciated!\n1- Nurse Pros- Only a bachelor degree (straight into the\nfield), nice schedule, would preferably work nicu/1&d\nCons- Very competitive to get into, lots of nurses\ncomplain about getting burnt out, most schools I want\nto apply to don't have nursing as a major.\n2- Physicians assistant Pros- Easier major for\nundergrad, would want to work in derm, like the field\nCons- Grad school (debt and very competitive)\n3. Speech Language Pathologist Pros- Easier major for\nundergrad, nice schedule, Cons- Grad school (debt and\ncompetitive), field isn't as diverse, not as much\nmedicine based\nThis is my first time posting on reddit and i'm on my\nphone so sorry if the format is weird! Thank you!",
