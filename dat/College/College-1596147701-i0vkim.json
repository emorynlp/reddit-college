  "text": "This is directed at US college students but may apply elsewhere.\n\nMany students won\u2019t be going back to school in person this year and may be attending virtually from home. If this is the case you need to consider where you will be to vote. \n\nIf you are back home with parents or away from school but are registered to vote at your school address you should either change your voter registration or request and absentee ballot. You may also want to consider where your vote will count most toward the issues you care about and if you are in a swing state.\n\nAnd if you aren\u2019t yet registered to vote, please go do so! It\u2019s so easy. Don\u2019t give me that \u201cI\u2019ll do it later B.S. either, you won\u2019t. Do it now.\n\nhttps://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote\n\nEdit: list of swing states thanks u/scarf229slash64\n\n\nFor the presidential election: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, Ohio\n\nSenate: Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Montana, Maine, Georgia, Alaska\n\nEven if you aren't in one of these states, your vote matters! There are lots of competitive house races even in solid blue/red states, not to mention local races that have an even more direct impact on the community",

I\u2019m not in a swing state. I\u2019m trying to decide whether it is even worth it to vote considering my vote isn\u2019t that valuable and spending that money could cost me a week of groceries. \n\nI got married a few months back. He became abusive immediately and I got divorced. My legal name is my married name. Since the divorce happened so fast I never got the chance (or funds) to change my name on my drivers license. I\u2019m well aware this is illegal, but I still haven\u2019t found the money for it. It will cost $10 to get my divorce certificate and I\u2019ll have to go wait in line at the social security office in the middle of a pandemic as well as my boyfriend and I both having to take off work so he can drive me because there\u2019s no public transportation and I lost my wallet with my drivers license. I\u2019m torn on what to do. I would like to vote but it costs money and I can\u2019t help but feel like not being able to afford food for the week in order to vote in a heavily red state is not worth it.",

He claimed that he wants the election be in November, but that that mail-in voting would be a disaster (for him).  \n\nMods, feel free to take this down if it's too political. I understand, but this discussion needs to happen where even the non-political oriented students can see it.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?  Can we trust our own government with mail-in voting?  I'm planning on voting by mail, but I don't want to November 3rd to roll around and \"Surprise, we're not counting these votes.  Too late for you to go in person.\"",

I would strongly suggest dropping off absentee ballots yourself if at all possible (I know it may not be if you're in a different state \u2013 for me, it's just a couple hour drive so while inconvenient, I'm going to try and drop it off in the mailbox in person. Still beats waiting in line in person and potentially catching covid.)",

I'm much more left leaning and consider myself a liberal mostly. She says it should only be military members who are out of the country that vote in absentee because apparently the load of ppl voting absentee this year will fuck trump over. She also thinks that coronavirus is completely political and that it will magically disappear once the election ends. I'm not really sure where she gets this idea, but whatever. Personally, I think we should be more worried about Russian or other country interference in favor of Trump bc I don't like him at all and to my knowledge (someone pls provide sources and correct me if i'm wrong) Trump had the aid of Putin in the 2016 elections. Also, I think the electoral college is bullshit and we should abolish it completely instead of worrying about the mail in ballots.",

Doing this will decrease the burden on USPS and increase the odds of your ballot being counted.
