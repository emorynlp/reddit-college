  "text": "I'm a former admissions counselor for big university in Texas. I've always been curious about what makes students choose a school versus another. Is it location? Prices? Feeling of fit?\n\nA big debate in higher education dwells on how to properly communicate with millennials, or younger generations. The perceived problem is that high school age students do not pay attention to adults. I have always been a proponent that the problem lies with the adults. I don't think we properly communicate. The burden of communicating effectively lies with the adults. It's not that the students are not paying attention, is that the adults do not know how to talk to students. \n\nAs part of my final project, I am conducting research on different marketing tactics used in higher education. Emails, paper mail, phone calls, Zoom meetings, in-person meetings... Which one is the most effective way to communicate, and why? I am using the Elaboration Likelihood Model as a theory to explain the phenomena. \n\nI am collecting research via a survey. If you are in currently attending college you can fill out the survey, and it will help me out immensely. Here is the link:  [https://ttucomc.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_eOPx8Be8HDaXEjQ](https://ttucomc.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eOPx8Be8HDaXEjQ). The answers are anonymous and I am more than happy to share my paper and the results of the survey! \n\nWhat do y'all think is the most powerful marketing tactic used by universities??",
