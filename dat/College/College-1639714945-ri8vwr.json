  "text": "I want everyone to know that ProctorU will flag for eye movement. With that said, the camera angle changes once test taker is connected to the proctor.  Surroundings and body position appear mirrored. I never look at myself while taking the exam, but after the incident was reported and I received a 0 on the exam, I simply cannot accept it. \nEye movement doesn't implicate academic dishonesty, yet here I am facing that at 34- never cheated on an exam before and here is the kicker..I made a 72! Why would anyone cheat for a C. \nI am going through the process of filing a grievance.  It is unfortunate and psychologically exhausting. I won't stop until I get justice. Any tips? Send them my way. \nI'm at an impasse with the professor. \nI signed up for a testing session to record my findings.\nAnyone that uses ProctorU can likely confirm that.",

      "text": "I have had Respondus tank my grade mostly for freezing and ruining my exams.\n\n\nThese softwares are archaic, invasive, and need to be done away with. Even if a class is done online, there is no reason exams cannot be proctored in person. Deferring to these crappy programs instead of that, now that it is KNOWN that they are ridden with glitches and faults, is honestly just laziness on the part of the college.",
