Because they had to explain title IX, instead of just telling us what counts as rape or sexual assault, they had kids from the state school come and put on a play about a girl who gets sexually assaulted by a friend and then did character Q&A after. The acting was surprisingly good, but the lines were so cringy, I had to keep myself from laughing. \n\nThe professors said if anything wanted to leave they could but idk if people left because they found it cringey or if they were legitimately triggered. \n\nI transferred to the state school my second year and when it came time for them to explain title IX, we literally just got a brochure and were told where to get condoms if we needed any. For reference, the Catholic school didn\u2019t give out condoms and you weren\u2019t allowed to have opposite sex overnight visits. they could refer us to a health organization, albeit a lot of the ones on the list they gave were crisis pregnancy centers.",

You make three squares. The first square you ask people to draw or write down their past successes. Second square is personal challenges or opportunities for growth. Third square is their vision for the future. Everyone gets three minutes for each square. Then you go around the room and each person talks through their squares in one minute or less. Then later on in the day we do the exercise again, but it's for the team and not the individual. Puts everyone on an equally vulnerable playing field and leads to real connection. It's much better doing it than the explanation I gave here.",
