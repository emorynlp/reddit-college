  "text": "Hello! I hope everyones day is going well.\n\nI (16m) am currently on my last 2 years of high school genuinely hating every second of it. The constant stress over getting good grades on every single subject (relevant to the field I want to study or not) is destroying my mental health, this has led me to question if I even WANT to go to college, especially with the fact that in this current time experience is being prioritized over qualifications.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a degree in written arts and is it worth stressing for another 4 years of my life?",
