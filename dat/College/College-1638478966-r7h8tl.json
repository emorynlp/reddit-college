  "text": "So my gpa in my 1st year was pretty awful. Well below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. I've managed to improve it each year and in my third year, I got a 3.5 (but only about 3.0 cumulative). I'm in my 4th year now and I'm managing to stay around 3.6. However my cumulative gpa is still much lower\n\nIf I wanted to put my gpa on a resume, should I just not bother because my cumulative is mediocre, or somehow include my gpa from my final 2 years",

      "text": "You could always put your major GPA, which will be higher since you say you did well in your last 2 years and those are really only major courses by that point. But tbh, someone who put their major GPA but not cumulative is a telling sign they didn't give a shit about their GEs. But you totally can.\n\nWhat major are you? The rule is typically only put GPA at 3.5 and above, but it depends on major as well. CS and EE are quite hard, I could get behind someone putting a 3.0 cum and major GPA on their resume for that. If you're like a coms major and put that on though, that's going to look bad.",
