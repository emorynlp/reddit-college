  "text": "So my gpa in my 1st year was pretty awful. Well below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. I've managed to improve it each year and in my third year, I got a 3.5 (but only about 3.0 cumulative). I'm in my 4th year now and I'm managing to stay around 3.6. However my cumulative gpa is still much lower\n\nIf I wanted to put my gpa on a resume, should I just not bother because my cumulative is mediocre, or somehow include my gpa from my final 2 years",
