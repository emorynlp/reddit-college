  "title:": "How strict are profs with word counts? Is this reasonable?",
  "text": "I had a discussion post assignment that asked for 200 words. It said in the requirements to avoid going over 200 words, but that we could go over by a little without penalty. Anyways, I took this to mean that I should avoid going over 200 words, and that the word count requirement was not extremely strict.\n\nThis discussion post assignment was pass/fail, so you can either get a 0 or 100. \n\nI wrote 198 words. She gave me a 0 because I didn't meet the 200 word requirement. I put a lot of work into writing my discussion post well, and it was all just a waste of time and effort because of two words. I sent her an email explaining my situation and how I didn't realize she wanted EXACTLY 200 words (nowhere in the requirements did she clearly say we needed EXACTLY 200 words). She replied saying there were no exceptions, so I'm stuck with a 0 on this assignment.\n\nThe ironic thing is that this was for a creative writing class, and the content of my writing had no bearing in the mark but writing exactly 200 words did.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people telling me to take it higher up, but I'm not going to bother. The end of the semester is coming up and I'm pretty stressed out already. It did upset me but I'm just gonna move on. Thanks guys",

I emailed, asking where 600 was a minimum, so I could be sure I read future assignments more carefully for those details. Instead of replying, the professor sent an email to the class about how being concise was a sign of respect... It was over 600 words. Over the course of the semester she sent repeated and ever more escalating passive aggressive emails to the whole class over inane stuff. I called her a pedantic nitwit during reviews and that got back to her (anonymously). The email after that was several pages and went into insane detail about proper comma usage and stating she was not pedantic. Much of the final was about those emails and not the class. I missed a 4.0 by a hundredth of a point and she wouldn't round up. 91.99 is not a 92.",

Semantics allows for home to be a person, for me, because of my background. My husband is home. A pedantic person would probably whine and cry until they had that person's home address and insist that a home is a structure because that's what the dictionary says.

This would be an abuse. \n\nWith that said, OP should first talk about it with the Prof. If that doesn\u2019t work, then they consider the size of the unit. If it\u2019s a small program at a large university or a small university, the Dean is perhaps appropriate. If it\u2019s a larger program, the department chair is most appropriate, followed by the Dean, then the provost (or equivalent). University governance is also an avenue as well. \n\nI did a lot of work in governance during my time in undergrad, this is by far one of the most ridiculous things I\u2019ve heard of someone failing an assignment for. If it\u2019s material to your grade, fight this OP. You were wronged, their assignment and expectations aren\u2019t clear, and this is a power trip.\n\nEdit: and to your other comments about being a grader, I can\u2019t speak to your standards. For me,  it\u2019s 198 words of quality versus two words of verbal filler (let\u2019s be real that\u2019s all it would take), I\u2019d rather have concise and quality than two superfluous words that add nothing other than extra reading time.",

That is on top of a 5 to 20 page paper almost weekly. I'm assuming you are in the first year or two, but things to look forward to if you keep going long enough.\n\nAt under 200 words, I would probably grade you petty as well, honestly. Because now you will never go under the minimum again and always go over a little next time, right?\n\nIn the first few years of school, you will get graded on what I like to think of as \"good habit requirements\" rather than on how creative or in depth you are.\n\nBut if you lose the battle, win the war on future assignments with a lesson learned.\n\nBy the way, this is two hundred words.",

Assume they\u2019re trying to fuck you up. It was clear to me what they wanted just from reading your post here. And for the future, 200 words is typically the standard for those sorts of discussions, universally across courses.\n\nThis isn\u2019t high school, the instructors often don\u2019t see you ever again after the semester, and they usually don\u2019t have any vested interest in you passing or succeeding. They just want you to follow their instructions, do what you\u2019re told, and learn something in the process. \n\nI\u2019ve been plenty of pissed off at plenty of instructors. You don\u2019t go to the dean unless something serious is going on. Just keep your head down and keep on trucking. A few more discussion posts and the impact to your grade disappears.

I have some professors that do discussion posts, some don't care about the length of responses and some give a suggestive word count but won't deduct points if your short.\n\nIf I was a professor, I wouldn't care how short or long your answer is. As long as you get you point across.",

In the real world, you need results, and if you don't have the results, you need a good reason why.\n\nIn this day in age, when people get relatively easy tasks, like 200 word essays, and you mess up a critical detail, even to a small degree, it is the teachers responsibility to either develop you into a better person, or give you a pass and you will fail in the real world.\n\nI wouldn't sweat the 0. If it was a small mistake on your part, learn from it, and grow. Some people, especially teachers who are responsible for churning out quality students, will be \"strict.\" It's always about the principle, it's nothing personal.\n\n\nIf I were the teacher, and someone emailed me begging for the points, or were upset with me, that would tell me that student is not going to be successful in my class, or in life after they get their degree, if when given deadlines and requirements, and they are ignored or not executed on.\n\n\n\nEither this an oops on your part, and if it is, fuck it. Just one grade.\n\nOr, this is a pattern for you and this \"discilpine\" will create better behaviors. Resulting in a teacher who is succeeding.\n\n\n\nI'm saying this as someone that literally had to drop tla course this semester, because my teacher would TAKE DOWN assignments ON the due date, in order to encourage us to not \" procrastinate\". Sure, that's fucking masochistic. But guess what, the lesson they've taught me, that when given specific requirements, that they are specified because THATS what you're getting graded on as well, stuck with me.\n\nHope you find this useful and don't see it as \"everything does everything for reasons you can't understand, deal with it.\" Reading your edit you seem more mature than most on this sub. but understand  a Principle, getting paid 250k a year, would literally fucking cringe at the idea of a student, who factually DID NOT do what was needed, complaining they didn't get the grade they thought they deserved. Not only would it go anywhere, how can THEY fairly discipline the teacher, if you legitimately didn't hit the word count.\n\nThe only real exception would be if multiple other students had less words, got better than 0, and there was a pattern.",

              "text": "You have no idea how discussions are weighted for this class. I have had classes weight discussions anywhere from 5% to 40% of my overall grade. Assuming that a 100 point discussion would be inconsequential to this persons grade is naive. My post said contact the instructor first. If her instructions are as contradictory as OP claims then OP is likely not the only victim here and it should be brought to the professors attention. I would bring it to the dean based off principality. Professors are expected to grade based off of the rubric/instructions/guidelines provided and if any of such are contradictory it must be corrected. Scholarships, grad school, financial aid, and more are on yhe line for many students so maintaining a standard of professionalism for our professors is not \"excessive\".",
