  "text": "To start with, I wasted four years of my life pretending to go to college while I was just lazing about, but I put it on my CV (Travel And Tourism) so I wouldn't have to explain my gap. It's worked so far, since no when checks it because it's not related to the Jobs.\n\nRecently though I've wanted more out of Life, and I'm hoping to go into hairdressing. My mum is a hairdresser and I've always enjoyed it. The only thing stopping me from classes is the difficulty of getting employed as a hairdresser, as well as my no degree showing up (it would be at a different college) but I must ask, is it worth it?",
