  "title:": "Can\u2019t decide what school I want to go to",
  "text": "The school I want to go to has an average cost after aid of $15,000. Is that cheap compared to the average school cost after aid? There\u2019s another school closer to home with only $10k average cost after aid. I\u2019m almost done with my associates, and I can\u2019t decide between the two. The $15k average cost after aid school has a gymnastics gym near by. They also have a gymnastics team. Im passionate about gymnastics and I can see myself going to that school. The other doesn\u2019t. Aside from that I would also like to take foreign language classes ( not In my degree plan ) for fun at the school of $15k average tuition after aid the other one doesn\u2019t foreign language classes. 2 hours 21 minutes vs 1 hour. Zero debt. I just don\u2019t want to get into debt and regret it later. I do have over  $30k in liquid cash. Easy No brainer?",
