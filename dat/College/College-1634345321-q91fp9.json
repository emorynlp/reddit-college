  "text": "I\u2019m a biology major and I\u2019m currently taking bio 1 with lab. In my lab, I currently have an 84, which I\u2019m confident I can bring up to an A. \n\nWhat I\u2019m worried about is what my professor just emailed our class a few hours ago. We did our midterm exam last week online. And someone, in the classes groupme, randomly sent something about the exam (I don\u2019t know what it was exactly because when I looked at groupme 15 minutes later it had already been deleted). All I saw were the reactions of people leaving the chat and saying not to do that. \n\nMy professor emailed us saying that all people who were in the chat automatically can only make a 50% maximum on a new midterm which we will take in person at the end of the semester. Today is the last day to withdraw a class at my school. I don\u2019t think I can pull off a decent grade with my midterm that bad. I\u2019m also pissed because I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong all I did was be in a class group chat and someone decided to ruin it for everyone.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m planning on going to vet school and I need an A in this class. Does a withdraw or a C, with a possible retake, look worse on my transcript? Any advice would be much appreciated.",

      "text": "Wow. That's a crappy situation. \n\nHonestly, I'd talk it over with your professor. Don't worry about dropping, just go to his office hours or whatever and speak to him. If he's reluctant, then ask him to try you. You studied, you did your part, you show the procedure and your knowledge. Stand by your achievement and if it goes haywire, maybe you can talk with the director of the department and ask of you can retake the class to bring up the grade. Likewise, speak with your academic counselor regarding the issue.",
