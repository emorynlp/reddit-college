  "text": "I\u2019m 100% against these organizations existing because I feel like they are clubs where you can only join if you: \n- have good looks.\n- have tons of money.\n- have a certain outlook on life where you think you\u2019re above everyone else.\n- basically if you fit a certain demographic.\n\nNot only that, these organizations pick and choose who gets to be a part of the fun and who doesn\u2019t, and I assume that those who don\u2019t get chosen take hits to their self-esteem. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning the countless sexual assaults, rapes, and other horrible things that happen at obnoxious frat parties. Why do college campuses tolerate this? Why allow these organizations that cause more harm than good (if any)?",

      "text": "Well, Freedom to Associate is a basic human right in America. You have the right to be friends with whom you wish, hang out with them however and whenever you like, and not be forced to invite people you don\u2019t like. Fraternities and sororities are social clubs and are protected by the right of Freedom of Association.\n\nUniversities like them because 1) they add an exciting social life to campus. Lots of students look forward to partying in school, and fraternity and sororities provide that environment. 2) Greek life encourages rituals and traditions that connect students to campus life. By endearing students and fomenting a sense of nostalgia, greek life produces engaged alumni. 3) greek alumni are some of the largest donors to universities. Because of the strong networking and preexisting privilege, the greek system produces a disproportionate share of wealthy alumni donors.",

      "text": "It much cheaper than living on campus in a lot of cases. For me it\u2019s $2k a semester for the house bill. This includes rent, dues, utilities, food, cook\u2019s salary, etc. it\u2019s less than half the price of room and board. Fraternities where I go are very inclusive, my frat has had plenty of gay and transgender, and minority brothers. Our parties are also much safer than dangerous unregulated house parties. We have multiple sober brothers monitoring each event, and have people sign a contract that includes the fact we will turn them into the police if they try anything belligerent, and we reserve the right to remove them from the premises with any force necessary if rules are violated. We also do not bid people who generalize specific groups of people, it\u2019s wrong under all circumstances and we don\u2019t tolerate that bigotry. To get a bid, show up to events and be a decent human being, that\u2019s all.",

It was an academic fraternity though, so I thankfully never got to see the horrors of frat parties. \n\nI know Greek life has its problems that need to be addressed, and I personally didn\u2019t get anything positive out of it, but I know that many have, so I can\u2019t say that frats/sororities need to be outright eliminated. It feels selfish to push for something like that.",

We attempt to choose people who have a growth mindset, share common interests with us, and would be kind to others.\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that sexual assault occurs outside of greek life.

I managed to pull a 0.0 in my last semester and left school for years. There were parties all the time, a lot of social pressure to drink, guilted into not studying when I should have. Really just a nightmare.\n\nHowever, my nephew is in one now. It's an Asian-based but inclusive fraternity, and he (non-Asian) and his non-Asian friend pledged, went through that whole thing, but now he's pretty happy and proud of it. he's been the PR chair and has gotten a lot of graphic design experience. Their social outlets revolve around team gaming, not drinking contests. It's been a really stabilizing experience for him.\n\nSo although fraternity life messed me up, I take the blame for it, and it's been really positive for my nephew, so I can't condemn it outright. I think (social) fraternities like his are pretty rare though.",
