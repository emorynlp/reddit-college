  "title:": "Question about asking for a recommendation",
  "text": "So, I\u2019m planning on applying for some research programs for this summer and they pretty much all require 2 letters of recommendation. One of those should be pretty easy to secure, as I\u2019m going to ask my current professor/research advisor. However, the other professor I was planning on asking is not in my department (professor for a gen ed), and I haven\u2019t had a class with her since last semester (Sprinf 2021). However, I was in her office hours quite frequently for help with papers and I got an A+ in her class so I felt like she would be a good recommender.\n\nSince I don\u2019t have a class with her this semester, I\u2019m not quite sure what her office hours are (although I can probably find out if I ask around a bit). However, given that we\u2019re getting close to finals and I know her class has both a final and a paper due in close succession (since I took it last semester), I didn\u2019t want to take up some of the time that could be spent with her current students. I also didn\u2019t want to just to her office completely unexpected.\n\nSo I emailed her instead, although I know that\u2019s not exactly the preferred method to ask for a recommendation. However, in my email I did specify I\u2019d like to meet with her either virtually or in person to work out details and things like that.\n\nI sent her an email on Saturday night, which was still over Fall Break, so obviously I didn\u2019t expect her to respond quickly. However, now that it\u2019s Monday, I\u2019m wondering exactly how long I should wait before either sending a follow-up email or dropping into her office hours, if I don\u2019t receive a response. I probably sound a bit impatient but I\u2019m just trying to figure out timeframes given that finals are coming up and all that.\n\nFor reference, the earliest deadline for these programs is in mid-January (around the 11th off the top of my head). I recognize I\u2019m probably asking a little late for the recommendations, but I really didn\u2019t get this all sorted out until Fall Break.\n\n**Tl;dr: Sent a professor an email for a recommendation on Saturday, wondering how long I should wait (if no response) before I send a follow-up or go to office hours**\n\nIf you\u2019d like any clarifications, let me know and I\u2019ll try to add them.",

      "text": "Fine to ask a prof in another department. Because of your high grade and your office visits, you should be remembered. Some professors won't respond to emails over the weekend. So start your impatience with today. Wait until at least Wednesday. You could also call the department secretary/coordinator of that professor and ask what the professor's office hours are. The professor also might have a phone number listed on their web page, so after Wednesday you could also call (even though students rarely do that). Good luck. You are asking in PLENTY of time for a letter that needs to be done by mid-January.",
