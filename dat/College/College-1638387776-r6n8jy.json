  "text": "I am a senior in college and I want to change my career path. I have been putting off these throughs for a while because I didn't know what to do, but now I have realized I don't want to continue on the career path I have been taking classes for all throughout college. I want to do something in tech, but I have no experience in the field and don't know what to do. I also don't want to do another 4 years of school. Is there something I can do to fast-track a computer science degree? I might take a gap year between undergrad and law school, so is there a 1 or 2 year program I can take to get a degree in computer science? I seriously need help. Thanks.",
