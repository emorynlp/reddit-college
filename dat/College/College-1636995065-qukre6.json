  "text": "Got a 0 on a midterm. Noticed that I uploaded the wrong file so before she could grade it or upload solutions online, I emailed her asking if I could email her the PDF of the exam. She has a recording of me doing the exam and scanning it. I sent her receipts of the times I had uploaded it and scanned it (thank you scannable). Yet, she didn\u2019t answer me. This morning (5 days later) during lecture, she  says she can\u2019t do anything because she already uploaded the solutions\u2026 this morning\u2026 even though I sent her receipts as proof I didn\u2019t change anything and I can even screen record me retrieving the fucking exam and uploading it to show I didn\u2019t change shit.",

You might have to look outside of the teaching faculty for guidance like an ombudsman or Student Affairs office.",
