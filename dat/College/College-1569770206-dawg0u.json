  "text": "I go to a big state school and going out 3 days a week is almost normal here.  I truly don't understand it.  I usually go out once a week and even that can be exhausting for me.  I have a super heavy workload and all I want to do on the weekends is relax.  How do people have the stamina to go out that often and still get decent grades??",

Nothing wrong with having fun every once in a while, but I think a lot of people who aren't responsible for paying for their own tuition are losing sight of why they're really in college.",

I look forward to watching tv and lounging around all weekend long now. Every time that my friends try to get me to go out it just sounds so exhausting. I think people just grow out of the phase, or never are much into it in the first place and that\u2019s completely fine. I find that when i force myself to go out, I just think about how nice it would be if i was at home sitting on my couch wrapped up in a blanket and watching a show. Everyone is different and that\u2019s totally okay. It\u2019s nice that you can balance staying in and going out right now because i can barely make myself go out even once a week!",

I majored in Accounting + Business Law and would often meet up with Nursing, Engineering, Liberal Arts, Pre-Med and many others. These people didn't go out because they had easy schedules but because they knew how to organize their schedules and gave themselves the time to go out, as did I. I woke up early, went to class and studied all day so that most days past 9pm I had finished all the work I needed to (barring Exam weeks).\n\nIf you want to go out that often- make the time to do it, it's easier said than done but possible nonetheless. You should enjoy your college experience. I prioritize my friends and my happiness and had an amazing experience because of it. My grades could have been better but in 10 years will a degree with Cum Lade be more valid than one without it? \n\nGood luck with your studies friend and feel free to pm if you ever need advice.",

My first four semesters were nothing but 18 credits, work, and one or two academic-related organizations. Then my junior year I let up a bit with 15 credits both semester, once semester of which was abroad, so I did a decent amount of going out then too. Now in my senior year, I am in 12 credits, I picked my schedule very carefully with my senior priority (Only have class from 1-4pm on Monday-Thursday), and I can really enjoy the 3 day weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention as a senior I actually have friends who I can go out with and am 21!",

As for the people who do, what constitutes \"decent grades\" is relative, as is the difficulty of different course loads and different universities. Some disciplines require a huge amount of reading or work outside of class, and the amount of time that takes someone will vary. For example, a reading-heavy social science or humanities class or an upper-level, proof-based math or physics class would take me a lot of time to do the work, certainly a lot more than something like intro-level science and calculus classes.\n\nSo, how much free time someone has after putting in the requisite amount of work to get \"decent grades\" in their course will vary a ton; some people choose to use that time to party, and others might choose to use it differently. At the end of the day, all this boils down to personal preference.",

In reality we have finite amount of time every term in College. \n\nThose that party hard alot of the time what are they giving up (they have the same amount of time everyday as you do). Sleep, class time, study time, work time, ECs, each of these has a time-cost associated. \n\nThe ones that do this the best (they do exist) can study with extreme efficiency! intelligent! Extremely organized, and have quite social network. Never put yourself down because your not like them. They are rare individuals that make up a small minority (under 1%). \n\nTip: do everything as its the ideal time to learn time management that carries on to later in life. Everyone learns this at different rates.",

Partying is exhausting. You're right school should be a full-time job and that very reason alone is precisely why it will take a majority of your time. And when you graduate and find a job, will you still be able to sustain your routine? As there is a peak in the desire to party in your college years, that desire will decline when you leave. And good luck trying to keep your friends with you when you want to party, they'll start to have busy schedules and can't keep up with the party lifestyle. In short, it isn't sustainable, and as much as you want to it to be, consider if you want to continue pursuing your studies. I know college is the part where people are trying to figure out what they want to do in life, but don't let your grades drop because you choose to let free and drink a hefty amount of booze. You have the independence and freedom of choice to do what you wish right now, it's worth asking yourself how you're going to deal with that. Don't let the decisions you make wish you can turn back the clock because that's when you know you could've made a better decision.",

It's much better to just get some friends together and sit around a table at a bar.   \nObviously, the amount of work you have to do will affect how often you can actually do this.   \n\n\nI had a pretty difficult major (actuarial science), and for me it was just a manner of time management. If you plan out your week ahead of time, you can essentially schedule your fan. It sounds a bit restrictive at first, but I found it super helpful. As far as maintaining stamina goes, consistently going to bed at the same time each night helps a lot. Going to bed at midnight every night is a lot better for you than going to bed at 10 one night and 2am the next.",

Those classes, at least at my school, usually consist of College Algebra, Intro to Business, Computer Competency, and Composition 1. It definitely gets harder quickly, but that first semester, for most people, is not going to be a very heavy course load.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, older business majors? The ones I've met, even the ones taking fewer hours than I am, definitely have a lot more coursework than I do. I'll also add that, at least at my University, the Business majors also have higher standards to stay in the honors college. Their scholarships are harder to get and harder to keep. And because of their degree requirements, high school concurrent and AP credit doesn't go as far for them.",

It's not the engineering classes that are an issue either- it's the RA stuff that takes all the time. \n\nBut my point still stands: some people can do it all, but most can't. For them, there is a trade-off. \n\nAlso, while my engineering classes really aren't that bad, they're definitely a good bit more work than *freshman* business and gen Ed classes. They're also more work than freshman engineering classes as well. I only specified freshman because that's most likely what OP is. \n\nAnd I do have a lot of respect for business majors. It's a very solid choice of major. But after talking to every student on my floor, I can pretty safely say that the freshman business majors with 12 hours definitely have less workload than the comp sci or pre med majors who, in addition to having more hours, also have more sophomore level classes. This isn't even reserved to STEM: the hardest working guy I've ever seen is Music education and composition double major. \n\nThe dynamic changes later on, but for freshman, I'll stand by my assertion that a lot of (ie not all) business majors have it easier than most.",

Some people can just make excellent use of their time 24/7, but if you\u2019re not already like that don\u2019t try to start keeping up with them, just do what you can and get by at your own pace.\n\nAlso it can be the complete opposite too as I certainly see plenty of kids bombing their grades by going out every night, but those types don\u2019t last long at college anyway.",

Even if all of those were kept equal, don't you think it's kind of bleak that so many people just accept that working life takes away your free time and limits opportunities to socialize? You'll spend many more years working than in college. Shouldn't we seek to arrange our working lives so that the expectations are more humane?",

Then I got my first job:\n\n2007 - Finished Undergrad in Psych and Biology\n\n2008 - $34,500 starting as a recruiter in New Jersey, USA\n\n2010 - $49,000 ending as a recruiter, laid off due to recession\n\n2010 - 2012 - Grad school full time\n\n2012 - $57,000 stating as an Analyst with a consultanting company in Washington DC area, USA\n\n2016 - $75,000 ending as a consultant at the same firm\n\n2016 - $120,000 starting as a Business Analyst in Seattle area, USA\n\n2018 - $185,000 converting to a Business Intelligence Engineer\n\nIf I had to give one peice of advice, it'd be to network with people. I talk to old college friends and co-workers that I haven't spoken to in literally 5-10 years when they are looking for a new job or moving to a new city. Sometimes I refer them to roles at my company, sometimes I connect them with other friends that might be able to help them. I like to think that most people would help someone if explicitly asked provided it's not manual labor :P",
