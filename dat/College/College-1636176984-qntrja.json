  "text": "i don\u2019t know how i got here in life. i feel so far gone and so numb and disassociated. most of my friends from highschool are in their 3rd year of college and i\u2019m still technically a freshman at community college with the credits i have. i had setback after setback when it came to life after highschool but i hate making excuses for myself. how is it that, if i\u2019m so much stronger than other people my age (what people tell me), i can\u2019t do college the right way? how can all these people who haven\u2019t had many struggles or experience in life go to college and be just fine? what does that make me? i have a job that pays really well but this isn\u2019t fulfilling and i feel like i\u2019m not supposed to be at this place in my life. \n\nsomething must have went wrong in the past and set me on the wrong track.\nmy life right now isn\u2019t what i want it to be but i\u2019ve been saying that for a year now. i can\u2019t change anything i feel like i can\u2019t move. any chances i want to make to my lifestyle makes me want to scream even thinking about having to put in all this work and probably still end up falling back into my old ways of being late to everything, skipping appts or classes, eating horribly. why can\u2019t i change? i\u2019ve always and still do have such big visions for my future and my dreams, but can never fucking show it the right way. \n\ni\u2019m frustrated no matter what the fuck i do i\u2019m angry at any and every thing. i\u2019m so alone. why is everyone moving through this part of life so much better than i am? even my friends who go to community college and work, just like me, aren\u2019t bothered by the fact you slowly lose your friends who are away at school and they don\u2019t feel the need to be concerned with the states of their relationships like i always am. sometimes they don\u2019t feel the need to talk to anyone all day or even go out and it makes me mad that i can\u2019t be like that. it\u2019s childish of me. nothing makes sense. \n\ni just need comfort and i need guidance and help but i know no one in my life will understand. \ni need to change my life and have a healthy lifestyle but everything i try just fucking fails. \ni need something or someone. \ni feel so tired and defeated.",

      "text": "I really understand where you're coming from, as I'm in a similar position.\n\nBased on what you wrote, it seems like you compare yourself to other people a lot. I'm going to tell you right now, stop doing that. Stop comparing yourself to other people, because other people's lives will always seem better. What you see in other people's lives are most likely what's on the surface. You never know what problems they might be going through.\n\nInstead, compare yourself with yourself. If you even just simply woke up 30 mins earlier than yesterday, then that's an improvement. Look at yourself from 5 years ago compared to now and see what has improved, then look at yourself 5 years from now and see what you can do to improve.\n\nAlso, everyone is on their own path. Some people go through college nice and easy, some people don't, some people don't go through college at all. Just because you don't seem as \"successful\" with college doesn't mean you're on the wrong path. You just walk through your journey differently than others.\n\nAs for fulfillment, my best advice is to find what is most important to you. What makes you happy long term? Is it having deep relationships with family and friends? Is it serving and helping people through your career? Seek what truly matters in your life, then you will find fulfillment.\n\nI hope my message helps. Stay strong, and don't give up :)",

          "text": "Thankyou so much for taking the time to respond. I think it\u2019s hard for me to compare myself to myself because i don\u2019t even feel like i\u2019m the same person that is sleeping late, not going to class, etc. I just see \u201cmyself\u2019 as so much higher up than that other person. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on I think I\u2019m just ashamed of myself. When it comes to having a different path than others, I\u2019ve heard that a lot before and I know objectively it\u2019s true, but it just doesn\u2019t make me feel better. I feel like since my path is different than a lot of other peoples, that means i\u2019m not going to be as successful as them.",

              "text": "The fact that you said you don't feel like the same person as before is comparing yourself with yourself.\n\nI think what you need is confidence through success. Contrary to what most people think, confidence does not breed success. Success breeds confidence.\n\nJust because someone is confident does not mean they will be successful in something. Instead, having success in something makes you confident.\n\nThe more you do something, the more confident you'll become in that something. The more confident you are from your successes, the less ashamed you will be because you have more things to be proud of.\n\nBeing on a different path than most people doesn't mean you won't be successful. Firstly, you need to define what success is. Being successful means different things to different people.\n\nYou could make a ton of money but lack loving relationships with family. Would you consider that person successful because they make lots of money? If that's the only thing they care about, then yes they are successful. But if they wish that they had spent a little more time with their family instead of making an extra dollar, then they are not successful.\n\nLike I said before, find what matters the most to you. What is absolutely the #1 most important thing in your life? If you were to die tomorrow, what would be the last thing you do? Whatever that thing is, pursue that, and that will most likely make you the happiest long term. And quite honestly, if you're happy, then there's no need to be ashamed or compare yourself with others or worry about success.",

      "text": "Hey. You\u2019re not alone. I dropped out of college after the beginning of my sophomore year and now all my friends are halfway through their junior years while I\u2019m doing my own thing. It\u2019s a scary feeling that can\u2019t be avoided but that scary feeling is gonna be what pushes you to not just lay in bed all day when nobody\u2019s telling you what to do. It\u2019s a positive thing that you have negative feelings when you aren\u2019t where you want to be. As crazy as that is to think about. The most important thing I can say to you is that you are not your thoughts. All these negative thoughts in your head making you feel so terribly about yourself are not you. Isn\u2019t that liberating? Your ego feels threatened and compares yourself to everyone around you that seems like they have it all together when most likely they do not. And that\u2019s fine, there is so much time. Time is gonna teach you everything you need to know when you need to know it through your experiences. Realize this, Everyone is on their own journey. Each person is the main character of their own story and however frustrated and behind you feel you are always in the right place at the right time. There is no sense in comparing yourself to others. Compare yourself to yourself. Motivate yourself by people that are doing what you want to be doing. Life is all about people.\n\nMEDITATE \nSimple as this. Sit on your bed back straight feet on the floor. No phone. Sit with your eyes closed and breathe. Sit there for 5 minutes and just breathe.\n\nBREATH WORK\nYou could potentially not be breathing the right way and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing you to feel nervous worried anxious stressed and tired. Weird right? We overlook out breathing because it\u2019s just automatic most of the time. There are different ways of breathing that make you feel different ways. Control your breath, control your life. It is that powerful. Deep Belly breathing. Wim Hof method if you can handle that, box breathing for absolutely sure\nEXERCISE\nif you aren\u2019t active get active. Train your body train your mind. Running. Even if you can\u2019t run far fast or for long. 10 minutes. It\u2019s not bad. Go slow, do what feels right. You will hear that negative voice in your head saying I\u2019m tired I wanna stop this sucks. Remember what I told you? You are not your thoughts. Tell that voice to shut the damn hell up and push yourself. This will teach you to keep going when things get hard. Control your breath. Running is absolutely amazing for getting anger out. I related to the anger you feel. Let me tell you nothing absolutely nothing could piss me off after a run. \n\nYou are right where you\u2019re supposed to be",
