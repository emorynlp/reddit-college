      "text": "Life is lonely. It\u2019s hard, then you die. Use this as an opportunity to get to know yourself. Don\u2019t be afraid of doing the things you want by yourself. Just do them. Want to see a movie, eat out, try a hobby? Just do it.\n\nHaving friends is awesome, but only if they\u2019re true friends. How will you know when you meet a true friend of you don\u2019t know what kind of friend you\u2019ll be?\n\nFor you immediate situation, first and foremost - who is financially supporting you? If you\u2019re depending on loans, then cut out everyone toxic in your life and focus on you. If your abusive dad is supporting you, treat him like a pet rather than a person. Do what you need to do to get your money, but stay emotionally detached. Also, work on contingencies for supporting yourself so you no longer feel controlled.\n\n\nA lot of people struggle freshman year. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re dumb or failures. It\u2019s often because they haven\u2019t learned to fight for themselves first. \n\nRemember: the universe doesn\u2019t care. If you don\u2019t look out for yourself, maybe no one will.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry for how you\u2019re feeling :/ it\u2019s hard when the people that are supposed to care and love you, treat you in ways that cause you lots of pain. Cutting off a parent is hard in itself- it is now a fresh wound and over time, it will hurt less and less. It\u2019s okay to be sad and to feel guilt or just be angry- grieve the parent you wish you had and give yourself the space to do so. \n\nAs for your man- a person that you do feel is untrustworthy is not worthy to have around. It\u2019s better to be alone than around people that trigger you negatively, hurt you, or are generally not aligned with what you\u2019re looking for in life. \n\nIt sounds like you need a discovery period to explore who you are free from the negativity of others. There is a power in being alone and once you feel it, you\u2019ll know how profound it can be. Doing things that you once thought you needed someone else to do will give you confidence to know how high your worth actually is. Take yourself on a date, go to places you\u2019ve always wanted to go, and try to be present. All this is very hard to do, at first\u2026 but you are strong and you can do this. In time, you\u2019ll accumulate people around you that fit more accordingly to what you\u2019re looking for in life. For now, give yourself time to heal for the hurt you have been through. A toxic parent can cause lots of havoc internally- rewrite the awful things you\u2019ve been told through the abuse and give yourself a big hug.",
