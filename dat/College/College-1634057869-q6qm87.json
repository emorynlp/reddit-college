  "text": "My 18yr old just started attending a city college this fall.  She isn't really into it and has asked me if she can skip out on school this semester.  Keep in mind her classes have already started and she was dropped from one because of absences.  she has a D in one classes.  She currently is taking 12 units for this fall semester.  The math class that she was dropped from will be fulfilled next semester.  My question is:  if she dropped all her classes this semester and takes the same ones again next semester, hoping she gets better grades, will this move help her GPA? What are the reprocussions of dropping classes as far as her record and  being able to transfer to a STATE OR UNIVERSITY COLLEGE? Will this lower her chances even if she gets better grades on the exact same classes she dropped?  Please give me some facts/advise.",

      "text": "One thing I'd warn you about: dropping classes *could* impact her ability to get financial aid. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is usually evaluated by you completing 66% of your credits taken, and keeping above a certain GPA threshold. Some universities will consider that yearly, some by semester. At the least, it could make things harder next time around, so I'd make sure to review the university's policies just to make sure it won't bite you. \n\n\nWithdrawing shouldn't hurt her GPA though, as the other user noted.",

      "text": "If she's asking to skip school this semester, I'd be terribly weary about her going next semester. What's going to change?\n\nI think certain people need a gap year (or a few) to really excel and know the value of college. \n\nIf she's not feeling college right now, I would suggest supporting her through not going to college and looking for a job. A gap year is preparatory for college and for some it's an incredibly important thing for them to experience. If she's been living with you rent free, continue that. Don't change anything to make her think she's being punished because that's horse shit. \n\nThere's two things that can happen. Either she'll get jobs, work them and want to go back to college or she'll find something she likes and stick with it. \n\nI just think sometimes the idea of pushing CHILDREN straight from high school into college is too much. I think a break and a little dose of reality helps a ton.",

Sending her to a State School/university will go even more poorly.\n\nTake some time to talk with her about how she actually feels about school, what she wants to do, and how she wants to accomplish that. As she steps into adulthood, those choices are hers to make, not yours. While it can be hard to let go, and I\u2019m sure you want the best for her, running through the higher education track just isn\u2019t the best/most preferable option for everyone, even if traditionally it provides the best jobs.\n\nThe world has changed, and a college education to corporate job jump is far from the only way to be successful in life.",

Classes with W grades (withdrawn/no GPA) aren\u2019t going to be a problem when trying to transfer in the future. Classes with D grades will probably not be transferable at all.",
