  "text": "I am a junior taking four classes this semester. Each week I have been becoming more and more burned out, and I think the reason is for this particular class I am taking. My other three classes have reasonable amounts of homework which usually take about an hour each. My one class, however, the teacher expects us to read a chapter from a book the class is reading, and write a 10-point font, times new roman, 1.0 spacing, 1 page paper. Mind you, three times per week! I have been able to complete them so far, but this really seems like its overkill on the teachers part. Each paper and reading combination takes me about 6 hours each, multiplied by 3 times per week, and I barely have any other time for homework. Any advice or similar experiences?",
