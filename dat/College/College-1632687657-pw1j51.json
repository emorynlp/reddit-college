Like 80% of the grade is just turning in something that\u2019s finished (per the rubric). The other 20 is pizzaz.\n\n I used to obsess over whether my work was good enough in undergrad and now that I grade undergrad work, oh my god.

So if I tell it I\u2019m writing an academic paper it\u2019ll edit my writing completely differently than if I\u2019m sending a business email.",

But it helps to remember that a good chunk of those students who look like they put in no effort are 1. student-athletes who don't want to be taking classes but have to as a stipulation of playing collegiate sports, or 2. students who don't want to be in college for any reason but their parents and/or some sort of scholarship is paying for it so they're just coasting to pass. Honestly, I can't blame them for that. College is not for everyone and a lot of people have to try it to figure whether it's for them or not. The really annoying thing though is that's it's almost always the intentionally underachieving students who are the ones to argue grades and ask for extra points. Students who are genuinely struggling or have anxiety about their work not being good enough almost never ask for help.",
