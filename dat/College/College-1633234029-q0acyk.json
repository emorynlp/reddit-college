  "text": "This is my first reddit post I\u2019m not 100% on how all of this works but I need some help with this. I\u2019m a first gen freshman in college (technically a Junior because I graduated high school with my A.A) I\u2019m taking about 17 credit hours, I work part time, and I\u2019m doing terrible in my classes. \n\nI study whenever I have time in between my classes and I understand the material but I do really bad on all of the assignments. I know that a key part of making sure you understand is being able to explain it to someone else which I can do, but as soon as I got to a quiz or test I get nearly every question wrong. As a result, I\u2019m failing 2/6 of my classes with a grade of 53% in one and 64% in the other. I\u2019ve watched many youtube videos, read other posts, talked to life coaches/counselors and none of their suggestions have helped. A lot of people have been telling me to quit my job so I can focus, but I need my paycheck to cover my expenses. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips on what I can do moving forward? I\u2019m a pre-med student, so anything less than a B+ this semester is really not an option for me.",

              "text": "A lot, and failing, regardless of your GPA does not look good.\n\nSlightScholar1 is aboslutely right. You almost certainly don\u2019t have the time to do what you need to do to actually do well in school \n\nI don\u2019t know how to say this without being mean, but if you cant answer the questions consistently to the grades you are getting you don\u2019t understand the material..  It may look familiar to you, you may know you have seen it before but you dont know it.\n\n\nHave you looked over the questions and figured out why 1) you got that question wrong 2) what clues there were that this was going to be on the test and was a main topic. \n\n\nYou need to figure out how to change your study habits to active stuff.  Skim the book any lecture notes and course materials prior to the class and take bullet point notes of main topics and vocab to watch out for ,  You are just making a skeleton at this point, no full sentences no actual answers.\n\nThen actually read the book  watch the lectures , go to class and use the skeleton you have made to take notes.\n\nThen organize your notes , not into blocks of texts but concept maps, charts , flow diagrams, schematics etc.\n\n\nAnd while you are doing that, ask yourself questions.  (Look at Cornell notes methods - not a fan or all of it, but it gives you a good idea)\n\nGo to office hours\n\nGo to the learning and tutoring center or whatever you have at your school\n\nThere is a really good chance you are not going to get a B+ this semesters, but it is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nIf you look at this one semester as a rocky start and learning opportunity, you absolutely can improve over time.  (This is actually something that grad schools and med schools like to see, and that your eventual LOR writers can highlight - identify a problem , and fixing it is actually a much more important thing than just getting A\u2019s  all the time)\n\nIf you focus on this one semester in panic mode trying to get the next exam grade up without looking at the bigger picture and resolving the long term issues is  1) not going to work anyway and 2) going to break your brain and your will",

I do go back and review but by that time I have new assignments to do and can\u2019t fully review so I know I need to get better with that. As for the other study tips you mentioned, I\u2019ll definitely try those. Thank you so much for this response it honestly helped alot",

      "text": "\"Understanding\" material isn't a binary thing like people seem to think it is. It's not \"you understand it or you don't,\" it's \"you understand it somewhere on a range from extremely superficially at a beginner level to extremely in depth at an expert level.\" Most of the time to do well in k-12, you really only need a superficial understanding of topics. College expects more from you, though, so you need a more in depth understanding. Being able to parrot back facts is not enough at the college level-- you need to have a better idea of the inner workings of a subject. \n\nI apologize that my comment doesn't really help you solve your problem, but I think it's good to get out of the habit of thinking you either \"understand\" something or \"don't.\" Realistically, you understand the topic a little bit, which is probably more than people who never went to college, but it also seems you probably don't understand it well enough to actually succeed in college, at least at the moment (although you can probably get there with the right resources-- I suggest a tutor if you can get one).",

You can spread out the workload by taking a summer class, but then you have to pay for it yourself. If you can afford that, I\u2019d recommend it! 15 credits is just too much for most premed students to keep the gpa they need.\n\nThat being said, I also teach in my boot camp that studying is both UNDERSTANDING and MEMORIZATION and I give some tips for both.

Did you not understand the question? Was it multiple choice? Did you not understand the answers or how to eliminate them? Was it open answer? Did you over look the details? If you have any questions, ask your professors. Also, after class review the material and ask your professors specific questions the next class so that you can understand before the test. \n\nAlso, how are you studying? Did you wait last minute? Maybe you need to quiz yourself more using study questions that can be found in books or online, or maybe form a study group so other students can ask you questions. \n\nHope this helps.",
