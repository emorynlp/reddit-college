  "text": "What do you guys think about removing the requirements for gen-ed classes from 4-year degrees to shorten them to 2-3 years? I personally feel that most gen ed classes that I've taken have not been very useful to me & won't be useful to my future career. I also think it would be a great way to spend less money on college. For those who want to take gen ed classes, why not let them do a 4-year degree, while everyone who already knows their future career can do a 3-year degree?",

      "text": "Here's an answer that doesn't speak to the virtues of being a well-rounded member of society \u2013 which I do think is a valid argument, but other commenters have already covered it.\n\nOnly about 50% of students enter college \"confident\" about the career they want to pursue. Moreover, **more than half of all students change their major at least once, with about 20% changing more than once**. \n\nSimply put, a lot of students go into college without the slightest clue of what they want to do, and others go in confidently believing they've chosen the right path only to find out otherwise once they start taking classes.\n\nThat's a lot of why we have gen-eds. Because students who are exposed to other subjects very often go \"hey, I really enjoyed that more than I thought I would, maybe I should pursue XYZ instead.\" Without this exposure, I bet my bottom dollar you'd have a lot more people dropping out, struggling through classes in a major  they don't enjoy, or ending up in careers that don't utilize their full potential as people.\n\nSource on above stats: https://www.ellucian.com/assets/en/2019-student-success-survey-results.pdf",

      "text": "The reason General Education requirements exist, is because data and past research has shown they increase critical thinking skills even if they are totally unrelated to the major someone is taking. They also teach empathy and critical analysis towards opposing viewpoints, better communication, and a variety of other \"soft\" skills that many people do not get exposure to in high school. \n\nAnother way of looking at it: we don't need more people with critical and technical skills who are not able to effectively communicate, empathize with or effectively work alongside coworkers. We have plenty of people already who can't play nice in the sandbox. Do we really want to take away what little training people currently have in these skills? It doesn't help you if you are an amazing coder but are totally incapable of leading or working with a team. Or if you have amazing project management skills but you can't write or interpret written instructions for your team. Or you can't speak to your team because you're too terrified to stand up in front of people and talk. Or your team hates you because you have zero ability to empathize with them or understand where they are coming from. These are the skills you may not realize you are learning in Gen Eds, but are critical to your success as an adult and in the workplace.",

Every core requirement has to be two classes. How is he supposed to prepare for interviews when he has to compete with other students from schools around the world who do not have to through that ? 80 out of 128 credits and the geneds usually take more time than what he is supposed to be studying. I found that interesting. Countries like France, UK and almost any other country I know of, do not require one to do that once they are at the university.

That's the whole point of a well-rounded education. I was trained to be a math teacher. One of my most useful classes in college was an African American Literature course. That course taught me how to look at the world from a viewpoint different from my own. I previously didn't appreciate how the different life and cultural experiences shape how we view the world. It helped me challenge my own views and consider the perspective of others. My writing courses helped me in my professional writing. Many of my colleagues who studied only math and fewer gen eds can't write a clear sentence to save their lives. I had lots of practice in my liberal arts education. If you had asked me at the time, I would not have appreciated how helpful those classes were going to be. \n\nA bachelor's degree is supposed to be well-rounded. We are not just preparing you not just for a specific type of job you want right now. What if that changes? How do you know now what is going to be useful 20 years from now? There are jobs that will exist in the future that we can't even predict right now. The bachelor's degree is intended to give you a wide range of transferable knowledge and skills for any of the changes that come your way. You might think you know what job you want now, but almost everyone does something different from their exact intended job or exact chosen college major at some point in their lives. \n\n>For those who want to take gen ed classes, why not let them do a 4-year degree, while everyone who already knows their future career can do a 3-year degree?\n\nWe already have that. Community colleges have many two-year degrees for people going directly into the workforce. \n\nAlso, it doesn't have to be expensive to do gen eds if you do them at a community college and then transfer.",

      "text": "That is not really the contractual agreement for you to receive a BA/BS. It's conflated because the message now is 'you need a degree to get a career'. The conception of a BA/BS was for you to become a well rounded citizen educated in several aspects that translated to a health member of society as well as some proficiency in a specific field.\n\nThere are other methods of just getting training for your career such as Bootcamps, two year certifications, or trade schools that focus exclusively on your topic. However you will notice they are less accepted (in certain fields) as BA/BS degree will always be preferred  because of the connotations that you have more experience not only in the field but with other skills (soft skills.)\n\nAlso having a standard of measurement for students is how schools get accredited. You can't have differently people doing different things and expect the results to be the same or there to be consistent data of comparison.\n\nIf you want to get rid of gen-eds, you need to restructure K-12 education and make it the same and equitable across the board. Something nearly impossible given states rights to format their education (Sorry that was a US centric comment).",

I don't think you should need to take an excessive amount of it (6 credits over 8 semesters for me, so really, 2 semesters of math is really not that bad). These classes aren't useless, many of them are fundamental to understanding the various things that are occuring/occured in the world around you. Lots of complaints here about not really learning anything, and I hate to say it, but it sounds like you guys just went to schools that have a poor education in that particular field/had bad professors/weren't particularly the best students in those courses. Gen-eds are most definitely important, you should just choose classes that have at least some relation to what you're studying/your interests to make them enjoyable and worthwhile.",

A child in the US can, with just a little effort or some bad luck, effectively complete all of their years of compulsory schooling without really learning anything at all, and be functionally illiterate and innumerate at 18. \n\nSome have been homeschooled for a variety of dubious reasons without any oversight. Others went to critically underfunded schools who are rewarded only by the number of students they graduate, not the quality of those graduates. A lot of poorer high schools offer few, if any, AP classes (~equivalent to A-levels) and because it's a significant percentage of high school graduates, universities are forced to pick up the slack. Just imagine entering university without doing A-levels of any kind. \n\nSo even within the population of 18yo's with a high school diploma or equivalent *for a single state*, there's this huge range of competencies. Some are illiterate and innumerate, others are operating at a 2nd or 3rd year undergrad level. And all of them have been handed a GED or high school diploma. \n\nGen-eds are meant to be a way to provide a well-rounded education across many subjects, but they have largely morphed into remedial courses for the stragglers in the group.\n\nWhen people from the US talk about gen-eds and \"a well-rounded education\", they're talking about what you experienced in your mandatory schooling, including A-levels or college or whatever your country of choice has. Other countries require *high school* graduates to be functional adult members of society, the US does not and it gets outsourced to their universities. But this is obviously a dangerous game for all the citizens who do not go on to university.",

They don't understand that most students are not interested in academia and research etc but instead just want a degree so they can get a job. It's difficult because they are naturally passionate about it but to many of us, we see it as useless classes that make us drown in more debt. I am a forestry major so why should I have to take British Lit and Music Appreciation? That's what I'm doing next semester. I'm only taking one forestry class, Soils. Some professors have spent their whole lives in academia and have no perspective of the job market or what most jobs actually require from people. Many don't know anything about agricultural majors or environmental majors, like mine, and yet will tell me that I'll *definitely* need that \"History of Cheese Making\" class to become \"well-rounded\". For the record, the History of Cheese Making class would be really cool and interesting but I don't want to spend money on that when I'm here to learn forestry.",

Or just any elective courses under broader distribution areas (e.g. the arts, the humanities, the social sciences, etc.)? I don't think I've ever heard of specific Gen Ed courses being required (aside from obvious basic ones like English 101 and such); that's kind of the point of them is that you should be able to choose from a variety of classes under an umbrella field. But the \"well-roundedness\" facet isn't just some scam attachment (though I think we can all agree colleges can be/are a scam in other ways); it's literally what distinguishes them from technical/vocational schools and programs (which there's also nothing wrong with). YMMV, but usually students who complain about taking \"useless\" Gen Ed's are the ones who lazily pick or let their advisors pick their classes for them",

As for your other point, two year technical forestry degrees only get you hired as a forest tech which is a lower paying position. You also need to take into account the fact that SAF (Society of American Foresters) accredited degrees are hard to come by. Usually only 1-2 per state. This is a smaller school with fewer resources and I'm trying to get Gen Eds done before I transfer next Fall to complete my degree at the University of Kentucky. I don't lazily pick the classes that I pay for, I scour the course catalog. If I had gone with what my advisor had recommended, I'd have been screwed when I transferred. It's not like I absolutely hate my Gen Eds or I don't participate, I usually enjoy them. That being said, if I could ignore everything other than English 101-102 and just do my forestry classes and still earn my bachelor's, I would. It's too expensive to become \"well-rounded\".",

Four year degrees used to be proportionally more affordable, and they've become less so due to other factors (predatory loan industry, administrative bloat, *arguably* the increased distribution of fin aid (I don't believe that myself, but it's an idea that's circulated)).",

The courses they see as Gen Ed's are history, diversity and inclusion, art, math, composition/writing, science and behavioral sciences. They let students pick from 15-30 options for ach topic (except math and comp) so people can find ones that match thier major/goals a bit. Like agriculture students take a plant and civilization course, or a course about cover letter/resumes, horticulture, or landscape architecture. Heck some people take an Gen eds and then minor in it or change their major since they didn't know it was an option to begin with. \n\nAlso a Bachelors degree at almost every US university is 120 credits, so even if you didn't have Gen Ed's, you would still need to make those credits. They would all have to change their definition of a bachelors degree and subtract it by like 30 credits. This would put a bachelors only 30 credits more than an associates.",

I took a class on it and a study abroad experience to see how even universities in the UK, which we first were first modeled after, differed drastically from us today. It actually a super interesting topic if anyone wants to start a deep dive! \n\nEach country has a different way of calculating credits, semester lengths/options, and degree requirements. In the US many schools follow the fall spring, and optional summer. Most have students complete 15 credits (around 4- 5courses) during the fall and spring which translates to 4 years and 120 credits. \n\nSome countries/universities do a winter semester or a required summer which may shorten the length of a degree. They may also award more credits/hours than others. Credits amounts may change due to how long thier semesters are or how long they meet in class each week. \n\nSomething else that can change a degree requirement is what type of primary school or high school education they received. Some countries have technical training or more robust systems where they might rely less on post-secondary education to round a student out. Even in US I did PSEO on high school and was able to graduate in 3 years with only one summer. If they already expect students to have a rodust knowledge of Math, science, and writing due to the structure of their previous education then they may not need to add it to the curriculum.",

It\u2019s just as meaningless as the grading system. \n\nThe only real difference is what happens *before* university. In Australia people have to do 2 years of \u201ccollege\u201d, years 11 and 12. You take a mix of specialised classes for your degree plus general required courses to make you well-rounded and ensure you can read and write and do maths and all that good stuff. It\u2019s basically 2 years of nothing but APs and all schools must offer them and they must all be to standard. You cannot complete high school without this. So Australia requires you to be a functional, well-rounded member of society *before university*. It also shaves a year off because you enter university at a more advanced level than the average US student.",

I made it through high school and ended up taking ~7 years in between graduating and going to college. I learned so many things during that time that might not have been academically significant, but they absolutely made me a much better student when I was finally ready to take that plunge. I ended up going to community college (and worked for student government as our campus PTK chapter president!), which was a great experience. I needed some of those \"remedial classes\" to get reacquainted with things I had forgotten over the years, like algebra and how to write a properly formatted essay. No shame! That isn't knowledge you just retain if you aren't using it semi regularly. I ended up transferring to a local university and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2019. It was hands down the hardest thing I've ever done, and required so much dedication and sacrifice. \n\nAll that life experience is worth something!! I feel like we get stuck sometimes on the importance of a traditional, linear educational experience. But, if everyone had that exact same path, imagine how boring, uninspired, and one dimensional our work would be! I'd much rather problem solve and create with a diverse group of people than a bunch of people who were all put through the exact same education mill. I'm getting off topic... Sorry. Anyway, congrats on your schooling and good luck with student government! They need people like you, I'm sure you'll crush it.",

Stuff outside of your major is cool, but make it optional.\n\nEDIT: \nafter thinking about this for a little bit, I believe that we should still have to take *some* gen eds , but reduce the number of disciplines needed and have them be tailored to your major if applicable. For example, I\u2019m comp-sci with emphasis in data admin. My English class shouldn\u2019t be focused on the dissection of poetry, but about writing reports and whatever other necessary paperwork is needed in my field. I shouldn\u2019t have to take a 6 credit bio lab/lecture and nor should anyone that has to go into anything that is outside of the field that those types of courses are actually applicable to. Nowadays we have an unfathomable access to information for absolutely free everywhere we go and if I wanted to learn about poetry and the art of writing I could go to YouTube and a plethora of other sites at no cost and learn exactly what I want. \n\nMy college history course should not be about 19th century America and the slave trade. I\u2019ve learned about the same couple hundred years of history since grade school. My history course should be on the origination of the computer, how it came about, how data implementation has changed since it\u2019s conception, etc. That type of course I just described is considered an EXTRACURRICULAR for my MAJOR in COMPUTER SCIENCE, but the aforementioned is a requirement? The general history of your country and whatever is deemed necessary curriculum should be covered in the over a **decade** you are in elementary/middle/high school for \u201cfree\u201d.\n\nI support the pursuit of knowledge and being well versed in multiple fields. It is a valuable skill set and makes you a more open-minded person (IMO), but when that price tag is in the thousands of dollars it is not worth it. Me writing a 10 page paper keeping me from doing my other career related homework does not make any sense. Studying for biology exams and cramming information into my head just to get a grade is not what education is meant to be.",

I am glad dual enrollment has started to take off in the last few years.

A few of my friends did it, but it came at the cost of them not being able to walk at graduation and having to continue living in our hometown to finish their courses a year after the rest of us.\n\nLow income access to higher education is a whole other discussion.

These days, at many schools, you *can* BS your way through gen ed classes, and it's a core failure of the institutions that serve us. \n\nI entered college 12 years ago, well after grade inflation was underway, but I've only seen it get worse and worse over the past decade. What I've seen count as \"passing\" in some college classes now wouldn't have passed the classes I took in high school, and again, that's only slightly over a decade ago, after standards had already began to lower. \n\nFor some historical perspective, it seems that No Child Left Behind and \"Race to the Top\" were federal educational decisions that drastically accelerated what turned out to be our \"Race to the Bottom.\" It seems that many k-12 districts literally just don't bother to fail students ever (source: I have friends who teach in some of these districts and they are literally not allowed to fail students) and so students who \"pass\" high school enter college without basic skills and colleges find it hard to resist lowering standards because in some classes at some schools, keeping standards at what would normally be considered \"college\" level would result in 100% failure rates.\n\nYes, I have seen this play out in real life. Students (including many on this sub) claim that it's a professor's fault if everyone fails, but when 100% of your students come in unable to solve the equation 2x=10 and unable to write coherent sentences and are then placed into college level STEM and humanities courses that require these skills, then yes, if 100% of those students fail, it is NOT the professor's fault. Professors aren't miracle workers that can pull up students from middle school level skills to college level skills in the course of a semester.\n\nOf course, everyone gives the professor shit if they fail the students who deserve to fail and no one has their backs, so they give in and pass students who shouldn't pass. They water down their lectures, exams, and assignments so that some students can pass and they just accept that this is the current state of our education system.\n\nYour mileage may vary by school, though. I worked at a community college where the \"100% of the students are not ready for college\" is an accurate descriptor of our student population (and we have the placement test scores to prove it). The Ivies inflate grades for other reasons, but no one at Ivies is graduating without basic skills, most likely because no one without basic skills is getting into the Ivies. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm a grad student and at least at my school and in my field of study you absolutely 100% *will* fail if you can't demonstrate you are competent. However, I've heard that there are some fields where even at the master's level it's nearly impossible to fail. And so the trend continues... everyone just passes their students and kicks the can down the road.",

Even in my psychology class, we had an entire chapter about this. No one will retain information that is not useful for their job. \n\nIt is such a weird statement to \"career training school\" when the entirety of college is literally only for that. It prepares you for the job. It is literally job training. If you ever ask anyone why they are going to college the first thing they will say is for better opportunities, and not to learn about everything that barely teaches you anything. \n\nEvery general education has no depth to it, unlike my major classes. It literally like \"Sorry, but this is required so we made it easy.\" The majority of people will nearly instantly forget everything that they learn in that class the next semester. Due to people knowing that they are not going to be using it. \n\nPersonally, I literally do not remember what I have learned in any of my general education, and I am doing my very last GE class. While I do not remember GE I remember everything from my major.\n\nThe only class that should be required is English 101 and English 102. The amount of people that I have seen that cannot type, structure sentence, or paragraph is insane. I have seen people's essays and they are awful I cannot imagine them trying communicate in email to their bosses, or co-workers.",

I went to a \"career-focused\" college (their words, not mine). There was a core curriculum of some required classes but no traditional gen eds like you'd find at most colleges. I would describe it as the opposite of a liberal arts education. The majority of my classes were very niche and major-specific right off the bat since freshman year. \n\nPersonally, this style of education was detrimental to my learning. I felt confined and didn't have the option to explore other areas of study that interested me. Other students had a very difficult time changing majors because with such niche classes, they didn't translate over into other major programs. Obviously, my experience isn't everyone's and some kids did thrive in that environment, but a lot of people I knew ended up transferring out and eventually, so did I.",

My dad has worked in a lot of management positions in many different fields and it's crazy how many different issues can come up.

If you just wanna focus exclusively on things directly related to your specialty, then that's fine I guess but well, don't be shocked when the other guy gets the promotion you wanted.\n\nWhat are your goals for your future career? The best paying jobs in any field are ones that require more responsibility, and handling responsibilities in the workplace often means understanding people, money, planning, & being able to *respond* to whatever crazy shit comes up. Maybe the senior employee who comes from a more engineering oriented background won't come up with the response to absolutely every unpredicted event, but they should still be able to know enough to delegate the response properly & understand what is happening. If I was looking to promote someone and give them more responsibility, the LAST person I would look for is the employee who just takes a \"meh, I'm here to do X and that's it\" attitude.

In my undergrad, for example, they had basic science courses geared for teachers, one in physics, one in bio/earth science, one in chemistry. That way teachers and other non-science majors could pick one, rather than a general \"all the science\" class. (Or, they could pick a more advanced science, but the option was there). I don't agree with Frankenstein gen ed.",

It is a bit stupid that an english lit major is often expected to take the same physics 1 course as a mechanical engineering major.",

A lot of students in public schools are pushed to move on every year whether they truly passed or not, I speak from experience teaching elementary school. So many students who shouldn't have passed but because of whatever reason they are pushed to the next grade.",
