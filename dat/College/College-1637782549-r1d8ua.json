      "text": "It all really depends on what you plan on doing after college. I started my freshman year working on a BFA in Fine Arts, just to realize this year, that the jobs that I\u2019ll be aiming for after college are more geared to the Financial sides of Art, so probably a Financial Analyst for a Museum or something.  With this I found that I would be better off getting my degree in finance. So, try to do some research on how you might be able to use your degree after college, and I think that would probably make you feel more secure in your decision. Good luck!",
