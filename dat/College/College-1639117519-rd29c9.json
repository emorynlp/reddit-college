  "text": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m currently a junior college student. I plan on going on to grad school in the future. I currently have a 3.4 gpa. My freshman year I had a bad semester as I had a relative pass away, and had to miss out on assignment and finals which left me with a semester gpa of 2.4. However this was in 2019. I know I can retroactively withdraw for the entire semester, however I already have 3 W on my college transcript, and in the fall semester I took 5 classes. Is there another way I could potentially have the grades expunged say pass/fail, audit, etc\u2026\u2026?",
