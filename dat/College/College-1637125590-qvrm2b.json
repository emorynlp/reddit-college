  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman and NFA economics major. I don\u2019t have an absolute passion for the field, but a decent paying job is more important than anything to me. However I keep hearing horror stories about Econ grads not being able to find jobs and having to go to graduate school, which I definitely don\u2019t want. I\u2019ve also been told college is practically useless if you\u2019re not in STEM or business. I\u2019m been thinking about switching my major to finance for more stability but I feel like I would enjoy the major substantially less. Should I make the switch or stick with Econ and a comp sci minor? Any advice helps.",
