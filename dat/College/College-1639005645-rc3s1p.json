  "text": "Hey guys.  \nI'm a first-year university student in Canada. Lately, I have been struggling with picking what to study. I'm currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Science degree, but I'm unsure of what major to actually stick with. Here are the options I was thinking about:  \n\\- Microbiology (current major)  \n\\- Molecular Biology and Genetics  \n\\- Biochemistry  \n\\- Bio-medical science  \nAlthough I am looking toward going to pharmacy school, I would also like to pick a major that has the most prospects if pharm school falls through. In this case, pursuing a masters degree is a given, I just don't know which undergrad to pick.  \nAny help would be appreciated, thank you!!",
