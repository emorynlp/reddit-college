  "text": "I\u2019m a junior but I know a lot of freshman and sophomores are dropping out. Not because money but they just don\u2019t want to do the work or they think it\u2019s too hard. Wondering if these kids getting out of high school (junior/senior during corona) were just used to not having as much or??? Curious on others thoughts",

      "text": "Teachers (and the like) are pushing more and more people into STEM majors (science, technology, engineering, and math) these days. I'm doing engineering and people drop out all the time. It's likely that people are entering STEM because their teachers or parents may have pushed them into it, but didn't realize the dedication and effort many STEM majors require. It is possible that many of these students are getting their illusions of STEM shattered and realizing that it isn't for them so they drop out.",

      "text": "I can\u2019t say for everyone but as a freshman I\u2019ve been thinking about it too but not for the work load. I find the work load to be reasonable but rather that I\u2019m not learning the best way. I could buy a private tutor with the money I\u2019m spending on tuition instead of taking two classes a week 45 minutes each that actually do with my minor and major. I think that could be a possibility, the work load, but also just our generation and the more opportunities that are open without a degree needed could be a big part of it.",

          "text": "Out of curiosity, what do you mean by more opportunities available without a major? I feel like I see way more people complaining about entry level jobs that want a bachelor's or master's degree and several years of experience then I see people talking about dropping out of college because they found a great job with different requirements. If what you're saying is true, I think that would be great, college is expensive and lots of people aren't going to make a great return on their investment or use their degree all that much, I just feel like more and more jobs are requiring degrees not less and less.",

              "text": "Perhaps it has to do with the my field and my city. The particular job I want doesn\u2019t require a degree but in how I want to apply it it is greatly recommended. While I agree that jobs are starting to require more interviews, degrees, and what not, there is a lot less stigma about dropping out of college and starting a business or using social media as a form of living. When I said more opportunities I didn\u2019t particularly mean with other businesses or white collar jobs.\n\nEdit: I have found recently more jobs than previously would rather train you their way rather than you having knowledge of it previously.",
