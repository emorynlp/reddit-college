  "text": "I saw a lot of reviews about those paper-like screen protectors that mimic the feeling of writing on paper, but in the process ruins the apple pencil tip over time. If you guys have any recommendations on screen protectors you use, please let me know!",

      "text": "I would say that all screen protectors wear on the pencil tip because of the friction. Even the normal glass will eventually wear down the tip, just not as quickly. I use my apple pencil for notes and highlighting ebooks. I would say after 8 months of use I should probably change the tip soon. The screen protector didn\u2019t really justify spending $20 on a new pencil tip for half the lifetime ($20/4months). \n\nWith that being said, I practiced my writing on the glass screen and ended up not needing a paper-like screen protector even though I bought one that a YouTuber recommended. I actually learned that my poor handwriting was more a product of not knowing what pen thickness to use + lack of practice. Hint: start large to make your handwriting more neat and work your way down!",
