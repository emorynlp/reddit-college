  "text": "Couldn't find a similar question, so figured I'd ask. I want to be around my peers, so I'd prefer to dorm over getting an apartment. But I realized this may be a bit weird since I'm potentially so much older than others at my dorm.",

      "text": "Depends on how you feel around and get along with people generally younger than you. It might be a few years but I (33) was a completely different person at 26 than I was at 18 or 20. So for me, rooming with the younger crowd would have been oil and water. For you, if you already interact with people in the age range that you are likely to room with and it's generally a pleasant experience then it could work out. If you find people younger than you to be generally annoying for whatever reason then living with them isn't going to be awesome.",

      "text": "I would say get one with less roommates. I just think having 6 different dudes friends over would suck especially if they\u2019re too loud all night long. And if they can\u2019t buy their own alcohol it would suck to be put in that position constantly for 6 different people because you either say no and they don\u2019t like it or you say yes and you\u2019re responsible for them.\n\nThere are definitely other ways to make friends. Sometimes there are student houses with a bit of an older crowd and less surveillance but like still fun. Or dorms for niche groups of people like honors dorms, etc.",
