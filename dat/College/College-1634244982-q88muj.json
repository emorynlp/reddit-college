  "text": "So my biology professor is using a point grading system. We can get a total of 712 points. \n\nOur exams we get points for even if we get a failing grade, which I\u2019m very confused by, I got a 48% on my first try for our unit 1 exam but I still got like 24 points out of the 50 I could\u2019ve gotten, I\u2019m confused cause I\u2019ve always been used to if you get a failing grade you get 0 credit for that exam. Can someone explain to me how this works? \n\nAnd if you can get a total of 712 points then what is the lowest amount of points you can get and still pass with a C?",

      "text": "So i\u2019m pretty sure in order to get a C the lowest amount of points you can get is a 500/712 for the course which equals a 70 or a C. You got 24/50 points which equals 48% on the exam not the overall course. Im kind of confused because during my college experience i\u2019ve never heard of getting a total of 0% for failing. Letter grades are kind of arbitrary and just help you gauge what your percentages mean. You could still get an F even if you got a a mere 5 points on your exam, but those points will still be added to your overall course grade. If this was your first grade then you would have a 48% in the class since only 50 points have been available as of now. As new assignments get added the overall point value will increase until there is a total of 712 possible points at the end of the semester. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t exactly the question you\u2019re asking but i think i sort of answered it?\n\nedit: additional info",

          "text": "That helps a lot! Thank you. I was homeschooled my entire life so I\u2019m still trying to figure all of this out. I always thought that failing exams meant you would fail the whole class. I didn\u2019t realize that even if you get a very low grade you still get credit for it. We have a total of four exams, 50 points each, so we can get up to 200 points total for all of our exams. I feel bad that I didn\u2019t do better on my first exam, I have all As and a couple Bs on all of my course work/homework though.",

              "text": "Oh no worries! It can be a bit confusing if you\u2019ve never encountered it before. If you were to get  about 450/712 points or less for the course than yes you would have an F in the entire course and fail the class. But if you fail an exam you still retain those points and can still work on bringing up your grade! And don\u2019t sweat it, my first bio exam freshman year i\u2019m pretty sure I got a D on it. First exams are always tough because you don\u2019t know the professor\u2019s testing / grading style. Just use this past test to prepare for the new ones and i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do just fine :-)",

I think quite a a bit of the class failed because of that. That\u2019s why he allowed for an unproctored retake of the exam. He claims our practice exam for this unit will have everything in it that could possibly be on the exam but now I don\u2019t trust that.",
