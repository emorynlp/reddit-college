I just have trouble focusing in class, or shifting from one subject to the next, and I often miss things not being detail oriented, which devastate my grade\n\nThe hard working people I know are baffled by this. They think smart = success, and only lazy people struggle. Good for them I guess, I don\u2019t care\n\nI think I\u2019ll have a fine time in the work world. Though I\u2019ve only worked non academic jobs, I\u2019ve never struggled at work. The struggle is having to learn many new concepts every week. Were it just one subject, or just consistent work projects, not exams, I\u2019d do fine\n\nSo I think of dropping out, but then i remember if I stick through it work will be easier. And to those who say college is easier, im glad you\u2019re a sponge who can just soak up knowledge, enjoy that",

I've been out of college for about a year now.\n\nIf it would be beneficial to your mental health or growth, I seriously recommend taking a semester or year long leave of absence. Obviously that privilege isn't available to everyone, but sometimes a break is just needed. Especially if you're experiencing burnout or a lack of motivation. \n\nPersonally, I know i'll go back to school because I enjoy it but obviously that isn't the case for everyone. Taking time off was so good for me because it allowed me to get my lust for learning back and motivation to move towards the future I want for myself. Ive also finally been able to address my mental health and anxiety disorder after struggling with it my entire life. \n\nJust know that there are so many good paths out there for you and there's no shame in taking a little longer to graduate if that's something you choose. Best of luck!!",

That's their thing. They could move bricks 12 hours a day and be happy. If you're one of those people, quit school. Jobs can break you. Shitty jobs do. I haven't had a 401k for most of my jobs in the past decade. I've had two jobs making 50k a year in the past 10 years.\n\nStay in school for you. I know it's aggravating but I assure you, a shitty job working for horrible people without many ways out is debilitating. They won't grant you vacation, you don't *earn* vacation. 10 hour shifts are horrible on your body. Working 70 hours a month blows.",

Itll be worth it someday. You should have some kind of career in mind thatll bring you happiness or at least you can be content with, thatll bring in enough money for the things you enjoy",
