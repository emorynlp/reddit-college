  "title:": "Discussion Participants Needed for Undergraduate Project! [Nutrition Perception]",
  "text": "Hi r/college!\n\nI'm looking for participants to talk to (over email, or PM) for a project I am working on for my undergraduate class. The goal of this discussion is to understand how past experiences regarding weight loss advice and nutrition affect an individual's perception of what a weight loss diet, or a healthy diet, looks like. I am particularly interested in talking to people who grew up in the United States and are between the ages of 18 to 35 who identify with \"struggling with their weight\", have made an attempt to lose weight, and who have been (or are) \"overweight\" or \"obese\". I would be sending you a few questions about what advice was given to you regarding nutrition, what traits your family exhibited regarding food, and asking about a few other lifestyle factors. Let me know in the comments if I can PM you!\n\nPlease feel free to message me if you are interested but have some further questions!",
