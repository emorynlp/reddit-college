  "text": "This last week or so has been shit, and it's gonna be shit for awhile. \n\nOn Thursday, a cousin of mine was hospitalized with a severe case of covid Pneumonia. He refused to get his vaccine because he is/was young and healthy. And now he's dying. Then, earlier today, my dad met me for breakfast and broke the news that my grandma has been diagnosed with end-stage cancer. It started in her pelvis, and has now spread to her lungs. So far, she is in good health, but is rapidly declining. I'm flying out to see her ASAP. \n\nFinally, after an emotional drive with my mom to pick up take-out, we arrived home to discover that my older dog was limping. I don't know yet what happened, or if it's a dislocation or just a simple muscle injury. But, if it turns out he needs surgery to correct it, I'll have to make the horrible decision to put my best friend of over ten years to sleep (he is sixteen years old this year. Old but still healthy, besides the leg, but at his age healing is hard, and frankly, I think it's cruel and selfish to prolong his life). Oh, and I also have an infected stye that was apparently the worst stye the doctor at the Urgent Care had ever seen, so I'm on antibiotics and am putting eye paste on my eyelid four times a day. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm taking just one class (an Astronomy lab course that's worth 5 credits), but it's my first time being in college, and it's fully in-person. Just last year I was diagnosed with Autism (so, huge shock), and I also have Cystic Fibrosis and only just gotten healthy enough to attend college (and I also spent literally all of last year in serious isolation to protect myself from covid). Before the shitshow that has been this past week, I was already struggling with burnout and college anxiety, though nobody knew because I'm so good at hiding it, I'm enjoying what I'm learning so far, and I'm holding a very solid A. \n\nBut, considering everything that has happened, is happening, and may happen very soon in the future, I don't think I can make the next seven weeks or so. I've emailed my prof and explained everything that's going on, and I've also been taking full advantage of my community college's disability services. I'm also in therapy, limiting the amount of time I spend on school work every day, prioritizing self-care and healthy eating, exercising, socializing with close friends and family, etc. I'm doing every damn thing in my power to stay strong and afloat, but I'm starting to sink pretty fucking fast. \n\nShould I click that dreadful \"drop class\" button? Or, should I do what I've always done, which is swallow my pain and give everything all I have till December? Honestly, I'm torn. I want so badly to attend and succeed in college, and having a goal and something to do keeps me going in life. But, at the same time, I'm physically getting sicker and sicker, and my mental state ain't much better. Plus, I might have to let my dog cross the rainbow bridge, then fly out to a cousin's (very preventable) funeral, then immediately say my final goodbyes to my dying grandma. But, I don't want to quit, and frankly, I don't know when to quit. \n\nMy parents say there's no shame in dropping out of college and taking time off to go be with loved ones. But, at the same time, they recognize that without college, there's not much I have to do except chores and sob my eyes out. College might be the only thing getting me up in the mornings, and it keeps me out of my head for a couple hours a day. I don't want to take that away from myself. But, at the same time, I'm getting pretty fucking sick. I haven't eaten a full meal for three weeks. My bodily functions are all out-of-whack. I have a nasty, oozing stye. My emotional pain is starting to manifest into physical pain throughout my body. And, I'm just riding massive, unstoppable waves of grief. I could be perfectly happy and content one minute, and ugly-crying the next.  \n\nSo, should I put college on the back-burner yet again? Or, should I just keep going? Or, does someone close to me have to click the \"drop class\" button for my stubborn ass? I don't fucking know.",
