      "text": "As someone with ADHD, social anxiety, and on the autism spectrum:\n\nGet friends. Easier said than done, believe me I know, but you can't do it alone. Find a study group, get external pressure, get help with all the executive stuff. \n\nI never attend lectures. I just can't sit there and listen for two hours. Luckily all lectures are recorded so I see them more as a resource. First I figure out what I need to know. Then I watch the part of the lecture explaining this and only this material. Works great for math. Don't know about other majors.\n\nWatch recorded lectures on double speed if you have ADHD. Pause the video as soon as your mind wanders. Rewind a minute and continue if you've gotten your focus back. \n\nInstead of a notebook I use A5 cards. Each card has exactly one topic on it. If the topic doesn't fit, too bad. Make it fit, summarize it better or split it into sub-topics.\n\nDedicate a physical space to studying. I play video games in my freetime so I can't study at my desk where my PC is. I have a spot where I study. If I am not studying I am not at that spot. \n\nI use an adjusted pomodoro method for studying. I pick a task that can be completed in roughly 30 minutes. I work until this task is finished (great example are the A5 topic cards. One card takes me around 30 minutes). Then I take a break. If I just tell myself to work 30 minutes I will just slack off in those 30 minutes. If instead I have a concrete goal in mind, I know I can't take a break before I reached this goal so I will work hard during those 30 minutes trying to earn my break. \n\nKeep in mind everyone is different. What works for me doesn't necessarily work for you.",

It\u2019s definitely worth it to see if your school\u2019s accessibility services has this or something similar. I\u2019ve found it very helpful.",
