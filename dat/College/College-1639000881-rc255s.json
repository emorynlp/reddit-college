  "text": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m currently a freshman at a local CC about to finish my first semester of college. I really hate CC. I really do. All my friends are at their 4 year enjoying life while i\u2019m here going to work school and have no type of social life. My parents are super strict and annoying so I don\u2019t really have any fun. My goal was to transfer in year to a 4 years but my GPA is low for it happen is close to 0. I always ask my self when will so ever be happy again? It looks like it\u2019s never going to get better for me.I\u2019ve hit rock bottom in my life. every thing seems to go the opposite way for me and I really don\u2019t know what to do. I really hate Community college I would t wish what i\u2019m going through to my worse enemy. Has anyone else gone through this at their CC and does it get better when you transfer?",

      "text": "Is the social scene different at a 4 year, yes. Will classes be any easier, no. If you hate community college and your GPA is low, I'd think about skipping college entirely and finding a career that doesn't require it. What if 6 months to a year from now you're driving a new(er) car, taking exciting trips, learning directly useful skills, renting your own place, etc, while you're friends are slogging through the core of their college experience, stressed about tests, going into student and consumer debt, not getting enough sleep, and complaining about their lives online.\n\nTrust me, life after college is infinitely better than life during college, even if you're good at/like school. If it's not for you, move on, avoid the debt, and make your friends jealous of you.",

      "text": "I think living on campus is the fun part you\u2019re talking about. You get to get away from your parents, have some independence for the first time in your life and that can be really great and freeing. It sounds like a good experience for sure. I did go to a community college while living with my parents and then transferred to a 4 year university after 2 years at CC. I never lived on campus so I didn\u2019t have that party experience, but I did have friends (and my bf) who I \u201cpartied\u201d with before starting to go to school full time (initially I was a part time student in CC). I know it probably feels shitty to not be having the same experience as your friends right now but I would suggest getting a job, if you can, (I\u2019ve made such good friends at work who I can hangout and have fun with outside of work) and just work on finding what interests you in college. The partying freshmen year is a phase, it ends, and this shitty situation won\u2019t last forever. Try making some goals for yourself, what do you really want to do? Not what your parents or friends want but what do you want and how can you inch closer to those goals day by day? Just some stuff to think about. I totally empathize with your situation because that sucks and my parents were helicopter parents as well with all their dumb, arbitrary rules.",
