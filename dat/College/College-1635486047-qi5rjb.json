      "text": "You\u2019ll find every type of person at college - but the thing that changes is that (for the most part) people start minding their own business more.\n\nWorkload increases, many people are also working one or two jobs, and they have to manage the myriad of responsibilities that come with being an adult. Things like scheduling doctor\n and dentist appointments, cleaning the house, buying groceries, etc.\n\nOn top of that, the world isn\u2019t the same 2,000-4,000 people anymore. It\u2019s tens of thousands of people, and no one can, or wants, to be friends with everyone of them anymore.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t selfish, and self-centered, they have their priorities straight, and just being friends with random people doesn\u2019t make it on the list.\n\n\nThat all being said, it takes time. I went through 3-4 groups of people before I stuck with one. It\u2019s okay to decide some people don\u2019t click with you, but don\u2019t just blame them for it. Move on and keep working to find people you like. Join clubs, go to wherever people from your hobby hang out, etc.",

      "text": "~~*one way you can get isolated is if you are selfish and self centered, or at least feel that way about yourself.\n\nand im not throwing shade at you, but you're saying this like its a provable fact when really its just a common rookie mistake of only seeing things your way and nobody else's, which is the definition of selfish. \n\nlast thing i want to say is that its human to feel frustrated since it is an emotion. but the best thing you can do for yourself is become aware when it's normal to be frustrated so you don't come up with rules like this that don't make any sense when your mood changes.~~",
