  "text": "I understand readings aren\u2019t always necessary to to well in the class depending on the class, but I feel I am wasting an opportunity by not doing my readings given Im paying so much to be in college. So if you were doing all the readings in your class or at least most, how would you schedule that thruout your week? Currently I have around 130-150 pages a week with 100 of those pages for 1 class which is like a small novel a week. How can I manage this or at least get close to this?im also taking 15 credit hours and I have a part time job. Any advice?",

I skimmed and made note of the important bits but if I read every sentence for every class that the prof told me to I\u2019d be done by the year 5085. So I just prioritize what I need to read closesly, what I need to know but don\u2019t need to read, and what I can skip",

      "text": "It helps to view reading for class as different than leisure reading. You can read more quickly if you are reading for large themes and key concepts, rather than trying to digest every word. Also, for a lot of texts, what argument is the author making, and what sub-arguments are made in each chapter? Reading for big picture stuff is a helpful time saver, especially if you are in the humanities or social sciences where we do so much reading. It gets easier as you do it more.\n\n\nTo show it's doable, a short story: one of my profs told us to read a book in four hours. What most of us ended up doing was reading the intro and conclusion to the book, then the first and last paragraphs of either chapters or sections of chapters. If you want to be more thorough than that, you can go through the whole book, but just brush over anything that seems like unnecessary details rather than main ideas. Basically, you hit a point I'm your education where skimming is an obvious solution to being assigned more books than you could ever read closely in the time given.\n\n\nIf you struggle with that sort of synthesis, sometimes it can help to ask \"how would I explain this book to a friend in a few sentences? What point is the writer trying to make?\" Things like that.",

      "text": "If you're in the humanities, unfortunately you do have to read at least most of the assigned readings. It helps to start with the abstract and conclusion, then the titles and skim read each section. Sometimes it takes multiple re-readings of the content. It does get easier as you read more. I preferred the classes that had readings over the ones that had homework and worksheets to be honest.\nIf you don't care about fully understanding the content, you can probably get away with reading the introduction + conclusion and finding a few random quotes in the middle or near the end of the paper/book chapter to foster discussion.",
