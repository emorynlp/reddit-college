  "text": "Sunday I got my second covid vax and got insanely sick to the point where I couldn\u2019t get out of bed, spasms, chills, fever, the whole nine yards. I sent my prof an email Sunday afternoon saying I was very unwell and couldn\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s note at  the moment but if she could excuse my absence. \n\nMonday the class happened and unbeknownst to me, she assigned everyone into groups for a project. Just now, nearly 5 days after my email, professor tells me my absence will NOT be excused and I will have to do this giant group project alone. If she had replied days earlier I\u2019d at least have had time to start the project like everyone else. What the actual f do I do? I\u2019ve been making straight A\u2019s in this class and this professor just hates me",
