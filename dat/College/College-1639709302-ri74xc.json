  "text": "So today I took my final exam and realized that multiple attempts were allowed \n\n\n\nMy first score was a 90, but I took the test 3 more times until I got a 100. \n\n\n\nMy last attempt took 4 minutes answering 50 questions with a 100%\n\n\nI\u2019m wondering, what happens when or if he realizes? \n\n\n\nThis Professor is very old, retired and is always experiencing technological problems with his computer. He often shows up at least 10 minutes late to our zooms due to having router issues. \n\n\nThis is ironically an intro to information technology class, I\u2019m guessing they were just limited on staff this year and had no one else to teach. \n\n\nChances are he won\u2019t realize, but I guess I\u2019m wondering if he does? Is he allowed to change the grades to people\u2019s first attempt?",

But if he does notice, probably the worst that could happen is for him to record the first grade for everyone. It's not like he'd fail you outright for a tech issue that was his fault",
