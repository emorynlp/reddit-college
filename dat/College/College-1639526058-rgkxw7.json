  "text": "My brother passed away right before Halloween. I was already diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been referred for ADHD, all of which have been anchors and I\u2019ve barely kept my head just above water but I somehow managed through four semesters. I\u2019m in junior year now and I feel like I\u2019m falling apart. It\u2019s close to finals and I missed nearly 4 weeks of class. I\u2019ve been in thorough contact with my professors and I thought getting generous extensions and absence exceptions would be enough. It\u2019s not. I can\u2019t do anything despite the fact that it\u2019s been a month after his death. I have regular suicidal ideation. I feel stupid and helpless and lazy. It feels like everyone is waiting for me to get over it and go back to schoolwork even though I\u2019ve missed so much. I can\u2019t really tell but I\u2019m paranoid that my professors are getting tired of it. I wanted to go to law school and now I just feel like dropping out. This is a lot but I just want some advice or reassurance or something. It\u2019s so difficult to bring up his death and my grief with anyone in my life without making it awkward and then shifting the conversation or saying things like \u201cA\u2019s don\u2019t matter! Just do your best and things will get better!\u201d\n\nI just feel so lonely and overwhelmed with all this.",

      "text": "Having suicidal thoughts is something hard to cope with. It seems like there are lot of things going through your mind, and you can\u2019t take it all at once. You\u2019ve done a great job so far, and I\u2019m pretty sure your brother would be proud of you to have accomplished what you have. Education is something you can go through later in your life, it\u2019s never too late. Focus on your mental well-being, it\u2019s much more important than anything in this world and see a therapist. Sending good thoughts to you. You\u2019re never alone, no matter how hard life seems to be. You\u2019ll always have people supporting you, and people that loves you. It\u2019s just important you open up yourself to receive that help.",

      "text": "Your profs aren\u2019t getting tired of you, but there\u2019s not much they can do if you remain enrolled. They can\u2019t give you points you didn\u2019t earn (not meaning this in a harsh way\u2014you have a very valid reason you\u2019re not able to earn those points right now). It sounds like a leave of absence is appropriate. School will be there once you\u2019re ready to return. It\u2019s not the same as dropping out. It\u2019s a pause while you work on healing. You might not want to push graduation back, but at least it keeps graduation still on the table, and your grades, reputation, and health in tact. Sending you positive energy \ud83d\udc95. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.",

What happens to my scholarships? How accommodating are schools? Do I have to reapply? I am scared at the idea of putting it on pause but also recognize that I might not survive Spring semester. Also, thank you for the kind words.",

              "text": "I wish I had concrete answers, but the best advice I have is to ask a trusted prof, advisor, or CAPS for guidance. Schools will have their own processes. It\u2019s a scary thing, for sure, but you have to survive. One step at a time. What will help you survive? Scholarships are great (kudos for having them!), but if you lose them to take care of yourself, your health is more important. There will be future opportunities that you just don\u2019t see at the moment. At this point, immediate survival before longer-term \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. You\u2019ll get through this eventually (not to minimize your pain\u2014you\u2019ll always feel the loss, but you\u2019ll process things after some time), and the qualities that got you to your current success will only be strengthened by overcoming this immense tragedy. I promise you will survive this and even thrive again, but you probably won\u2019t feel that way for a while. And that\u2019s ok. \n\nDo you have anyone at the school you can ask? Perhaps a prof that knows your situation and might agree that you need some time to heal before turning your attention back to work? They should at least know whom to refer you. Try that if you can, and if not, we can brainstorm some more. \n\nDo you have a favorite funny show or YouTube channel? I love Slice and Rice (I think it\u2019s called\u2026 it\u2019ll come up on YT). Challenge yourself to laugh once a day!",
