  "text": "I took ASL III this semester and had a terrible experience with my professor. She repeatedly posted \u2018receptive quizzes\u2019 which were riddled with errors. \n\nI took the time to screenshot her whenever I noticed something off. I\u2019m positive there was much more that I could have pointed out. \n\nShe always reacted in a nonchalant manner, even telling me once that \u2018I might get credit, if other students bring it to her attention\u2019. I\u2019m frustrated because I ended up with a B, when I know I deserve an A. (I have maintained a 4.0 since returning to college summer 2020)\n\nI know there\u2019s probably not much I can do about my grade, however, I feel like someone needs to be made aware that she is a very poor professor. \n\nI know times are hard because we all moved online, but what bothers me the most is that most other professors notice errors, and correct them. She acknowledged the errors I pointed out were valid, yet never fixed them for the other students taking the quiz. (I know because I asked my sign partner.)\n\nTo me, this squashes the potential of any student attempting to learn language from her. If the answers are confusing, and riddled with mistakes, you begin to question yourself. This could possibly impact someone\u2019s future negatively. \n\nAny advice appreciated.",
