  "text": "Second year of college.\n\nFour weeks before the end of the semester, me and my family were hit with covid. I have the weakest immune system out of everybody in my family, so mine lasted longer + was a worse case. I started feeling better on the last week of this semester (pretty funny, huh?) and couldn\u2019t catch up in time. Did I cry? Yeah. Do I feel like a failure, no. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m on academic probation now, but I want to take some time off college to clear my mind. Maybe college isn\u2019t for me right now. I\u2019m pretty happy I chose a community college though because so far, I have no debts to pay. \n\nFor those who failed their classes, it isn\u2019t the end of the world. And no, you are not a failure. I am proud of you for trying. For those who passed their classes, congratulations. I am also proud of you. I\u2019m hoping 2022 will be a much better year. 2021 was a tough year for a lot of us.\n\nNow that this semester is over, I can finally breathe. Literally. That heavy feeling in my stomach is gone now.\n\nP.S. Fuck covid and seasonal depression.",

I feel like it would be fair for anyone to get extra help if they were screwed over by the pandemic, it wouldn\u2019t be special treatment because they should help anyone in that situation! I think they\u2019re just being stubborn. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you",

I was hoping they would understand and give me some type of extra credit to do, but all I got was, \"I can't do anything about this, it wouldn't be fair to the other students. You'll just have to retake the class. See you again soon.\" Which made me not want to retake their classes anymore lol. It's straight up BS. The professors I had this semester were a little tougher than the ones I had my first year. The professors I had my first year were a lot more understanding than this year's. At this point, there's nothing I can really do. Once again, thank you for understanding you. It means a lot.",
