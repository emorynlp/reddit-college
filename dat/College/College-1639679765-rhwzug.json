  "text": "Having such a hard time with post-secondary life. I was in the working world from college, worked in manufacturing, trades, became a warehouse supervisor, did that for 5 years.\n\nIn 2019 entered college at 26 because I wanted to get an education in hopes for a new life and change careers so I went for computer science, which I thought I would be interested in, after a full semester of computer science courses I wasn't interested at all, and had a life-altering concussion(which is probably one of the worst things that ever happened to me). I struggle with post-concussion syndrome to this day, which severely slowed down my education.\n\nContinued through school because the student grants were my only hope of income with post-concussion syndrome, decided to study what I was interested in so I was studying sociology, and then a total of two years and a half years later, I don't know wtf i'm doing anymore lol. Struggling from suicidal thoughts every second of my life. I'm turning 29 in two months. Been in mental health programs for a year, therapy and stuff, it's very helpful, but it ended.\n\nAny advice? It's not easy for me to just quit school and get a job in what I used to do again due to struggling with post-concussion syndrome.",

Meanwhile I was interested in completely different majors. Thing was, they don't exhibit the promise of money after graduation.\nNow I feel fucked. Cause obviously expectations were placed on me.",

Student loans and student grants gives me income, whole time I was just focused on my injury...which still strongly debilitates me to this day\n\nI also feel fucked lol. idk man... life's bullshit. are you going to school for something else now?",

Though I worked warehousing, it was sort of better than being jobless and lost in life.\n\nI also want to have a degree or complete post-secondary school in this life, but I also want a decent job afterwards, shits so tough. And i'm not interested in things like IT or STEM, or health, or business, so it's rough lol, I have to pick something I don't like eventually I think. Maybe marketing \u2639",

I like all the humanities courses tbh, sociology, psychology, philosophy, they're so interesting to me. And the fine arts courses like writing. Versus the STEM, business, and health fields, you have to really be into STEM, business, and health, I wish I was, but they don't really interest me-career wise. Although I think economics I might find interesting, haven't tried an economics course.",
