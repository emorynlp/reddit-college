  "title:": "I think my university is dying post covid. Over halfway done with MCS Is it worth switching out at this point?",
  "text": "I'm so frustrated. I'm getting my masters at the university I got my undergrad at. I've got a BS in business and now getting MCS. I loved my undergrad and graduated high honors.\n\nI figured I'd do my masters there since it's so close to my work and it started out fantastic. Faculty was great and I am holding a 4.00.\n\nThen covid hit and it all went downhill. While remote most faculty got let go and replaced with adjuncts mostly. The ones that remained are the oldest and seem the most burnt out, especially my department head. I'm in a Network Infrastructure course being taught by department head and the dude just does not care.\n\nOnly online, no physical labs only packetracer, no live lecture (instead watch pre recorded videos from 2017), office hours only two a week (not every week, have only had three in an eight week course), and no homework has been graded by him (just netacademy that doesn't tell me where I made mistakes so I'm not learning from them)\n\nThis feels like it's on the level of a poor quality community College class, not an accredited grad program at a private non profit university. \n\nI am considering changing programs but am just little over halfway complete with it. I'm not sure what to do.\n\nPart of me wants to just power through and at least get the degree but that feels pointless in a stem field if I'm not prepared for technical interviews.\n\nAnyone been in a similar circumstance? I'm the first in my family to go to college let alone start a masters program. I'm 30 (part time student was all I could afford while working two jobs) so I'm not sure if it's even worth it.\n\nShould I stay or should I go? I'm still passionate to learn and can handle remote as long as it's a quality faculty. If any recommendations please let me know.\n\nAs much as I'd love to power through. I'd be surprised if the kept their accreditation with how things are going and don't want to risk getting a UTI on my resume.",

      "text": "no offense to your decision but it sounds like the university was already pretty bad, then COVID hit. decent universities have enough money to retain tenured faculty and instead freeze hiring/cut holiday bonuses or lay off other staff. remember that nonprofit status doesn't mean it's better than for-profit, it just so happens that all good schools are nonprofit.",
