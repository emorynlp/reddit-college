  "title:": "For some reason feeling really disappointed that my GPA is dropping below Summa",
  "text": "I barely graduated high school. I went back to school after a long hiatus, got my associates. Never thought in my life I would ever get my bachelors degree. Started at a university and set a lofty goal of graduating Summa Cum Laude, knowing it wouldn\u2019t happen and I\u2019d probably fall to magna, which is also very lofty for me. Just kept my head down and did my work. This semester I really got burned out, I\u2019ll end up with A, B-, B+, B+. Last week I went to an advisor to schedule my last semester, and he told me I have a 3.94, well into summa range. I hadn\u2019t even noticed or thought about it. But with this semester ending, it looks like I\u2019ll exit this semester in the area of 3.7. I only have 4 classes left, and won\u2019t be able to get back into summa range, I don\u2019t think.\n\nSorry that was a run on paragraph, but point is I\u2019m fucking devastated over it. Had I known I was doing so well, I would have probably done better this semester, but just had a lot going on and lost focus. \n\nThing is, I shouldn\u2019t be in this position at all. I could very well graduate magna cum laude with a BS. I never thought I would go to college *at all*. I never, and I stress, never gave a fuck about grades before. If I passed with a 65 I was psyched in high school. I graduated with like a 0.9 or some non sense.\n\nNot sure why I\u2019m so salty. But really hoping I can somehow manage summa, because for some reason I can\u2019t explain, I really want it.",

      "text": "I get that! I\u2019m shooting for summa too. I graduate with my associates (and am then transferring) after the spring. I\u2019m right on the line between magma and summa. I think it\u2019s good to have high goals. It shows you have drive and you want to do well. Just don\u2019t let those goals discredit smaller achievements. Magna is still incredibly prestigious! Congrats!",
