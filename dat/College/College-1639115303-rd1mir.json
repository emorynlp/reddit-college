  "text": "\"there's a version of you right now, a couple years **older**, **a couple years wiser**, and exactly as you're so deeply wanting to be. you're their power. **you, right now, is what gets them where they are.\"**\n\n*-astoldbyzozo on tiktok*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sharing this right now because this sub is filled with anxiety, sadness, exhaustion, and frustration. we are all just beginning, in the middle of, or finally completing finals and tensions are high. I get it. but I hope everyone remembers to breathe. this is just one moment of a long journey. take care of yourself and your health. this is a step to your future goals, and if you're not quite sure what those are yet, you'll figure them out. everyone here has made it through a crazy year and a half as if life has been normal, despite experiencing college at a very strange time. I want everyone to take a moment to breathe and relax and remember that you got this.\n\n<3",
