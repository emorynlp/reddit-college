      "text": "Are you wanting to do whole semesters abroad or are you OK with doing something like winters or summers? If it\u2019s the former it might be a little tough because of how colleges make you do so many hours in classes at/from the college. If it\u2019s the latter then look and see what programs are available through your prospective college. For example, the public universities in my state are part of a program where students can do either part of a semester or whole semester abroad and you get your credit from them. (No hassle trying to transfer credits from another institution.)",

Study Abroad spots are limited - any university will want to spread them out to more students, not have a few hogging all the opportunities - and every university requires a minimum number of courses be taken from them, not elsewhere, as its their name on your degree.",
