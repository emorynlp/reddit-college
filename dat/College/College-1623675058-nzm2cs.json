  "text": "As of today, Selective Service will no longer be impacting federal student aid eligibility when reviewing the 2021-2022 FAFSA. In other words, if you did not register for the draft, this will have no bearing on whether or not you can receive federal student aid.\n\nThis is HUGE news, and something we\u2019ve been waiting on for a long time. We had an idea that this was coming, but thought it would be several more years. As someone who\u2019s worked in this field for years, I\u2019ve had to deny many, many students federal aid because of this. Transgender students, students who were incarcerated, and students who were not citizens between the ages of 18-26. Students who *needed* the money.\n\nOutside of FSA, this is huge progress and shows where society, and, more specifically, the Department of Education, currently stands on the SS. It means that, aside from potentially diminished chances at landing a government job, consequences of not registering are nearly nonexistent.\n\n**Update 1 \u2014 We\u2019ve just been informed that this change also grants eligibility for students who would otherwise be ineligible due to \u201cdrug offense restrictions.\u201d Yes. This was also a thing.**",

Like I get being a transwoman in the army would probably suck, but from the other responses it sounds like no one thinks a draft will ever happen, so why wouldn't trans people be able to sign up just to be able to get aid like most people?\n\nEdit: I really am just confused, like it also looks like trans people can change their paperwork with the social security anyway?",

When piecing together the basic elements of the 13th Amendment, the Draft is quite literally in opposition to our rights as Americans, and many would say this violation is veiled as patriotism. The courts have ruled against this idea, but haven\u2019t really presented a clear answer as to why SS is constitutional. I want to be clear though that this is simply a stance, and I understand there are opposing arguments on the topic. This is just where I stand on it. \n\nThat said, I think removing this requirement in FSA eligibility is beneficial to many parties, particularly those who might have otherwise been unfairly disqualified, due to not knowing about the draft, or not able to register for whatever reason.",

      "text": "This is a genuine question and I hope it doesn\u2019t come off as rude - I truly want to learn. \n\nHow does signing up for Selective Service affect DREAMers and our Trans community? I thought it just means you\u2019ll get drafted if there is a war, and people haven\u2019t been drafted since Vietnam. Haven\u2019t the past three generations of students been 100% safe from having to unwillingly serve? I\u2019m pretty sure trans students and individuals without their papers are allowed to serve, right? Isn\u2019t military service a legitimate path to citizenship? Are students who were incarcerated not allowed to be drafted? \n\nThanks!",

          "text": "This is a really good question. Fortunately, it is incredibly unlikely that the draft will ever be used again, so people don\u2019t really need to be worried about serving against their will. At this point, it\u2019s about perception \u2014 how the U.S. government sees and acknowledges individuals, particularly minorities, such as immigrants and transgender people. \n\nIf you were born a male and then transitioned to female, for example, you are required to register for the Selective Service, regardless of your current gender identity. This speaks a lot on how this country\u2019s government sees trans individuals. It shows a profound lack of acknowledgement to their existence. \n\nLikewise, if you\u2019re an immigrant, even one without a green card throughout the ages of 18-26, you\u2019re STILL required to register. So, non-citizens are not exempt from this law.\n\nAs far as incarcerated individuals go, I see more students than I\u2019d like who were locked up during the ages of 18-26, and who were not able to register because of their incarceration. Before today, they\u2019d be ineligible to receive federal aid.\n\nAbolishing the draft doesn\u2019t necessarily need to happen because people are afraid to go to war. It needs to happen because it\u2019s outdated, discriminatory, and uses young people as insurance in the event that it will ever need used again.",

          "text": "Well, 18-26, but yeah \u2014 Failure to register if your assigned gender at birth is male is technically illegal. You could receive a fine of up to $5,000 USD and/or five years locked up; however both of these consequences are exceedingly rare today. A much more common consequence of not registering is being denied federal student aid (i.e., Pell Grant) even if you\u2019d otherwise qualify. This is why it\u2019s such a big deal that the Department of Education is now waiving this requirement.\n\nThere are many circumstances in which a student was not aware or was not able to register for the SS. For example, I see many Reservists who enlisted fresh out of high school, and who didn\u2019t think they\u2019d need to register because they\u2019re already serving. Which makes total sense. But before today, these individuals would have been ineligible to receive federal student aid. A lot more people are impacted by this then you might think.",

I imagine you could be removed from the SS database by renouncing your citizenship and moving away, but that\u2019s a lot of trouble for something that\u2019s never going to be used again anyway.",

You can't really legally get out of registering with the selective service short of renouncing your citizenship and leaving the country or spending the ages 18-25 institutionalized. In the unlikely scenario there was an actual draft, you could potentially avoid being inducted for a variety of medical, personal, or moral reasons.",
