  "text": "So I\u2019m going to technical school, and it feels like I\u2019m not doing anything right. It feels like I can\u2019t remember anything. Is it just me or can anyone else kinda remember what the teacher said in class?                                               Also, feels like everyone else is not real studying and is either working or partying. How often do you study in a given day?",
