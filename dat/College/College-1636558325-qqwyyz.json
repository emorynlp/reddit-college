  "text": "Hey everyone, \nI am thinking about changing my major (currently computer science). Math is just not my thing anymore, I was very smart at it when I was in high school but I have no interest in studying math anymore, I just can\u2019t stand it.\n\nI enjoy searching for hours and writing, and was thinking about changing my major to either criminal justice (been my interest since I started college) or social work ( a friend of mine who has a degree in criminal justice said to look into it).\n\nSo I was wondering, if anyone had any experience with these two majors, what\u2019s the main difference? And which is better for the future?",

Once you're done with school, leverage the marketability of CS and get a job you like that doesn't have to do with the math aspects.",

              "text": "I know it's daunting right now, but I'd still suggest sticking with it. Rearrange classes so you give yourself a semester without math so you get a break, take advantage of tutoring/ study groups, whatever you gotta do. \n\nJust as a point of reference, I understand that social work is a noble field, however my local county starts folks with a bachelor's at $17 an hour, and those with a master's at $23, all capping at less than $30 an hour. All fine and dandy, but you can make that without spending tens of thousands on college.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re interested in these majors you should talk to a counselor about the different classes you will be taking for each, as well as the type of job prospects you will have after college. I don\u2019t think you should stay in computer science if you really don\u2019t care to work with computers/math in the future. However, it is still important to look into what careers will be available with these majors since college is a huge investment that you wouldn\u2019t want to waste. So basically, talk to a counselor! (That\u2019s my advice for almost everyone)",

Also I used to be a CJ major, and also realized that many of those careers require at least a masters. I would definitely look up career fields your interested in and see what the academic requirements are and then go from there!",

I don\u2019t have interest in law enforcement, but there are a lot of options that criminal justice can lay a foundation for- personally I\u2019m leaning towards criminal psychology.
