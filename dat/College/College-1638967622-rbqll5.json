  "text": "I feel like my grades kept going down since the midterm period. I was on track to do well in so many classes but the wheels fell off and I am now in jeopardy of not getting a 3.0gpa.\n\nWhen I did so well in the midterms, I actually put what I studied in my life. I once heard an MV of a pop song, and sang my class notes to its tune. I was also practicing a lot for different classes, doing case studies and tons of extra practice. I once calculated the work done for the water to fill up my cup. A week after the midterms was my ABRSM video submission deadline. I had a lot to catch up then as I was busily preparing for ABRSM piano exam and put less effort in my studies. This quickly became a habit btw.\n\nFor the next semester, I am doing a four track revision method after the midterm. I treat each track as a service name on the Shinkansen, given my railfan nature. \n\nFirst, we have the Mizuho, which runs from 2 weeks before the start of term to the last teaching week. This service makes two stops per day, with one stop being one course, skimming over new content to be taught.\n\nThen we have the Hikari. This service makes stops on my class days, giving myself a review of the content, and possibly write a song on the content. \n\nThe third service is the Kodama, which makes stops on each day without classes. I will use these days to get an extension on what I learnt, such as doing case studies or projects on things I am interested in, related to those classes. Some extra practice may also be done.\n\nThe last service is the Nozomi which sets off after the first week, giving me an opportunity to skim through things I have learnt and do some practice on them.\n\nAs a Liverpool fan myself, I know what the team did in 2005 and 2019, winning despite trailing by 3 goals at some point.  I hope this makes me a comeback.",
