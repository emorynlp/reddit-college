  "text": "I'm a Chemical Engineering student from Malaysia. Most of the universities here are still implementing online learning. I have been in online learning for 3 semesters. Tbh, it's getting really challenging and tiring. It's draining me day by day. Till the point, I have decided I want to postpone my studies for a semester or maybe a year. It's just not for me anymore. Each day I woke up I feel like I've been forced to join online class, listen to lectures and do assignments. I no longer have interest to continue. But I don't want to quit though. I still want to finish it and graduate. Even though I'm almost in my final year but my brain, my mind, my body can no longer accept it. I don't want to hurt myself. Just wish me the best guys. I hope this is the best decision \ud83d\ude14",
