That you're better off doing trade and then earning 6 - figures in r/antiwork esque fashion? obviously I'm exaggerating, but calling four years an \"entitlement\" after a century of intense marketing it falsely and nobody being held responsible. and then calling the grads suffering under unemployment because they didn't know the game \"entitled\" it's too much\n\ncomplaints about something being broken are very valid, because those in power already know how to fix it",
