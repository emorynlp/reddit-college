              "text": "I misread the original question. Apologies. If you failed classes, yes it can effect admittance. Most like for GPA's to be on the higher side, and at minimum 3.0. More competitive schools want it much much higher, but a 3.5 is considered good in general. If you have fails/withdraws everywhere you need to address what was going on in your life and what has changed. Schools want your GPA for every college you've attended / the transcript. If you were doing okay and just decided it wasn't right for you, you'll also need to address why this is your passion now.",
