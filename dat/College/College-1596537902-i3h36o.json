  "text": "I never planned to start at 22. I graduated HS in 2017. I didn't know what I wanted to do and time just went by so fast. I got caught up in work and home life. I wanted to start this fall, but, I can't do online classes. I tried to do them over the summer but ended up wasting money and withdrawing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've decided that I will start in the Spring. Hopefully schools will be opened. I will be 22 in January which is kinda a bummer. If I started in 2017, I would be done. Kinda mad about it. Any late starters here? I'm gonna get my BSN.",

I am a junior, but in the process of applying to transfer to a new college, so I don't know if I will be a sophomore, junior, or a senior for a couple years yet. Basically, I am in the same boat! Don't make a big deal out of it, and people will be none the wiser. If you talk about age, some people may say you are a grandma/grandpa, but you get to call 17-18 year olds babies (in a joking but loving way, don't be a jerk.) You may not relate as much to the 17-18 year old crowd and some 19 year olds, but as long as you don't make a big deal out of it, literally nobody will care. Also, there will be people older than you as well. I am currently 23 with approx. 2-3 years to go. Personally, I am concerned about missing out on college life when I age out of dorms, but if I just live near campus, it will literally be like I am an on campus student, but with the freedom of commuting.",

I met people that I thought were teenagers and they were in their late 20s surprisingly. So you're never alone, there's always someone your age and older around. It's all about personal growth and new opportunities.",

      "text": "Kinda in a similar boat. I also graduated in 2017 and went to college right after, but left in spring 2019 because I was still undeclared four semesters in. I worked up until the pandemic shut down my job, and now I\u2019m taking online community college classes. I most likely won\u2019t be able to transfer until 2022 at the earliest in which by then I\u2019ll also be 22-23. \n\nEasier said than done, but I really wouldn\u2019t sweat it that much. To be honest, I applaud you for not going right away if you didn\u2019t know what you wanted to do.  People told me to go anyways and \u201cfigure it out there\u201d, which I\u2019m sure works for some people, but I ended up wasting a lot of time and money giving in to that pressure. It\u2019s true that most people in our graduating class who went to college will graduate next year, but with the pandemic-induced recession happening, having to delay entering the professional working world isn\u2019t the worst thing. I think since you worked full time and have a bit of life experience under your belt school may be easier for you and you may be more respected by your professors.  \n\nWhen I was still in college the majority of my classmates were also \u201ctraditional\u201d students but you\u2019d be surprised at the amount of older people that are in class as well. Depending on how you plan to do college you can have a similar experience as a traditional student by living on campus, eating at the dining halls, joining clubs, etc. but it really depends on what your priorities are and if you\u2019re able to pay for such. People won\u2019t really care if you\u2019re an older undergrad and probably wouldn\u2019t know unless you told them. In terms of making friends I think whether or not you click is more important than if you\u2019re the same age, but if you\u2019d want to find people your age to hang out with seniors and grad students are usually in their early to mid 20s. \n\nGood luck and congrats for going back!",

Personally, I think you are making the right choice here because I feel there is a really strong social pressure to go to college straight from high school, especially considering most students really are not sure what they want to get out of college or if they really even need it in the first place.  Considering online school is going to likely be a thing for this next year, i think you are making the right choice here. Some people will say that online school is better than nothing but its all about meeting people, getting the experience to live on your own, finding new hobbies, growing your professional and interpersonal skills, etc many things you really just cant get from home right now.\n\nAlso, This isnt a race against. I will not be graduating with my class because i need to take care of myself first and so shoud you. It is all about where you are now relative to yesterday and that is what matters most. There are definitely free online courses everywhere to continute your self development or skills one way or another for almost no money. It is difficult to think about what could have been had certain choices werent made but you may find that taking this time will have been worth it to know for sure what your plans are. Hope this helped a bit :) What are you planning on studying by chance?",

I don't tell people how old I am and everyone assumes I'm 19/20 until I tell them otherwise. And most people that I've told have said, \"Oh, cool,\" and then never brought it up again because it's just not relevant to most of the things you do in college. Your age can offer you experience and knowledge that freshman don't have so you can often add a lot to discussions in class and offer advice to any friends.",

It was a hard transition and I didn\u2019t have the discipline nor right study system to do well. I was also working during this time too and lived with roommates bc I moved out when I turned 18 (no strong family support + other issues). I tried to take more classes the term afterwards but it didn\u2019t workout and I fucked up my gpa at that one school with just 7 credits. \n\n\nIt took me almost over a year to get back in school, this time at another community college. I took around 41 credits from summer 2019 to spring 2020. I learned how to focus on my work and really talk to your professors whenever you can, ie. after class, email, office hours. It really helps in a lot of situations, such as extensions, second chances, etc. And now I\u2019m transferring to a great 4 year school at 21 years old to a school that has everything I need and want! Hard work really does pay off. \n\n\nMy fall term at my new school is also going to be all online, but because my classes from the spring and others in previous terms have been online, I\u2019ve adjusted. Also i really don\u2019t want to wait any longer to take classes for my major.\n\nI feel bad sometimes that I didn\u2019t start school like how my other friends and hs classmates did, but I had personal reasons as to why I couldn\u2019t. Still sucked tho but at least I have working experience and been in the real world. I just think to myself that if I were to start back then, I would have wasted my time doing something I wouldn\u2019t want to do now. Also I wouldn\u2019t have been able to experience the other things outside of school and met people who helped me grow. \n\n\nI think what\u2019s really important is that everyone has their own timelines; it shouldn\u2019t be a race but stick to your goals, and they\u2019ll come.",

I graduated in 2017 too and while I went to university immediately, I couldn\u2019t handle the 15 credits I had to take to keep my scholarship so I took W\u2019s for my classes and dropped out. I took the next semester off and started again online in summer 2018, but I\u2019ve only been doing part time since then so I\u2019m still a sophomore in credits. I turn 21 this month, want to get an associate\u2019s by next summer, then hopefully graduate with my bachelor\u2019s by fall 2022, and I\u2019ll be 23 by then. (The only way I\u2019ll finish my bachelor\u2019s by that time is if I enroll in an online degree that lets me accelerate the amount of classes I\u2019m in so I can finish quicker.) I didn\u2019t even figure out what I really wanted to study till about 3 months ago. I first picked nursing when I started college, then I changed it to nutrition, but now it\u2019s English/literature bc that\u2019s truly my passion and what I originally started thinking of studying back in high school when I was planning for college.\n\nIt\u2019s taken some time for me to accept I won\u2019t be finishing when I wanted to bc I want to hurry up and move on from this stage and start the rest of my life. I\u2019ve had to realize the only person that actually cares is me and it\u2019s not actually a big deal. It\u2019s still a huge accomplishment to finally get that degree. Plenty of people don\u2019t start college after high school and they still turn out successful. My own mom did it, graduating from high school in 1998 then being in college from 2003-2014. Yes, a lot of people graduate high school and then graduate college 4 years later, but there are also sooo many people who don\u2019t have traditional education journeys. More than you would expect. I believe everything happens for a reason, so I think there\u2019s a reason you\u2019ve waited till now to start college. Maybe you weren\u2019t ready after high school, like me, so you\u2019ve had to take time and practice navigating life to prepare you for college and the expectations. Don\u2019t think about how this part of your life \u201chasn\u2019t gone right,\u201d just focus on what *will* go right after you figure this out.",

I was worried about being older than other students, but it didn\u2019t really make much of a difference because no one asks your age. I firmly believe starting at a later age, while a bummer, can really help because college is taken more seriously. If anything, being in the workforce and working entry level jobs makes you more passionate about getting an education. \nWhat really helped me was being involved in student senate because I got to become involved in college events and knew a group of students I could socialize with. A lot of them were younger (around 18 to 19) but there were also people my age and older. I really enjoy being an older student as I am more serious and really know what I want to do with my education. It does suck that I will be done after those I graduated with because I\u2019m just getting my associates while they are getting their bachelors, but I feel like I\u2019m getting an education at a time that works better for me and will help me become more successful in a way\u2014 mostly because I know how to ask for help from advisors and I know what to do in terms of internships.",

That put my back as a sophomore when I would\u2019ve been a junior but oh well. Go at your pace and honestly no one will care about your age and they probably won\u2019t know unless you say so.

I started college right out of high school (graduated HS in 2012) but then I \"took a semester off\" for mental health reasons at the beginning of 2014. Didn't go back until 2018. It's a bummer when I think about the fact that I could be practically a doctor if I wanted to by now and even have more than enough credits for a dang master's degree given all the stuff that didn't transfer when I restarted (new school). That simply does suck and it's not ridiculous if it is a bit of a grieving process for you to get past it.\n\nAnother caution: colleges are full of administrative bullshit which may slow you down more or at least make you worry that you might be slowed down (course availability, approvals, etc.). You might also slow yourself down from your current plan if you hit unexpected struggles. It's part of the game so accept it and take deep breaths and flow with the bullshit. I've put myself through a lot of stress for not much payoff worrying about the outcomes of such things. Good luck out there and thanks for going into nursing!",
