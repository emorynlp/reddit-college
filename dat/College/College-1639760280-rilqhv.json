  "text": "Does college take all ur time away into studying, lectures, homework? I see ppl say it\u2019s more flexible than HS. Idk if that\u2019s true. Is college just like community college in terms of workload, and overall how much time you spend doing the work? I ask because I got other important things I do other than school, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not gonna have time for em.\n\nAlso is college harder than community college?",

      "text": "It really depends on the class and also the professor. I\u2019ve had stem and non-stem classes that ate up most of my time, and I\u2019ve had classes that were easy breezy. You won\u2019t know what your free time will look like until you\u2019re settled into class. But chances are, if you\u2019re taking 9 or more units, you\u2019ll be pretty busy every week.\n\nI\u2019m in community college and I would say it\u2019s pretty hard. Everything is relative tho. And it\u2019s all in the moment. Classes I miss and look back on fondly were absolute torture in the moment, but I learned a lot.\n\nGood luck. I hope you find a balance.",

      "text": "Like someone else said, it depends. \n\n\nAs a music education major in the honors college, I took 19 credit hours this past semester. Much of my free time was spent practicing, studying, doing homework, and meeting extracurricular degree requirements. There was no time for me to get an outside job, even on the weekends. \n\n\nOn the other hand, I know a lot of people only taking 15 credit hours and they had a lot of free time, even if they were also in the honors college. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, you do have control over your class schedule. When I built mine for next semester, I did it with what I wanted in mind. If more free time is what you want, schedule all your classes as early as possible so you have afternoons free.",

      "text": "I found college the same as community college. The amount of busy work cut down from community college levels. Many classes in my major also had more writing, less exams, and more reading than community college, but overall I felt I was spending the same amount of time.\n\nIt all depends on your college and your community college, as well as how each college approaches each major.",

      "text": "depends on the class & professor. i took 5 classes this semester, i am a cs major. the math class was the least bit of time because my prof didn't give homework or anything, it was just all tests. probably 1-2 hr commitment per week. 3-4 on test weeks, not bad. there was programming theory class i took though that took the most time. extremely long homeworks. exams were brutal and also long. each homework took like a full day, morning to past midnight, of straight work to finish. i also took a systems programming class, on average it was like a 1-2 hr commitment per week. but when exams / projects were in the air, easy 25+ hr commitment.\n\nas for is university harder than community college, imo no, they are the same. university for me has just been more work, but about the same level of difficulty. sometimes even easier than cc was. a lot of that depends on the classes though. like in cc i took 2 engineering physics courses which are weed out classes, those were really hard. i also took linear algebra but it was proof based, that was hard as well. those 3 are among my most difficult classes i've taken in the whole degree. glad i knocked it all out before university tho, because i had decent professors at the cc.",

      "text": "I'm a current university student who transferred from a cc last year. College is definitely more flexible than highschool. Not only do YOU get to choose your classes, but you also get to choose the dates and times of those classes. And you can tailor each class time and day to suit your personal weekly schedule.\n\nWhen you refer to \"college\" I'm assuming you're referring to a 4-year university. And the workload difference between a community college and a 4-year would largely depend on the university itself. Some universities are semester based, which means they have the same 16-18 week curriculum as cc's. Other universities are quarter based, which means they have a 10 week curriculum that's more fast paced; these would be your research universities or UC schools. \n\nAs someone who goes to a quarter system, i'd say the workload is vastly more difficult than community college, not because there's more work, but rather, my professors are all researchers. And the material they provide challenges you to apply what you've learned in real life. There's little room for extra credit or slacking off on course material. Midterms are every two weeks and the exams determine a large part of your grade.  In short, you have to stay on top of things. Personally, I think quarter based universities take take your time away the most, as opposed to semester based ones.",

      "text": "Very dependent on your major as well. I am a chem major and I spend most of my day studying, taking classes, and labs. It is a full-time job in a sense and I treat it that way: I clock out at a certain time in the evening and relax and spend time with friends (if deadlines allow).  It's more flexible in the sense that you have a couple of hours of classes a day, but you *need* to stay on top of your assignments and studies.",

Depends which state your in, I'm in one of those states where a \"state college\" is basically community college but they offer bachelor's degree as well. But all the assignments and courses are community college level, aka very easy lol. I also take most of my classes online so as long as I turn the assignments in before 11:59pm Sunday night then I'm good. And whenever there's a long paper due the prof. lets us know at the beginning of the class.",
