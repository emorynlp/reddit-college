  "title:": "I just failed my calculus quiz that I should\u2019ve got an A on",
  "text": "Studied the past three days,\n\nOur quiz is 25 min. I screwed up on the first problem by implementing the wrong technique which took up like 15 min.\n\nLooked at #1 again and saw how I made such a simple mistake, so I quickly fixed it. Looked at the other problems and I also knew how to do them \n\nBut I didn\u2019t have time to finish them\u2026\n\nThus was a really easy quiz that I fucked up on. I have a high B+ in the class and am so sad because this will bring it down. It\u2019s worth a lot of points. The quarter is almost over and I need an A in this class. I have big goals of transferring to UCLA and other big names. \n\nHow can I stop feeling bad? I studied so much and should\u2019ve gotten an A\u2026",

Then circle back to the longer more complicated ones.\n\nSometimes the test wins, and we just have to learn from it for the next time. No need to dwell on it, but evaluating things for future exams can be fruitful (:",

When I looked up the clock on canvas, I had 15 mins left and I only finished 25 questions. I failed that midterm bad. But then the TA gave ECs so I could still maintain my A. Praying for you.",

You could've gotten a better grade if u didnt waste time on #1 but its still the grade you deserved cause you didnt finish. Just learn from this and move forward.",

I really appreciate when instructors focus more on learning vs evaluation, so if they\u2019re reasonable, you might find a better path forward for showing your progress.

Worst comes to worst, you show them that you care very much about your grades. That sets you up for a letter of recommendation. You\u2019ll be okay. And don\u2019t feel like you have to move mountains in calculus from now on. People always say \u201cjust try harder\u201d but really, effort is a limited resource. Keep trying but learn from the experience and be mindful about the overall technique that must be used for certain types of problems. Learn to skip problems and go back later if they become way too time consuming. \n\nOh and eff these people who say you got the grade you deserved.
