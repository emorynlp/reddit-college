  "text": "I am 22 years old, graduated college in May, and started a full time job a month ago. I have been really down about it. I feel like I have no freedom anymore with my job and all I do is work. It sickens me to think that I have to work the rest of my life now. How do people do it? Every day I think of an alternate way to make money besides the traditional job. I miss all my friends and how life was in college.  All I do now is sit at a desk for 8 hours. What kind of life is that? What do others do right out of college and how are you feeling?",

So I don\u2019t have a solution either, but I totally recommend you do what I\u2019m doing before you get a house, kids, wife, etc.  Go solo travel the world, go hike, have a drink in all different places.\n\nI\u2019m considering joining the Air Force and applying to be a pilot or navigator.  That\u2019s something I\u2019ll at least find extremely interesting and honorable and be proud of",

      "text": "I completely empathize with the sentiments expressed in your OP, but just wanted to let you know that while I felt the exact same way for a while I eventually began to really enjoy my life as a professional more than as a student. It took some getting used to, but the challenges that came with my profession really kept me interested more than school ever did. At first I didn\u2019t have many responsibilities and so I was just bored and felt like my life from then on would be that of an office drone, never thinking critically or being challenged. Once I actually made some headway in my field though everything changed and I really enjoyed the fact that my goals were set by me and I was responsible for my own success. Instead of being given assignments I was deciding upon tasks based on what I thought needed to be done. \nDepending on your field, your experience may differ from mine, and it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll never be as happy as you would be in an academic setting, but I just wanted to let you know from my experience that it\u2019s also possible that once you get some more responsibilities and more autonomy at your job you may begin to enjoy it way more than being a student. Whatever happens, I hope you eventually find what makes you happy and are able to pursue that. Too many people hate their lives and life is too short to be spent like that. Whatever happens, I wish you the best of luck.",

What kind of life is that?\n\nIt sounds like you should have a lot of free time to socialize and pursue your hobbies in the evenings and on the weekends.  If you aren't doing those things, why not?    \n\nI enjoyed college, but I don't miss homework, exams, living with roommates, or having very little money.  Life after college is what you make of it.  I have developed new interests, met lots of new friends, traveled to interesting places, and gone from having a pretty boring entry-level job to a better job that is more interesting and more challenging.  \n\nIf your job is the core source of dissatisfaction, stick it out for a year and reevaluate whether this is a career path you want to continue with.  Entry-level professional jobs are often dull or involve work tasks that other people don't want to do.  It gets better as you gain experience, develop skills, and get promoted into a role with more autonomy and/ or responsibilities.  If you still dislike your job after a year, start looking for something different.  You shouldn't need to return to college in order to find a different job unless you want to enter a field where a specific degree is a necessary qualification.   \n\nIf you are unhappy about not having much else going on in your life other than your job, you can fix that within the next few months by making more of an effort to get out and do things in your free time.  Make new friends and pursue new hobbies if you want to lead a richer, more fulfilling life.",

I don't really miss school so much as I miss working with the people at my old job and the fact my old city had a hell of a lot more to do than the gulf states. However, I like my desk job. I can do awesome engineering work, am surrounded by awesome people, and have gotten back into shape making some gains. \nHaving a woman again would be nice, though.",

It isn't all life is, but it is a major part of it, and figuring out how to deal with it will be a very important skill for any person. Next, do other things besides the mundane. Find a hobby, go on a trip, explore your city, meet up with some friends. There is more to life than just work, and work may just be the tool to get to the more fulfilling things. It may not be THE fulfilling thing. \n\nI just don't think clinging to Uni is going to be sustainable or healthy for you and your future.
