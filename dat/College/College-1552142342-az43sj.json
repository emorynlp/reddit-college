  "text": "There\u2019s a girl on my floor who completely destroys the toilet stalls. They\u2019re always covered in her feces. The other day there was crap on the toilet seat itself and somehow on the wall behind it. I feel so bad for the custodian who has to clean it up. \n\nWould it be mean to put a note near the toilet next time it happens that\u2019s says \u201cEither go to the doctor or clean your crap up. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting and immature that this keeps happening\u201d ",

Sometimes it's just people from other places who aren't used to western fixtures, other times it's because someone raised them to be afraid of touching toilet seats (I've met American women who were that way due to messed-up moms), sometimes it's just an odd personal preference. But as you'd imagine, anyone hovering a couple of feet above the seat is going to make a mess fairly often.",
