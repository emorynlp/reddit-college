If you grade is already an F it takes a lot of work to bring it to an A. I am not saying its not possible to go from an F to an A. I am saying its not likely from ONE assignment.\n\nJust like how if you were at a 95%, a 0% on one assignment won't drop you to 56%. \n\nEither he has only 3 assignment the entire semester and the grade is heavily scaled, or this is not true.",

Even if you are doing poorly in a class, if you demonstrate a basic grasp of the material and consistent improvement, you\u2019ll get the benefit of the doubt. Communicating with a Prof (or boss) about problems you\u2019re having shows that you care - even if you don\u2019t think the interaction necessarily helped you. If you\u2019re close to passing, the student who shows that they tried and cared will make it (this is less true in some undergrad sciences where your grade is less open to interpretation).\n\nTLDR; Always at least pretend to care and try and you\u2019ll get by.\n\n[Source: am old]",
