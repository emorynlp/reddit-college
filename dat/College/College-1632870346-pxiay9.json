  "text": "I\u2019m a fifth year student so I have had a lot of experience with college in person exams and classes and even thought it was stressful at times, it was doable. After zoom classes, online speeches and online exams I just lack motivation to study and put forth effort. I am trying my best but I\u2019m not dealing with the stress well at all. Anxiety has been worse with exams this week and next and I\u2019m just counting down till I get a break. I don\u2019t know how I did my hardest semester in person pre covid, it seems like something I could never do now. \n\nDoes anyone else relate? I\u2019ve been seeing people say covid hurt them in terms of grades but I couldn\u2019t feel more the opposite.",

      "text": "Weirdly my profs are still conducting online exams despite in person classes. Honestly I\u2019d rather have unlimited time for an in person exam compared to a short time for an online exam. In general I really dislike online exams even though I know they tend to be popular with students. However, I think it\u2019s more of a false sense of security thing because usually you don\u2019t have much time to look at notes so I doubt average scores are much higher.",

I'm taking 16 credits of all technical math/engineering courses but I'm completely burned out, have zero interest in any of my classes, and I have negative free time. I'm drowning in work and I only keep getting further behind. I'm at least a week behind in most of my classes, and yesterday I couldn't sleep till 6 AM since I broke out in itchy hives all over my ass and legs from the stress. \n\nYeah, ain't having a great time here : ^ )",

When things were online, a class being 1 hour really meant 1 hour.  In person class is 1 hour + 15 minutes to get there + 15 minutes to get back + another 30-60 minutes to get back into a workflow of some kind.\n\nPlanning my day has been really tough and I feel incredibly scatter brained.",
