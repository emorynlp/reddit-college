  "title:": "Dutch exchange student here, which university do you advice me to go to? (14 options)",
  "text": "Dear Americans, I am a 19 year old university student (International Business) from the Netherlands, and next year from mid-August until mid-December I have the chance to go on exchange to the USA. I have 14 options, but have a hard time making a choice, since google does not provide very clear answers and based on the fact that I just have so many choices...\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which university/ies would you recommend or really advise against, and why? Please also tell me about experiences you had, I\u2019m interested in your story! (Or leave any tips, maybe regarding my method of researching)\n\nA bit extra info:\n- I do NOT need to pay any tuition, so more expensive uni\u2019s don\u2019t have a bigger impact on my budget (the accommodation/living costs however do)\n\n- 3 things I find important: \n1. Quality of education. Besides that, I have a preference for more practical education/courses (more focussed on developing skills), since I\u2019m now used to courses just based on research (completely unpractical)\n2. Experiencing the \u2018real\u2019 American college/university life (sports, parties, general atmosphere etc)\n3. Interesting area. Both the near surroundings as where the place is on a national level, given that I would like to make a few bigger trips during my time in the USA.\n\nUniversities:\n* Babson College \n* Emory (Goizueta Business school)\n* Florida international university\n* Florida State university\n* Georgia state university\n* Ohio state university (Fisher college of business)\n* University of Maryland (Robert H. Smith)\n* University of Michigan (Ross)\n* University of North Carolina (Kenan-Flagler)\n* University of South Carolina (Darla Moore)\n* University of Virginia (McInitre)\n* University of Washington (Foster)\n* Texas Tech university (Rawls)\n* Tulane University (A.B. Freeman)\n\nMy research so far suggests that the following would, purely educationally speaking, be the best: Babson, Emory, Michigan, North Carolina, Washington and Virginia (Don\u2019t know about Virginia since it always states Darden instead of McInitre). \nIs my research on this aspect right so far? Besides, do you recommend state or private schools?\n\nThanks for reading this all, it\u2019s a lot but that hopefully makes it easier to give a recommendation, your help is very much appreciated! :)",

      "text": "Beyond the top 10 or so business schools, state and private are mixed and neither are necessarily better.\n\nThe ones in closer proximity to the Northeast (NYC, DC, PHL) and West (LA, SF, SEA) would be better as an exchange student. You will be close to several large cities for networking and attending events, trains are more realistic options in those areas, and airfare prices are going to be lower on average.\n\nBabson and Washington will have high cost of living. Virginia and NC are lower cost of living ones for the coast.",

      "text": "Ohio State will give you the absolute college experience, biggest school in the state, 1 academically. Huge party school, massive football games, parties down every street, the graduation rate is ridiculously high and the school has an insane reputation for when you apply for jobs and internships, you are also in the capital of Ohio a major city with plenty of businesses. Not that expensive as some other major cities.my sister goes there as do 2 of my close friends.",
