  "text": "On Mondays and Wednesdays I go into college while Tuesdays I do online learning. On both in college days I feel incredibly nauseous, dizzy and begin to need the bathroom a lot more but on Tuesdays I'm completely fine, I wake up the same not in a total rush and don't rush around I take my time, I make sure not to eat spicy or greasy food on the days I have college and I try stay hydrated. The thing is when I get to college I'm better I don't feel as dizzy or nauseous but why do I experience this?",

      "text": "Sounds like anxiety. I used to break out in hives on my trunk the night before school. You can try taking a Benadryl the night before. Benadryl acts as an anti anxiety agent. Side effects are morning drowsiness if you don\u2019t allow at least 8 hours of sleep and can cause dry mouth and eyes. You may want to see a doctor about it as well.  There are many prescription medications as well.",
