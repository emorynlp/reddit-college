  "title:": "(Mention of suicide) Does college always feel like that?",
  "text": "I started college in August thinking that I would have a very difficult but still fun time there, but... Oh my god it's so much worse than I thought.\n\nIn high school, I only agreed to go on college because it was practical, not by interest. Still, I hate my subjects to the point that I changed programs for the next year. Even there, I feel like choosing the least bad of my two options.\n\nI cry everyday. High school was painfully hard, but college is so bad that I thought of suicide (I won't do it, but the intrusive thoughts are incredibly hard to get rid of). \n\nWill it someday get easier and actually fun, or do I need to accept the suffering and just get over it?\n\nEDIT1: I have a \"tutor\" that basically helps me with organizing myself and staying motivated. It... doesn't really work on the motivation, but at least the organization stuff is going well.",

I think that college just isn't for everyone, and it's better to admit failure, than deal with all that stress.\n\nI have a colleague who pushed hard in college, international relations.\nHe got addicted to sleeping pills, and their side effects are lingering to this day, 5 years after he stopped taking them - he have major anxiety due to downregulated receptors from benzodiazepine abuse. His liver is damaged and he has serious health issues, I don't fully know why, but it's connected with college. He's just 30yo. His degree didn't get him anything. He went to the same profession as me, and is making less then me, even though I am 22yo and I have no degree. It straight up wasn't worth it to him with all that stress.\n\nEdit: typo",
