      "text": "Does your school have a dead week or a reading day or something between the end of the semester and start of finals week?\n\nMy best advice is to plan out whatever time you have, and set how many hours you want to study, and then make plans for what relaxing you might want to do. I actually found finals week to be more relaxing than midterms because classes were over, so you could entirely set your own schedule, study exactly what you needed to, and had everything laid out before you. My first finals week, we watched the beginning of Avatar: The Last Air Bender. Also, study with friends, even if they aren't in your major because it helps you break it up and relax a little bit at times",
