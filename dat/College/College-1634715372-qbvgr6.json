And when I say the cross is easy it\u2019s just a class about how to handle your emotions. There\u2019s nothing hard about that class",

I couldn't have thought of a better time to come back to school really. \n\nI am a grown ass man! Thank you! \n\nI did drop out because I couldn't handle the responsibilities. I kind of did the same thing you are. I blamed it on depression, anxiety and health issues I was going through at the time. That's a really long story that I don't mind sharing but I feel like this isn't the place. If you keep leaning on ADHD why you can't pay attention for the duration of an online class, you'll be in the same position I was.\n\nDo I tell disabled people to pay attention? Uh... if they should be paying attention I would. I mean, I suppose in the right situation I'd tell a person in a wheel chair they couldn't walk because their legs don't work but I really feel like they'd know that. \n\nI really feel like calling yourself disabled because you have ADHD a REAL fuckin' stretch. You're a victim of ADHD. You straight up threw out your responsibilities because you have ADHD and that's that. So far you've had enough determination to type out these posts. That's a lot of concentration.\n\nPeople don't have a problem putting up with my crap. That's because they don't generally come to me with petty problems for advice, then take my advice and say they can't do it because of their 'disability'. I mean, don't get me wrong, we've all got problems but as grown ass people, we keep them to ourselves and don't let a 4 letter acronym that's being handed out by practitioners like they are those tiny Bible's on campus. EVERYONE has ADHD. It's about as human as having 2 nipples.\n\nThe one thing about this post that drives me nuts, and I'll never be able to figure out. I've been reading the last sentence for SO LONG. I thought being a special snowflake was like... a good thing. It's like a double unique. Not only am I a snowflake, which are all unique, but I'm a SPECIAL unique snowflake. That's pretty solid, bro.",
