  "text": "For one Gen Ed category at my college, you have to take a life science course. There is one 2-semester sequence, General Biology 1 and General Biology 2. In the spring semester I joined college, only GB2 was available (since they usually expect you to follow the sequence with GB1 in fall, GB2 in spring). At the time, I was in a major where I expected to do GB1 later anyway, so I chose to take GB2 first. Now, I'm changing my major and I don't want to have to take GB1 since that will do nothing for me.\n\nBut here's the catch: since they expect you to take GB1 first, that is the course that fulfils the life science Gen Ed requirement (listed in the course description). GB2 doesn't mention that it counts for Gen Ed. I'll hopefully be talking to my advisor on whether I can get credit for GB2 in the life science Gen Ed category without having to take GB1. I was just wondering whether anyone here has any similar experiences? Did you ever have any success with getting credit/gen ed credit for courses that were not listed as such? I'm not worried about, just curious if this has been done before with any success.",
