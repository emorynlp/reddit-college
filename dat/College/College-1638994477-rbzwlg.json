      "text": "Lol no. I'm 23 and I'm still in my junior year. My friend graduated at 25. One of my friends started their nursing degree at 26 after finishing their service at the marines. And another friend started community college at 28. Tbh if you already worked at multiple jobs during that 6 year delay, you're better off than most college students that have a bachelor's at 22, alot of extracurriculars, but no work experience. It's a dead end for them. \n\nDo not feel embarrassed. Because nobody in college will care and your age is probably the last thing your classmates will ask you. With covid and everything, you're technically still in that optimal age where you can graduate at 27 or 28, and enter the workforce with year's of experience behind you. Better than most med students that finish residency at 35. You still have years ahead of you to figure shit out. And by the time you graduate, you'll still be in your 20s by the time you land your first full time job.\n\nAs long as you're on track to finish your degree. Things will go according to plan. And the fact that you're pursuing higher education in your early 20s is normal for most people.",

Only downfall was that I was 24 in a class of 18 year Olds. So I didn't have \"adult\" friends, but the teenagers were so nice and they were really funny kids. Now as a senior I have a 33 year old in my class with me. She gave me a good piece of advice when we had a similar conversation, in 4 years you're going to be that age either way,, if you go to school or not, so why not do what you want so when you get to that age you'll have accomplished what you wanted to do. That helped put it in perspective for me.",
