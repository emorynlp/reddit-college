  "text": "Hey guys,\nI\u2019m looking at going to college in the states or Canada on a soccer scholarship (I\u2019m from New Zealand) but unfortunately my GPA is only 2.19. However, this can be explained because a few years ago I was planning on finishing the rest of my schooling in Canada but to do so I had to finish off my New Zealand schooling, so in about 7 months I completed virtually my entirely schooling, but by the time I was done Covid had kicked up and I couldn\u2019t go to Canada or back to school. Now I\u2019m looking at going to college again but I\u2019m stuck with this low GPA so I\u2019m just wondering if I get a high scoring SAT and the likes, Will my GPA be acceptable considering the circumstances? If not does anyone have any clue on what I could do to raise it? \nThanks a lot for your time.",
