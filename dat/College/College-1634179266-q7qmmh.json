  "title:": "Trouble choosing a major",
  "text": "I'm a high school senior looking applying to mainly T30s-T50s. I am really interested in international relations/political science, but i am unsure about attending law school. I also know that job prospects are very limited and hard to get post-grad. \n\nI also would be interested in business, such as finance or management. This would provide me more financial stability, return on investment, and jobs. \n\nMost of my application seems to be geared toward IR/Poli Sci (President of Politics Club, lots of involvement in global organizations, english tutor etc). \n\nShould I follow what I enjoy learning more, or what is more realistic in the long term?\n\nAlso, how will colleges view it if I apply for a business major with relatively little involvement in business ECs. (I took business classes in HS, also raised $10,000 for charity selling stuff, but that's all).",

The finance industry is inv]credibly over saturated now, with jobs not increasing at the level of some other industries.
