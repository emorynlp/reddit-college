  "title:": "Was not able to answer a single question on my Stat quiz",
  "text": "I studied super hard last night & knew about 85%-90% of the work but today when I took my quiz, I forgot how to do EVERYTHING. I couldn\u2019t even answer one question out of three. I bombed my other quiz and exam because I barely studied, but I actually put so much time and effort into studying last night, so I am super upset that I choked on that quiz, and probably only received points for my name. Has this happened to anyone else?? When you knew the material the night before but when you received the math/stat test or quiz, you forget how to do everything? I honestly just want to cry because I already have a 65 in there and I just feel so dumb. I have been trying so hard since I\u2019ve returned back to campus (since I was remote last year) and am drained.",
