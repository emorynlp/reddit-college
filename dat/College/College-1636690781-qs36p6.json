  "text": "okay so i\u2019m in my first year of college, as an anthropology major. so far, i\u2019ve only really been loving my intro to cultural anthro class and a linguistics class about english words. hypothetically, this is good, my grades are good, i\u2019m finding out what i enjoy, etc etc.\n\ni\u2019m just worried about money. as much as i would love to be an anthropologist and spend my time doing fieldwork, i\u2019m not sure how realistic it is for me to do that and financially support myself.\n\ni guess i\u2019m just curious, am i overthinking this? is there a way to pursue anthro and/or linguistics and make a decent living? \n\ni\u2019ve been getting increasingly paranoid about not finding anything to do after graduating with a degree in anthro :/",
