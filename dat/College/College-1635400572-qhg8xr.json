  "text": "I'm a sophomore in college and this semester has been stressful for me as of lately. I've been financially dependent for most of the time being, until I ended up failing my last semester from my first year and I lost some of my financial aid. My parents were upset by this and encouraged me to get a part time job. So far, not one job has accepted me and almost all jobs I've been looking for are full-time, and as a full time student, that won't work well since I have to focus in school. I can't depend on my poor parents for much longer because they're also struggling financially while also saving up for my younger sister who's going to college next year. With the spring semester approaching soon, I know I'll be needing to pay for what I need to continue my education. I don't want to be in such a stressful situation and trouble my parents or myself any longer. Please help!",
