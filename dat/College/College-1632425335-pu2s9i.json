  "text": " I don't know if this is the right place to ask this so if it isn't feel free to remove mods.\n\nI'm  looking to do a semester in the US in two years (we have to start  prepare for these things this early) from Sweden and these are the  universities my uni are working together with.\n\nIdaho  State, North Dakota, Nabraska at Kearney, Bethany College (Kansas),  Northern Kentucky, North Carolina at Greensboro & Indiana university  of Pennsylvania.\n\nMost of these  looks pretty good, but I've also heard horror stories of people going  away to what looks like a good school and it turned out to be really  bad. So does any of these send out red flags? Or green flags for that  matter? Both (more importantly) academics and in \"rest of the package\"  (town, the people there, sports, food etc.)",

      "text": "I didn\u2019t go to Northern Kentucky (NKU) but I have friends who did and I grew up a bit south from there. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s a good school. There are plenty of ways to get involved on campus and in the community. My friends who went there enjoyed it. And on top of that Kentucky is a beautiful place, I absolutely love it here! \n\nNKU is also pretty close to Cincinnati, so if cities with lots of stuff to do is your thing then you won\u2019t be too far away. And if you like hiking, kayaking, outdoor adventuring, there is plenty of that across the state.",

      "text": "Most of these are pretty rural, conservative places. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re in good shape. Personally, I would avoid Kansas as, having spent time there, it\u2019s kind of a wasteland. I know two people who went to Idaho State and both had good experiences.\n\nIf you have the time and the resources, I\u2019d definitely recommend visiting at least your top pick. I can\u2019t count how many of my friends returned home after one year of college because they couldn\u2019t stand the town they were in.",
