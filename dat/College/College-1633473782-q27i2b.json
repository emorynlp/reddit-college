  "title:": "Is it ok to NOT work while studying",
  "text": "Hi I\u2019m a college student on my 5th year of biology I plan on doing graduate studies after my major, I want to get some opinions on a matter because I feel insecure about the fact that other people work part times at retail or groceries (which I worked once at a retail) but now work Uber eats part time while studying. Right now I need grades rather than quick money but I feel insecure about it because an old friend who worked at a grocery made me feel bad about not working a job like him although he studies something easier\u2026 but anyways what are your guys opinions on this? I need you to be dead honest with me.",

      "text": "Hey. I would maybe keep Uber Eats even if it's just a delivery a week or something. It is true a couple potential employers may look down on you for not working and that's coming from someone who worked very little in college. But you get the best of both worlds if you say you just did Uber Eats during this time even though it was super part time. Also internships are very important if you can get one.",

Luckily I live with my dad so I don't have many expenses but the focus on school helped me land an internship. I don't know if I would have if I was burnt out from working part time and studying.  \n\nAs the other commenter says you do what works for you and keep in mind how much stress you yourself can handle.",
