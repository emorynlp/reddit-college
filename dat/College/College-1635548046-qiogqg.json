  "title:": "Would it be wrong to email my TA and suggest he makes changes to our discussion?",
  "text": "I won\u2019t go into details but basically in my math class our TA is in charge of making weekly quizzes for our discussion sections. He is giving us very unfair quizzes that nearly everyone is failing, and every week he sends us an email calling us lazy and saying it\u2019s our fault for not studying more. It isn\u2019t completely his fault though because I don\u2019t think he fully understands the circumstances our class is in and he seems like he wants us to do well in the class. I was thinking about sending him an email and explaining why I think the quizzes are unfair and maybe suggest a change. Are there any repercussions to doing this?",
