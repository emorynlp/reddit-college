  "text": "Hello Everyone!\n\nSo, I am on my last semester of my bachelors degree, graduating in December. In this last term my mom has fallen ill with cancer and I am the only one that can help her since she doesn\u2019t have the energy to work any longer. I am working three jobs currently in order to pay the mortgage, bills, utilities, etc. I really don\u2019t have the energy to study currently (I am half online 3 classes, and 3 in person classes) in my online classes I am doing great, on my in person classes not so well. I really don\u2019t want to go to class since I am always tired. I have also become more depressive, to the point that I had a gun and needed to turn it in because I was literally so close to do something really stupid. I\u2019ve talked to my professors and they don\u2019t seem to care, they just say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you still need to come to class\u201d and \u201cYou need to figure it out\u201d and I never show up honestly. I really want everything to stop. I want to just be able to take a breath and just sit and do nothing. What do you think I should do? Counseling hasn\u2019t helped neither, dean of students is a joke, and deans of the colleges (Departments) are saying the same thing as my professors. I\u2019m going insane, I have a group project and I really don\u2019t want to go to class and the Professor saying \u201cOh look who decided to show up\u201d what should I do??",

If you think you can handle classes online, like you seem to be doing, trying and get your three in person classes online next quarter or when you're ready. \n\nNo degree or education is worth your life.

      "text": "Hi, first you can do it. Don't lose hope you just need more brains to think with you.\n\nIt's hard I know and I know this is a vent more than asking for advice\n\n\nI don't have solutions but I have ideas I will throw all of them and you pick what you see suitable for your situation. (I don't have details about your situation nor I'm asking).\n\n\n1- freeze your classes for a year so you could figure a way to get stable income, care for your mother, and study your classes\n\nPros: you get time to think of a better way to solve this cuz you got 3 major events and you need to solve get through them all. So a wise move is to postpone one of the three events. The only one you can postpone is uni cuz the others are not choices but facts (unchangeable).\n\n\nCons: you might get away from school life that you won't be able to come back again which results in .... You know the rest becoming a drop out without any education (according to degrees and employers) \n\n\n2- Get financial help from someone you know again money and your mom's illness are unchangeable events so you need to work on them not wishing these tragedies didn't exist. \n\nPros: it will mean less thing to worry about. Which will give you time to take her of her and study while having one job (almost normal situation).\n\nCons: that you reach for someone who might not help which is not surprising like not everyone have the financial luxury of helping other people or even willing to help or reaching for someone who would help only in exchange for something which is to be expected it's not utopia but the problem is them asking something unbelievable or too much (crisis merchants) \n\n\n3- Get someone else to care for your mom or help you take care of her. Though this type of commitment is the hardest (in my pov). \n\n\nPros: again one of the 3 major events is being handled while you focus on solving the other 2 major events if your life. And getting more time to study. (Same as other pros I'm running out of ideas, sorry)\n\n\nCons: them asking for money. Typical no one commit to taking care of sick person volanterary unless they have a bond with them of somekind (this will help if you landed on taking this option).\nOfc them asking for money would be no problem if calculate that 3 jobs, university and paying for someone to care for your mom partial or completely fits together. \n\n\n\n\nI don't have futher ideas currently. I might get some later and I would send them in separate comment ofc. \n\nEdit: don't ever think of doing something that would threaten your life. You won't fix anything with that and it's not worth it. \n\nBut for now I have these three ideas which would work if the circumstances fit probably in your situation. \n\nI know probably have thought of all the above but I had to say what I have in mind and maybe laying the ideas down this way helps you more.\n\nAnd you can text me if you wanna talk about anything my inbox is open. \n\n\n\nHope all go well and you mom immediate recovery. \n\nHave a great day/night",

      "text": "Have you told this to your mom? Talking things out could help you find relief and an answer. I will say, if this is your last semester, do what you can to finish, graduate and get your degree. That will help you in the long run. Not finishing now might be a mistake. \n\nHowever, if you absolutely don\u2019t see a way to finish your semester. You can talk to a student counselor and tell them that you don\u2019t want to graduate this year, and that you will wait for the next one to graduate. You could simply drop all your classes and get a W on your transcript. But I encourage you to talk to a academic advisor/counselor so that you ensure your safe return to the classroom. \n\nYou can drop one job in order to free some time for school. If you drop one job, you can help yourself by selling your possessions. Do you have valuable things that you don\u2019t use/aren\u2019t necessary? Things like jewelry? Sell them, tell them goodbye, and use that money to help you out. \n\nAlso, Talk to the banks, tell them that you are close  from graduating, that you will make more money after graduation. Tell them that right now, you need more time to pay the mortgage bill. If they can offer you some type of delay, or some sort of wait period, that would be nice. I don\u2019t know if getting a loan would be a good idea. You or your mom could try the loan avenue as well. \n\nEnding your life wold cause more problems. Imagine your ill mother having to endure the expenses of your funeral? And on top of that, deal with the emotional pain of you being gone. Not a good idea for sure. If you care for your mother that is. Based of your post, I will say that you do. \n\nI fucking commend you for all the things that you are doing. Three jobs and also full time student, damn. You are fucking doing a lot. I respect you for that, not that my respect means anything, but it illustrates how big and strong of a person you are. Honestly. \n\nFinally, I will say, talk to your mom, let her know exactly how you feel, and ask her what is it that you ought to do. Knowing what her mindset an ideas are is important.",

You\u2019ve got maybe a month and half of school left and then you\u2019re done, you most likely be in a better spot to help being totally done with school. Talk to o department chair or the necessary higher ups to explain your situation. In all likelihood this situation won\u2019t just go away in a month so I think you should consider that.",

      "text": "Hi.  Sorry you are going through this.  \n\nTen years ago I went through a similar situation.  I was a full time student, had a part time job, owned a small business, and then suddenly my brother died of a drug overdose.    I withdrew from most of my classes, and failed the rest.  This effected my financial  aid, so that I wasn\u2019t eligible to reinstate it until I paid out of pocket for a semester and received passing grades.  If you\u2019re considering withdrawing and you rely on financial aid, then you need to speak to someone and hopefully try to mitigate whatever obstacles that scenario could create for you in the future, if any.  \n\nI do recommend that you take this time that you need, though.  The trauma and weight of our circumstances can linger for a long time if we avoid it.  I literally just went back to school this year.",
