  "text": "I applied for university and was accepted for this fall semester. I told my parents my plan would be to move in and live in the dorms at my school. ever since then, my dad started telling me about this great idea he had to \"go back to school\" and get his bachelor's. I wanted to support him and told him it was a great idea. after all,  who am i to tell him not to better himself? but then he went ahead and applied to the same university that I'm attending this fall... soon enough he's wearing my schools merch and buying mugs with MY schools mascot on it. It wouldn't be that bad if I knew his only intentions were to get a degree, but he has never expressed interest in furthering his education before now. he has a well paying job making 90,000 a year and so he doesn't really need a bachelors... but my dad is very controlling, always monitoring my location, internet, and friends. he is also bi Polar and a classic narcissist. 90% of my motivation to apply for the dorms instead of taking the hour long commute to and from my house was to get away from my family. I can't tell if he's doing all this to get under my skin, or to try to keep as close of a hold on me as he can. I'm scared he is going to start showing up at my dorms unannounced, since he has a campus ID and won't stop pestering me to tell him my dorm number. what do I do?? am I over reacting? at this point Im contemplating transferring to an out of state school. :(",

      "text": "I would sit down with him, look him in the eye and say how it is. You are 18+, you want to expirience life, find lovers, hang out with your friends and strugle with exames. Tell him you are not a little kid anymore, also you appreciate what he is trying to do, but then tell him you also want to start being an independant and he should not interfire with that. The point is. Talk to him like an adult to an adult. Thats the fastest way to get respect and get your point across. I disagree with all of these comments about running away. He probably loves you just doesnt know whats good way of showing it and whats not, thats where you come in and explain it to him.",

When I enrolled, my dad did too, and my mom was already taking classes since she works at the university. I take classes with both my parents and I will say it is a little weird, but not as bad as you think. It\u2019s an experience that you will never forget in years to come. You can still have your own life on campus with him taking classes, that doesn\u2019t have to interfere with your college life. Set boundaries. If he wants to get his degree, let him get his degree. You are both adults.",

      "text": "So, this is definitely a tricky situation and I do think that you should keep your options open if it really starts to develop into something problematic. First off, a few more things that would help or knowing to what degree your parents may be paying for your education and also   If there are other circumstances that may make it difficult for you to just cut ties if need be. I generally dislike Reddit advice on life matters, often because much of the advice you get won\u2019t consider downstream impacts or that real life can be much more complicated than we imagine. (Also, it\u2019s kind of implied that your father was admitted to, but I don\u2019t remember explicitly reading it in your post, so if he hasn\u2019t been admitted yet then definitely don\u2019t worry about it too much yet.)\n\nOn the first point, trying to establish yourself as financially independent will definitely help you in decision making, so you might look into getting work or, depending on your field, even finding some kind of part-time internship. This way you can at least save up a bit of money. Next, definitely prioritize finding a friend group. Make sure that they understand your situation and our people that might be willing to really help you out if worse comes to worst. I wouldn\u2019t approach a friendship like this, but the main thing is that you should definitely be looking to find people who will have your back Which often means having their back as well. Lastly, your campus likely has support groups and counseling services that you should seek out that will help you find both university resources that will help you decide what to do and also help you to relieve some of the stress. In particular, there may be certain accommodations they might be able to make for you in order to help mitigate Some potentially bad issues. And this definitely includes talking to your RA and letting them know what the situation is. It might be possible at some point during the semester or over the year to change rooms or buildings to make it more difficult for family to find you. They probably won\u2019t be happy once they learn about this, but at the very least Your dad couldn\u2019t just show up unannounced.\n\nFor now, I think your best option would be simply to play the games and hope that things just become too inconvenient. If your dad is serious about going back to school, then he will have his hands busy between a commute, his courseload, and presumably whatever he is going to be doing to earn some kind of income. So, if he\u2019s under the impression that he can continue doing whatever he\u2019s doing, and will be able to make the same income that he has been, then he\u2019s probably going to find out very quick that it\u2019s just not something he can manage. And this way, if things do turn out like this, you won\u2019t have to worry about losing face with him or potentially other family members.\n\nHowever, if it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s going to bother you and it\u2019s going to be an issue, you might talk to someone else in your family, if that\u2019s possible. Sometimes letting them know how you feel and having that person act as an intermediary can be a great help in trying to navigate difficult family dynamics. Depending on your relationship and personalities, it certainly could be more worthwhile to simply address the issue head on, but Given that you\u2019re posting on Reddit and the information that you\u2019ve presented, it kind of sounds like he would rather not have that conversation if possible. It may be best of course if you can just set out some rules and boundaries, but like I said if you can have someone else talk them down from the cliff and realize that they are being unreasonable, that will work in your favor.\n\nThe last option, would be to transfer. Probably the best reason you would be able to find is if you can find a program that is \u201cbetter\u201c for your interests and goals. And that may also mean that one strategy you can take us to simply change majors and \u201cfake\u201c changing institutions for that reason. I wouldn\u2019t pick something that you absolutely love, but you should definitely pick something that you can live with if you had to complete the degree and we\u2019re not able to change back if you decided you wanted to. Anyway, this will give you a more plausible out that allows you to avoid the discussion about wanting to get away from your parents. There are a lot of reasons people transfer between universities, but going out of state can be especially difficult if you don\u2019t have a support network, so if there\u2019s anything you can do to avoid this it probably would be for the best. But, if you absolutely have to, then do not hesitate to do so. Again, I would seek out academic advisers and counselors who might be able to help you and also help you find other suitable programs for your area of interest.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that most of my approaches to these are to simply avoid the confrontation, which I know some would absolutely detest, but not knowing your particular situation or you or anything else really, I prefer to be a bit more conservative here and not just say \u201crip off the Band-Aid\u201d. Like I said, hopefully once you get settled in, this will settle down and your dad will chill. If not, like I said, use your resources, and even potentially post an update here. Anyway, best of luck.",

This is his response to his fears that college would allow you to gain enough independence and confidence to escape from him... this isn't about his education, it is about sabotaging your education to keep you dependent on him and therefore available for him to use and abuse at will.\n\nBest option is probably to transfer (far away) without letting him know anything about it. Even if it means a worse school, it will be absolutely worth it for your mental and emotional health. You need to cut all ties with him, ASAP or he will never stop.",

      "text": "This post immediately made me think of Arrested Development when Michael was living in George Michael's dorm room.\n\nSeriously though, this is pretty uncool. If your dad really wants to earn a degree there are other options. He doesn't have to go to the same school as you.\n\nI'd talk to him. If you're worried about rejecting him (I also have parents I have to tip toe around with how I word things), maybe frame it as more \"I think it's really cool that you want to earn your degree and I'm flattered that I inspired you. But I worry that with you at the same school as me, I'll use it as a crutch and not learn to be as independent and responsible of an adult as I'd like to. Maybe it would be best if we went to different schools and just were there for each other for peer support while we both go through this journey.\" Make him feel like it's not because you don't want him there, it's because you think you need to learn to be on your own a little in order to be a functional adult when you're done with college. Which is actually a really important part of the college experience.\n\nIdeally, you'd be able to just be direct and set healthy boundaries, but I know with mentally unstable parents that's not always possible. Sometimes you have to be somewhat manipulative to deal with them without a major upset.\n\nGood luck to you. Wishing you the best.",

Maybe there\u2019s a school counselor who can help with this. If he finds out your dorm number and things get bad, definitely tell an RA, or someone at all. I want to be like, get a restraining order if you have to, but I know thats way easier said than done and can cause all kinds of problems and you probably need more cause for that.",

Depending on the size of your campus you might not run into him much. A lot of dorms require you to swipe your id to get into the elevator. If the id isn't coded for your floor, then the doors won't open. The housing office at your school, could explain how secure your dorm is.

They don\u2019t typically stop students especially ones escorted into the dorm by people who live there, but seeing a grown man sneak or hover around a dorm is likely not going to fly. So you may be protected from him randomly showing up at your dorm.\n\nYou should definitely talk to a school counselor about your worries about him stalking/harassing you and they may be able to give you resources or help plan your next semesters with you if you decide to stay. He does not need to know your whereabouts 24/7. If you don\u2019t set boundaries and say no, he will keep crossing the line. Equally, talk to your family separately from him to help mitigate him victimizing himself because he likely wants to thrive off of bothering you or thrive off of being the victim if you reject him. If you are worried he will twist your words, record the conversation.\n\nTransferring might be a good option depending on how the first semester goes. But I do think he will find many ways to cross the line still even from different states. You may find it easier to cut contact if you move away if that\u2019s the case. \n\n I just think you really need to be firm about drawing the line in the next few months because if you don\u2019t, he will always think it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m really sorry that he never talked to you about his decision to go back to school until after he got accepted. I hope you don\u2019t have to transfer and that it goes the best that it can go but regardless, best of luck with school and the situation!",

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re a supportive kid and that you inspired him, but setting boundaries for yourself/your own mental health is my biggest piece of advice. Maybe you can eat lunch with him but not see him after 5 pm, maybe you can go to his dorm but he can only see yours once in a while\u2026 not to overexplain. I just wish someone had told me I could say no and that the response I got was not my responsibility. \n\nI forgot to mention my dad is also bipolar but that\u2019s just to note that I hear the depressive episode aspect, OP. Time, space, and practice help. I\u2019m out of college and finally don\u2019t live with my dad, thus I find it much easier now that I can physical boundaries than emotional.",

Just do your thing and if he crosses some boundaries let him know when it happens.",
