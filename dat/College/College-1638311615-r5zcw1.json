  "text": "so I\u2019m currently taking a class known as College algebra and trigonometry but our textbook is precalculus (my university didn\u2019t wanna call it precal for some Reason??). Im currently trying to transfer to another college and their precal is 3 credit hours whereas my college alg and trig is 5 credit hours, would my credit hours be transferable or would I just lose all those hours. (and to mention they don\u2019t have college alg and trig)",
