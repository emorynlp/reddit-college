  "text": "Are there any International Business Majors out there who have graduated? Which field are you currently working in? I am looking to major in something that can allow me to travel internationally and is business related. I figured this is a good major for this working in consulting, marketing, product marketing etc. Any feedback is appreciated!",

      "text": "When I visited my current uni before applying, we had a career coordinator run through all of the business majors. When he got to this one, he said that he\u2019s been trying to get it removed because graduates never seem to find worthwhile jobs. I haven\u2019t seen anything about it, so I\u2019m assuming he was successful.\n\nYMMV but there are more specialized majors to go into if you want to travel. While marketing has some of its own issues, that would be an improvement over international business imo.\n\nJust my 0.02 but people are free to disagree if they\u2019d like.",
