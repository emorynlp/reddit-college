  "title:": "I love it when I spend 3 hours on notes for a final and *none* of them end up applying to the questions.",
  "text": "So our professor did this thing where he made the final \"open notes\" and on canvas so effectively you could google it. But to save the trouble I decided I'll just print out the study guide and write an answer to all the questions on there, so that way I didn't run out of time hopelessly googling things.\n\nTurns out I spent most of my time hopelessly googling things, as the questions were way too \"dense\" to apply to the study guide (which consisted of mostly easy questions). \n\nI still passed, but boy was that frustrating.",
