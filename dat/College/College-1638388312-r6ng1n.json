  "text": "I applied to a university for the 22' Spring Semester, on priority deadline exactly on October 14th.\n\nAs of today I'm still waiting for them to reply, I have contacted someone that works in the admissions office almost a week and a half ago but she never replied.\n\nIs the first school I applied to, so I'm not sure how long it takes to hear back, but clases start at the end of January and since I would and international student, if admitted, there's a lot paperwork I'd have to get done, besides looking for a place to live, so I'm worried that with the Holidays coming, I won't have enough time to get everything ready.\nShould I contact them again?",
