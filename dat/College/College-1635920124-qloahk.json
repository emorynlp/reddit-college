  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a junior in college right now, and I've held a 4.0 gpa for a while... Until now. \n\nMy doctor believes that I may have a pituitary tumor so I have been undergoing tons of tests and have been feeling exhausted and overwhelmed, on top of having issues with verbal abuse towards me at work. My grades fell from all As to As and some Bs, and I've been so stressed out. I told my professors about this, but I am still missing class which just leads to me falling behind and then my mental health drops and I'm no longer motivated to pursue school on top of the poor mood, prodding of needles, and work issues. I tried using the disability office, but they want written proof of my condition but I'm still being diagnosed with it and getting blood and imaging work done for a few more weeks to months...\n\nHow do I balance my illness with school? And how do I let go of this 4.0 GPA and not feel so upset losing it? I know a lot of it is out of my control, yet I still feel horrible dropping down after so much work.\n\nThank you.",
