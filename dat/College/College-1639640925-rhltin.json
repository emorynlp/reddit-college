  "text": "Hello. I am a chem major and I've been finding it really hard to study chemistry subjects. I really want to read myself next semester because I have done poorly this semester. OrgChem 1 was super hard to understand. In addition, we had Calculus 1 and it was also hard. It's finals week and I ended up being depressed after every exams. I have no motivation to study anymore. Anyone of you who has any tips for this subject? Chemistry is really all about understanding the mechanism and my mind just go blank whenever I see concepts. Thank you!\n\nNote: I also posted this in r/chemistry so these two are the same posts. ",
