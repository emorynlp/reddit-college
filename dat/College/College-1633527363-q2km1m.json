  "title:": "Why do people say self-esteem and confidence are so important to have, especially for college students?",
  "text": "Despite what professors and faculty may say, some of us DON'T have what it takes to succeed in class and the real world. I myself fall into that category of those lacking in potential. There is no need to get one's own hopes up for nothing. If you do, then failure just hurts even more.\n\nIf I say I have the skill to do something, like get good grades, get a scholarship, or find a good job, and I don't end up succeeding, then all of that believing in myself was just overconfidence. Overconfidence is something people dislike in a person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess what I'm tying to say is that self-esteem and confidence are only deserved for those who have shown that they can succeed and that they do have potential. People like me probably don't deserve it.",

      "text": "Also, I encourage you to start separating some of these ideas.\n\nYou can be smart AND fail a test (or even a class). \n\nYou can be highly competent AND not get a job offer. \n\nYou can be a competitive applicant AND not get a scholarship. \n\nAnd you can deserve to feel confident in yourself AND be a person who experiences failure. Like everyone else. \n\nNone of these things are mutually exclusive, qns treating them as such is not realistic and is not fair to you or anyone else. \n\n\n\nEdited because I hit \"post\" too soon.",

      "text": "It sounds like you are struggling with self-image. It could be really helpful to discuss why you do not \"deserve\" to feel good about yourself with a professional. This is not a healthy or productive discussion to have on Reddit. \n\nOne thing I want to add though: college is a time of immense growth. We ALL WILL fail. The failure is not the important part though; it's how you get up afterwards and what you learn from the experience. Failure does NOT mean you are less worthy, that you were overconfident, or that you shouldnt love yourself. Do not base your worth on successes. You are more than your grades or scholarships or pieces of paper. Let your failures help you mature and grow. \n\nAgain, I think this perspective is indicative of bigger self-worth work that needs to be done. You should not have to earn self-esteem, and if you are reluctant to let yourself be happy within yourself, it is a good idea to talk with a mental health professional.",

      "text": "One last thing: we CANNOT compare ourselves to others accurately because we cannot fully understand the position another person is in. I guarantee you, the people you uphold as ideals have failed more times than you know. Even professors, doctors, CEOs.... they have all failed. However, many of them are successful because of how they used failure to grow. So, even if you see failure as a negative, the people who seem \"worthy\" of confidence and self-love have actually experienced failure as well. This is why we CANNOT base our worth on success; none of us would be allowed to feel good about ourselves because we all fail. \n\nInternalizing failure as a fault and making comparisons to others are both destructive. Learning how to separate the negative feelings from failure and self-worth can open opportunity and actually help you ultimately succeed.",
