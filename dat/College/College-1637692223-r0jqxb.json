      "text": "Hey, it happens to the best of us. Perhaps because it is by putting in our best that we become the best. And because we put in our best, it happens to the best.\nIt is tiring, yes. You are exhausted. \nYou need rest. I would suggest taking some.\n\nIt does feel like you'll fail, but you know what,\nYou've spent time with the material. Even if you can't remember anything right now, you know it's not something entirely new. \nTake a day for yourself. Use it for rest. Make no plans for that day. Let your mind get away from studies and thoughts of the future. \n\nAnd after that, while there may not be time for you to prepare the way the way you wanted to, there will still be some time. Use that some time to your best advantage, and it'll turn out well for you.\n\nBest wishes!",

      "text": "My advice would be to try to pass your major specific class(es) and then worry about gen eds later. In the grand scheme of things your major classes are more important. Don't spend all your time trying to pass a history class if your major is engineering. At this point you have to kind of pick and choose where to put your effort.",

      "text": "I feel you on that! I\u2019m also burn out due to school and work at the same time. But luckily teachers have been easy at the moment. I sometimes don\u2019t feel like doing any homework or anything at all. I just feel exhausted. But don\u2019t give up! Keep on trying. \n\nOne thing I would do is to reach out your professors and let them know maybe they can help you raise your grade by turning in late work. Good luck!",

      "text": "I was in a very similar situation freshman year and i won\u2019t go into detail about it but to overcome and become pass the class, i had to only focus on school. I mean like i didn\u2019t have time to play sports, date, even work. Then I had to make friends with people at my college who have the same background or are similar to me. It will really help trust me. I honestly had to also teach myself how to study, this was the hardest but most important. And lastly, remember it\u2019s okay to fail, it\u2019s not the end of the world i promise. The most that will happen is you\u2019ll be placed in academic probation and you\u2019ll just have to work to bring your grades up next semester. Typically you won\u2019t lost your full ride unless you don\u2019t improve your grade. \n\nAlso, sometimes if your struggling in a class and you know your not going to do well, DROP THE CLASS. Please don\u2019t be afraid to, as long as you do it before the deadline and you still are considered a full time student, there\u2019s usually no penalties. You can even sometimes do Pass/Fail I would just ask your advisor. I believe in you! It happens fairly often so don\u2019t feel alone",
