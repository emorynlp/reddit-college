  "text": "So I have this corporate finance class, and it\u2019s a sort of difficult class, but I was doing alright with the homework, but I was terrible when I came to the tests, but my test grades were slowly improving until I failed the final. I\u2019m super worried about it affecting my graduation goal and I just want to cry because it\u2019s extremely overwhelming with everything else. So if anyone has any tips on how to feel better about the possibility that I may have failed it would be greatly appreciated.",

You\u2019ll be okay. Stay strong, study hard, and try again.\n\nMy school is known for corporate finance being rather difficult too, so I know what you mean.",
