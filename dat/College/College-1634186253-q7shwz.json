  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, I\u2019m currently a sophomore in college living in a double and I need some advice on what to do about my roommate and his girlfriend. I\u2019ve been living with my roommate since last year and he was dating the same girl then, but he didn\u2019t have his girlfriend over as often as she does now. \nSince the beginning of the school year he\u2019s had her over to spend the night about 3/4 days of the week and sometimes on weekends he has her stay all night and all day and occasionally helps her study out loud in the late afternoons while I\u2019m trying to relax and have my own time watching TV. It is currently 12:30 and they\u2019ve been talking out loud for the past hour and spanking each other while making sexual remarks to one another which has made me very uncomfortable. Normally I wouldn\u2019t care if this was an occasional thing but it has literally been happening for weeks and I\u2019ve had enough, I want to lay in my bed without having to hear them make noise for hours or know that they\u2019re hooking up right next to me, and worst of all I\u2019ve been woken up by the sounds of them fucking. \nI want to tell my roommate that he can\u2019t be doing this, especially not this often and that he should start respecting the fact that I don\u2019t wanna have to deal with them for hours, but I\u2019m afraid doing so could negatively affect our friendship. What should I do?",

What he's been doing isn't ok. If he refuses to listen and respect what you say, then that says a lot about your friendship.",
