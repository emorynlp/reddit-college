  "text": "i\u2019m a first year student living on campus and i\u2019m taking three classes and they\u2019re all online, I\u2019m currently taking Anthropology111 Econ111 and ELA114\n\nShould i be studying every single day for these classes? or like 2-3 hours a day for each class?\n\nI\u2019m already sitting at 60s for ELA and Econ and idk about my Anthropology yet, but my midterms are literally this week so I need some advice please. These midterms are mainly multiple choice and a few short answer questions so it should be easy for me I\u2019d say.",
