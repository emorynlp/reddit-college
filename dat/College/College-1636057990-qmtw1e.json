  "title:": "UC Transfer Application - Explain gap in education",
  "text": "I\u2019m a student at a California cc planning on applying to a couple UCs this month. \n\nI\u2019m on the section of the transfer app where it\u2019s asking me to explain 2 gaps in education. \n\nI\u2019m a non traditional student, and have been working full time since 2013. In the Fall of 2014 I did not attend cc because I worked retail and my schedule was crazy during the holidays, so I decided not to register for classes. \n\nThen the following semester, Spring 2015, I decided to stop going to school completely and focus on work - with really no intention on returning. (I\u2019m glad to be back now though!!)\n\nMy main question is, how should I convey this? The word limit is 150 characters - do they want just a brief and direct explanation or do they want it to be in essay format like the PIQs? \n\nAnyone go through this process/successfully transfer to a UC and have to fill these sections out?",
