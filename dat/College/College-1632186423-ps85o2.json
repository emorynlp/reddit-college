  "title:": "Cornell or Uchicago for Marine Biology",
  "text": "(This is not an admissions question) Hello, I'm a senior applying to colleges pretty much now. I'm looking to choose between the University of Chicago and Cornell to take one of my \"reach slots\". I would like to choose just one because they are both pretty high reaches and I don't want to be totally demoralized by letters this winter. I haven't been able to find much online but I know the schools each have at least something for marine biology. I would really appreciate it if someone could find like a breakdown chart of what's offered at each school. I'm also interested in ocean sciences so if either of the schools have that, it would be appreciated as well. Thanks so much in advance and good luck to you if you're applying rn.",
