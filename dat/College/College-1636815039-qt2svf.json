  "text": "I'm in college and I literally haven't had a totally free day since before moving to college. My day starts and ends at my laptop. I don't know how to just \"do little bit by little bit\". Knowing I have more to do disrupts my feeling of relaxation and feels like a threat. I grind so much that my brain has become numb and slow from being constanyly used. How are people able to laugh with friends or work out knowing they have to study right after that? Gives me anxiety",

I have to just manage my time well enough that I feel on top of it or I\u2019ll end up burning out at some point.\nAnd on top of that, if I don\u2019t find reasons to relax and be happy now then when will I? Because the to-do lost never ends. So I might as well be happy now.",

Go to bed thinking obsesively about your essay or discussion remarks, feel extreme guilt when playing videogames, and do that weird leg shaking thing whenever you aren't doing school work. Yes, this is truly the way. \n\nIn all honesty, I'm still learning that, yes you have to work hard when it is time to work hard, but you also have to play hard when it is time to play hard. Half assing either will make you a miserable mess.",

I thought it would always be like that, im assuming you are in gen Ed's with as much class work as you have. It really all depends on the classes tbh, for example, up until this semester I had a lot of homework due every night. But now that I've finished all my gen Ed's I have mostly lecture classes with the exception of German. German is the only class I ever have homework in, with the occasional essay from a lecture and exams. You'll  be alright, gen Eds suck.",

Part of this overwhelming feeling is because I'm also trying to fulfill the requirements of my study abroad program I have in Spring. Basically just paperwork, which is easy but there's deadlines and lots of unanswered questions, and people I need answers from are usually too busy to respond. Creating fierce anxiety. I've been accepted, and it's in Rome which is awesome, but I can't finish most or all of the paperwork at once. There's a lot of processes that take weeks, especially the visa, and the extra covid documents. The worst part is about medications",

I'd rather just be done with it and then work out, and get the most out of it. Otherwise my mind won't relax till the weekend\n\nJerking does help but it reminds me of how I'm single and then I feel jealous of other people tjat might be fucking. I start to dwell on it.  I look good but there's no real opportunity to meet girls here, just little friend groups and classes. I get the impression no one is looking to talk to someone, so it's just busy adult life.",
