  "text": "I am a junior, a human development and family studies major, I\u2019ve been going back and forth between a few careers choices my entire college career. Came in wanting to a be a doctor. I was so sure of it and so happy about it. But then I realized just how hard that stuff is. And sure enough it was so hard. So I dropped it and turned to PA. Which seemed like it easier pre reqs. Then orgo came and I panicked and decided to drop it and so when I did that I had to find something else. So I went the OT route. It felt nice when I did that. Because it felt easier. Now I\u2019m back feeling jealous of my pre med friends because they\u2019re doing so good and I\u2019m just here looking like i know what i want but i don\u2019t.. I\u2019m noticing I keep going with what\u2019s easiest but am I wrong for that or am I just sending myself down a really dark hole. Now next year I need to figure out what I\u2019m applying to but I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing. I need help. How do I figure out. What do I do.",

      "text": "maybe go for nursing. It\u2019s not the same as being a doctor but the school is a lot less and you can always go back to become a nurse practitioner or something. That being said you shouldn\u2019t just switch to something because it\u2019s easier. orgo is designed to be a weed out class.",
