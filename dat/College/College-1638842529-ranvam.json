  "title:": "Should I Keep Going With Computer Science with Bs in all my computer science classes?",
  "text": "To all the comp sci majors and alumni, I m currently taking my Data Structures class and I\u2019m a sophomore. I\u2019ve passed all my other \u201cgateway\u201d computer science classes with B\u2019s, which is weird to me since I usually get As but literally every computer science class other than like Assembly Language Programming I\u2019ve gotten Bs. I don\u2019t code in my free time since I barely even have free time with a part time job. It\u2019s not that I hate computer science, I just seem to not be meant for it. Maybe a major part of it is that I wait until the last minute to do my projects. But this semester I\u2019m hovering between a C and a B. This question has probably been asked many times, but should I continue computer science, or pursue something I think would be easier.\n\nTL:DR - B in all my comp sci classes, and maybe C this semester. Should I continue the major?",

          "text": "Thank you, yeah I honestly think I might drop to a C this semester. I had one of the professors and was supposed to do classes live but he ended up switching to online due to medical problems and even then he just posted old videos he made during lockdown. With how important it seems data structures is, I might retake the class",
