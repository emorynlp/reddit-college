  "text": "So I have an orgo exam coming up and I am terrified honestly. I have been studying for the past weeks doing all the practice problems but I feel so screwed. I feel like no matter how much I study I'm going to fail. I can't even fall asleep because I keep thinking about mechanisms. Some times I find myself subconsciously creating questions about orgo like whats the stereo chem or what reagents do you use to get this molecule when I'm trying to sleep and then it's like my brain is fully convinced I have the answer that is the only way I will sleep fall asleep. I feel tormented I don't know why I'm so focused on this stupid class. I already decided I would switch my major, but I feel helpless.",
