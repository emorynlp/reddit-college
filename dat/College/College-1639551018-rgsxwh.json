  "text": "I\u2019m in a two year tech program for precision ag. Precision ag is a degree dealing with how data is managed and utilized in agriculture to minimize variables in an ag operation. \n\nI had a very bad first semester of college struggling with balancing school and working up to 60 hours a week along with some mental health issues this landed me on academic probation. I had a phenomenal second semester scoring all As in my required classes but it wasn\u2019t quite good enough to get me off academic probation. Then after some issues with my mental health and communication with the school on an internship I ended up failing not getting academic credit for my work which was 4 credits, and another F on my transcript.\n\nWhen I met with my advisors who also instruct nearly all the credits required. They helped me develop a plan to get me off academic probation, and they pressured me to \u201cwork as hard at school as I do at work\u201d and assured me I should continue on my two year plan to graduate. \n\nHowever because of that higher class load to make up classes I\u2019ve failed and a whole new set of mental health issues my grades suffered and now I\u2019m worrying about academic dismissal. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I could possibly work to stay in school? My advisors consistently show that they recognize my effort and voice how I\u2019m a good person to have in the program, but I worry my enrollment will be outside their control. I also can not bring myself to talk about my mental health with the school or get accommodations. I just want to get my degree and push myself to get it as quick as possible but my failures as a student and over estimation of my capabilities keeps me from getting out of the hole I\u2019ve dug. Any advice on steps to take is appreciated.",
