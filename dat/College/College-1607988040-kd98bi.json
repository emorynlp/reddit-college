Think about it, you have to take multiple cumulative exams in a short period of days, which could lead to students being overly anxious and how you did in previous exams might affect how well you would perform in the later ones. And yes, I tend to feel empty after finishing everything up. Good thing I would have some reviewing to do this year after I finish the finals which I'll probably start on next week.",

However, I like the idea of optimising processes and stuff. Just, I don't have any particular interests in economy. Do you think I deserve this major?",
