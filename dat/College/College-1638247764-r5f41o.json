      "text": "As someone who really struggles with procrastination/wasting time, I suggest just trying your best again tomorrow. Don\u2019t beat yourself up for not getting much done. Do your best with the amount of time you have available; you can\u2019t regain time but that\u2019s okay. If you get stumped, try your best to find a simpler solution, or move on to something else to stay productive. Any work is better than no work in my opinion. It won\u2019t always be perfect, but that\u2019s okay because you tried your best. Proud of ya; you got this. It\u2019s not too late.",
