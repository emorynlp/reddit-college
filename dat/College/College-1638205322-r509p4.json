      "text": "Chinese is very hard especially if your first language is latin based. Study everyday and try to get a language partner preferably who is fluent  or advanced in Chinese. I study around 20-30 new words per week with Anki and spaced repetition. I write as many Chinese sentences I can in a little diary of sorts. I practice my grammar this way. I try to watch TV shows and movies and put up subtitles to practice listening. You can do this passively by just listening or actively by really trying to understand what they are saying and the subtitles. I am lucky enough to know someone who speaks Chinese so we usually have an hour dedicated to speaking Chinese to each other.",
