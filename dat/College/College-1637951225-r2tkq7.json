  "text": "The class is Survey of Human Diseases. There was a GroupMe in the beginning of the year but the TA disbanded it within a week, and I haven't been able to find any other classmates to study with. I can't review past exams/questions because they're locked, the study guides account for appx. 30% of the exams, and the lectures aren't recorded online. My current plan's just to read the textbook repeatedly and memorize it as best I can. Advice?",
