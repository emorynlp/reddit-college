  "title:": "What are my options if I failed college and trade school but still want to be middle class?",
  "text": "I went to university studying aerospace engineering, and I took advantage of all of the resources available to me and studied for countless hours only to fail my classes anyways.\n\nI then switched majors to cinematic studies and only found that slightly easier. But I failed 2-3 of my classes and realized that it was going to be an uphill battle and that I might fail out of school anyways.\n\nThen I went to learn a trade (electrician) because I hear people suggest this option for those who are unable to complete college, but found that it wasn\u2019t simple either and ended up failing multiple times with that route.\n\nI\u2019m 25 and I need to figure out something to do. I don\u2019t want to live a destitute life, but I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m not very intelligent.",
