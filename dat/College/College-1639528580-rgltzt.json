  "title:": "Coping with first bad semester as a high GPA super senior\u2026.",
  "text": "I feel ridiculous and entitled for posting this but I really need some encouragement. I am a super senior in my 9th semester (I\u2019m in the process of taking an extra year because I changed my major drastically as a junior; I will hopefully graduate this spring). I never expected or planned to get grades this high, but somehow up until this semester I have maintained a 3.97 GPA, even with the pandemic and lots of family turmoil. This semester has been a nightmare for me. I had a sudden death in the family, got extremely sick twice (not COVID) and experienced the worst physical pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life because of it, dealt with 3 COVID scares, and have become increasingly anxious and depressed to the point where I contacted a s*icide hotline last night for the first time in my life. I will definitely get an A in one class and I\u2019m taking an incomplete in another class in which I\u2019ll likely get an A\u2026 but the other two might be Bs or Cs or even Ds at this point. The thought that I may not graduate with honors when I COULD have had I graduated \u201con time\u201d is killing me. How fucked am I? Will future employers, grad schools (a couple years from now \u2014 taking a desperately needed break first), etc. understand if I explain what happened to me this semester (I\u2019m a humanities major)? Is it okay to \u201clet go\u201d of finals (and grades in general) for the sake of preserving my mental health? I know I am worth more than my GPA but this is really hard for me to live with.",

That\u2019s literally billions and billions of people without the same opportunity.\n\nA rough semester. Absolutely.\n\nDoes it warrant reflection and counseling. 100%.\n\nIs suicide the answer. A resounding no.\n\nOnce you have time to reflect, you will likely look back and see that your academic career was defined not by your time up until now but how you persevered this semester and beyond.\n\nGreat things are in store. Great things.",

          "text": "Thank you for this \u2014 I know it\u2019s really important to keep in mind the incredible privilege I have in the big picture. I\u2019ve been in counseling for a couple years and it\u2019s definitely helped some\u2026 but finals season puts me in quite the depression sinkhole, and this semester with all of the setbacks I\u2019ve faced (and my knowledge of, and discomfort with, their consequences) it\u2019s deeper than ever. I know s*icide is absolutely not the answer, though, and I am not allowing myself to go down that route, because \u2014 you\u2019re absolutely right \u2014 great things are in store, and I also have great things in every other aspect of my life but this one that I do not want to miss out on! Just need to get through the next week, somehow. \ud83e\udd72",
