  "text": "I had a midterm (remote) yesterday and then homework for another class. I set my alarm for 8 today but my body was not having it. I literally went back to bed and slept till 4 and never left my room. I don\u2019t have classes today though. I was just too exhausted. I\u2019ve been thinking of that damn midterm all last week. Luckily monday is the day when I got no class",

      "text": "I'm curious about why you're so exhausted. Your other habits are causing you to be exhausted, and that's not good. \n\nEveryone would benefit from having a solid sleep schedule. The college life of sleeping really late into the day or not sleeping at all is incredibly detrimental. I think there needs to be skills built around sleeping for young people in college. \n\nI remember a peer telling me that he missed class and slept until 1 pm. I'm 32 and I can't sleep past 7 am on any day. I'm in bed by 10 pm every day. I never get drowsy and sleepy through my courses. I don't have problems falling asleep either. \n\nGranted, being young makes sleep a lot different. I just really think that parents and high schools should have really drilled sleep skills into kids before pumping them off on their own.",
