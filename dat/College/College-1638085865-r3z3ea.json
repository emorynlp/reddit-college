  "text": "(Throwaway account)\n\nI'm in a bit of a dilemma. I'm a freshman at a private university in Boston MA and I'm planning on majoring in film production. My school has a pretty good film program and has a plethora of connections available. However, the issue is once I graduate I will be $75,000+ in debt, that's assuming my financial aid stays the same for the next 3 years. The thought of that stresses me out way too much and I would like to lower that if at all possible.\n\nI plan on moving to the Philadelphia region after I graduate for personal reasons, so I've been looking at some schools in the area. I found one that peaked my interest, mainly due to the fact that the out of state tuition is less than $20k a year even before financial aid, and I am paying more than that right now in loans (thankfully federal, but still). It's in PA and relatively close to the Philly area. I'm thinking of applying there, however their film production program is less than stellar. I know in the film industry you don't absolutely need a degree in film and a lot of it is based on experience, but I'd like to get one anyways since it opens you up to networking opportunities and also allows you to gain some type of experience.\n\nI don't know if it's worth staying at my current college and graduating with a hefty amount of debt in a low paying field starting off, or transferring to a much more affordable university but possibly not getting a great education. I was thinking I could just gain experience on my own time as well, like I was doing throughout high school, so that might be able to offset that? Not entirely sure, I'm just a bit stuck and stressed right now. I feel like transferring is the better option, but I wanted to get other opinions as well. If anyone has any advice, it is greatly appreciated. Sorry this is pretty long, but thank you in advance :)",

          "text": "I didn\u2019t mean just that. In school that\u2019s probably what I would be doing in my free time, but eventually my goal is to find internships in the field, work on a few projects that aren\u2019t necessarily big productions by a recognized studio but still good enough to start gaining experience, etc. \n\nOf course a place isn\u2019t going to hire someone whose reel consists of a quick simple 30 second iMovie trailer shot on their iPhone. There\u2019s a lot of difference between that and someone who has shot multiple types of short films with their own equipment, directed it themselves, wrote it themselves, and edited it themselves. Is it official, industry recognized? No, but it\u2019s so much better than having nothing and a lot of people can recognize that hard work, especially if it\u2019s just applying for internships or entry level jobs.",
