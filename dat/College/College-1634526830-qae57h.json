  "text": "Should i change majors if i'm not passionate about the coursework for my major? I know I could do well in the courses if I study hard enough, but it doesn't make me excited. I feel like I'm just cruising through. \n\nMy major is actuarial science, btw. This major also requires a lot of math exams outside of college classwork, to which I don't find the content of the exams interesting either. But, I don't know what else I could major in that would be a \"good\" job.. I do like math. But I also like creativity, colors, and design, which there isn't really any of in actuarial science. \n\nOverall, idk. Any advice?",
