  "text": "Ok so figures I have a presentation due on Friday and now Im dealing with flu like symptoms (a good friend of mine just got the flu) so now im nervous I may have it. My professor is luckily the more chill type who might understand that I may not be able to make it on Friday as I currently have a fever and am not sure how symptoms will progress. I just want advice on how to word an email that lets the professor know that I may not be able to make it to class on friday if I am still dealing with a fever and such, best way to word this?",
