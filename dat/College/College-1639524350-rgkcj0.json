  "text": "Hi all, \n\nOur university has been offering an alternate grading option since Spring 2020 due to COVID. Essentially, we can replace any 1 or 2 classes with a satisfactory (C+ or above), pass (D to C), or fail (F). The course's grade won't impact your GPA. I've used it regularly on one class per semester since (2 satisfactories and 1 pass), as I usually excel in 3-4 of my classes per semester but don't do very well on the final class. How bad will it look to potential employers if I am essentially covering up the poorer grades? Is it worth it to save a GPA?",
