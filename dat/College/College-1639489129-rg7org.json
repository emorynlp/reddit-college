If you do, get someone there while you check.",

I suggest ask your friends' grades first who similarly performed like you in class. Then you can take a deep breath and turn the page. Don't take it onto after the holidays or else you will stay feel nervous and insecure. So see your grades now, and be calm and relaxing during the holidays. I'm sure it'll turn out good.",
