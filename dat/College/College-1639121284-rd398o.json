  "title:": "Prof asked for feedback and then turned down all the feedback lmfao",
  "text": "One of my profs (for an essay writing class) made a huge deal about getting feedback and said stuff like \"oh I want to improve for next semester\" yada yada. \n\nWhen I emailed her some very detailed feedback (ex: I believe that there is a degree of ambiguity inherent to writing as a medium that does not translate well to rigid memorization questions), she literally accepted none of it. \n\nThe way she worded her reply also makes it seem like she just skimmed my email lmfao, for instance, she literally repeated a few things I said in my email (ie. I mentioned that she mentioned early on that memorization helps the people in the class who are bad at writing essays but good at memorization - I said that forcing us to regurgitate stuff in a writing class instead of grading us on our writing isn't very productive. She literally just repeated that part about helping people without refuting my point at all.) \n\nSighs.... I'm just frustrated. I'm more annoyed at her acting all open-minded than if she was just upfront about not wanting to accept any criticism at all.",
