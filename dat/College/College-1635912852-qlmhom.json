  "text": "Quick background, I\u2019m a freshman at a university that has around 16,000 students, but it wasn\u2019t my first choice. The main thing that I always wanted from whatever university that I went to was to have a large student presence, kind of like the stereotypical college experience. I\u2019m coming in from out of state, and while I like the campus and the city it\u2019s in, it feels like it\u2019s very quiet most of the time and it isn\u2019t exactly what I envisioned it being like.\n\nNow, this wouldn\u2019t be that much of an issue for me, however there\u2019s a large public university that seems to fit the description of what I was looking for, and it\u2019s in-state. This college was my third option (behind my current school because of location), but I never actually completed an application for them. Now I\u2019m kind of regretting it, but I have a lot of friends and family where I\u2019m at. \n\nIs this just fomo or should I actually look to transfer?",

          "text": "Without scholarships the prices are about the same based on what I\u2019ve seen, although I do have one for the university that I\u2019m at right now. The tuition\u2019s (mostly) paid for with this state thing that I have, so as long as it\u2019s public that\u2019s all covered - it\u2019s just everything else that has me taking some federal loans out. From the financial side it\u2019s probably best to just stay put honestly, I\u2019m just having an existential crisis about not going to a traditional party school I guess. Thanks for the response",

              "text": "It's always more expensive to move, whether you're ain college, in an apt, or a house. Staying put is a good choice. Explore what you can do outside. Sure, there may not be skiing or ice skating, but there's hiking, camping, tree climbing, caving... You'd be surprised at the cheap possibilities that people have come up with.",
