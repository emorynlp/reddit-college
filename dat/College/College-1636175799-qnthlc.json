      "text": "You need to just invite people to hang out and go get food, that\u2019s how you make friends. Also never say no to the first time someone new invites you (unless you like REALLY have to study or work or something). Eventually you\u2019ll find the people that you want to hang out with and talk to again and again. \n\nAlso for me it\u2019s not just hanging out, it\u2019s talking to them throughout the day too. When something interesting happens and you\u2019d normally snap your best friend from home, snap some people from college too. The ones who want to be your friend will keep replying to you and continue the conversation. There now you have friends. *this last part does not apply if you have snap streaks with like 100 people. That means you text and use social media differently than I do.",

      "text": "I've made my own comparison: it felt like everyone was part of a jigsaw puzzle and I was just a loose piece sitting on top.\n\n Basically when that happens you gotta find other friends.  If you don't feel like you have your \"group\" just keep trying to meet new friends until you meet people where you feel like you don't even need to try to be friends with them, it just happens on its own.\n\nThis could take a while but there are a lot of more toxic friends or at the least people that won't prioritize you as a friend that can waste your time if you settle with them.  Gotta be careful when choosing a group to designate as your main friends.  Don't let convenience make you spend more time with people you can't connect with than true friends out there.",

      "text": "I guess to also come closer to answering your question; I myself have hopped from several social circles as they fizzle out one by one after a while.  I've seen other people's social circles die out over pretty drama.  But there's some that persist and stay connected.  The goal is to find those ones. Find mature people who will actually put effort in to stay friends.  The people who live across from you in the dorm might not be the best fit for you and that's okay.  Don't stop looking.\n\nWhat helps is trying to initiate hangouts.  Get a movie and ask who wants to watch it together.  If you have a car, propose a mall trip, figure out who actually wants to hop up and do stuff, as opposed to the people who just sit around and \"chill\" but wouldn't raise a finger to keep a friendship going.",
