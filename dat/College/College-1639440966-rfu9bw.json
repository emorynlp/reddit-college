  "text": "So my dad and stepmom got a divorce after filing their taxes together in 2020. For college applications, I have to state his income that he reported on his 2020 taxes but it is combined with my (now) ex stepmom\u2019s income as well. What should I do? Should I just report my mom\u2019s income instead? It only asks for one parent.",
