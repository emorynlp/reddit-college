  "text": "It appears that I need funding to achieve success in my career, college is also very important, but I also value my career, but there is no way to get funding other than getting a job while in college, why not a part time job you may ask? Will unfortunately part time jobs are not an option in my country as they are not available.",

It\u2019s doable with 4 but it sucks the social life outta you. It really depends on how you balance your hw with work. Plan ahead for sure.",

      "text": "I did it but it\u2019s very tiring and you have to time manage on a razor thin margin to be able to make social time. As a result, many FT workers and students just don\u2019t have much of a social life at all. It\u2019s doable but you need to determine if it\u2019s doable for you. Some people need lots of time to study and understand material, it\u2019s not possible for students like that.",
