  "text": "I've made a post here before about my roommate who has a gaming addiction. I called him out about how his constant gaming drives me nuts and he completely blew up on me, i.e. screaming, slamming things, getting in my face. \n\nWe barely talk now and he bought a silent mouse, but I just know that I can't live with him for another semester. He sleeps in every day and the moment he wakes up, he starts playing video games. He only leaves the room to get food or maybe go to classes. I've been trying to spend as little time as possible in my own apartment because I can't deal with his presence looming there 24/7. I'm not sure what to do.",

I couldn't solve my problem & had to just tough it out. I'd find a place to study & do work outside of your room, & only use the room for mainly sleep. If they keep you up at night, you can calmly explain yourself & try to find a work around. Foam earplugs & eye mask work great for me.",
