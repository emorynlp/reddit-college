  "text": "I'm an undergraduate seeking to get involved with a professor's research.  I sent a short email to the professor but they are predictably not responding.  If they do not respond after a week, I would assume that email isn't the best medium of communication with them.\n\nIn such a case, would it better to follow up with the professor by calling their number or by visiting their office?  Thank you for your time!",

      "text": "Normally, a week isn't an unusual time to wait, specially for emails not directly related to a class. It could be worth a follow-up email, but if you're concerned that they won't see it or reply, that's valid.\n\nIn that case, go with office over phone. Some folks don't use their phones, and it may be easier to catch them and have a substantial conversation if you are physically there.",
