  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and I don\u2019t really have a solidified friend group. I\u2019m in different groups but I don\u2019t have my core yet. My one friend group is one with the people on my floor. I\u2019m not sure if they like me or not so I\u2019m starting to think I should either slowly drift away or stop talking to them. \n\nHere\u2019s what happened in the past week. \n\n1. We usually pregame in one of their dorms and one pregame we had last week I left to go use the bathroom. When I come back they locked the door and when I would knock no one would open the door. They opened it eventually and said, \u201cWe\u2019re u knocking this whole time we couldn\u2019t hear u cause of the music\u201d \n\n2. Same thing as 1. But this time I just went to my dorm and was like \u201cno thanks you guys suck for that\u201d to myself\n\n3. One of them texted in the group chat if anyone wanted to get food. I said yes and when I found them they all had their food already and said \u201cwe forgot to get you.\u201d Shitty part is that my roommate was there. \n\n4. My roommate is starting to be a dick to me\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what I did for them to start doing this so it kinda sucks having to go through it. That was kinda the reason I went home for the weekend this week.\n\nAny advice on what to do.",

      "text": "They're being bad friends. Especially your roommate, not cool. I know it sucks to be excluded, especially by your roommate who should have had your back but the good thing is you found out now and you can go work on those relationships with people who enjoy you, who genuinely want to have you around! \n\nI wouldn't confront them on this, be the bigger person. If they or your roommate bring it up in a \"why don't you hang out with us anymore\" kind of way, then I might mention that you weren't being treated nicely. It's better to take the high road. Don't let them know they got to you or give them any ammunition to talk poorly about you.\n\nAlso if you can, don't go home for the weekend. There are always so many things to do in college towns in this is your prime friend-making time. Ask those other groups if they want to play Uno at a coffee shop. Go for a hike with them! Move nights, baking competitions, hammocking, laser tag, study groups, anything! Join a club or an intermural sport. It's hard to make friends in college but it's even harder to make friends if you're not at your college.",

Maintain a pleasant, but somewhat detached, attitude with them.  Keep an eye out for others on campus you might be more compatible with.",

      "text": "Went through something similar and it\u2019s unfortunate, but it sounds like they\u2019re trying to get rid of you. It took me a little while to realize it when it happened to me, but they made it blatantly obvious in the end. We had went to get lunch together at the schools cafeteria. I set my stuff down at the table we always sat at. I came back with my food only to find no one there. They were sitting at another table on the other side of the room. When I brought my stuff over they had said there was no chair for me to sit at and no more room at the table. \n\nAfter that, I realized that I had kind of forced that \u2018friendship\u2019 since I had no one. My whole relationship with them was so awkward and they really had no interest in anything I had to say. It was a really mean way of telling me that, but looking back on it, I should\u2019ve realized I wasn\u2019t welcome in their group. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s your exact situation, but are you good at reading people? Do you have similar hobbies, beliefs, personalities? Do your conversations feel easy/not awkward? You don\u2019t have to necessarily do anything to someone to treat you like this. They might just be assholes who don\u2019t know how to communicate with you. They aren\u2019t your friend\u2019s and I\u2019m willing to bet they never were. Find people who are worth your time.",
