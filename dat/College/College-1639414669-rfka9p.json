      "text": "I feel common advice is to not enter a program unless it\u2019s fully funded. You will make very minimal $ while in grad school and digging yourself into debt via loans is not recommended.\n\nIf you are passionate about your topic, have solid mental health, are great at project organization, work well independently, and are intending on academia/research then sure. I personally would not have started my PhD without doing a master\u2019s first despite having the opportunity. I learned a lot* about graduate school & academia culture during my master\u2019s and it really prepped me for the mental/emotional/physical/financial requirements & demands of a PhD.",
