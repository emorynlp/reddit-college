  "title:": "Extreme boredom with online classes",
  "text": "Since I started college in 2020, I\u2019ve only done online classes because of covid. I\u2019m doing core and bba required classes that aren\u2019t related to my field so I already don\u2019t like the classes. I\u2019m mostly always home and have to read a few chapters then do a quiz for each class which in itself is not hard or time consuming. By this time in the semester though I can\u2019t barely stay focused at all and would rather do house chores or errands than read material I don\u2019t care about. Is there anything I can do to help stay focused and avoid my careless attitude?",

      "text": "i wish i knew how to answer this because i deal with the same thing. it\u2019s so hard to stay focused and i get distracted very easily. the only benefit is learning at the comfort of your own home, but the experience can\u2019t be the same for everyone. and it\u2019s so draining staying home almost 24/7 and doing college work. online classes are a blessing and a curse",

          "text": "Yeah I've also developed a bad habit of searching up test and quiz answers online even thought I 80% of the time am correct. Hopefully next semester I'll do in person classes so I can actually meet people and be more involved with the material cause it's nice being able to do everything at your own time but if you don't like the material it's not a good time.",
