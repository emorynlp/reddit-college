  "title:": "How do I get back into college with debt from a previous school?",
  "text": "Long story short, I went to college after highschool, ended up dropping out due to financial reasons, accrued $6000 in loans through my university and $5000 in federal loans. The loans through my university have been sent to a collection agency, and I have yet to make a payment or start a plan. I'm now financially stable and in a different state, what do I need to do to get back into college? Do I need to fully pay off all my loans? Or can I pay the one through my university and defer on my federal loans once I get back to school? And if I want to get back in by next August do I need to start applying early, or should I wait until my loans are paid? Also I don't know if this is too specific, but am I going to have to transfer my credits from my old college or can I just start over? I truly do not need them for what I'm doing now. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I would love to know how you managed.",
