Funding is attainable mostly though through loans. You can achieve anything in the US if you put your mind and energy into it.",

      "text": "In practice \"easiest and simplest\" typically translates into \"low quality\" and \"not competitive for jobs.\"\n\nIn general college is hard, because you go there to learn, and learning is hard work. I'm sure there are places with less competitive cultures where people don't get stressed just because something is \"hard,\" although I don't know where these places are. As far as overall stress levels go, I'd put my money on Scandinavian countries being low stress-- not because their college courses are \"easy\" (I'm sure they aren't) but because those countries are wealthy and have social safety nets so that overall anxiety isn't as high as in other places. They also don't quite have the same competitive academic culture as places like Singapore, which despite being wealthy like Scandinavia has a cut-throat academic culture.",
