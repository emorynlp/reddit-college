  "text": "So I\u2019m a little worried about the classes I chose and that it might be a little unrealistic to keep up with so I just wanted another opinion on if the workload is manageable and I\u2019m just going to have to work hard or if it\u2019s too much?\n\nIt\u2019s only three classes, so maybe I\u2019m being irrational and just over worried, but I\u2019m taking Trigonometry, Programming Fundamentals I, and Government II (not the official government class name it\u2019s just the second counterpart to it) I\u2019m not so worried about the government class as I am about the other 2.",

      "text": "Programming is sort of a polarizing subject. In my experience, either your brain is wired to understand the step by step methodical process of putting yourself in the computers shoes and reading/writing the code. Or it's totally foreign to you and it will take massive amounts of work and mostly trial and error (instead of design) to get the behavior you want out of it. But I wouldn't be worried about that courseload at all. Are you working full time as well, 9 credits honestly seems low for someone working part time or not at all.",

          "text": "Yeah, sadly my brain is the type where I do Not naturally understand coding and programming and have to do trial and error :p \n\nand Technically it\u2019s 10, I guess the programming class is an extra one because it has a lab, but literally just a one credit difference LMAO\n\nand I am unemployed actually, I\u2019ve just really struggled in the past with time management and passing classes so I think I\u2019m just irrationally super worried lol \ud83d\ude2d",

Go through your syllabus or textbook and youtube any topic you struggle with. This and work through as many problems as you can and you should fly through it.",
