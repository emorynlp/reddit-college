If you signed some university policy or teacher syllabus/policy that states that the university, Canvas, and/or professor reserves the right to use software and/or other technology to monitor student activity to ensure academic honesty, they have just fulfilled their legal obligations of informing you.\n\nNow, as for Canvas, I do not believe it can access that much information and it\u2019s technically possible to detect other devices, if they\u2019re connected to the same network.",

I don\u2019t think most people would want to take the risk.\n\nThe problem is that the professor already wrote the exam and didn\u2019t want to modify it to be open note. If they make a test that was meant to be closed book be open notes, it would be too easy. Some classes are harder to make tests open notes since they just test your information retention. A lot of engineering and physics classes already are open notes by allowing a formula sheet but they get away with it by making the exams difficult enough where the notes just serve as a reference and not as answers. It\u2019s much harder to make a final in freshman psychology open notes since they would normally just test your retention anyways.",

                                      "text": "I can understand your point as playing devil's advocate, but let's be clear: it is much more difficult to cheat during a protored exam than one being done remotely, where people can just write down notes on a sheet of paper or use a separate computer even if VMs didn't work. The professor (should be) is watching you, and other students taking the exam would also likely see any cheating and it's in their best interest to report them since it would flatten any curve(along with being the ethical thing to do).\n\nProfessors shouldn't need to change their exams, but from my own experience, most of these exams are fine with open notes anyway. For example, my astronomy exam had open notes - I used my notes for about 50% of the questions, mostly the multiple choice questions. The exam still tested me on have my understanding by having multiple written response questions. The difficulty of changing a few multiple choice questions to written response should be minimal. All the professor would be modifying to fit an open-note exam would be the rules. You can perfectly test someone's understanding (what retention is based on) with an exam being open-note. Even with it being open-note, there was still quite a curve with the class average being around 75%. To me this says that even with it being open-note it still challenged people's understanding of the concepts taught during the course. No one was tempted to cheat, and I was not penalized for obeying the rules and not cheating.",

It discourages a lot of people from cheating and catches a lot of people who try. For my proctored tests, I have to do a room scan first, to verify that I don\u2019t have any notes or another computer lying around. I also have to use a mirror to verify nothing is sitting on the keyboard of my laptop. The software also tracks your eyes through your webcam to see if you look somewhere else for a prolonged period of time",
