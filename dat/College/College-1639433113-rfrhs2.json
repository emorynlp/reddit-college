  "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm currently in a pharmacology/neuroendocrinology research lab. I'm a neuroscience major with plans for grad school.\n\nBefore going to grad school, I really wanted to narrow down what I want to study specifically and also work on some skills such as experimental design and scientific writing. \n\nSo far, my supervisor, who is a postdoc fellow, has had me play around with data. My numbers were accurate but she didn't like the aesthetics of my graphs. She suggested I learn R on my own but hasn't really brought it up again. It kind of made me feel inadequate. Like she doesn't want to teach me anything really and was perturbed that I wasn't better at data analysis. I'm not terrible at stats. I got As in all my stats classes. And I'm currently a stats TA. I just have never published a professional scientific paper so don't really have that knowledge of how data should look- but it's something I'm hoping to learn with this internship. \n\n Also she mentioned how maybe we could do a literature search one day together. \n\nWell I've only been in the lab for almost 3 months. So far I've done basic animal husbandry and I'm now getting trained in orienting and set-shifting tasks of rats with pavilion boxes which I find interesting. \n\nToday I asked her if she ever searches for more research literature once she starts getting data from her experiments, to look for any similarities her research is currently producing with past research. \n\nShe said she should do that but doesn't. I felt this was an opportunity to maybe have me take on that task. But she didn't offer that.\n\nI'm just wondering what kind of research experience I should be getting ? What would he helpful for my skill building or future in graduate school?",

      "text": "These seem like isolated incidents, and this is usually how research works anyway. People may mention that they should do something, but never get around to it because they're busy. \n\nIt seems like you're getting good experience, but I agree with her that learning some data visualization skills would be useful. She's not being critical, as she clearly doesn't have any issues with your statistics work, but presenting that data in a manner that's more visually appealing is a good idea.",
