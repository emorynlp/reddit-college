  "title:": "Guilt about not being in complete crisis this week?",
  "text": "I'm in my last week of classes and I have no finals (CS+History major, all my finals are projects/papers that I can turn in from home and have mostly done or exams that have already gone by) and so once classes are over I'm *basically* done (I have some projects to touch up and finalize but even those are mostly done). I have many friends in STEM majors that are working their asses off this week. I have been working as well to finish projects and get my stuff together but I haven't been freaking out and I get to leave 1+ weeks early for winter break because of my lack of finals. I've been feeling really guilty/impostery because I'm not burnt out and dying this week. I know it's weird and stupid for me to feel guilty that I'm not falling apart but some part of me feels like I'm not working hard enough or doing this whole college thing right or living up to my potential if this time of year doesn't grind me to the bones and demolish me.",

I kinda just have the feeling that even though I busted ass this semester, the fact that I don't have that massive stressfest of finals means it doesn't count lol\n\nThank you!",
