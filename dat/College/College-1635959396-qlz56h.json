  "text": "I need help deciding whether i should take physics 1 and orgo chem 1 at the same time or different times. I've taken a physics class at community college and passed with a C, this time it will be at my own college which is a bit harder. I will be taking organic chemistry at community college. If i take it in the spring I will be taking physics and orgo at the same time and I will be at 18 credit hours.\n\nIf i take orgo in the summer then it will be during 8 weeks and im not sure if this is enough time to learn the material but it will be the only class I'd be taking?\n\nLast option is taking it at community college in the fall semester, however this will be my last semester of college and i am required to do my last 30 hours at my college so taking the class at community college might put me in a weird situation. \n\nThanks.",

      "text": "This could go either way. I'm a senior physics major, and I personally will not sign up for more than 12 CH's of physics because the work load is just too much (tbf, I'm talking about upper level physics, so this may not apply if you're talking about introductory physics). I've never taken it, but my friend who took orgo said that was one of his hardest classes (he was a biochem major). I think both those at the same time sounds like quite a lot, especially if you're taking 18 CH's (at my school you need an override to register for that many CH's). \n\nThis also depends a lot on what those other 10-12 CH's are. If they're basic gen eds then you might be OK, but if you're talking about 18 CH's of upper level science courses I think you will be overwhelmed.\n\nOut of the options you provided, I would say taking orgo over the summer sounds like the best option especially since you got a C in your last physics class. \n\nBottom line: it's better to do a few classes thoroughly than many courses poorly.",
