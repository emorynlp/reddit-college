  "title:": "I failed my thesis, and I might be one year late before I graduate.",
  "text": "Most of my classmates will be checking their thesis this month, and probably most of them will graduate a semester later. I am the only person in the class that my thesis groupmates kicked out because I was \"lazy\" or \"did not meet their standards,\" but I cannot blame them. Thus, I have one additional year to pass the thesis. I feel like my ego was gone upon seeing their thesis getting passed while I was left behind. I am 21 but might graduate at 23 if I pass on my thesis for the second time. Please take note, the only subject I failed is the thesis, and I need to take three semesters for it. The rest of the subjects are fine.\n\nHas someone experienced the same problem (losing my ego while my classmates will graduate soon), and did I need to feel bad about leaving myself behind? I need advice.",

The first three weeks we had to come up with a topic based off of prior research and find 10 additional sources (so we couldn't study something entirely different). We couldn't use more than 2 sources from the old paper we were basing our work off of (and if we did we still had to find 10 more to present). If we couldn't find a topic within 2 months, you functionally failed the seminar and would need to repeat a full year. \n\nBy the end of the first month you were supposed to have 10 pages written and sent in, by February another 10, March 10, by the start of April we began peer reviews with other students and bi-weekly presentations of our findings. Due to COVID we also had mental health check-ins every so often. \n\nBy May you would ordinarily have a presentation to the board of professors at the faculty where, in a normal year, only something like 40% would pass. Mine was on state owned enterprises and rent seeking iirc... I got a B+ only because of how well my defense was presented. Had I not gotten an A on my defense, I would've gotten a C overall.",

      "text": "So, I started college at 16 via dual enrollment, royally fucked up my GPA as a first gen college student (had no idea the grades stick around on your GPA). I left and moved to NYC for a few years and came back to college at 21. It\u2019s taken me almost 6 years to finish my degree between paying cash, working a demanding job, and just life in general. I have seen people who were a year or two behind me in class graduate before I have. It sucks, but it\u2019s your college experience. People will pass you up, it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Use the next year to intern, get work experience, or fuck off and have fun. It\u2019s up to you. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, you\u2019re so young.",

I've been in college since 2016, 3 years for my Associates, and thanks to covid I'm going on year 4 for my bachelor's, when I should have been done 2 years ago. \n\nIt stinks sometimes to see people move on, but they are following their own paths. Maybe they have more resources, time, or maybe you fell back and didn't give the effort you wanted to. That happens, it's life, you can't compare yourself to the lives of others. Take it as a chance to undo your mistake. Buckle down, bust it out, and go into the world to kick some ass. You can do it!\n\nSincerely, \nA 24yo Super-Super-Super-Senior",

The extra year gives you more time to figure out what you want after college, and gives you time to mature and grow and learn more things about life.   \n\n\nNow for me, I'm 22, and I still haven't graduated highschool, but I\"m enrolled at the local community college some how. I had a lot of trauma re:academics in middle/highschool, and now have to take one class at a time because of that. I've failed all three classes I've taken. And you know what? Failing is okay. It gives you a chance to work out what went wrong and then try again later, with that knowledge. At this rate, I won't graduate with a 2 year degree until I'm about 30. And that's okay. It's not a race to the end, it's about improving and seeing how far you've come.",

I was also one step away from removing a number of our members from our thesis because of the reasons as yours so I do understand the frustration of your leader. You can grow at your own pace and I do think that this circumstance allowed you to reevaluate yourself and your ego. I hope u get through this, OP!",

The age thing doesnt really matter because after you graduate youre gonna start working and almost everythings gonna reset. Applying for jobs, going to interviews, making friends at work. \n\nIts always gonna suck being a student esp if you dont know anyone in your class but at the same time its the only subject youre taking so you have more time for yourself. Its chill. Tho youre always gonna regret not doing your best..because lets be honest you could have passed the first time. You cant do anything about it now but since you already owed up to your mistake just do your best to finish it in one take.\n\nPs. if it gets too hard on your ego try therapy most consults provide cheap or free services",
