      "text": "IMO epq is a waste of time. Many of my college didn\u2019t complete it and I don\u2019t know of anyone who actually enjoyed it. \n\nI did maths, further, physics and business and it\u2019s definitely doable but at the end of the day, you don\u2019t need 4 a levels from any university so the only person you are doing it for is yourself. \n\nDepending on the course, some don\u2019t count further maths as one of your three a levels and more of a supplementary one (which is a bit ridiculous because it\u2019s much harder than the other three I did) but I think they see it as too similar to maths. On the other hand other courses require further so take a look before you choose. \n\nIf I was you I would do the four with epq and see how you find it, if you\u2019re capable to get top grades you probably won\u2019t benefit from epq, and if not maybe fm is a bit of a push. It\u2019s much easier to drop an a level mid year than it is to pick up a new one",
