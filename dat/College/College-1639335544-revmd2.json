  "text": "I\u2019m a US student who\u2019s thinking about what degree I want to get. I was thinking about doing but i don\u2019t really know how it works. Is it a large workload? Do I declare both majors at the same time? Could I do two unrelated majors, like a BA and an engineering degree? (If I do two related majors it\u2019s be a double major, right?) Do colleges/universities even offer programs like that?\n\nCan I even do all that as a freshman?! \n\nThank you in advance! And sorry for all the questions, I\u2019m just stressed. The school I go to calls itself a college prep school but i don\u2019t feel prepared at all and I know absolutely nothing.",

      "text": "You should ask an academic advisor at the school you're looking at. But generally, getting a second degree at the same time just means you have to satisfy that second majors course load ontop of your other majors. Both majors should share a lot of gen ed requirements so people who have a lot of AP credits already or transferred gen eds are the ones who usually do this.",

      "text": "Th workload depend on the majors and if you have previous credits. Depending on what majors you chose you might end up adding extra years of college. For example, I am a software engineer major so doing dual degree with computer science would not be difficult since there is a lot of overlap but doing it with psychology major would be difficult because there isn\u2019t a lot of overlap in classes and it will most likely add few more years to my graduation.",
