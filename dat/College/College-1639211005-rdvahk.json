  "title:": "Should I let my parents pay for college for me?",
  "text": "So far, my parents have been paying my college tuition. I\u2019ve asked many times before if they\u2019re okay with doing that, and they\u2019ve insisted that they want to and that they can afford it. However, I feel guilty about them doing such a thing for me considering how hefty of a cost it is. I acknowledge the amount of privilege I have by them even making that a topic of conversation in the first place, but at the same time, I know not everyone digs the idea of someone\u2019s parents paying their tuition for them in the name of being responsible.",

Likewise, know that it\u2019s a big gift and you\u2019re lucky to receive it. There\u2019s no need to pay it back, just make sure your parents know it\u2019s appreciated.",
