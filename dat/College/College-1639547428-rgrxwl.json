  "text": "I need some advice. I found out that I am on academic probation. I am sitting with a gpa of 1.5. This is the result of poor time management skills on my part and depression. I lost my scholarship and I am stress beyond my mind. I do want to continue my education, but I may have to consider dropping out.\n\nHowever, my parents are against this decision. I know that I\u2019m technically an adult (19 y/o), but I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nWhat should I do?",

      "text": "Could you drop back to part time? Take a couple classes and figure out time management. Get serious and prioritize your grades. Hang out with people who have good time management. Set alarms for yourself. Make a schedule. Hold yourself to getting everything done before you go out with friends or watch tv. Once you prove to yourself that you can do part time, then ramp back up and keep those good habits.",

          "text": "This! Since you're paying for school, going to school part-time while working might be a better option. You need to focus on improving the GPA to stay in school. Talk with a college advisor about your situation. \n\nIf you're able/ it's a feasible location, maybe look at community colleges. They're cheaper and are often better-suited for working students. Depending on the program, you can often earn an Associate's degree. I don't know what you're studying, but assuming it's a Bachelor's program, you could go back to a traditional college with more money in hand after working and saving money from attending the community college.",

I had a friend in the same situation and he\u2019d allowed his part time fast food job to become a full time job and #1 priority. He got to continue at school and recovered after dumping the job and the late night restaurant worker lifestyle",
