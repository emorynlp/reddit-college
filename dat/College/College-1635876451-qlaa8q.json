  "text": "Hello! I am conducting a survey on students who have sought therapy for mental health for a course project and I only need three more responses. There are 8 short answer questions that can be answered in one sentence. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Your responses will not be published publicly. You may remain anonymous. Thank you so much for your time and consideration, and happy procrastinating!\n\n[https://forms.gle/Yzw5NJ3LoEKFu8PDA](https://forms.gle/Yzw5NJ3LoEKFu8PDA)",
