  "text": "There have been so many things that have been affecting me mentally this term. Life as a college student is rough...being a college student with bad mental health is worse. Some things that have been very challenging that some of you may relate to are:\n\n\\- I feel so stupid in seminar classes. Everyone is able to raise their hand confidently and speak clearly for a long time about their thoughts. Meanwhile, I am sitting there feeling like I'm having a mini heart attack, trying to force myself to say that thought that I have been rehearsing in my head for the past 20 minutes, but is no longer relevant because the discussion has moved on. And feeding into this cycle causes me to feel like a failure and unintelligent.\n\n\\- When I do manage to speak, my sentences become jumbled up, I forget what I am trying to say mid-sentence and end up speaking only 3 sentences (without saying much) and sounding unintelligent.\n\n\\- I hate dealing with passive-aggressive profs and classmates all day. Seriously why can't everyone just be friendly and supportive? Can we all understand mental health?\n\n\\- I hate when some profs make you feel stupid and like a total idiot for making a mistake or asking a stupid question (even though they say at the beginning of the term that no question is stupid and to not be afraid of taking risks). Why do some profs feel the need to assert their authority and intelligence?\n\n\\- I am tired of sitting at home on my computer WATCHING MY LECTURES when I should be there in person but the C-word prevents us from being able to go back to that.\n\n\\- It is so hard to make friends during this and the isolation is horrible. But at the same time making friends is too much work. Same with dating.",

      "text": "I don't have much to offer because I'm also having a mental breakdown and looking to Reddit for advice. You're not alone in your struggling. This college shit is so much fucking harder than any of us could have anticipated (thanks, C-word). My best advice is to make self-care a part of your schedule. If you can't do anything else, at least eat a meal and take a shower. Don't put your studies before yourself, even though we all do it sometimes. \n\nAnd also- don't beat yourself up over feeling stupid. I also tend to jumble my words A LOT when I speak (social anxiety), but I suggest writing down your thought on a Post-It note or in your notebook/computer before you share- at least a few bullets. That way, if you derail yourself and forget what you were saying, you can quickly glance down and continue. This strategy has saved my ass countless times in class and made me sound a lot smarter than I am. Lol. Good luck homie, you've got this.",

Some are good with public speaking when they are kids some never feel comfortable talking in front of large groups of people. You have nothing to prove to anyone. Our own self worth and value comes within not from external validations. You don't need me to tell you are awesome, and to be easy on yourself. You know that you are smart and capable and just because you don't ask the perfect question at the perfect time doesn't mean you are any less awesome. I had several breakdowns during my undergrad but I got through and I'm sure you are able to as well.",

First, thank you so much for openly sharing this and know that you are not alone. \n\nSecond, can you find any positives in your situation? I know it's not ideal, but what have you been able to do since being in university? Are there ways you can reach out to people and engage even though you're not in-person?",

      "text": "First off- you are absolutely not alone! The c-word has had such a negative impact on my mental health and many aspects of my college experience. You are absolutely right, post-secondary in itself is extremely challenging, and it doesn\u2019t help when mental health presents even more barriers. To address your points one by one (take or leave whatever works for you) \n- in terms of seminars, I have been both in the shy position and the speaking confidently position, and in my experience, the confidence comes with practise and general self-confidence, which both take work! \n- people have done far more memorable things in my experience that I would never recall, so try it out if you feel a burst of confidence and go for it- you\u2019ll get better as you keep at it :) \n- for the next two: people suck, it\u2019s just the way some people react to their circumstances, all you can do is control your reaction and keep being a good person that attracts other good people \n- the social aspect of the last few years is undoubtably awful, and I know it\u2019s probably not helpful, but we\u2019re all in the same storm, and I\u2019m sure you will have plenty of opportunity to engage with in person lectures and get out there to have some meaningful interactions that go beyond a screen. \nOverall, I\u2019ve been in a similar place, and it won\u2019t always be like this, things will get better- and I wish you all the best!",

      "text": "For mental help, sometimes you need to know that going to the doctor actually helps. I went to one, I now am taking antidepressants and vitamin d pills. Having the ability to talk to someone, even anyone face to face with a person who will give you objective help can really move you toward the right direction. It gave me a sense of normalcy in these shitty times where it feels like even your soul is being taken away. Putting your foot in the door can and likely will help. Building up your mental strength will likely solve most of the problems that you face and is more than likely effecting not only your ability to process information but also your current reaction to different environments. \n\nSide rant =>\nPeople always try to be negative toward others. And I feel like it's better to embrace it. If the professor is going to treat you like you're stupid. Just say they're not teaching properly. If the students around you are shamelessly trying to make you feel embarrassed, just know they're compensating for feeling inferior themselves even though they won't admit it. Why try participating in an environment that shuns you when you're trying your hardest? Just don't. Protect yourself because how you feel is more important then how they treat you. It's okay to be shameless. You don't need to show respect to those who don't give it to you. \n\nI feel like a lot of people understate the mentality you need for each class depending on how well you grasp the material. If an environment is not helpful in building yourself up just look at them pitifully. The person teaching the class may be double or triple your age but they're nothing but a five year old for trying to make you feel a certain way. \n\nSome people may say I'm crazy for saying to be so antagonistic, but I'm not, I'm telling you to be shameless. Professors for some reason actually like the personality because it makes their classes more interesting.",

      "text": "I think it's important to discuss the effects of mental health in it's own. Most people I know have dipped their toes into the pool of depression, we are all accustomed to it. The problem is that mental health issues really change the way you think, and it's definitely not a logical change. Once you start going down hill, it's a cyclical process of digging a hole and piling the dirt around the opening always making the hole deeper and making the surface higher. It's a double edged sword, ya know?\n\nI think objectively, outside of your personal situation, we could all agree that mental illness really affects our thought process. It makes us think things that aren't true but we don't have the faculties in place to weed out these thoughts. There's a lot to be said about it. I find that mental illness really makes assumptions second nature, when they should be logically examined. I feel as though healthy mental states help us decipher those assumptions into the baskets they deserve to be placed in. \n\nHere's a part that nobody will like to hear, regardless of it's merit. The first four bullet points you made, could very well be a part of those illogical assumptions. \n\nI've got a tremendously great friend who throughout her k-12 education, she was placed in the special-ed classes. I'll skip all the nitty gritty, but she holds a Masters degree now. There's a certain amount of irony when we speak about it. She says that she isn't smart, she can't read well and can't speak well all while telling me, who was a college dropout, that I'm smart and she wishes she could be as smart as I am. \n\nShe struggles with those first 4 bullet points you made too. She feels as though she can't speak right. She thinks she's stupid. I always find it comical how she will tell me how smart I am but when I tell her that she's smart, she doesn't believe me although she thinks I'm very smart... She's got a Masters degree. I was a woodworker for 10 years. \n\nI suppose where I am getting is that those things aren't necessarily true. Some objective analysis may bring some truth. The problem is that mental illness changes how we think and it changes it to pretty much how you've stated things. You're thinking all these things that *could* be true but ultimately, there's no strong evidence. \n\nYou can call me on my phone, talk to me, and I'll rate how well you speak. Even if it's not great, you've got to realize that even the best speakers fuck up. I mean, the English language is not easy, nor are the sounds. To think that you're supposed to be perfect at it is ridiculous. Look at it like musicians do, we are the KINGS of hiding fuck ups. Musicians are taught, from the beginning, that if you EVER screw up just keep going like nothing ever happened. Hell, sometimes if you're laying down a solo and screw up, repeating it another 2 times makes it intentional. My suggestion to how you feel speaking is for one, give yourself some credit and if you mess up, don't focus on the screw up but focus on the recovery. Let it go, language is for communication, not to impress people with your incredible vocabulary. \n\nAs for dealing with condescending professors, I think it's important to once again apply the benefit of doubt that maybe they are trying to be funny and light. Maybe they are terrible at making jokes. Dude, some people don't understand how to joke. Some people are absolute shit at talking to other people. Attribute it to their personality, accept it as meaningless and try to move on. Hanging on those things is only a detriment to you. You're in control of what you allow to affect your brain. \n\nIn Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, he discusses this. I highly suggest this book, it's like a light 130 page read. In essence, you're in control of what you allow to affect you. It's true. You can have someone telling you all your bad qualities and not let them affect you. It's a skill that takes work but it is possible. \n\nLife is just a lot easier not giving a fuck about all the bad shit that happens. It's going to constantly happen no matter what. The difference between being happy and sad is the focus you choose to spend your time on. I know it's a very thin premise to believe in, but it's better than nothing. At the end of each day, get a scrap paper and write down 10 POSITIVE things about the day. My friend has the hardest time doing this too, but she's getting better. Do it until writing 10 things is cake. You'll be better for it.",
