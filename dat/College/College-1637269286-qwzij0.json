  "text": "I'm nearing the end of my first semester of senior year and, after feeling like the office dunce all summer in an internship, realize I should've taken school more seriously. I did however, get a positive reccomendation from my internship. I'm an accounting major, only have 1 C on my transcript but I just don't know if I'll be good enough to hold a job next year after I graduate. Am I just being too hard on myself?",

Since you cheated, you haven't actually done this, so you can't really say that you're \"good enough.\"\n\nIf you have a positive recommendation from your internship, it's a good sign, but still if you cheated your way through school chances are you're not being hard enough on yourself. Push yourself to go back and learn all the material you cheated through and *then* maybe it will be reasonable to have some self-confidence.",
