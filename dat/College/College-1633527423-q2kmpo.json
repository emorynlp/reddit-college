  "text": "Hi there, a bit of background\nI'm a first year, first semester student who fucked up a chose to attend a small ass state college and it is SO HARD to try and eat healthy. I'm scared because I'm not in the most healthiest shape and the fact that there is only ONE place to eat. Moreover, everything in that cafeteria is carbs, fats, and so much sugar!! Nothing there is healthy except a small array of fruits and salads. Worse part about it is that I'm forced to have a meal plan on campus and it's such a struggle to try and eat without avoid the sugary and fatty foods.\n\n At this point I'm somewhat broke and can't buy a lot of foods so grocery shopping isn't much of an option for me (especially with the small amount of space in my and my roommates fridge) I'm running out of options and I'm getting paranoid about gaining weight and starving myself here not eating enough, what should I do? Anything have anything suggestions?\n\nTLDR: first year college student with on campus meal plan and not enough options to eat good or healthy food. Can't buy groceries and starving myself. What should I do?",

      "text": "For cooking on a small budget - check out Frugal Fit Mom on YouTube. She\u2019s great at budget cooking and she has a few videos on cooking for college students. She goes over pantry basics and how to eat healthy while spending as little as possible. \n\nAs far as eating on campus - see if your cafeteria posts their menu online and make a plan before you go in so you know exactly what you will eat. Ask for modifications if someone is handing you the food - smaller portion, no bun on the sandwich, less sauce. Those small changes can help to cut out excess carbs and sugars. Eat some veggies every meal if you can, drink mainly water, and do not feel obligated to eat everything that they give you. \n\nI struggle with the last one because I hate to waste food - but if I\u2019m not hungry then I\u2019m not hungry and I don\u2019t want to trash my body. \n\nExercise a little everyday if you can too, walk, go to the gym, anything to move your body a little. That will help you feel better as you try to eat healthier.",

      "text": "Does your school offer free medical visits at the student health center? It may be good to talk to someone on campus about your situation and how to fuel your body in a healthy way. Many schools also have \"wellness coaches\" or something similar. Their job is to help connect you with resources and make plans to live a healthy lifestyle that works for you and is sustainable. If you DM me the name of your school, I can look into resources to connect you with!  \n\nMy worry is that going on advice from this forum or social media in general will push you towards an unhealthy or unsustainable solution. A few things to remember: \n1. Your brain needs fuel! Our brain burns a lot of glucose (the energy we get from food), so it's important to give your brain enough fuel, especially when you're working as hard as college students do. \n\n2. We are still in puberty. Our bodies are going to continue to change until we are in our mid-to-late-twenties. Even if we are eating net 0 calories, our bodies will look different on graduation day than when we started. \n\n3. Fats and sugars aren't inherently unhealthy. It's important to have balanced meals to get all of your macros and nutrients, but having fats and sugars in your diet isnt inherently bad. What foods are you most concerned about? \n\n4. Skinny does not automatically mean healthy; fat does not automatically mean unhealthy. It can be very unhealthy to restrict and undernourish, just as it can be very unhealthy to excessively overeat. It can be hard to find a balance that works for you, which is why it could be helpful to see a professional. Of you have access to a dietician (not a nutritionist), that would be best, but that isnt always covered.",
