  "text": "Asking because I recently submitted a project I knew I did terribly on for one really important class that I was on track to get an A in. If my grade comes back and its as bad as I think it will be I want to ask the professor if I can redo the project. Otherwise this grade might prevent me from getting into graduate schools, since I already have a bad semester in my transcript.",

They probably won\u2019t make an exception regardless of how close y\u2019all are because that would be unfair to the rest of the class. It\u2019s also just one class, which isn\u2019t going to stop you completely from getting into grad school even with another bad semester.",
