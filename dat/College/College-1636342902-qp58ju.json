  "text": "Hello!\nI currently have a bachelors degree (graduated in May) but need to go back to grab 11 chemistry credits to move into other parts of the Lab I currently work in. When applying to schools what category does that put me in? Am I technically a graduate student? How does one go back with the intention of just getting a couple of credits and dipping? Confused on the whole process. I am near Philadelphia if that helps answer questions about what universities offer that sort of thing. Thank you!",

      "text": "I am doing the same thing in pa (pittsburgh) for accounting and I need more 30 credit to get my cpa license. I just need the accounting classes and I have everything else.\n\nI was non degree seeking but found my community college to make non degree pay the cost up front for class versus a payment plan. (I can't pay upfront $1200) but 300 a month is easier for me.\n\nI would be careful about that for you as well. I am now enrolled as a as in accounting to cover this. I probably won't get my as as I have my ba but dont want to do the gen eds. but I am not committed to it yet.",
