  "text": "I've basically been the only one doing this stuff and we've been living here for over 3 months. I've been sick for the past week so I've had literally no motivation to do these things. We have like 5 bags of garbage and a sink full of dishes. They also don't clean the floor when they spill stuff. The living room is also a mess and has been filled with trash for over a week. I'm literally the person who takes care of all of this stuff, but I've been sick. My current plan has been to just wait and hope they'd eventually do it, but they haven't. Am I really asking for too much? It's actually so bad that I want to move out because of it.",

      "text": "Definitely a conversation you need to have with your roommate about who does what chores and when and that they are expected to contribute. Has your roommate ever lived on their own before? Some people who never had to do chores at home, it never occurs to them that chores need to be done because their parents always did them.",

And yeah, I didn't mention it, but I've asked them and one guy just blatantly says he won't do it. The other one says he will but never gets around to it. They probably just want me to do everything.",
