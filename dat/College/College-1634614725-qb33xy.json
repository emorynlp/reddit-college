  "text": "College isn\u2019t going great, I don\u2019t enjoy it, and my grades aren\u2019t as good as they should be. I have options that I can use to resolve this, I can (A) I hunker down finish the next few years of college and hopefully end up at job that pays well or (B) I can quit after this semester, and start the steps to getting certified as a mountain guide. I have more options but those are the two I\u2019m really thinking about at the moment. (I got into college relatively early, and as to not overload myself only took three classes. I\u2019m also going to a community college so I don\u2019t have a ton of money invested in college so far.)",
