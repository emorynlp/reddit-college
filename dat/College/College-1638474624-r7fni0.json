  "text": "it\u2019s my first year in uni and i\u2019ve been taking this class for my major. last week i went on vacation for thanksgiving and i didn\u2019t have access to a laptop (which is where it\u2019s easiest for me to do my work) so i just decided to not turn in any work until i returned home. \n\ni had an A in the class but when i returned home i saw that I had an F as a result of me not turning in 3 assignments. the teacher has assigned two final assignments this week before the semester ends and i\u2019ve been working on them to see if my grade will change, but from the looks of it, i\u2019m not sure if it will :(\n\nsince this is a class that i\u2019m required to take for my major, if my final grade stays as an F, does that mean i\u2019ll have to retake it??",

      "text": "If you\u2019re required to take it for your major, then yes, you will have to retake it if you don\u2019t pass. In addition, if this is a prerequisite class then you won\u2019t be able to move on to the next class until you pass it. Depending on if they\u2019re only available in the spring or fall then it could set you back a bit. I would ask if you can still turn in the assignments late for partial credit.",
