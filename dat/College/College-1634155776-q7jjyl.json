I\u2019m graduating this fall and tried to accept only the fall semester loan but it said I had to accept it all. I called the school and they were able to sort it out for me in a way that I could get the whole amount for the one semester I needed. If you can\u2019t get a hold of them, send an email and then call early tomorrow.",

Half the money is disbursed at the start of the fall semester, and the other half at the beginning of the spring semester. (A three-term loan in this case could be fall semester, spring semester, and maybe either the summer semester or a winter-break mini-mester if your school does that.)\n\nIf your school is on a trimester system, then a loan would most likely be divided into three terms to begin with, and would be disbursed in thirds, one-third of the money given out at the start of each trimester.",
