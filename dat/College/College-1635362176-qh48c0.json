  "title:": "I'm taking a gap year after this semester, and I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons.",
  "text": "So this semester and spring semester of this year have been an absolute mess. I suffer from pretty bad depression and am super low energy. I wanted to take a gap year to get my mental and physical issues under control, but my mom absolutely discouraged me from doing it, so here I am. The semesters both started out okay. I would wake up on time, go to my lectures, take notes, and do my homework. But a mere couple weeks later I'm losing the will to do anything and barely even want to get up to get food sometimes or perform basic self care. College is expensive as hell, and I keep doing this without changing myself I'm just gonna be wasting time and racking up even more soul-crushing amounts of debt. I have the attention span of a goldfish, things as simple as basic chores and walking to the dining hall and lecture halls is exhausting, and my grades are absolute garbage. So I wanted to ask what everyone thinks the pros and cons of taking some time off of college would be, and if it could be worth it.",

      "text": "Taking a gap year will do your mental health good if you know what you need to work on. I took a gap year after two really bad years of crippling depression and anxiety. I took therapy too and that definitely helped a lot. The con here is that if your mom isn\u2019t supportive then it has potential to make things worse.",

I didn't want to attend immediately, but I let her talk me into it. I have plenty of other family who I know would support me though, and my dad said he would let me stay with him.",
