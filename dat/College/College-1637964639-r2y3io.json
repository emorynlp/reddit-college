  "title:": "Should I let my sister follow her dream (art) or do something more stable (veteranarian)",
  "text": "(TL;DR): Should my 18 year old sister follow her dream to become a digital design artist (looks pretty good at it), or become a Veteranarian for job and money stability. \n\nI have a sister who turned 18 last month and has high functioning autism. She struggles with english for some time but she works really hard and pulled all A's and B's for her first quarter of her senior year. I think if she puts her mind into it she can become a Veteranarian. She had an interest in animals for most of her life and is pretty good at biology so my parents and I were wondering if she can become a Veteranarian. \n\nMy sister has a strong passion to follow her dreams of becoming an artist for her ENTIRE life. She was always drawing but we have strict nigerian parents so this was always conflicting for them. My mom is a nurse and my dad is in nursing school with his bachelor's in computer science. Im in my third year of college applying to pharmacy school and my other sister who is a sophomore in high school wants to pursue some science degree and go to space. My brother is too young (9, male) so we don't know what he wants yet. He says police officer, fireman or science master every now and then. So pretty much my family is heavily health/stem oriented puttting even more pressure on my sib.\n\nI want my sister to follow her dream to do digital design but with what is going on in this world I think it would be more practical for her to become a Veteranarian, or maybe another job she is interested in that is more safe, maybe even pandemic proof. My family and I wish the best for her but I always hear about how you cannot make money on an art degree and how certain non-stem degrees will never find a job (not trying to hate on humanities majors or anything). Also she can still do art stuff to the side as a recreational thing like patreon or instagram so it isn't like she is giving up on the entire thing. \n\nI am helping her apply to the same community college I went to because nobody seems to be helping her rn and I want her to get accepted and win some scholarships. She is autistic so hopefully she can cash into that cause scholarships are really hard to find unless you have a niche. When its time to choose the major im not sure what im gonna tell her",

      "text": "You can't just tell someone to follow a career because you think the pay is good. You can suggest it, but usually it won't turn out well because the individual has no motivation/discipline to chase someone else's goal. Those two areas are so widely different too. PreVet isn't easy either. Its like premed almost and if she is struggling already, you are just tossing money away. There are less than 30 veterinary schools in the U.S so its very competitive.",
