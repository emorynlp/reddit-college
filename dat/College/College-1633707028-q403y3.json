  "title:": "Skipping way too many classes",
  "text": "Im skipping my STATs and astronomy lectures purely because the professors are horrible. I feel like for the money I payed it just feels like a waste. I'm a freshman too but credit wise im a sophmore almost junior. I could only register for classes post-orientation which was in like august so my class times suck and some of my professors are 2nd or 3rd choices. My STATS professor basically just reads off a slide and does sample problems in which he nevers explains clearly. I always have to go to the TAs office hour just to understand whats going in lecture. I decided to not go to lecture anymore because it was a 9am (I commute) and I found the textbook a lot more helpful. I also skip my astronomy lectures because its just a class i tooo for my lib ed credits. My professor is an assistant professor who I think just started teaching. The material is seems interesting but the way he teaches makes is so passive and slow that lots of students leave mid lecture. I felt bad that this was happening and I shouldve talked to him about it but I decided to just not attened lectures anymore too. I just feel like the money I worked for is kind of wasted on this expierence.",

          "text": "Sorry what I'm trying to say that I have a better time learning the material on my own than going to lectures specifically for these two classes. My other classes lectures feel like they are actually worth going to. I just dont like how I'm paying so much for this quality of teaching. I considered dropping the class, but other sections are filled out so I decided to just finish it so I dont fall behind on credits",
