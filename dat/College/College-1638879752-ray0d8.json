  "title:": "How do you study a boring and dense material?",
  "text": "I have some mandatory math courses even though I don\u2019t particularly like math. Subjects are pretty boring because the material is too abstract for me and there aren\u2019t many practical examples provided, so I easily lose focus when I try to read the lecture notes. \n\nI have to read, understand and prove theorems, definitions, mathematical properties and I simply hate them. I have no problems solving practical exercises. With numbers, not symbols. \n\nDo you have tips for such situation? How do you manage boring lecture notes?",

      "text": "I always resort to videos on YouTube for every topic in my math classes. I also find it extremely difficult to be engaged when it comes to book work (or even PowerPoints) so finding videos that pertain to exactly what I\u2019m learning at the moment really helps keep my attention and I find I learn it better. Khan Academy, The Organic Chemistry Tutor, and Maths Genie are some of my favorite math YouTube channels. I hope this helps!!",
