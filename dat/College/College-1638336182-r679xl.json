  "text": "Hi everyone, so basically I just submitted my CSS today and didn\u2019t realize until after that the CSS for Fordham was due on November 15. I submitted it 15 days later, today November 30, and I was wondering if me submitting it late will affect my chances of getting accepted into the school? Thanks!",
