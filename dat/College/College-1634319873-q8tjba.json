And cheap prices most of the time only apply for citizens of the European Union, which get national prices instead of international ones.\n\nThough there are exchange programs that could cost less money.\n\nEdit: which languages do you speak?",

If you are interested you can search the specifics on the Internet.\n\nI don't know the price for non-EU students. My tuition fee this year costed me 350 euros (around 400$), but I was eligible for a discount, it usually costs 800 euros (840$). That is the price in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, concretely Granada. The prices of tuition fees vary from Autonomous Community to Autonomous Community.",
