  "text": "Being the smart kid in elementary middle and high school got me accepted in one of the most pretentious colleges in my country if not the best, but now after two months I am lost, I can\u2019t seem to focus, I can\u2019t even bring myself to study,  I am no longer participating in class as I used to, not even concentrate in class, I feel hopeless, I am no longer the smart kid but just an average, or even the dumbest out there, I am stressed out  and sad because I don\u2019t want my hard work to go to waste because of this unexplained laziness, I really worked so hard my whole life to join this shit hole of uni and planing on studying abroad in Japan in 2023 so if I fucked up it\u2019s the end. I am finding it hard to bring myself to sit in my desk and do shit. I beg you please tell me what should I do? I really can\u2019t go on like this. If I do my  parents are gonna be disappointed and my future too. I live in a third world country and unis are for free but to study abroad I still need to pay but most importantly I need good marks. I am studying computer science to be a data science. Sorry for my bad English, I hope I was clear\u2026",

      "text": "Your english is great and there is no need to apologize for that! It\u2019s also completely normal to go from \u201cthe smart kid\u201d to \u201caverage student\u201d in college, every college student grades fall compared to High School  because the content really isn\u2019t as \u2018easy\u2019 as it is in HS, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t bring your grades up, you just need to find a way to study that you like the most and that works the best for you. \n\nAbout the laziness, you\u2019re the only one who can change that. Set some goals for the future that will make it all be worth it, studying abroad  can be a good incentive to get out of your bed, think how much you\u2019ll regret it knowing that you COULD have studied abroad, but didn\u2019t because of something that was actually under your control. But after studying abroad, what are your goals, career wise? What do you wanna do? Think that you are the only person that can get you there and meanwhile you are feeling lazy, there\u2019s thousands, millions of students who are doing their thing and that will be competing with you in the future, so don\u2019t disappoint your future self now. \n\nAlso, try making daily goals, say (or write somewhere) to yourself \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m gonna do a, b, c and d\u201d, it not only helps to organize yourself, but will also motivate you to get out of bed. \n\nNow, if what you\u2019re feeling is not only laziness and may be a problem greater than that (you\u2019re feeling depressed and such), I would tell you to seek out for help, maybe try talking with your parents and look for professional help.\n\nBest of luck!",
