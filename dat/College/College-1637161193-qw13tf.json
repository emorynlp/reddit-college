  "text": "How do you deal with end of the semester burnout? I think I have like 2 weeks left + finals. And I\u2019m so burnt out\u2026. Like I\u2019ve skipped classes so many times in the last week and I\u2019ve only been on campus today for 2 hours and I\u2019ve already had it cross my mind like a dozen times that I should just skip my next 3 classes and go home\u2026",

      "text": "This is the toughest part of college, and in my opinion, the real test. You paid for college and you're there for a reason, don't lose sight of that. This is the moment when you have to dig deep and gather the strength and motivation to keep going. You're almost done, only 2 weeks left. There's no magic pill you can take, no magic advice, no spell that's gonna get you to classes and finish the work. It's all up to you. And the real test is figuring out if you want to still be there or not. If you don't want to be there, then you should have dropped out and not wasted all the money and time. But you're here, at the end. You made it so close to the finish line. So, it's up to you; do you want to finish strong or forever remember how you wasted your time and gave up right before the end? (I can tell you from experience, you should go with the first choice.)",
