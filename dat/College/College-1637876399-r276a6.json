      "text": "I went to community college and was transferring. There were two colleges I was looking at, let's call then U1 and U2. \n\nI went to visit U1 on an open day. It was big and intimidating at first, and had to sit though way too much rah-rah-we-are-great stuff. I went off with all the humanities-interested people (my field!) and after listening to some speeches, I got to meet a few professors. Each humanities major had a different table with two professors from each major there. I went to the major-table I was interested in and briefly explained my interests, as they are fairly niche. He said my interested sounded very interesting and they definitely have the faculty for it, and then gave me his personal business card and said to email him directly if I had more questions (something I regret never doing, but I ended up knowing that professor anyways). Then I took a tour of campus. It was busy, but full of energy. The library was huge but full of life. Every student seemed to be on a mission. There were places to be and people to see. It felt invigorating. Seeing so many driven people made me want to be the best I could be. It felt fun!\n\nA month later U2 has an open day. I go there, and am led on a tour. It was quiet despite classes happening. Only a couple students about. Saw some buildings and the library, but all felt sleepy. Cozy, but perhaps nap-inducing. The tour then led over to the gym (I'm not particularly athletic) before being forced to sit through annoying rah-rah-we-are-great stuff. Then the tour went and split up to meet with financial aid people. Being more interested in the academics, I tried to ask questions the financial aid office didn't know. They didn't even tell me who could answer my questions. They operated under the assumption you will be coming here anyways, so might as well talk about costs. Coincidentally, costs for U1 and U2 were the same so U2's emphasis on how cost-effective they were sounded fake.\n\nPerhaps you can guess I ended up only applying for U1 (U2 had rolling admissions in case I failed getting into U1, but I naively only applied for one university, something I don't recommended especially when U1 had a 40% acceptance rate...). In U1, people were busy, I could talk direct with extremely kind professors, students felt like they were off to change the world. U2 felt snoozy and as if no one was sure whether to get out of bed today, let alone change the world.\n\nTL;DR: I thrive on activity.",

      "text": "College visit road trip My friends and I went on we basically it's clean headed out from Maryland, Wind up the East Coast all the way to Colby college in Maine stopping at like Columbia Dartmouth, William and Mary, Princeton, University of Maryland, Vasser vasser, Headed to Ohio state, Then the Notre Dame and perdue, Then The University of Chicago where I ended up. Then we headed to Vanderbilt where another of our friends was going or planning on going at least. Then we did a stretch down South Texas A&M, George Tech,  Sorry I forgot about Harvard Yale and MIT we we saw those and went to a couple parties there when we were in Boston and the New England area. But once we got down South we checked out to Tulane University, Florida state, And then Then we left the car we were using with a friend in Tallahassee and took a flight out to the West Coast stopping in Denver and heading Out to check out the University of Colorado at Boulder then we headed to the West Coast, Checked out usc, UCLA, Berkeley, California Polly technic, We also stopped at California Institute of Technology, Then we went to the University of Oregon, University of Washington In Seattle. And then we Decided To drive back so we rented a car And ended up driving up to Canada to check out a University in Vancouver then we drove through northern Canada for a little while stopped at Western University just to take a look, Then we ended up heading through Michigan after a bit more driving stopped at the University of Michigan at Michigan at Auburn and Ann Arbor, Then we headed to Wisconsin to check out the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Milwaukee, Then we headed to University of Minnesota and then down to the University of Iowa just for the heck of it because one of our friends had ended up being recruited for their football team and we spent about a week there partying there was a lot of corn kind of fun a lot of field parties. Then we headed back through Chicago just so I could get a second look at the University I had decided on also we returned the car there and flew back But we had to lay over in Boston again so we decided to take a second look at The schools there ended up stopping add a friend's place And well he had some kind of party going on so we ended up though we ended up just kind of crashing at his house for a couple days having a bit of fun. Before driving back down and well my boyfriend at the time wanted and did end up attending Annapolis Before deciding military wasn't quite right for him so he right for him so he kind of dropped out after a year Had to cover the cost of his education for that year and then ended up transferring To Boston college But yeah we kind of just drove back to Maryland stopped in DC to take a look out of school Did a brief swing down to the carolinas and Virginia because we had hit the other States why not The same friend boyfriend that was interested in Annapolis wanted to take a look at the sentinel as well I think that was what we stopped at can't remember the exact name of the school so sorry. And then we headed back home to Maryland\n\nWe had stayed at the dorm rooms or apartments of friends from our school that had gone to random schools we were visiting pretty much for free it was a massive road trip took us a month or so little more really We were seniors, It was actually a common thing to do like after that like after the football season had ended you could opt for online classes if you line classes if you were going on the college visit swing of things There were points where some of us had to fly back so some of us were at some colleges others weren't just depended on what schools you were interested in it was fun. A lot of getting called and sick and using like the full allotted 20 days for college visits in the student Handbook taking online classes or just using the virtual software that my school liked to advertise So yeah they liked to give students who were sick the option option to be able to still be in class, Every year the senior class at my school gets swept with mono and some other less than savory illness or another I'm fairly certain it's just people taking full advantage of the college visit policy the policy but it works out well most people keep their grades up. And you get a taste of the college experience while traveling\n\nBut yeah I knew the school I ended up at was the school I wanted to attend because when I was on campus I was buying coffee and they were just these 2 guys it's 2 guys sitting at a table discussing A particular Facet of physics referring to optics And just how light is reflected depending on depending on the circumstances and and well I just kind of sat downIn the only seat that was available which was literally at their table after asking if I could and they just kind of pulled me into the conversation. There was no like snobbery Or anything it was just people wanting to have a conversation they had never met each other before and had just started talking while they were waiting for their coffee and I told them I was a prospective student taking a look at campus and they started filling me on the different Intricacies of the physics department at the school opportunities event opportunities available for freshmen research And just the different dorms one of them was rushing a Fraternity it was a good Time I went to a party that he invited me to with my friends. And honestly had some of the most intellectually stimulating conversations of my life there in that 12 hour. Before we headed out of of Chicago Onto the next University that our friend Matt wanted to take a look at.\n\nIn general that was when I kind of knew I wanted to go there just because the school really actually fit with the banner live the life of the mind. I felt happy there honestly it felt right like this was where I wanted to study.I got extraordinarily lucky and I got accepted and and I chose to attend that particular University I've enjoyed my 4 years here immensely and I've grown as a person intellectually intellectually and socially. I love the city I have enjoyed my time at the University and it's really helped to shape me into the person that I've become. A person I'm happy to be, My friends got into some of the schools they wanted to go to others didn't but we all ended up somewhere and for the most part with the most part whenever asked this kind of thing I do know most of us mention this trip and just the fact the best way to know if you like a school is to go there but if that's not possible check out some virtual tours online at least for me that moment in the coffee shop just talking to random people who were students who were so welcoming and so willing to have a conversation about physics while waiting for coffee for coffee was the moment I decided I wanted to attend the school because it was different than back home and it just felt right to me. Mind you I still wanted to go to MIT and Stanford but I ended up at The University of Chicago because that was where I felt the most at home I was at home and just felt like that was the right place for me to study.\n\nSo just depending where you go take a look at some colleges go on visit heck even go check out your community college your local community college at least for the 1st couple years that might be the cheapest and best option for some people just out of high school",
