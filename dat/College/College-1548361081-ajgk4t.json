I think teachers who require a book(s) that they wrote for a class should be forced to sell it at cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShout out to the creative writing teacher I had who required a \"book\" she wrote that was literally $6 (sold basically at cost) to actually do the opposite of this!

The only educators who required us to pay for a textbook that they read were lecturers.",

      "text": "My peeves: \n\n1. Some textbook decisions are made at the department level and faculty are told what book to use. \n\n2. Publishers want to kill off the used textbook market. How they are doing this is by telling Dept Chairs that they can offer the E-Text cheaper then the physical book. So take MyMathLab......they offer the e-text for $126 while the actual print book costs $150. It seems like a deal until you realize you can't buy the damn book used anymore. \n\n3. Some colleges are using the publisher systems (MyMathLab, Cengage Mindtap, etc) for online courses while bundling the e-text. The only problem these systems do not give you access to the material without paying the publisher. So if you buy a used textbook, you are still locked out of the system until you pay $100 to the publisher. I don't know how this is legal if you paid tuition for the course. Fucked up. \n\n4. I have a firm suspicion that some dept chairs take kick backs from publisher sales reps for adopting their textbooks. When an A&P textbook costs $250 and the fucking subject has really changed in 20 years......WTF?!?!\n\n5. Some faculty (ones forced to use a certain textbook) don't bother to read the assigned book. \n\n6. Some faculty download the textbook test banks from the publisher and then throw them into Blackboard or Canvas and don't bother to actually read the test....they just tell the system to throw out 50 out of 100 questions at random. Come on.....",
