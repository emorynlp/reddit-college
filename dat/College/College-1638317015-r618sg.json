  "text": "So I applied to some PhD programs and asked some of my professors for recommendation letters several weeks ago. 2 of my my recommenders have sent in their letters, but one has not sent any. I had sent a follow up a couple weeks ago that she responded to saying she hadn\u2019t had time and a follow up again today just reminding her of the deadline. No response today.\n\nDo University\u2019s toss out applications if letters of recommendation are late? Or am I over thinking?",
