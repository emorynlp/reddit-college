  "text": "I am in so much pain I end up putting off school work some days. I will admit I don't exercise like I did before school started, but I'm going to start today.\n\n However I have one of those husband pillows I prop up against the wall and I use that to lean against while on my laptop, and my laptop is on a food tray table at eye level. I have my icy hot and a baseball to roll on my neck and back next to me at all times like I'm 60 years old. After 20 minutes of sitting in one spot my neck gets so sore I can't concentrate. I have to keep cracking it. School takes up a lot of my time so I can't be the only one with this problem, right?!",
