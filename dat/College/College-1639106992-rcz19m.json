  "text": "It's as the title says. It's the first exam of my programming class and it hit me that I wasn't meant for this course. I couldn't process shit and I wasn't able to complete the exam even with the given 3 hours.\nIt's 10% of my grade and I'm even more scared for my midterms because that is worth 25%",

      "text": "I had an old friend my freshman year who got a 3% in her class. She couldn\u2019t do anything to fix it and had other issues she was taking care of and nobody judged her. It happens, we realize a class is too difficult for us sometimes. Could you email your professor and see if there\u2019s any chance that you can do a late withdrawal? I\u2019ve known people who were able to do that but it had to be brought to review",

      "text": "Are you able to still withdraw from the class? If it's the first exam you might still be able to. If you're not understanding things now you may not later into the class as well, better to withdraw now than take the F. \n\nIf you wish to continue with the subject, maybe try studying it on your own or take the class with a different professor a separate semester. It might be their teaching style that's not clicking with you and holding you down, not the subject itself.",
