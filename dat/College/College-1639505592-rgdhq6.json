If you are struggling with a paper you could ask to show them your thesis and part of your outline or something. I would make sure to have something prepared before you go to get more out of it",

Let them know what your goals are, how you plan on achieving it, etc., & see if they can help. For example, want to learn more about a type of job? They might be able to connect you with alumni in that position to tell you more about it.",

I missed points here on this assignment / test, can you explain what I did wrong?",
