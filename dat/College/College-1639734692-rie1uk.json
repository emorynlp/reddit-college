      "text": "He can technically report anyone to the school for any reason. You can too. There is no requirement for the complaint to make sense. If he wanted to, he could file a report because you talked about giraffes on a Tuesday.\n\nNow, despite everyone having the ability to file a report for any reason, the university will obviously throw out claims that are not against an actual policy or make no sense.\n\nYou can also file a lawsuit for any reason. You could sue someone for wearing blue shoes or something stupid, it would just get thrown out but technically you would be able to file it and everything. Not relevant but a fun fact.",
