  "text": "i was just wondering if anyone else gets these calls. so far i\u2019ve gotten \u201cwilliam\u201d, \u201cmia torres\u201d, \u201ccharlie\u201d, and \u201cchelsea\u201d (and probably more names) calling me to tell me i\u2019m eligible for student loan forgiveness. this SCREAMS scam to me, especially since 1) i don\u2019t get emails about this and 2)they don\u2019t even address the university i go to. i would assume my university would be telling me about my loans, or i would be getting emails or letters in the mail. thanks in advance!",

      "text": "These are scam phone calls, often pretending to be a collection agency looking to collect on said student loans, usually they get your name in a data breech and just call based on your age since tons of statistically speaking if you call enough 19-25 years olds one of them will be in college. If you are at risk for defaulted on a student loan or eligible for a student loan forgiveness program you will usual receive a letter or an email for your bank, or the department of education depending on Loan type as a notice",
