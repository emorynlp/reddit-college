  "text": "I basically went through like 10 or 15 forum/quora/reddit posts, and read two books to compile these tips. Any additions are welcome. \n\nThe most important section is the \"study habits\" section, as noted by some commenters \n  \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1jN3Hy1h4he5eHTbq5enaDVrrlywBvAYjXELia6R_9j8/edit#\n\nAnd here is another post from this subreddit that goes far deeper into the importance of habit and routine forming than I have. (I agree with everything on the post)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4wrp56/what_i_tell_incoming_freshman_every_year_good/\n\nAll advice on that post aligns with at least one, if both,  of the college books I've read. Srsly read it lol.\n\nP. S. (entirely unrelated) I found a survey app called Pulse for college students exclusively. They often ask questions about depression, school, etc. If you have the time/are interested pls use my referral code (you also get 250 pulse points, note it's only 1200 to redeem a 3 month trial in skillshare) : Follow the link below or enter the code o8yddW5VOR in the app. https://bbuw.app.link/o8yddW5VOR\n\nThe survey results are pretty interesting and cover areas like dating, alcohol, intelligence, depression, school etc. It's restricted to college students with a college email address. you can redeem prizes like a 3 month trial to skillshare with just 60 surveys (2 minutes each). I'm trying to get the biggest prize of an electric bike, so that I can bike to a near by climbing gym 2-3 times a week for fitness/training for a climbing competition. ",

Oh how much must I sacrifice to get into a good grad school xD\n3.9 GPA first quarter, but probably will get harder as I take more upper divs. Soon my choice of EE major will bare its fangs. ",

I agree that those are the most important tips, and will definitely have the most immediate effect on your grades. \n\n\"You don't get good grades form doing anything else.\"\n\nI pretty much agree with that, but one of the other main points of my google doc was to prevent people with crazy course loads from burning out. Sure, you could \"just do your homework, show up for class,and study every day\", but if you have seven classes and don't have some hardcore time management skills and good priorities, you're going to burn out sooner or later. \n\nalso note the top comment on this thread about using more than just your academic abilities to get an A in humanities classes. I have never used that strategy before, and I'll be going into STEM anyways, but there are other, albeit less honorable, ways to get good grades",

This also helps when they are reading a paper of yours because they know you it is easier for them to understand your ideas. ",

IT INDEED IS THE BEST ADVICE FOR \"humanities\" classes. \n\nI think it's worthwhile to note that this is probably only valid for upper div classes, small classes, non-engineering classes, or any combination of those categories. Ie\n\nIn upper divs, classes are smaller, work is more abstract=>more room for subjective grading(this applies to some stem courses as well) \n\nIn large classes, usually professors don't even get to know you even if you go to office hours, plus they usually don't grade the test anyways.\n\nIn non engineering classes, a lesser quality work is decided to be so subjectively, so there's some room to wiggle, while in stem when you're wrong you're pretty much just wrong. Period.\n\nAll in all, if you want to get something out of your stem education, just learn the material well and don't bother with these \"trickery\" type grade boosters. Foundations are much more improtant in stem than humanities. ",
