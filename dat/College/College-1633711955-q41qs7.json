  "title:": "Should I Double Major As A Transfer Student??",
  "text": "  I'm currently in my first semester at college and even before I applied, I couldn't decide between majoring in Early Education or Art. Finally, I settled on Early Education. I am now considering transferring to a college in-state (less expensive) and I'm wondering if I should double major Early Education and Art? If I don't enjoy teaching an elementary classroom, I could teach art to all grades, or try to get into a different art career. I know these professions may not be exactly high earning but they're my passions. On the other hand, I've also thought about minoring in Spanish (to both learn the language more and seem better on job applications), but would that be too much if I do decide to double major?\n\n  For anyone who's double majored, what was the reason and how did it go? Do you have any advice, pros, cons, etc??",

      "text": "For context, I'm semi-accidentally double majoring. I happened to have enough credits to have both a second major and one minor. My advisor suggested that I use those credits toward such versus the alternative: random electives that wouldn't equate to anything beyond classes on my transcript.\n\nThat said, I did do some planning for my second major in going with a subject I was familiar with, somewhat interested in, and could see myself working with in the short term as a job. Goal-wise, I've dedicated myself to going for a long-term career in my first major, so my second one isn't really life-defining, as most people consider majors to be. Ideally, my second major will prepare me for a job post-graduation as I earn an additional degree for my dream job that is, again, based on my first major. My minor also supports my first major as it addresses some topics from a specific area in it. With all that said, my advice is to focus on your passions, whether in one subject or two. I definitely see myself not feeling as motivated with my second major because my interest in it isn't as strong, and that makes things feel more draining when they don't have to be.\n\nDelving into the pros, I've come to realize that some employers seem to consider those with multiple areas of study to be more well-rounded. As previously suggested, it can expand your career opportunities too, but that likely depends on how majors are or aren't related to one another. That also doesn't matter to everyone, some people set on having a career in one subject area for their entire lives. While I don't think it's hard to study multiple topics, many people do think so, and it can be easy to be admirable in the eyes of some for that reason.\n\nThen there's the more significant con, which is that double majors can pack your schedule. While the supposed standard is to stay in college as an undergraduate student for four years, many people already stay for five. An advisor probably has a trustworthy answer for you on what the length of your stay can hypothetically look like, and I can say from personal experience that many second majors were a no-go for me because they'd hold me back a year or two. I'm in a rare situation in which my current one doesn't hold me back at all. Decisions around this issue come down to what you want and need for your future: Where do you see yourself in x amount of years? Can you realistically stay in college, taking away time from other opportunities, jobs included, for x amount of time? If not, what might your support system look like, maybe in your family, to help you out when you could be limited in helping yourself?\n\nI know it's probably overwhelming but, whatever you do, I hope that you have strong communication with an advisor in this! Having professional guidance in your idea to double major, with or without a minor, is not only insightful but necessary.",

      "text": "I was going to double major as a transfer student this year but after talking to my advisor it was going to take me another 4 years to graduate. So I decided not to, but I was going to double major in art (graphic design) and biology. My major choices are different so it could be because of that, but I had taken classes towards both majors when completing my Associates degree so it was kind of disappointing. I decided not to double major but definitely talk to the advisors for both majors because that helped me make my final decision in the end. Good luck!",

              "text": "Of course! I went ahead with graphic design because I had more credit hours going towards that major! I felt like I couldn\u2019t choose between the two at all, because I wanted to have a backup plan just in case like you mentioned. In the end I chose the one that would take me less time in case I ended up wanting to go back to school for biology! If you genuinely enjoy both and can\u2019t choose, maybe minor in the one that will take you longer to complete. I have a minor in environmental science just to do a little bit of both!",
