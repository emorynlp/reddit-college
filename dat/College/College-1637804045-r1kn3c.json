  "text": "Everyone I talk to about how college was going recommended me and I was hesitant at first. When I got the call to schedule an appointment for a therapy session I was skeptical, nervous/anxious. I thought \"I have to sit and talk about my feelings,\" which if you know me personally... not big on opening up at first. So, I decided why not? Worst case, I don't care for it, and I don't ever have to do it again. Today was my first session and, I can't express how much gratitude I give to therapists. I'm a psychology major and, now I am re-considering my major and journey lol. Granted, I know some can be assholes, but mine was not only a woman, but she listened and actually cared. Coming from a family that shows their \"love\" in negative ways, I appreciated it felt good to get that healthy validation and genuine concern. So today was a win I haven't felt or had in a while, considering how college is going for me right now.\n\nJust thought I'd share :)",
