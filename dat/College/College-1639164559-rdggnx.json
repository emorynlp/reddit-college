  "text": "I didn't get full marks for attendance (just need to be present) even though I was at nearly every lecture for this class. I only missed a class the first week because I wasn't enrolled yet, and another because I was genuinely sick & the prof said it would not be counted against me. How can I politely point this out? I end up sounding confrontational in emails when I really don't mean to lol.",
