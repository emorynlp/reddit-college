  "text": "We were taking a mid-term in the class via laptops, while taking the exam my laptop popped a blue screen it was completely out of my control, then later during the exam, the exam shutdown on its own for everyone. The professor said leave we will figure it out later, and figuring it out means that people who did not answer will get a full mark on the question they did not answer, Obviously everyone knows you should answer everything no matter if you know or not, and I did that, at least if I did not have time to do the exam I might be lucky with a few answers but this is not the issue. I decided to answer and then come back to check and focus on the questions that were hard but at that point the exam shutdown, what should I say to my professor?",
