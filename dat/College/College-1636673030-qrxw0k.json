      "text": "I agree with the other comments. It would be stated in the syllabus as a part of your grade, and the teacher will usually explain what they cared about attendance. Example: two of my classes they dont care if you dont attend, it doesnt dock you points. While one of my classes is attendance and participation, if they notice you arent paying attention in the class or arent participating in activities they will dock points.\n\nIn the syllabus your grades should be broken down into how much goes into your final grade, that's where you should be able to find how much attendance matters.",
