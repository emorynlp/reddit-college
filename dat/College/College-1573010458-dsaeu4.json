  "text": "Just noticing perpetual trends.  Let me know if I missed any.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 Month before the semester starts:\n\nGuys, I want to take 21 credits, be active in 5 clubs and work full time.  Is this doable?\n\nHow do I make friends in college?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 Week after classes start:\n\nMy roommate exists. Should I contact an RA?\n\nMy roommate mugged me and lit my bed on fire.  Am I an asshole if I report them?\n\nDoes anybody else miss home while they are at college?\n\nIs college suppose to be this easy?\n\nHow do I make friends in college?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround midterm:\n\nMy professor and I had a misunderstanding. Should I contact the dean?\n\nIs college suppose to be this hard?\n\nHow do I make friends in college?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 weeks before finals:\n\nI've got an 32% in my class. How can I bring this up to an A?\n\nSomeone in my group isn't participating.  Should I tell the professor?\n\nHow do I make friends in college?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinals:\n\nI just finished my final 5 minutes ago. Why haven't my grades posted?\n\nMy professor wouldn't round my 32% up to an A.  Should I go to the dean?\n\nHow do I make friends in college?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 Week after finals:\n\nDoes anyone else miss college while they are on break?\n\nHow do I make friends in college?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Ok, you fun-hating people.  We get it, your school is different and your midterms aren't over.  They are over for most of the traditional semesters (Jan-May and Aug-December).\n\nEdit 2: Honorable mentions:\n\nWill it be weird for me to go back to college? (I'm 22) I think it'll look weird if I'm there.  - u/aliensfordonuts\n\nDaE nOt EnJoY dRiNkiNg CuLtUrE oR iS tHaT jUsT mE?

Should I go?  - u/xmarketladyx\n\nThe professor said that we\u2019re graded on attendance, and it\u2019s in the syllabus. I skipped most of my classes and now I don\u2019t have an A anymore. Can he legally do this? - u/hemehime\n\nEdit 3:  Last contributions:\n\n I have 1,000% in this class because BlackBoard can't handle manual data entry. If I don't tell the professor she's made an error, will my GPA really go above a 4.0 forever? - u/Professah_Oak \n\n My professor never showed up to class. They're not responding to emails. Should I contact the dean or their next of kin? - u/Professah_Oak\n\nI'm really struggling in class, but I've never been to office hours. How can I possibly I bring my grade up? - u/Professah_Oak\n\nI plagiarized text and the plagiarism software flagged it. Wat do? - u/Professah_Oak\n\nThis was the last edit.  I'm done.

I\u2019ve had to withdraw from a class already, and I\u2019m still drowning in work, and the class I was forced ot withdraw from was my core english gen ed, i was pulling all nighters in week 6 and 7, and was told in class by a strict deadline prof that i did my essays on the wrong readings cause i was tired and misread the numbers and i straight up had a full scale panic attack in class.",

The final exam ended up being 3 research papers that had to be done on the day of the final. I ended up reading like 20 novels for that class to do the essays.",

My roommates are both pre-med and both have the same major. They\u2019re basically besties at this point. I don\u2019t fit in here at all.

Eventually you bond over merely existing and going through the same daily struggle.  You form an in-group by having shared experiences.\n\nIt's an actual thing in psychology called the proximity principle.\n\nClubs, work, class (sitting near the same people every day), etc all help facilitate this.",

Talk to them about various shared experiences and ask them questions which you then bring up the answers to in the future to show that you care. Then eventually you can start asking to get lunch or dinner with them or something like that.\n\nWhen I first got to uni, I did a program where you move in a week early and do various fun activities. I picked a few people that seemed interesting and just always walked with them and chatted. I found out that three of them always got dinner together so I asked if I could join and now we are really good friends.",
