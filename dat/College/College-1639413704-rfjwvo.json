  "text": "First of all, I'm 18 and right now I'm the third year of highschool and I'm really struggling. I researched a bit and found few promising colleges that you can go to without finish highschool and I'm really excited because of it because highschool is a real hell for me.\n\nI'd like to be a movie director in the future and it's an art college in the capital of my country so I'll have to move towns as well. \n\nI saw all the subjects they're teaching throughout the 4 year length and I really like what I'm seeing. I'm going to see a teacher one of the subjects and I'll consult with him. I'd like to present the best of me, but I'd like to point out my flaws too to see if I'm compatible for that specific college.\n\nAny important questions I should ask?",
