  "text": "College sophomore rn I\u2019ve pretty much stopped procrastinating on homework but freshman I was terrible. I would turn in assignment within hour of due date often and Sundays were the so stressful. \nI got a job that allows me to do homework at work and I started doing homework in between classes instead of hanging out or watching tv. So now I practically don\u2019t have any work to do over weekend. And I don\u2019t feel stressed about school most of the time anymore.\nI say all this to encourage any procrastinators to get your work done as soon as you can, it makes college feel 100x easier and less stressful. I don\u2019t really have any tips other than just do it.",
