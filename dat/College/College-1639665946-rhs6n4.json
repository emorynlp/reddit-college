  "text": "I plan to watch the new Batman movie with my cousin in March. She lives in Miami and spring break is scheduled for the weekend the movie comes out, so I thought I should stay for an extra few days to enjoy myself. I\u2019ve never traveled anywhere for spring break and I\u2019m kind of envious of my classmates in the past who drove to Florida for spring break, so why not? This is my last semester in college so it\u2019s better to do this now than never, right?\n\nMy plan is to reserve a hotel on Miami Beach, or any hotel within 10 miles of it, and go out occasionally. The movie comes out that Friday so I\u2019ll have the weekend to myself for going to the beach, going to salsa clubs, and exploring the city. What else is there to do? Also, do people usually hook up more during spring break?",

      "text": "\"My plan is to reserve a hotel on Miami Beach, or any hotel within 10 miles of it, and go out occasionally.\"\n\nCheck Airbnb too, might have some good places. Also I don't know if there are hostels in Miami but those would be better to meet other students and young travelers. If you use a hotel or Airbnb, check the fine print for age requirements. Some cities like Miami don't like spring breakers so there are some places that will have a higher minimum age requirement for lodging.\n\nI wouldn't book anything more than a mile or two away from where you want to be. Florida is not easy to get around in and you'll have to either rent a car or pay a lot for Ubers if you are that far away.\n\n\"What else is there to do?\"\n\nProbably some good Latin American food to try. There are fishing and boat tours too if you are into that. Or you could do watersports.\n\n\"Also, do people usually hook up more during spring break?\"\n\nOn average maybe. It depends on where you are going. Students frequenting  Europe, LA, or NY are going to respond differently to that than ones who prefer camping or mountaineering trips. By the way Miami is generally a bit older crowd too if I recall correctly, but you should still see a lot of younger people during the time of year you will be going.\n\n\"This is my last semester in college so it\u2019s better to do this now than never, right?\"\n\nYeah it makes sense if you want to do something over your break. It's questionable how travel restrictions will be next year so this also is an easy trip to start off with since it's only domestic.",
