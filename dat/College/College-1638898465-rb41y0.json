      "text": "Not aerospace, but I knew a girl who had gotten an HR degree, worked in HR for 6 years and then went back and got a ChemE degree. In general, older students have more maturity, more work experience, etc. So I think you might have a keg up when it comes to networking and career opportunities if you have the grades to back yourself up. It may be harder to fit in with the students, so determine if you want to work with a study group or think you can fly solo.",

I\u2019ve looked at Arizona state abet accredited it bachelors, osu post bacc in computer science, Arizona state abet accredited engineering management, Georgetown cybersecurity masters, and embry riddle masters systems engineering. I\u2019m working on my 2nd masters in project management from Georgetown and think I\u2019ll take a 5 year break from school. So I\u2019ll be 41 before I work on getting a stem degree. I say go for it. Retirement by the time we retire won\u2019t be till 70 so we have a lot of working years.",
