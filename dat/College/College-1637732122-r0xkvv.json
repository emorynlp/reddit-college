  "text": "I keep on searching for computer science and software engineering internships via my schools job search website, but all of the ones I've found so far want experience in programming languages other than what I know (for example, JavaScript, SQL, and Python, when all I know is Java from taking AP CSA in high school). For other people in my school, I know that they already got experience from their time in high school, and the reason why I haven't done anything yet was because I was originally intending to major in mechE and am now considering switching to CS. How exactly should I go about getting this experience if, from the looks of it, every known experience wants experience beforehand?",
