Most just say to at least change things up / not copy it word for word exactly and not to use a whole chunk of it. Most of them have been fine with it as long as the recycled assignment isn't a huge portion of the new one. But of course I would never have done it without asking first and getting permission, I think if I had done it without permission the professor would have reported it and counted it as plagiarism.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve done this with parts of previous papers before. \n\n1: Do not copy massive chunks word for word. A paragraph is fine. 50% of the entire paper is not. \n\n2: Anything you reuse, CITE IT, CITE IT, CITE IT. An example citation in my papers for re-using my work included \u201cMy full name, Paper name, university name, paper written on date\u201d. If you properly cite your previous work, and your profs don\u2019t have an explicit rule that you can\u2019t actually cite something that is unpublished to the public domain, you will be fine. \n\n3: if your profs do have a rule stating that only public works are allowed to be referenced, upload your previous paper to a blog post, and cite that blog instead. It counts as a source. \n\n4: BE SMART about what you\u2019re citing. The objective of writing a paper is to learn something new each time, whether that\u2019s a new method of researching a topic, or the topic itself. If you can paraphrase a large section and only need to cite a small part verbatim, then you\u2019ve learned more than if you cited the entire section verbatim. \n\nRemember, your writing style progresses as you go through university. I thought my first year papers were the best, but when I got to my final year and wrote my dissertation, my first year papers looked trash in comparison. If I\u2019d cited them verbatim, I would not have graduated with first class honors. \n\nFailure to cite work you\u2019re reusing (whether that\u2019s your own work or other people\u2019s works) is plagiarism. There are no two ways about it. However, properly cited works can be viewed as a tactical shortcut to save time when done correctly",
