Most just say to at least change things up / not copy it word for word exactly and not to use a whole chunk of it. Most of them have been fine with it as long as the recycled assignment isn't a huge portion of the new one. But of course I would never have done it without asking first and getting permission, I think if I had done it without permission the professor would have reported it and counted it as plagiarism.",
