  "title:": "My University is getting rid of my major after my class. Do I stay?",
  "text": "I am currently a freshman at a small, yet prestigious stem school in the Midwest. I am majoring in biology, but shortly after I committed to the school, it was announced that they were phasing out my major and pretty much any other non-engineering major. I was not happy, but academically the school made sense, bc their pre-med program has a 99% acceptance rate into med school. After the first half of my first semester, I'm having my doubts about staying. I can finish out my four years here, it is just more complicated and I might have to take some bio classes online which I really hate. Besides the academics, I love it here. I have friends, an on campus job, and there's a co-op program that is required where I work three months and then go to school three months and repeat that all four years. Will it look worse to stay at a school that is getting rid or your major as soon as you leave with multiple online classes or worse to transfer after my freshman year. I'm really worried either of these might affect if I get into med school or graduate school. Do I transfer elsewhere or stay?",

      "text": "Transfer. You can study anything to get into medschool, you mainly just need to do really well on the MCAT if it\u2019s a degree outside of STEM. That being said med school is highly competitive and if you don\u2019t get accepted the 1st or 2nd round are you going to be satisfied working in a career with a major you didn\u2019t even want?",
