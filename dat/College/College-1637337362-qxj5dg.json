  "title:": "Is it okay to ask your professor(s) come to your winter graduation ceremony",
  "text": "I\u2019m graduating in December. Our school won\u2019t let us invite people from outside because of the pandemic so I\u2019m thinking about invite professor(s) to the ceremony. \n\nProfessor 1: My \u201chost mom\u201d (I\u2019m an international student and the host moms/dads are people within or close to the college community that would like to offer help from time to time) also department head of East Asian Studies. Spent 2 Christmas with her. Going to spend this Thanksgiving with her too. Very close relationship. \n\nProfessor 2: My art history professor. Took 5 classes of hers. Spent 2 Thanksgivings with her and her families. She offered to store all my stuff in her garage when school closed because of the pandemic and I had to clean out my dorm in a hurry last year. Knows professor 1 well (practically neighbors). \n\nProfessor 3: My sculpture professor. Worked with him the longest. Had a lot of long talks about art and lives in general. Received a lot of mental support when I had to finish my senior project in my bedroom last spring. But the relationship with him is limited to the study and studio work. Pretty close to professor 2 well but doubt he and professor 1 even know each other. \n\nI think I can safely invite professor 1 and 2 but I\u2019m really not sure about professor 3. I know I\u2019m probably overthinking this but it really got me anxious. Would appreciate any advice. Thanks!",

We\u2019re friends on Facebook and follow each other on Instagram. One of them I still see on a fairly regular basis. And I don\u2019t think there will be much of a downside to asking them to come! The worst that could happen is they find out you care about them.",
