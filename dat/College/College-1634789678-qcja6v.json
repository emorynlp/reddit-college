  "text": "I'm currently a freshman in a liberal arts university planning on double majoring in biology and environmental science, to get a BA degree. When ever I mention that I am getting a BA in a STEM field I usually get side eyes or snarky questions. I started noticing how many people look down on BAs and think those who are going for a BA are lazy or unproductive. This makes me feel insecure and unsure about what I want to do and what I am currently doing. Whats the reasoning behind why people think this?\n\nThe degree plan that I'm currently using follows the BA path, there's an option for me to chose it, because I still have a lot of time, but I'm not sure if I really should. Is there a big difference between a BA and BS when still receiving a STEM major? Would it be better for me in the future to change to a BS sooner rather than later?",

That being said, if you can switch without losing progress and would like to take more math/science courses, then go ahead and do it.",
