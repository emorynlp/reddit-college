  "title:": "I was 0.2% away from going up half a letter grade.",
  "text": "I\u2019m feeling frustrated and sad. I wrote my last exam for one course on Tuesday and I did very well. In the course, we had five exams worth 20% each. I calculated my final grade to be 89.3%, which is 0.2% away from the minimum to get an A+.\n\nI wish I tried harder. The frustrating thing is, if I had gotten one more question right on any of my five exams, I would have made the cut for an A+. *One measly question!*\n\nAhhh, I\u2019m so mad. I\u2019m not necessarily upset about the A, rather the fact that I was one question off/0.2% away from increasing my GPA.\n\nCan anyone else relate? Also, I\u2019m sorry if the formatting is all off. I\u2019m on mobile.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve received a lot of comments about messaging the prof. To clarify, I\u2019ve already emailed the course coordinator asking (politely, of course) if there\u2019s anything that I can do for extra credit. Unfortunately, nothing will bump up my grade. It\u2019s okay though, I will try harder next time! Lesson learned :)",

I was literally so close to having an A in both classes. For my microbio lecture class, I was literally one correct quiz question away from having an A. For my microbio lab class, our lowest quiz score gets dropped but like on the day of our very last quiz, I slept through my alarm clock and I wasn't able to attend class to take a quiz. So it's just so annoying to think about how I was literally this \ud83e\udd0fclose to finishing my first semester of college with straight A's and a 4.0.\n\nAlso, my mental health was so bad last semester and it made it hard to do stuff and it got to the point where my grade in microbio lecture was a solid C+ for 2 months straight. But eventually I picked myself back up and worked REALLY REALLY hard to raise my grade so it's just really upsetting and frustrating for that to happen and yeah",

You're not paying for a degree/education, you're paying for the opportunity to earn a degree/education. Furthermore, professors can't read minds. If a student is struggling with the issues you listed, instead of expecting things to be handed to them when issues arises, they should communicate with their professor. Then maybe they will be more lenient, as they know the student has external issues. When students don't use office hours, do you want professors to assume it's because of personal issues and not a choice to come visit? Because more often that not, it's the latter, but professor only know if students communicate.\n\nPart of a student's job is not just showing up to class and handing in the work, but also seeking help when it's needed.",

                              "text": "I certainly think the cost of most programs should give students the right to be a little entitled about the experience that is advertised to them by universities.  Whether or not I earn the degree, I'm paying a hell of a lot of money for the experience I have while I'm here, and academics are the main part of that experience.  We've created a culture that expects students to keep up with their work, maintain a social life, and be an active member of the campus community (aka good marketing for the university) without having the right to complain.  We're supposed to be mature and handle our responsibilities like adults while often being treated like ignorant children by professors.  \n\nWhy am I entitled for expecting my professor not to bitch about having to answer emails?  I'm juggling 5+ courses, each with lectures, readings, assignments, papers, exams, to \"earn\" my education.  That's the bare minimum of what is expected of me.  If that's a normal amount of work to ask of 18-21 year olds, why is answering emails outside of what should be expected of employees of the university I'm paying to attend?  Why are we so quick to make excuses for professors but hold students to such a high standard?  People need to stop going into higher ed/academia when they have no interest in giving students a positive experience.  \n\nI'll speak from personal experience.  Towards the end of a semester, I had a course where I was very close to the next letter grade (similar to OP).  I emailed the professor explaining the situation, and he told me that if I came to office hours to revise my final paper, he would help me out.  I went out of my way during finals week to meet with him and he didn't bump me up the 0.3 of a point.  I went to almost all the lectures, submitted work on time, didn't make excuses or ask for other extensions/extra credit.  So why didn't I deserve 0.3 of a point?  Because I didn't put in the effort?  If that's how you think students should be treated then idk what to tell you.\n\nAnd all of this over someone asking for a tenth of a point of a grade raise. This isn't some public high school where I'm receiving a \"free\" education.  Whether or not I deserve to receive a diploma at the end of my four years, I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get professors to treat me like a human being.",

At our college (and many other US colleges I've seen), an A \"Represents achievement that significantly exceeds expectations\" while a B represents \"achievement that is above the minimum expectations in the course.\" Not everyone is going to get an A, and that's okay.\n\nI'll be honest, asking for a grade to be rounded up \"just because\" (especially for students who haven't come to office hours for help, attended exam review sessions, accessed the practice exams I provide, or done the extra credit assignments I already provide) comes off as really entitled.  I'd write a letter of recc for a B+ student who worked hard, but I'd really rather not for one who \"grade grubbed.\"\n\nFeel free to be upset, but this is how it is and will irritate *many* faculty who you may want to think highly of you in the future (if you have another class with them, want a letter of recc, etc).",

And I'd ask those professors to evaluate whether their grading is truly fair and objective.  Grading is ultimately a zero-sum game; if a student who doesn't deserve it gets an A-, they're going to have a leg up over the student who accepts their B+ when it comes time for internship, grad school and job apps.

The professor would have to create a whole new assignment *and* its marking scheme and then would have to offer it to absolutely everyone in the class and then mark all of them and update everyone's final grade. That's a lot of effort. It's more effort than you put in doing the assignment. \n\nSo overall you're asking the professor and a bunch of TAs to make a sacrifice of their personal time for you with no incentive on their end. Plus, the extra marks from that assignment are going to put more people right on the border of an A or whatever, so it just shuffles the problem to someone else who's is definitely going to email the professor and ask if there's anything they can do to raise their grade.\n\nUnfortunately, the GPA system requires cutoffs and there will always be people who sit right near a cutoff.

I didn't say they shouldn't ask, I said it's bad, i.e. it's never going to get you brownie points.\n\nI just think people have to think carefully about what they're actually asking for. Asking for extra credit means asking for a lot of work on the professor's end and if you don't acknowledge that in the request, the professor won't be too impressed. I think that works for all professional situations \u2014 if you're asking for a massive favour then you have to acknowledge it, otherwise it's entitlement.\n\nStudents don't normally have experience of things from the professor's end, so it can be useful to sit down and think through the effort you're requesting, especially if you multiplied it by every student in your class and consider every student in their other classes (who are probably asking the same thing). If you take that mindset then your email probably won't come across as being *as* entitled. It'll still be a little bad no matter what, though.\n\nIf you're in a position where this person's impression of you is super important, and more important than the higher grade, you might not want to send that email. Students often think that asking for extra credit work makes them look *better* because they're asking for more work to do (so they must be hardworking, dedicated, etc etc etc). It doesn't work that way, and if they don't understand that then things could really backfire.",

The number of college students who threaten me and my colleagues to \"take action\" against us and try to get us fired because said student didn't get the grade they wanted is larger than you imagine. I've had students continually ask, thinking my \"no\" will change. I've had students try to use their parents as leverage. I've had colleagues who've had student forge signatures for grade checks. \n\nYou may need the grades for the future, but you should expect us to give them to you either. I'm sorry if someone missed one question one time, but to have below a 90% in most courses means they've missed more than one question on at lease every assignment. Which indeed does not mean exceptional work. Most places require a B to keep scholarships; Bs will get you into most grad programs; Bs will get you a good job; A/B averages will get you into some medical programs. You can have a stable future with B+s. Don't ask your professors for grade bumps because you think you earned it. \n\nTLDR: yes college kids can act as bullies toward professors, don't ask for a grade bump.",
