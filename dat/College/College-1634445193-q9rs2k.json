  "title:": "Why am I still emotional about leaving for college?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in my fourth year of college and I still get emotional every time I need to leave home for college. My home isn\u2019t even a good environment, my parents are toxic and abusive, but somehow I still hate leaving this home. I miss my dog and my grandparents who are back home most of the time. \n\nBut then, when I\u2019m at college, I don\u2019t find myself wanting to go home either. I\u2019m guessing I just don\u2019t like changing environments and would rather stay in one place. \n\nMy other guess is that I miss my home city (large city) whereas my college city is tiny. \n\nAnyone else feel the same? How did you get over it?",

      "text": "Grass is greener on the other side. You want X, then when you get X, you want Y - vice versa. \n\nI'm the same. Home area/town/city isn't great, but I still want to go back when I'm at University. When i'm at home, I sometimes want to go back to University. For me, it's basically hating changing environments and being away from a part of my life (i.e. at home, I'm missing my college life, at college, I'm missing my home/personal life). Also, nostalgia is a big factor as to why I like my home town/city/area. \n\nHow'd I get over it? I didn't. I'm about to finish my 4th year at University real soon (in the coming months), and it's time for me to leave my University town for good (unless I get a job here  - but I doubt it since there's fucking nothing here). \n\nLowkey, don't get too hung up over college. In the grand scheme of things, it's the smallest/shortest stage of your life - 4 years, compared to 12-13 years of school or 30+ years during the career stage.",
