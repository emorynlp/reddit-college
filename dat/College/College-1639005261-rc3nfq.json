  "text": "Hopefully this isn't too long. I've got a lot of thoughts right now and don't know where else to dump them.\n\nI'm feeling a mix of emotions right now. Finally, after 4 1/2 years I'll be graduating on Saturday. For that, I'm ecstatic. I'm almost done. In 6 days I'll be moving back to my hometown and entering the \"real world.\" It sounds scary, but I have an amazing support system.\n\nI feel extremely disappointed in myself. I went into college with a 3.25 GPA. I had big goals, but I ended up changing my major during my sophomore year. Because of that, I stopped caring about my classes since they were important for my old major and I ended up failing two classes that semester. COVID only worsened my GPA, and I've struggled to improve it since we went back to in-person classes. I'm graduating at a 2.2 GPA, and I can no longer achieve my dreams because I don't have the 2.75 GPA needed to even be considered for the graduate program I was looking at. I've beat myself up over this for the entire semester. I've cried, I've yelled, I've tried to look at the bright side, but nothing has eased my intense feelings of failure. I came up with a plan, but it doesn't even compare to what I wanted to do with my life. I can't convince myself that the piece of paper I've gone $60,000 into debt for is useful. I've spent hours looking at careers I could go into but everything in my field requires a masters or higher.\n\nEveryone around me has been telling me that they're so proud of me. My parents are constantly mentioning the fact that I'm the only kid out of six to even go to college, and that I'll be able to brag about it for the rest of my life, but I don't want to. Even if I'm graduating, I still screwed up. I know that I should just be happy, but it's tough.\n\nRegardless of how I'm feeling right now, I hope everyone does well on their finals and has a nice, relaxing winter break. Or if you're also graduating: congratulations! This internet stranger is proud of all of you no matter what.",

But I don\u2019t think all hope is gone. \n\nDo you mind telling me what you wanted to pursue in graduate school?",

              "text": "Okay so for counseling- there are jobs, though they are scarce depending on your location that will allow you to do counseling work w a bachelors. The most common ones like this will be for substance abuse treatment centers/ residential rehabs. Another thing you can do is case management or care coordination and that can be for all types of social work organizations, or even psychiatric hospitals. Another thing you can look into is intake assessment. \n\nGraduate schools also look at GRE scores and experience and your letter of purpose. If you work the field for a bit and grow your resume and still want to go for graduate school- it may trump the gpa portion. Though I would call the grad school and see what they can recommend based on your circumstances. In the meantime- idk what state you\u2019re in- but look up MCAP certification or something like it. You can get that w a bachelors and that\u2019s what substance abuse places are looking for.",

In the end, I just want to help people, and the things you've listed sound perfect. There's much more to social work/psychology than most people think.\n\nI'm definitely going to get out there and build my resume, even if it means taking on an internship for the time being. Maybe I'll forget about grad school and find something I love without it.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to tell me about this stuff. I'm already thinking of the possibilities and I feel a lot better knowing what you've told me. Thank you again :))",

It\u2019s hard to know exactly what you want to do your whole life and covid was a mess on mental health. \n\nOne last thing, I recommend taking the GRE ASAP while any math is still kinda fresh in your head. I took it 5 years after I graduated and it was hell on earth reteaching myself algebra and geometry stuff, I did awful on it lol \n\nGood luck to you!! You are amazing and congratulations \ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf8a you got this and are going to help a lot of people :)",
