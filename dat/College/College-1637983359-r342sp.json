  "text": "I have gotten a parking ticket for parking at a Faculty/Staff parking lot at my university and I am a commuter and have a red sticker. I saw other cars with the same red sticker parked in the Faculty/Staff parking lot and they didn't receive tickets (Faculty/Staff have blue stickers). I want a good persuading appeal letter that I can send to the campus police so I don't have to pay $25 for the ticket and this is my Second parking ticket since freshman year (I'm a senior). I would appreciate it very!",
