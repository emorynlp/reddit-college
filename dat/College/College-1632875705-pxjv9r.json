  "text": "So I\u2019m this one girl\u2019s ride to campus and home and lately she\u2019s been asking if we can go to those football games on the weekend. I always tell her no since Anatomy and Physiology want to keep me busy on weekends. She\u2019s telling me I\u2019m missing out on the college experience. Are these events actually worth going to?",

      "text": "Honestly, I think the ideal \u201ccollege experience\u201d is something that varies with each person. As long as you\u2019re happy and passing your classes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any right or wrong way to experience college\n\nI don\u2019t go to football games, because:\n\n* Watching any sport is boring to me since I\u2019m not actually doing anything\n\n* I\u2019m pretty busy and can\u2019t spend 3 hours watching football each weekend\n\n* I hate that so much of my tuition already goes towards athletic programs instead of my own education, and I don\u2019t want to give more money to that\n\nI might go to one game so I can say I went, but I don\u2019t plan on attending them regularly. So I don\u2019t, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out\n\nIf you don\u2019t like watching football or can\u2019t spare the time, it\u2019s not worth going to",
