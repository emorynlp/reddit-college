  "text": "For some context, I went to a high school where math wasn\u2019t taught well at all. I\u2019m a college freshman with the math knowledge of a high school sophomore at best.\n\nI had to take Geometry twice in High School and didn\u2019t have a strong math showing on my SAT. My school did not want me to take the TSI for math, so when I entered college, they asked me to take a preliminary math course.\n\nIt has been three months, I\u2019ve been topsy turvy, and I failed my final exam, which cost me the entire course. \n\nI\u2019m quite sad by it, I worked hard writing notes after notes and some things still didn\u2019t stick. I think I need more time. While I learned a lot, I still failed and that hurts.\n\nI don\u2019t know what exactly I should be doing, I did all I could and that makes me feel relieved but I\u2019m also sad that it didn\u2019t pan out the way I wanted it to.",

      "text": "Look into getting tested for learning differences. My brother was tested once he got admitted to the cc and he had to go to a big 4 year school campus in our capital city. It was $500, but it found all the ways he learns differently. They have given him accomodations like untimed exams, professor notes, copies of slides, and others. The first time he was evaluated at the U of Podunkville, they just said he was ADHD. Turns out his really gifted with learning disabilities! He only passed 1/3 of his hours at his 2st school, but once he was evaluated well and got what he needed, he pushed through with school & 2 internships and is graduating 1 semester late. \n\nI am sure that if you get evaluated, they will be able to help you more. Plus, you have a great attitude. Aleks doesn't work for everyone - a lot of people hire tutors who give them more problems to work through. College Algebra isn't good until you have passed algebra 2, and you sound like you need to go back to the beginning and make sure you know everything in prealgebra. Aleks.com can be purchased by the month as a homeschooler, so you might want to enroll an alternate name over break and start with prealgebra. If you sail through that, you can start algebra 1. You pay for time, not class, so it's money well spent, and you know it won't give you stuff you know already. Remember, pretty please my dear aunt Sally! \n\nThat's ok. I had a crappy high school too and I didn't know anything about history. You can do this!",

      "text": "Hey, it's okay. When I first started college I had to take a remedial math class to catch me up in the math I didn't understand in high school. I felt that I learned more from that one remedial college class than I did in four years of high school math. From what you typed it seems this class was remedial. You may need to go back further in your math foundations. Since you failed geometry twice, you may need to go back and do math starting with geometry.\n\nWhen I took the remedial math class our professor had us do something called xyz homework. Though the service was required for my class, it might be good for you to try them. They have videos on the homework service itself explaining concepts and how to do problems and it really helped me out. I went into college having probably the same level of math skills as you, and now I'm at the level where I'm about to start calculus only two years later.",

Math just takes a lot of practice, you want to make sure you start from where you're having trouble in math, learn the material, practice it, and move on to the next thing. Do as many problems as you can in a section to practice and learn the material.\n\nI forgot to mention that sometimes xyz has these crash courses on certain highschool math levels. If I remember correctly, it's a free course that gets added to canvas and you can go at it at your own pace. You might find that from them helpful as well.",
