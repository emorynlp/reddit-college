  "title:": "Friend dropped out of college before deadline, is still getting billed 1200$ and the school claims they don\u2019t have his drop out form on record",
  "text": "I was wondering if anyone knows what to do about this. He knows he for sure dropped before the deadline. The school claims they don\u2019t have any record of him dropping. They are still trying to charge him for those 2 classes from over 2 years ago (summer 2019). I don\u2019t know whether the form got lost in the mail or if the school lost it, but to me it seems messed up for them to still charge him.",
