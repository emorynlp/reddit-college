  "text": "Junior in college here! I have an okay paying job in the ER, but moving to off campus apartments with pretty lousy roommates is a huge regret of mine. I was just wondering what you guys do to make it through without a meal plan while also trying to make sure you keep up with bills and classes/grades? Any side hustles or programs to know about? I'm also hoping we get another HEERF check, since we haven't heard about it yet this semester.",
