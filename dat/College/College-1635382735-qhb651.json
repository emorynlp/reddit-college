  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in college. All this time I\u2019ve been a non-medical psych major because I\u2019m genuinely interested in it. However, I don\u2019t really know what I would do with it career-wise as I don\u2019t really see myself as a therapist.\n\nI go to a stem college, and I get a lot of pressure from my family to switch to a stem major even this far along. They say I should be a dermatologist or something along those lines, and I honestly would be okay with that as I'm into that too. Honestly, I\u2019m starting to consider it as it seems like it would be a laid-out career path due to my school\u2019s reputation and connections etc.\n\nBut it would be a LOT of stem work at this point, and I\u2019m not that good at it. My family is just like \u201cyou\u2019re smart, it will be easy for you! :)\u201d And I don\u2019t even know if I could finish all the stem classes by the end of my 4 years. I don\u2019t know if I should try to go the stem route or stick to psychology.",
