  "text": "Idk if it's just me\nBut for some weird reason I feel like I'm always the one a teacher or a professor picks on.\nLike even in general if a group of people are sitting with me I'm the first one people notice.like when I was a freshman usually my seniors would choose me first to rag (not the serious type of ragging they just make you do embarrassing stuff) and i have this new faculty teaching us how to use a dress form to create clothing (I'm a fashion student) I'm shit scared that she will be rude to me and make my next three years in college hell. And I'm just terrified to say the least cause she did yell at me today which made me want to cry. And since I'm such an easy target I just want to know why is it like that.\n\nSo sorry for the lack of detail. It'd just as unclear in my head tbh. \n\nI'll give an example , today in my fashion design class, we were being taught something and by the end of the class everybody's work was being evaluated but one girl got shouted and yelled at for her work twice or even thrice. The thing that confuses me is her work looked just like ours. Then why was she being scolded extra hard and I realized in most situations I tend to be that same person which sucks cause it feels embarrassing and hurts cause it makes one questions did I really fuck up that badly? It's things like this that happen to me quite frequently in college.",
