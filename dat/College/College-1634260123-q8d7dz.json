  "text": "Sorry for the length, and I hope I'm not in violation of Rule 6 here, I just figured providing context would help in determining whether or not my backup plan is going to kill me financially or time-wise. I am currently a second-year cadet at a state maritime academy in the deck officer program. For those that don't know, basically I go to school to learn how to drive and navigate ships and manage cargo, all the stuff a ship's mate would do. Admittedly, I dicked around a lot in my first year, much more than I should have, and I came out with an abysmal 2.14 GPA for last year. Now, this year, I'm almost halfway through, and I've definitely turned my shit all around. However, the more time I spend here, the more I worry about what if it turns out I don't enjoy this sort of life. As a mariner working on the Great Lakes (which I plan to do), I would most likely be gone 2 months at a time, with one month off in between periods of being out at sea, and then a few months' stretch between mid-January and mid-March. While this only totals to around 6-7 months of work throughout the year, and the prospective pay is pretty good for where I'm headed, part of me is terrified of what if it turns out I don't enjoy the time away. I fully intend on getting married and having a family, and I know being gone for such stretches of time can put strain on my loved ones. Now, I'll be going out on my academy's training ship come summer, and after which I can ensure I'm making the right choice here. However, I like to have a back-up plan in case this doesn't work out for me. Now, my program, while perusing my appropriate licenses, also would give me a bachelor's of science in maritime technology. However, in the back of my mind, I've always had this passion since I was a kid for aircraft, and for the longest time I always wanted to either major in aerospace engineering and/or become a pilot. I thought of going military, but I realized that isn't necessarily a lifestyle for me. \n\nSo, would I still be able to graduate in 4 years if, say after this semester or before next fall, I dropped from the program, took gen ed courses at a community college and did online school part time while pursuing a helicopter pilot's license? The classes I have under my belt already include basic physics as well as trigonometry, and many of my maritime courses do have a heavy emphasis on mathematics. I know a degree can be beneficial even if a pilot isn't required one, and an engineering degree can be a solid fallback to the fallback should becoming a helicopter pilot not work out for whatever reason. I can't imagine taking many science and math based gen ed courses online through community college until I transfer to get an online degree would be a terrible thing, would it? \n\nTl,dr: I go to school to be a commercial seaman, should I feel this isn't right for me, would it be financially and time-wise feasible for me to switch from my current 4-year program to finishing gen eds through community college online and pursue an online degree while pursuing a helicopter pilot's license since I also have a love for aviation?",
