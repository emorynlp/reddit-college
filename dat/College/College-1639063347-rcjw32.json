  "text": "Good morning! \n\nI'm currently about halfway through my grad program for my MBA, but I'm having a bit of a change of heart and very seriously considering pursuing psychology and wanting to study human sexuality. This passion has spilled over into my art, and I've been creating erotic art for a little while now, but I really want to delve deeper into it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess my main questions are: \n\nDoes this mean that I will need to redo my entire undergrad program? Does my BSBA help at all in this? Price is a little bit of a mitigating factor, but I've had good luck with scholarships and securing okay-paying jobs between my current degree/ experience. \n\nAny recommendations for online programs to do so? I'm trying to line this up before my MBA program is finished in the Summer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all so much in advance!",

      "text": "Hello! So for masters degree, I know they prefer a human services type undergrad but if you find a school with a program you are interested in, I would highly recommend calling and asking. I know it\u2019s not a requirement, just preferred. They also look at experience and if you have relevant job history in addition. But also a lot are understanding that you may not have any and are just starting out. \n\nI highly discourage going for an online counseling degree program. They lack the accreditation and is a problem when it comes time to get licensed after your two- three years (depending on the state you\u2019re in) of being a registered intern post masters.\n\nETA: also look at the phd programs that focus on sexuality around you. That is where you will start to specialize in that field. Though, you may be able to find internships sites in your masters that specialize in that field to get the process started and more experience under your belt to get into that PhD program.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for all of this information! \n\nI am in the medical field, but in administration and orthopedic/ physical therapy rather than psychology. So unfortunately, probably not the experience or job history that they are looking for.\n\nAlso, thank you so much for the tips about the online programs! That is what I was looking at, I didn't realize that they often were not accredited. \n\nThis was incredibly informative and helpful, thanks!!!",
