  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman (F18), and I would say college can for sure be more eventful for me, but it\u2019s better than being at home. And even talking to anyone at home too. I just can\u2019t seem to pick up the phone to call them at all. I like them not being all in my life at college. It\u2019s like it\u2019s MY own experience and not them seeing what I\u2019m doing. \n\nI feel weird feeling this way because I still outside of college live at home and she\u2019s even helping me pay for it. Also  my mom and brother are not abusive or something. I just not only love space away from them, but I actively love being on my own. \n\nAnyone else feeling this way?",
