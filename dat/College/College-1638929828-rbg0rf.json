  "title:": "How possible is it to transfer into a UC as a nursing major, after being on academic probation?",
  "text": "My situation is that,  I'm at CC and my freshman year I was put into level 2 academic probation. I had no idea what i wanted to do with life but now that i've kinda sorted myself out i'm determined and i want to be a clinical nurse specialist. \n\n I'm not gonna make any excuses, it was totally my fault. i just had really bad mental health that was undealt with but i'm learning to deal with it better and i've been taking things seriously now. \n\nAnyways I'm a semester into my sophmore  year and passed 2 summer courses With A's and im passing this semester with A's and B's (12 units. im just retaking the classes i failed my freshman year). I'm passing everything except stats, theres a high chance I could fail it and i'm worried it'll set me back even farther. \n\nand i'm told that Retaking classes you failed does very little to raise your GPA so i'm worried i might not be able to raise it high enough to transfer into SDSU. \n\nI'm hoping that i'll be able to transfer in spring semester of 2023. I'm willling to put in the work and turn it around but i'm getting anxious because my goal is to transfer and get my bachelors in nursing there at SDSU and the acceptance rate is about 19%. I'm really set on that school and i'm afraid i won't be able to get admitted because of the amount of classes i've failed. Just this constant feeling of impending doom. \n\nI'm aware of how competitive this field is but i'm willing to put in the work so i just wanted to know if there's any nurses out there who's been in my same situation and made it succescullly into a UC?? Or if its even possible to raise my GPA higher than 3.5 for my situation? Or if this is unrealistic and i have absolutley no shot of making it in and should just look into other schools. I have back up schools that i'll apply to but i'm really aiming for UC.",

          "text": "I was told that even if i did retake and pass the failed classes, the \"fs\" will still show up on my transcript and it would still be averaged in along with other classes. So even if it did raise my Gpa it wouldn't be much. \n\nI forgot to mention that i also googled it and the search results say the same thing.",

              "text": "Look in your colleges catalog and see what that says.  Schools usually drop the F in the GPA calculations if you retake the class and get a higher grade.  The F will still show on your transcript and the class will be marked as a retaken class and only the higher grade will count for GPA calculations.  I brought up my GPA a lot by retaking classes I'd failed in the past.",

                  "text": "Ok i'll look into that thank you. Do you know how the Fs will affect admission? and if you don't mind me asking, what was your gpa when you were failing? and what did you raise it up to? \n\nI'm just curious to know if its doable because i don't have anyone to ask. plus my counselor is hella intimidating.",

                      "text": "When I returned summer 2020 I had a 1.55 cumulative GPA, after this semester I'll have a little above a 2.0 if I'm calculating properly.  I received a B in the first course I repeated (my GPA went from a 1.76 to 1.85 that semester).  I have received all A's and B's and one F (combination of a class I hated, a bad prof, and my grandma who raised me passing away so I just gave up, retaking it next semester); I took 1 class in summer 2020, 2 classes each in Fall 2020, Spring and Summer 2021, and 3 classes this semester. I currently have just under 30 credits to get my first degree and 39 to get get my second (I added a second major because I realised it would only be one additional semester), I have lots of extra credits from when I was younger and bounced a little between 2 programs.",

You will be competing with individuals who were not ever on academic probation and have A's across the board with competitively high GPA's. \n\nI would say pursue your dream, but also be practical and have back up plans. Going straight into a nursing program isn't the only way to become a nurse. I would meet with a career advisor to help you have some backup plans in case transfer doesn't work out... especially since UC programs are drastically more competitive.",
