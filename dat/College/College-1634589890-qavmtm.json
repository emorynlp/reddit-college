  "title:": "ran out of dining cash, scared/ashamed to ask parents for more",
  "text": "Going into the school year i already knew i would have a reduced amount for dining cash bc my dorm came with a kitchen and i was super hyped bc i knew it would help me save money and stick to a schedule. However, i\u2019m in a less than ideal rooming situation. without going into too much detail for the sake of brevity,  my roommate does not make it possible to buy groceries, cook, etc.\n\nTherefore, i\u2019ve been having to eat out for all my meals or buy quick frozen meals and where my uni is located it adds up pretty quickly. And so, i\u2019m prob gonna have to ask my parents for some more dining cash to finish out the semester. but even though  they understand the issues with my rooming situation and have been very supportive through it, i still feel incredibly guilty and ashamed about this. am i stupid for feeling this way?",
