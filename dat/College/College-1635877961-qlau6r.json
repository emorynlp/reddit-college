  "text": "Hello,\n\nI cracked a dumb joke freshman year that resulted me being talked to by the Title 9 office. Nothing ever really came of it I don't think. \n\nI left that school a few months later for totally other reasons, had nothing to do with that.\n\nNow I'm looking to go back to school and transfer somewhere. The university where this incident took place simply won't tell me if I have Title 9 records, no idea why. I do however know that I have NO disciplinary records.\n\nWould Title 9 violations show up on my disciplinary records? Or is it separate? Do colleges pull Title 9 records when you transfer?\n\nAny advice would be so appreciated!",

      "text": "Honestly, depending on if you are being truthful that it was just a verbal joke, if they didn't pursue it I wouldn't worry. \n\nThe reason you were contacted was most likely to prevent you from continually making similar jokes that someone could complain constituted harassment and result in a formal title IX investigation.\n\nFrom what I have heard, there would be no doubt if there was a formal investigation. This all depends on what you consider a joke. After all, it seems that some people's \"jokes\" are really actually sexual harassment.",

It depends on what the title IX people and the rest of the people around you consider a joke.  \n\nThere is little chance this was not more serious than OP is making out.  Someone had to report it to title IX, which is a hassle.  They had to think it was serious enough to investigate.  When they did that they had to think it was serious enough to talk to OP.",

No I don't believe so. It was just a dumb comment I made at 17 years old. Definitely not a reflection of who I am today at 22 lol\n\nAnd to think it can stick with me and effect my academic career is absurd considering violent felons get full rides to college as a second chance opportunity.. If I physically touched her that would be a different story.. But I definitely didn't",
