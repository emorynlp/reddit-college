I had a blast going to several out of state football games, the vibe is way more fun when traveling with 3-10 other people on a budget.\n\n expanding upon /u/ApocSurvivor713 comment, travel abroad to a place you would be uncomfortable going alone later in life. I am so glad i went to china for 6 weeks with a large group, no way would i have felt comfortable doing that trip alone or with a small group.",

Internships are a fantastic way to get real experience, and sort of get a 'trial-run' with companies you're interested in, and get a feel for new cities you might want to move to.

Definitely spend more time with the homies before you guys separate after graduation and start doing your own thing\n- My campus has amazing scenery and attractions that I\u2019ve never explored nor tried out. I plan on seeing what the school really has to offer (finally after 3 years lol). So explore your school, give yourself some time to take it all in. You\u2019ll probably never step foot there after graduation so look at it now. Take pictures and get those angles\n- Unwind & destress. Work life can be stressful. I\u2019ve interned this summer and that was stressful sometimes with all the (stupid) work and drama going on. So I imagine full time is no joke. College is hard but don\u2019t let it get to you. Its your last year, relax. Don\u2019t relax too hard where your grades start slipping but take it easy. \n\nWe\u2019re almost at the finish line though, so congrats to us!",

You\u2019d be surprised how many places have student discounts but not necessarily advertise it. No harm in asking, but make sure you have a valid student ID on you whenever you plan on asking. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, check out the career center. It\u2019s a great way to receive advice and guidance on your post-grad plans. Most also offer other services such as mock interviews and resume reviews, which are invaluable. \n\nMake it an effort to attend whatever campus events interest you. Movie showings, poetry readings, discussions, comedians, plays, concerts, off-campus trips, etc. This is the only time of your life you\u2019ll have access to more or less free entertainment.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not big on fitness, visiting the gym/fitness center a handful of times is a good idea. You\u2019re paying for it in your tuition, so you might as well utilize the services. And gym memberships cost at least $200 a year in the outside world.",
