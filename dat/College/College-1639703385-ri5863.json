  "text": "Yeah, yeah I know it's my fault but my life has been insane right now. I am diagnosed with Bipolar and it affects my schooling a lot. In 36 hours I have a written final due. It's about 4 pages and I am easily able to knock that out in a few hours. The issue is that I need a topic approved by my professor and she has not responded. I have emailed her twice: once yesterday afternoon and a few minutes ago. If she doesn't respond by tomorrow morning I will just have to wing it, but my grade in the class is a low B and I desperately need it to be at least a B so my GPA goes up and not down. If anyone else has gone through this please let me know how it went I need some motivation and some advice too maybe.",
