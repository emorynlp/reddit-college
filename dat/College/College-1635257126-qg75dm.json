  "text": "So I'm currently studying for the math ACCUPLACER test, my college says I need to get a 258, my personal goal is 275-280 for some margin of error. As I understand it each section is graded 20-120 my current practice tests are\n\n* Arithmetic: 90% (I'm assuming that's 108 points)\n* Quantitative Reasoning, Algebra, and Statistics 75% (assuming that's 90 points)\n* Advanced Algebra and Functions 45% (I'm assuming that's 54 points)\n\nI'm assuming this means I would score 252 so I gotta a little bit of work to do until I get to 275-280.\n\nI'm also assuming since each section is worth 120 points the max score is 360?\n\nAny insight? \n\nI finally got comfortable today with linear applications and graphs (god that sucked, thank you for Khan Academy) working on improving my descriptive statistics score now.",

      "text": "I don't know anything about ACCUPLACER but I do know that a good number of tests place different weights on different questions, so your assumptions about scoring might not hold. In absence of any other information, though, I think your estimates are reasonable.\n\nJust keep on studying and you'll get there. In my experience, khan academy is a great resource, so don't be afraid to use it as much as you need to.",
