  "title:": "How do I get through the last year of school, especially when I detest my course? Should I just drop out?",
  "text": "\nI am a Year 3 student. I HATE my course. Been wanting to seriously drop out since the start of Y2. Every time I start doing work I get this boiling anger in me. Why? I feel like I\u2019m wasting my time. I take an ARTS ASSOCIATE for fucks sake. Word of advice: don\u2019t bother taking an art associates, maybe a bachelors but no associates please no, especially fucking art man. \n\n\nI chose it because I was young and had no idea what to do except know I liked art. Also over here I\u2019m forced to take an associates first then bachelors if I want (AT LEAST an additional 7 years after high school even for the most basic courses). Education is painfully fucked here and no I\u2019m not interested in bachelors because I\u2019m fucking over school. They don\u2019t even care about getting us educated from the fact that they barely cover the basics and it\u2019s just me and YouTube buddying up until graduation lol. They just want $$$ \n\n\nI hate it because it\u2019s useless as fuck to me. 1. Nobody respects art. 2. Nobody sees associates as anything (at least in Asian countries where bachelors are starting to look like ass wipes and everybody wants at least a masters). My main goal is to move out of the country and I\u2019m looking at r/Iwantout and all these people are in STEM or something. Who the fuck is gonna hire me?? I literally just wanna move out ASAP. I feel like I\u2019m wasting my time doing this course because I\u2019m not interested in it anymore + I don\u2019t see how it can help me. And it genuinely makes me angry.\n\n\nBut. I\u2019m in my last year. The total school fees are about $18k (not American) which is still a lot of money. If I drop out, I waste that and years of my youth. And, an associates is better than nothing. I KNOW I should just finish it, but in my heart I know I probably won\u2019t use the cert and I genuinely get so angry and upset whenever I even think about school. \n\n\nSo as much as I\u2019m YEARNING to drop out, how do I make the final year more bearable? I am already lowkey in school and don\u2019t talk to anyone because I swear if anyone wants to annoy me I\u2019m gonna flare up. Hell, I don\u2019t even go to school most of the time. \ud83d\ude43 I might be off to an internship which sounds like trouble because I heard interns get treated like dog shit and I probably won\u2019t handle that well considering I\u2019m already really unhappy with \u2026 this\n\n\nI know I should probably fix my mentality though. But I just can\u2019t help it\u2026 I feel like everyday I\u2019m wasting all my time on doing something I don\u2019t like. I\u2019ve been doing that my whole life and that\u2019s why I\u2019m really upset. I just wanna do something for me. But nah, I always gotta do this and that first. Hm, before I know it I\u2019ll be working 5-6 days a week for the next 4 decades and then crumble away. I HAVE NO EXPERIENCES, still don\u2019t. I just wanna live life while I\u2019m young in my 20s. Spent my teens in school like everyone else. And by the time I\u2019m 25 everybody my age are starting to settle down and shit \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42 I just want to fuck around and dabble into random activities learn new things not be so tied down to one fucking thing but nah the world don\u2019t work like that.",
