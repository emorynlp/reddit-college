  "text": "So I\u2019m majoring in computer science but I chose a history class as one of my classes. I chose history because I like it but I realized there\u2019s no point in me taking it. I can\u2019t switch into any other classes. Should I drop it? I\u2019ll appreciate a fast answer since the last day I can drop this class without a W is 11/03/21.",

      "text": "I think it would depend on whether it counts to your total credits or not. From my experience, I\u2019m assuming you need 120 credits to graduate. Every credit hour you take counts for those 120. If it doesn\u2019t fill a distribution, and the rest of your distributions don\u2019t reach your total credits in order to graduate, then I\u2019d say maybe keep it. If it\u2019s not a horrible class then it\u2019s beneficial for graduation and completing your total credit hours needed to graduate. Hope this helps!",

      "text": "Consider some of these questions: \n\n- If you have some scholarship requiring a certain number of credit hours, would that affect it? \n\n- Does the history class fulfill any university requirements for graduation? \n\n- Do you need a GPA boost? And if so, would this class give you that - meaning, could you guarantee a good grade in this class? \n\n- Would taking this class potentially cause you to spill into your excess credit hours in the future, based on your current mapping status? \n\n- Are you overloaded with your other CS courses? \n\nIf it were me, I would drop it. But that\u2019s also because I ended up taking MULTIPLE uneccessary courses and am now exceeding my credits so I\u2019m paying a lot of money for my classes now. I know you\u2019re in a time crunch, but if possible, you could always talk to an advisor and see what they say. \n\nHopefully this helps a little!",
