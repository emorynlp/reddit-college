  "text": "I\u2019m almost at the finish line for the semester. Just ONE more final (my music theory final tomorrow at 8am) and then I\u2019ll have officially completed my third semester. Then I won\u2019t have to worry about any school whatsoever until 1/18/22 (besides practicing my violin music, life of a performance major lol). After 10:30am tomorrow (or whatever time I end up finishing my music theory final), I\u2019ll get to look forward to going home and my trip to Puerto Rico in two weeks. This was my first normal-ish semester (I started last year during all the rona madness) and I\u2019m almost through it. Three semesters down, five to go!!!!\n\nJust felt like sharing this bc why not :)",
