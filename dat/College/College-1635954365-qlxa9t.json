  "text": "I\u2019m currently at UofSC majoring in Psychology with a temporary minor in Biology so I can get that credit and the lab credit out of the way. For a while now, media arts was been getting my interest, as I love film and filmmaking. I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s a good idea to Major on two entirely different majors and what the pros and cons to such as thing are.",

I know someone doing french and poli sci, someone doing french and Near East studies, someone doing creative writing and comp sci (who is also active in the university theatre\u2019s scenic design), someone doing econ on a pre-med track. Talk with your advisor about what\u2019s right for you.",
