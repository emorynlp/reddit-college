  "text": "I'm not looking for 'don't be lazy' advice. I am unfortunately the type of person that says \"Well I could've gotten an A on this test/in this class if I actually tried\". Obviously, this counts for nothing and sounds very arrogant to people who don't know me. I got 1360 on my SAT without studying, and now I'm kicking myself for not trying harder and being competitive for Ivy Leagues. I don't want to be like that in college. Does anyone have any tips or methods for getting out of this mentality?",

If you\u2019re doing a run in the morning and a student group at night, you\u2019ll fit in the studying as well. A person who starts off busy, stays busy.",

Or go to a specific, different place to study that has fewer distractions (quiet spots on campus, the library, etc.)\nTake breaks (5-10 min every 30-40 min). If every time you study it\u2019s horrible and takes hours of constant reading/writing, you\u2019re not gonna wanna do it much. Take some time to chill in there too.",
