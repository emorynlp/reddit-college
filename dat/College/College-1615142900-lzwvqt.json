Im not saying abandon everything, but don\u2019t prioritize school over going out with friends and doing something (idk like hiking or whatever it is you are able to do). Definitely become more involved in things around campus. \n\nI kinda prioritized classes and graduating over finding and hanging out with friends during my time in college. This is a major mistake I\u2019ve made that I would 100% change if given the chance. I basically let school and social anxiety rule my happiness throughout the time i was at university, and in the end have nothing other than that piece of paper to show for my time there.\n\nI know for some this is obvious and useless advice, however i feel the need to speak to others who are much like myself. Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re required to prioritize school or work just because of some dumb expectations laid out pre-university stage. \n\nEven if you take things slow, those classes and that school will be there regardless of how long you feel you need to take.\n\nEdit: sorry if this is hard to understand, grammar is my worst enemy",
