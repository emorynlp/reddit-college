  "title:": "Falsely accused of sexism while working on a project, lost a letter grade because of it.",
  "text": "Hey everyone.  Title basically says the gist of it.\n\nWe are currently working on a project where we simulate a working environment.\n\nThe team consists of 10 people, 7 men and 3 women.\n\nToday we were informed that the men are not listening to the women enough, and that since it was a continued pattern of behavior, we would lose 5 points, which dropped my grade from A to a B+.\n\nThis accusation is entirely untrue.  In fact, this is the only instance where I've actually felt my face get hot and feel all sorts of emotions.  I've never been falsely accused of so much as stealing a cookie... and it just sucks so much.\n\nNot once has anyone in the group male or female \"not listened\" to one another.  Not agreeing doesn't mean not listening.\n\nEveryone has contributed a solution at some point.  We have never totally disregarded someone's solution or ideas.\n\nWe have chat logs that I would totally be willing to show the professor.  \n\nIts clear to any 3rd party that everyone is included and nobody is getting left out.  At most they would see \"we should do this because of that\" and someone replying \"but I think we shouldn't do that, because of this.\"  There is absolutely no rudeness, condescending talk or anything that would imply we are not listening.\n\nSo going forward, I have the option to switch groups.  However, only 2-3 of us could do this though.  I would love to leave the group at this point, the problem is, I know a few of the others do too and idk, just feels wrong jumping ship.\n\nAlso, the third girl is an acquaintance who I know pretty well.  She told me privately its a bullshit accusation that the other two girls have lobbed at us.  She said one of the girls privately told her that she enjoys making the \"guys\" (aka us) feel emasculated by being the smartest in the group (wtf?).  Said girl tries to get her way, every step of the way and the group just generally doesn't agree... but again, she always gets her argument in.\n\nI could meet with the professor but I wouldn't even know where to start, other than asking for even one example of us not listening, while also showing dozens of instances where we go out of our way to make sure everyone's opinion gets counted.\n\nI don't know, I think I'm just too frustrated to think right.  Its not even the false accusation that gets me, its the consequences, my letter grade...\n\nSure, this is bias as its my POV but anyone who reads the chat could see its just not true.\n\nhow would you guys even approach this?  I don't want to make things worse.  I don't even know if the professor would treat is seriously.\n\nI have social and general anxiety so this is just a mess of everything, thank you for any and all replies!",

If I could handle it myself that would be best.\n\nThere's no weird laws about showing group texts, right?",

That being said, the girls and the teacher are in the wrong, and they need to learn that. When people exhibit bad behavior, it is up to others to point it out and correct it. \n\nDon't let people push you around like this.",

If she wont, tell the professor those things on your own and switch groups if you can. Im glad that the professor takes that kind of complaint seriously, but unfortunately the other girls are abusing that. You shouldnt be punished for something that not only didnt happen but isnt your fault. But. If that convo with the professor doesnt go great then just drop it.",

It would be hard (well also because it doesn't exist lol) but I mean, if I just said \"the rest of my group never listens to me\" I would hope they would try to verify it... just a little.  Especially when its a grade we're talking about.",
