  "text": "Hey all, so everyday for the past week I've been staying after my classes are over and getting work done in my school's library. For my freshman year (last year), I wasn't able to do that and did all my work at home since the library was closed at the time. Having a clear separation between work and home is so important, and now all I do when I get home is relax or do some light reviewing. Feel alot better mentally. Would highly recommend it lol.  Hope everyone has a great semester!",

Im supposed to be studying for three different exams but Im on reddit because im in chill mode and not grind mode. At least if I was in a library I wouldn't waste my damn time because why would I go all the way to a library to fuck around online.\n\nBut before covid happened whenever I went to school on the weekends to study or get tutoring my parents always gave me shit for it. Sometimes they would accuse me of trying to be sneaky and do something behind their back but im really just struggling with chemistry and have a hard professor. My dad told me before I left to get tutoring that whatever I am doing make sure it doesn't ruin the family name. I cried in the car all the way to school and studied for five hours afterwards. This was my first semester of college.\n\nI passed the class with a B, fuck you dad",
