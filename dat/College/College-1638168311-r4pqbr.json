  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman so I\u2019ve been at school for about 3 months and I still don\u2019t feel the sense of comfort that I feel at home.\n\nWhen I came 3 months ago, I was super homesick. I could barely talk because it felt like I had a knot in my throat, I struggled to hold back tears, and constantly dreamed of going home. After a few weeks, those things went away, but coming back now after Thanksgiving break made me realize that I\u2019m still sort of homesick.\n\nI\u2019d gone back twice before Thanksgiving break, but this was the longest time and the only time back where I really felt like I was back at home. The other times I never really adjusted to being back at home, maybe because I was only there for a few days. It\u2019s hard to describe, but feeling comfortable at home for the first time in months made me realize that I have constant slight sense of uneasiness while I\u2019m at college. I guess not feeling that anymore over Thanksgiving break made me realize that I did feel it while at college.\n\nI\u2019m never completely relaxed at college like I am at home. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m an introvert, but I sort of feel trapped, especially with a roommate. I feel a complete sense of comfort and ability to be myself without worrying about how I seem with my parents and siblings that I\u2019ve never felt with anyone else.\n\nI still have the same mindset that I did when I first got college - just getting through day by day waiting until I can go home. I haven\u2019t been really happy here and I know I won\u2019t be as long as I\u2019m focused on coming home in the future and not enjoying the present, but I don\u2019t know how to escape this mindset.",

      "text": "The feelings you are feeling are natural. As a freshman, especially if you have not lived away from family before college, lingering feelings of homesickness especially during the first semester are completely natural. The best advice I can give is 1) be patient with yourself. You won\u2019t be comfortable right away, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s extremely hard to take that first leap, but look at you! You\u2019ve done it! And plus you said it\u2019s not as bad as when you first got there, so look! There\u2019s progress happening, even if it\u2019s slow. And 2) one thing that got me through my freshman year homesickness was doing something that I often would do at home with family at school. Whether that be listening to a type of music that  would be played, watching a movie that I have fond memories of from home, or somehow incorporating a familiar home smell into my dorm. Any of these can start making your dorm feel like less of a strange place; and can help you start feeling more comfortable there. I wish you all the best! You\u2019ve got this, and you\u2019re doing great!",
