  "text": "\nI\u2019m 19 a freshman in college and I\u2019m absolutely miserable and am stressed out all the time about how my parents are going to pay the next bill. I have zero clue what I want to do the only thing I have a passion for that is a career is mma and I really want to but the likelihood of me making the UFC is fucking depressing. I don\u2019t want to sit in a 9-5 and be miserable or work at some big corporation that treats me like shit. It just feels like I have zero options for what I want to do.",

      "text": "I think you should do mma. If you feel like you need to be un school for some reason, only take as many classes as you can dedicate the time required to AND can reasonably afford. There is no reason people HAVE to take a full course load. That's just a stupid peer pressure thing. Take 1 or 2 classes if that's what makes sense money-wise and that's what you have time each week for. Yes, it will take longer but in the longrun you'll be better for if. Take those gen ed classes that almost every degree needs, get those out if the way. Take a random class (that fits into your overall requirements for graduation) like Intro to Archaeology or Creative Writing or something. You might find you like it. \n\nGet a part time job to help with money. Restaurant is great for people who can smile through the abuse customers, co-workers, and management will throw at you. There's good money to be made there but it's by no means easy. It DOES teach valuable lessons though so maybe try to put in a year or 2.\n\nAll the while don't stop the mma. Barring injury or other catastrophic event, keep training, keep pushing, keep that part of you that loves the sport alive. Having a passion will save you when the job and school and social parts of your life take a hit.\n\nMy passion is cross stitching. Yes, it's old-fashioned and kinda boring but when my life goes to shit and I need something just for me, it's there and I love it. It's therapeutic when everything else is chaos. So keep doing mma. Keep completing classes. Find a job you can stomach for a while and learn everything you can from it before you jump ship. Keep all those balls in the air if you can. \n\nYou got this!",
