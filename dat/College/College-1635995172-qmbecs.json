      "text": "Technically speaking paraphrases are supposed to be followed with an in-text citation, but in this instance I suppose I\u2019d nit use them per the professor, but I would still cite the source in my works cited. But this is a shit situation all around because following your professor\u2019s instructions has you technically committing plagiarism regardless if you cite the source in your works cited or not, as an source in the works cited is also supposed to be cited within the paper to not be considered plagiarism. \nI\u2019m honestly baffled as to why your professor would tell you not to cite a paraphrase, that is rather academically unprofessional in my opinion and I would not at all be happy about turning in a paper lacking those citations. Could this possibly be a test? I haven\u2019t used MLA in a while as I use APA, but APA does specifically state that the instructions given by a students professor overrule the citation style guidelines, does MLA 8 also have this clause?",
