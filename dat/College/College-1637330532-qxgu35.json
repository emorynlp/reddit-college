  "text": "I\u2019m starting university in the next spring semester and I was just wondering if I actually need to reply to every single email I get from the university? \nBecause I get a lot of email from uni where they just inform me about something. I\u2019m not sure if I have to reply to all of them.\nPlus, when I want to reply, would it be enough to just reply with \u2018Thank you for the information.\u2019 or should I start the email with \u2018Dear\u2026..\u2019 and then thank them for the information? :( I really don\u2019t know, I\u2019m so new to this. :(",

That should answer part of your question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally speaking, you do not need to reply be email to any mass email. Some of them may have a link to a form, which you may need to fill out, but you're not going to send an email reply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe exception would be where you're asking somebody for something. If you set off the communication (emailed a professor or department with a question) then you may need to respond. Use your judgement here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in general, you can just delete the mass emails if you aren't interested in what they're advertising, and you certainly shouldn't feel that you need to reply to them. If they need a response, they'll clearly let you know.",
