  "text": "It\u2019s just fucking annoying how my two group members were literally in the class nearly the entire semester until days before the project is due, and then me and my other team we figure out they dropped like the day before. \n\nThat is so ignorant to me idc what anyone says, it\u2019s one thing to drop, but knowing we got projects to take now and in the future yet you don\u2019t tell us is just crazy. I feel like professors should give us their points for that alone.",
