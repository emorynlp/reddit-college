  "text": "Mind you, I've already graduated and got a BS. But it's not like I'm going to just stop. \n\nI've always done my best because I have an immense fear of failure and mistakes, now I plan to go after a Master's. I look back and think \"Damn, what would have happened if I had failed even one of these courses?\" \n\nI just want to know what the after-effects would have been if I had made a hiccup on my path. I would have tried to find ways to rebound. \n\nLooking back, my panicked reactions towards upcoming assignments and exams seemed comparable to insanity, so I also want to find some closure to these feelings. \n\nWere my fears is justified, or have been exaggerating these past few years?\n\nRegardless of the answer, any insight would not only help me but also my peers in the future.",

      "text": "To be honest it depends on what you plan on doing with your life. For most College students who just plan on getting an undergraduate degree and then moving on, failing a course isn't that big of a deal. You could be a C student still get your degree and a good job. Good grades (aside from a few majors) just don't matter that much in College, most employers don't care about what your GPA was.\n\nI stopped stressing over my grades halfway through College. Still graduated (although not with a great GPA) and still ended up landing in my dream career.",
