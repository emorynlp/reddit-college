  "title:": "I have an F in my stats class and it\u2019s past the withdrawal date, what do I do?",
  "text": "Just failed two tests and I\u2019m really panicked. I worked really hard to study and learn the material for the most recent test but I still did terribly. My professor also forgot to post the test review before the actual test (he always posts them) so I didn\u2019t know what to study or get a basic idea on how to solve them.\n\nThe reason why I didn\u2019t withdrawal after the previous test was because I was being lazy and didn\u2019t do most of the homework, so I really thought I could do better for the next test if I just did the work more. It was also the first test that I failed (I\u2019ve passed my other stats tests before) so I didn\u2019t want it to look like I gave up just because I failed one test.\n\nI already booked an appointment with my counselor, but I want to see what you guys have to say. Thanks in advanced.\n\nEdit: minor clarity issues",

I wasn't too happy with my C but it allowed me to continue with my papers and complete my degree. I did stats with the same lecturer again.\n\nI had already seen the course I knew what to expect, but hell nearly failed it the second attempt too. Point is don't give up you will get there.",
