  "text": "Apologies in advance, but this is a long one.\n\nI'm a semester into my 2nd year of a 3 year Biomed course, and am having thoughts of dropping out. I can't get myself motivated to do enough studying, I'm just about passing the progress tests/assignments and am massively behind in lots of aspects of the course. Over the past couple of months I have had mild suspicions that I may have ADHD but (as with my studies) I haven't pursued it much beyond a screening at uni saying that I don't show enough symptoms to be put forward for an assessment.\n\nWhen considering dropping out, the 1st things that come to mind are \"what would I do instead?\", and \"isn't it going to end up being a waste of time/money?\". For the former, I genuinely have no clue as to where my passions outside of trivial hobbies, such as gaming or exercise, would lay. If I'm to drop out, I would want to reassure my parents that I otherwise have a solid plan for what to do instead, but as of yet I still haven't come to a conclusion. As for the latter, it would absolutely be a waste, but as previously stated, I would need to formulate some sort of plan to compensate for that.\n\nAlso, though this may be a bit trivial/greedy, I don't want to want to lose the vague sense of community I feel a part of within my cohort. Some of the coursemates I've been fortunate enough to meet are great people, but they all seem to have more drive/intent for the course than I ever did. I know nobody can be 100% all of the time, and some of the most vocal people in the cohort have been open about struggling with mental health, so I am in no way implying that my 'inability to do stuff' is a greater struggle than what others may have behind closed doors.\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for a solution. Rather clarity. I understand that inevitably I control my life, everything comes down to the choices that I make, so on and so forth, but so far it seems that whatever control I have is being squandered on meaningless activities that won't benefit me in any relevant capacity in the future.",

      "text": "No joke I felt like I wrote this post I\u2019m in my fourth year and changed my major at the beginning of the semester. I finally found what I actually enjoy learning about and was contemplating dropping out as well. I was really unhappy with my previous major but sometimes it can take a while to figure out what you want to study. If you do have one year left of your program I would recommend trying to finish and just get the degree if it\u2019s one more year. That way you have a fall back career if you need it for some reason later in life.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re interested in technology, try to switch to neuroscience if you\u2019re allowed to. If you can\u2019t, push yourself to complete your degree. You sound like you hit a burnout phase, and that is a-ok. Treat yourself to something nice perhaps and try to push through it, keeping in mind it could be of great benefit in the future. And talk about how you feel with someone, sometimes it\u2019s astonishing the insight you can receive that you never paid attention to. Best of luck human!",
