  "title:": "On being broke: nutrition, cognitive function and academic performance.",
  "text": "The clich\u00e9 of the financially\u00a0 struggling college student seems to be prevalent, we all know the jokes about living off beans and rice, the immediate practicality of junk food and the all-nighters gulping down coffee jars. \nThe culture of sacrifice is apparently all over the place. I often see opinions along the lines of\u00a0 \"I was in a bad situation but managed to success. If you do not cope with it you are just lazy\". This of course does not account for the variety of factors that could affect one's performance in life.\n\nBut still, I wanted to know how you people deal with this situation. Perhaps our situations do not align (I am a poor person living in a poor country), but still find it difficult to see how anyone could eat less than the necessary energetic supply to sustain ordinary activities and still manage to think deeply and extensively. My point is, when you're poor and malnourished everything is harder, from standing up to breathing; when your body can barely afford to sustain itself on low maintainance mode, how do you manage to sustain higher thinking and other academic requirements?\nPlease allow me to know your ways.",

      "text": "Save money. Look on Facebook marketplace or at thrift stores for things like coffee machines, cooking utensils. Do smart and simple shifts. I am a mom who lived in rooms and off of wic. I struggled and felt really hopeless and malnourished at times. My baby was always fed but it was difficult. You get assistance if you need it. But don\u2019t live off of it and depend on it. Save money. Eat healthy now because it\u2019s way cheaper than you think. You can get fruits and vegetables and buy quality grass fed meat. Buy from butchers or farms. I can get 4 dozen eggs for 9$ in my area. I buy meat locally and save where I can. You plan out your meals and plan your cleaning schedule. For cleaning schedule I use the weekly plan from clean mama. For meals, I make things like lasagna from online recipes that are super easy and cheap. Then you let it cool down (no more than 2 hours maybe like 30 mins) then cut it and freeze it in a container or put it in the fridge in a storage container. You can freeze food and reheat in the oven. Buy a water machine like the primo water machine. Get refills by returning you jugs at Lowe\u2019s or Home Depot. For four 5 gallon jugs it\u2019s about 6 dollars when I return my jugs. I buy attitude shampoo in Amazon it\u2019s 30$ and lasts me 6 months or more. I use cast iron, glass bake ware and stainless steel only because it doesn\u2019t have chemicals that leach into the food. I don\u2019t use a microwave ever. I have a nespresso but it\u2019s worth it so I\u2019m not buying vending machine coffee or coffee at Starbucks. I use monk fruit sweetener because it is better than sugar for the body. Lemon water and intermittent fasting are options for some people. It really is better than eating junk food. If anything you can make your own chicken nuggets with pork rinds spices a can of chicken an egg and some mozzarella. You can make your own fries with russet or sweet potatoes baked or broiled. You can make healthier versions of fast food at home for less all while helping your body to function at its optimal potential. You Save save save. Work hard and rest. Try not to stress or sweat the small stuff. It\u2019s ok to feel feelings to feel like there is no where but up and to struggle. Just remember what it feels like in this moment and let it fuel you. Remember it\u2019s only for a time and life can and will get better. One day you can look back if you make good decisions (including your major) and be grateful for where you are. If you fall flat on your face don\u2019t worry you can still get going. Listen to your body and eat well so you don\u2019t have hospital bills later from neglecting you health. Brush your teeth. Floss. Don\u2019t do drugs or do. But try not to become an addict because that\u2019s unhealthy and expensive and damaging in many ways.",
