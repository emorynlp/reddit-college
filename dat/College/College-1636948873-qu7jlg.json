  "text": "I work fulltime as a controller, I have a 4 year old daughter and, like most women, handle the household duties (husband works long 12 hour shifts - sometimes up to a month at a time, including weekends). I do not have help with childcare and am currently in a hot spot for covid.\n\nMy grandma died about a week and a half ago now and I just can't get my head back in the game. I am usually an A student (I already have a Bachelor's with \"high honors\" and am going back to get probably at least a master's in another field), but I am struggling to get a B in physics. I fell behind time-wise aftert grandma passed as I spent her last day with her and was there when she passed (it was not a peaceful passing). I've been trying to play catch up every since, but everytime I find myself having time to focus on physics, I do anything else. \n\nI love learning and even find physics fun to learn (the concepts, not so much the 30 minutes problems), but I lost all my interest and motivation and switched from wanting to learn to just getting the class done and I don't know how to get back to the proper headspace again. I can not take this class again as it is a lecture/lab on-campus class that I honestly didn't even have time for this semester...\n\nI also have not signed up for next semester yet as I think on a subconscious level I know I need time to myself.",
