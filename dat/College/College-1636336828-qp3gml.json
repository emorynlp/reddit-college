  "text": "I\u2019m planning on renting a furnished apartment near the college of my choice. What things should I purchase? What will I actually use and what are things that are recommended to buy but I won\u2019t use? I don\u2019t want to buy useless things but I also want to make sure I have everything.",

There\u2019s probably more but that\u2019s off the top of my head",

Just start paying attention to the things you use and start making a list. Used the can opener, add it to the list. Stepped on a bath mat after taking a shower, add it to the list. Used a spray mop to clean the kitchen floor, add it to the list. Etc, etc.",
