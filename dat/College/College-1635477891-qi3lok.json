  "text": "I am taking Art Appreciation and have failed the first two exams. The class is historically tough, so much that they have an expansive tutoring program.\n\nDespite attending tutoring and using student support programs, it just isn\u2019t working out. Even with my studying, I\u2019m not producing the way I\u2019m expecting.\n\nI currently have a 60 in the course, which means that for the next two exams, I\u2019d need two 90s to pass.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s realistic, and I feel like a failure for even considering it. Other than this class though, I\u2019m literally doing perfect, with all satisfactory and As across three other classes.\n\nFor those of you who had to drop a class, how did it make you feel?",

I\u2019ll have got take 2 extra electives to recover the four credits I\u2019ll be losing cuz I need 120 credits to graduate. I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s not a nice feeling for me bc I feel dumb for withdrawing. The fact I\u2019m struggling in a lvl 2 class means I\u2019ll struggle even more in higher level classes.",
