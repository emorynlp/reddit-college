  "text": "I have been to all of my classes basically everyday. It is now finals week and I have come down with a sickness where I was recommended by my doctor to go to the emergency room. I spoke to the dean as well as my professors and they said I might get an incomplete grade. They explained it to me but I didn't quite understand. Did I just fail 3 classes because I couldn't make their finals?",

Did you ask for an \"extension\" or an \"incomplete?\" Maybe they didn't realize what you were asking for in the rush of finals week, and maybe they didn't see a communication from the dean of students yet? \n\nI would send one more communication asking for an incomplete specifically and explain you are working with the dean of students. If that doesn't go anywhere, go back to the dean and explain that the instructor is being uncooperative (but be professional in that complaint, of course).",

      "text": "No -- an incomplete is for a situation where you did most of the work but got hit with something at the last minute that meant you couldn't finish on schedule. You'll have to arrange with the school/professor to take the finals you missed sometime after break and based on how you do that grade combined with all the work you completed before you got sick will replace the I.\n\nIf you don't finish the classes on the universities timeline (often about a semester) the incomplete may revert to a failing grade, but that shouldn't be a problem if you take the finals once you feel better.",
