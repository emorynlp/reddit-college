  "text": "So last night I tried taking my last final exam of the semester. \nFor context, this is a Class for Marriage And Family Studies on the socialization of families and communities. \n\nFinal exam: prep by answering 13 essay questions. Then copy and paste your answers into the 6 that randomly get chosen for the final. Must be completed using proctorio so there's proof you are simply copying and pasting from your own document. \n\nSo I finished my prep and had all the questions completed except for 3 that I decided I would answer if they showed up (more opinion based so they would be easy writeups).  \n\nLog onto Canvas and try to boot up proctorio, but my mic doesn't work.... Tried several more times but it never verified for me. Midnight hits and I'm not able to take the exam.\n\nSo I send a frantic email to my Prof explaining the scenario and attach a copy of the document with all the answers I have typed up in case she can grade them manually herself.\n\nShe responds saying it's the end of the semester and she's pretty sure there's nothing she can do. Enters a straight 0 and it drops my grade from an 89% to a 76%. \n\nShould I file a complaint with the department? She literally has what would have been my answers available, and they were sent right when the exam was due. The only difference is they weren't copy and pasted into the prompts on canvas. \n\nJust wanted to hear some opinions, as I'm pretty down about it rn.",
