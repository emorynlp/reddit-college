      "text": "I realized I was at a good university when, after I asked a question in class, the professor said, \"I don't know; I suspect no one knows. Write your PhD thesis on it and tell me the answer, see me after class.\" I had just transferred from community college where professors were kind but nowhere near this level of knowledge or encouragement. I saw that professor after class and he gave me a list of books I might be interested in to read. Then I found another kind, knowledgeable, and helpful professor, followed by another, all top experts in their field as well. When I applied for grad school the professors didn't just advise me and write letters of recommendation, they personally reached out to different universities and different professors.\n\nI don't care about rankings or popular opinion, but when busy world-class professors take the time to care for a singular student in a massive university, that was when I knew I was at a good university.",

Looked on LinkedIn, talked to alumni and realized it would be difficult to get where I wanted to go for a career from the school and not many people from my school were career driven. Then I transferred to a solid school where I am currently at and it\u2019s a lot better. Super easy to find internships and like minded classmates",
