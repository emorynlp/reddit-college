  "text": "In college I had a few core friends who I was really close to, then a cluster of \u201cfriends\u201d who I was not as close to. I mainly only hung out with them in group settings that someone else would set up.\n\nNow, over a year after graduation, I\u2019m really only in touch with the core friends. I have those other people on social media and would possibly hang out with them if an opportunity came up (like we happen to be in the same area or attending the same event), but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking every day or anything. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering- is this a normal thing? Did you find that, after graduating, it became harder to stay in touch due to the sudden change in distance? Thanks!",
