      "text": "No issue really. If you have other stuff going on that\u2019s more important, well then you better take care that more important stuff. Some people will say having a bunch of W\u2019s looks bad, but I disagree. For a couple reasons. First reason is that your transcript doesn\u2019t really matter unless you plan on going to grad school. If you don\u2019t plan on going then great not to worry. If you do plan on it you can cite withdrawing for personal reason. It\u2019s your first semester and if you withdrew form every class that\u2019s not going to look bad.\n\nSecond reason is that a job probably won\u2019t ask to see your transcript for anything more than proof of degree. And if you withdraw it wont affect your GPA, and there\u2019s no sense in wasting time with classes if you have other stuff going. I don\u2019t know what that other stuff is, but I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s it\u2019s more I important than your classes. \n\nAt the end of the day college isn\u2019t going anywhere. If you need to leave and come back when you\u2019re ready then that\u2019s what you should do. \n\nThe only real issue you may have is if it\u2019s related to financial aid, scholarships etc. But I can\u2019t really answer that for you.",

      "text": "It happened to me last year fall 2020. I was also dealing with private issues and was just not able to concentrate on school. So I dropped it. I got W\u2019s for all classes, which were 4. I have since retaken the classes and applied to a 4-year-college. They haven\u2019t said anything to me about the W\u2019s and I was admitted. I did have to pay back a small portion if my financial aid. If you feel like you just can\u2019t focus on your classes, dropping them might be better than having all F\u2019s or in general bad grades. Essentially, you should always consult your advisor and your financial aid office. Good luck to you \ud83c\udf40",
