  "text": "Honestly, I feel like choosing my college was a mistake. Long story short, I chose to go here solely because of a (brand new) special program that will help with grad school and the program ended up being very lackluster; I absolutely hate it here and transferring is not an option due to financial reasons. The only thing this semester has going for it was my grades; I enjoy most of my classes and I\u2019m doing very well in all of them.\n\nThe biggest issue I have regarding my experience here (outside of the issues with administration lol) is my social life. I\u2019m in a cohort of ~30 people. We\u2019re all roommates with each other in the same dorm, we have almost the exact same classes, and we\u2019re all at the mandatory activities held by our program. In short, we\u2019re in each other\u2019s faces 24/7. I\u2019m cool with just about everyone here, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m *friends* with anyone here. To top it all off, freshmen cannot join clubs with the exception of student government (ew). So I\u2019m stuck in an endless loop of eating, going to class, doing homework and sleeping. I hate it and it\u2019s extremely depressing. If you\u2019re not interested in parties, Greek life, or church stuff, there is absolutely nothing to do. The RAs hold events in the dorms from time to time, but no one really shows. On top of all that, I can\u2019t really afford to go out into town. \n\nPlease let me know of what a Nashville-area college student can do for fun!",
