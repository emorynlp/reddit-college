  "text": "November has been very stressful for me. Aside from having a hard time coping up in college, I've been also struggling to do my responsibilities as the eldest daughter. I'm taking care of my little sister since both my parents are working far from us. The pandemic, which caused for us to do online learning, has been very hectic for me and honestly my mental health is not doing good these past few days. \n\nDo you guys think this pressure in college is still good?",
