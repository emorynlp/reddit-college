  "text": "Hi everybody. I\u2019m a freshman and I really hate the school I\u2019m at. I just don\u2019t belong here at all. Anyway, I\u2019ve been doing really well this semester academically, staying on top of the work, not procrastinating, getting stuff done as soon as it\u2019s assigned. Now all of a sudden I can\u2019t bring myself to get any of this work done with so many final papers coming. I\u2019m afraid I burnt myself out too quickly earlier in the semester. I feel fucking broken and helpless. Thank you in advance for advice/help.",

      "text": "I went through this last year. I'm now in my second year but I'm still considered a freshman because I failed half my classes and ended up getting academically dismissed (I was able to appeal it). My best advice is use the resources given to you. Talk to professors, talk to whatever center on campus is designed to help students succeed, talk to friends. Whatever helps you get things done, even if it's just for a little while, do it. For example, I put on a TV show I've seen dozens of times and have it as background noise. I've also found that my house is a terrible environment for getting things done. I commute but I somehow convinced myself to stay a little bit later in the library or whatever common space is in the building I just had class in. Make super simplified lists for what needs to get done. Have one check box for research, one check box for finding sources, one check box for planning out your paper, etc. You'll feel better about yourself because it will feel like you're getting more done. I know it can be difficult to get out of a funk but don't be like me. Don't ignore half your classes and have to tell your parents you failed out of college",

      "text": "I\u2019d recommend going to the office hours of all of your professors and telling them your concerns. sometimes it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed and in your own head about things, sometimes just hearing that the tasks isn\u2019t as impossible as you think helps a ton. They aren\u2019t for everyone, but lists have helped me a ton as someone who gets burnt out easily. i make a list every morning of what i need to do for the day and for the week, helps me feel a bit more on track. i\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a rough go, i hope things look up soon :)",
