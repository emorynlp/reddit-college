      "text": "My first semester, I failed a whole class. My financial aid dropped. I couldn't take the next class the next semester because the one I failed was a pre rec. I took it again the next school year and passed it. Brought my GPA back up. And I failed another class later on, and retook that one too.\n\nAn A is successful, but it doesn't define success. A C is still passing. Nowadays I'm happy if my grade is barely above the threshold of what is considered passing. Because I tried my best in the end, and that's all that matters. You're going to be just fine. If you end the class with a grade you don't like, retake it. One bad grade doesn't mean anything.",
