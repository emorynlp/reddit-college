      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t study the day/night before an exam. You\u2019re not going to remember much, and it can detract from what you already know. Long-term memories take time to build, so you\u2019re pretty much beyond the window of making more. Short term memories fade pretty quickly, so you\u2019re likely wasting your time.\n\nSpend an hour or two right before the exam cramming a few memorizable things if you need to, as you can hold a fair amount of short term memories for a few hours if you\u2019re focused.\n\nFor example, if there\u2019s any acronyms, lists, terms, or formulas you struggle to keep straight, then memorize them right before the test. Just repeat it over and over in your head going in. Then, write it all out in some blank space first thing so you have it for reference.\n\nYour short term memory is like inhaling and holding a deep breath. It takes time to train yourself to swim underwater for two minutes, but taking a deep breath will give you an extra 10-20 seconds of endurance if you\u2019re desperate.",
