  "text": "I enjoy math but I do struggle with it sometimes. I\u2019m having a debate of taking it in person or online. If it\u2019s online, there\u2019ll only be 40 students in the zoom. If it\u2019s in person, it\u2019ll be 40+ students. I want to take it through zoom because it\u2019ll save me a lot of time, but in person, I feel like I\u2019ll get more help, although it could be the same online.",

      "text": "Personally I would take it in person. Doing it online will definitely be easier but you won\u2019t learn as much and you can\u2019t ask questions as often unlike in person. I also think it sets you up for Calc 2 better because in depth knowledge of Calc 1 is definitely very good when going on to the next class.",

TA held tutoring sessions and after every lecture the professor held a q and a for people that had questions on assignments or things they didn't understand. Taking engineering probability and statistics next semester online too, hoping linear algebra has an online option for next fall.",

Are you capable of finding answers on your own or self learning?\n\nI generally look for solutions on my own when I get stuck and if it's something I can't figure out then I'll email the professor. The key in taking online classes is being self-sufficient. If you can manage that, then you'll be fine.",
