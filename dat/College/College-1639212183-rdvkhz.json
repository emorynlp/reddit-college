  "text": "Ok gpa calculations really confuse me. I know a 3.5 gpa is a even amount of Bs and As but what would happen if I get a C (its kinda looking like it and I'm freaking out) is there a certain amount of \"extra\" As I can get to cancel it out like how does this work.",

      "text": "GPA calculations aren't hard.  Using your class' grading scale, multiply the grade point earned times the number of credits for the class.  Then take the total of grade points earned and divide by the number of credits taken.\n\nExample:  A in a 4 credit class - 4.0 x 4 credits = 16.0 grade points.  B+ in a 5 credit class - 3.5 x 5 credits = 17.5 grade points.  A in a 3 credit class - 3.0 x 3 credits = 9.0 grade points.  C in a 5 credit class - 2.0 x 5 credits = 10.0 grade points.\n\nFrom there, add the grade points earned (16.0 + 17.5 + 9.0 + 10.0 = 52.5 grade points) then add the credit hours taken (4 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 17 credit hours).  Lastly divide the grade points by the credit hours (52.5 / 17 = 3.088 gpa)\n\nYes you can have a 3.5 gpa with a C, obviously not given the example I used.\n\nHope this makes sense and good luck.",
