  "text": "I never really wanted to go to college, and there was a point where I decided I didn\u2019t want to go at all because I thought it\u2019s a waste of time and money. Now as a senior in high school applying to colleges, I realized I do want to go but only for the experiences. I want to go to college parties, make friends, freedom from family, and maybe join a sorority. Are these good enough reasons to go considering all the debt I\u2019d go into?\n\nEdit: I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the question at the end because I don\u2019t have a choice, I HAVE to go to college because of my parents. I should have clarified that.\n\nAlso, are y\u2019all in the comments blind? Where have I stated I wanted to go to college strictly for the parties, have you not read my other reasons? It may be in the first reason in the sentence but is not the only or even main reason I want to go. So y\u2019all can stop ignoring my other reasons and thinking I just want one thing. \n\nI\u2019m going to try out college for a year and see if I like it enough to continue all 4 years.",

Usually students go to college to get a valuable education and make connections to help them get careers after they graduate. Honestly, if you just go for the party experience you wont stick around for the long term.",

Work for six months.  \n\nApply for a credit card. Get the credit card.  \n\nUse the credit card for little shit for six more months.  \n\nAt the end of that six month period, call them and ask them to increase your spending limit to $5-10,000.  \nIf you've been paying your bills on time, they *probably* will.  \n\nNow take your grown-up sized credit card and plan a trip to Daytona Beach, or Lake Havasu, or Mardi Gras, or the Bahamas or Lollapalooza or Burning Man or wherever you think you can have the most fun in a week, and go have a blast.  \n\nWhen you come home, and the bill shows up you either start making payments on all the fun you had, or you start planning to declare bankruptcy and make it all go away.*(Caution: bankruptcy is not a magic wand. It's going to hurt if you do it.)*  \n\n\nIf you borrow a pile of money to go to college, you CANNOT escape those loans. They will shake you down until you turn 60 years old to get their money.  \n\n\nSo, I'm proposing you borrow $5-10,000 that is eligible for forgiveness instead of borrowing $25,000 to 125,000 that will never go away.",

      "text": "Hah. Somehow I don\u2019t even have to ask what country this is in. Such an American thing (I say this as an American). \n\nFirst off, no one is making you go to school. Your parents might want you to, but there is no way they can force you to do so. That\u2019s on you! \n\nIf you want freedom, having accountability in the form of grades on homework and still having to go to classes is NOT a great way to find it. IMO, half the behavior in college is a bunch of kids trying to feel independent while still being largely supported by their parents and realistically having pretty limited freedom. Having had both experiences\u2026full time work has been SO freeing. Entire weekends to myself. Vacation time. Putting money in the bank and retirement. Supporting my hobbies. Drinks after work with friends and NO HOMEWORK. \n \nIf you want real freedom, get a two year degree in IT or something and go get a job making 25+ an hour when you are only 20. That\u2019s what my friend did, and he loves it. Totally financially independent, has a motor bike, time for friends on the weekend, no more homework\u2026something about signing up for four more years of homework, papers, tests\u2026would not make me think of freedom, no matter HOW MANY parties you go to. \n\nDo you want to be a 22 year old senior who still thinks getting shitfaced with their friends 2+ times every week is the pinnacle of entertainment and worth $30K or more a year? You might, but I\u2019ll tell you that got boring after about a year or two. And you\u2019ll be pretty poor with very little disposable income to enjoy doing things which *actually* make you feel free, like traveling, owning your own car, experiencing new activities, and funding hobbies. \n\nThis would *only* be a good idea if you are also willing to find a major, stick with it, and graduate. You might change majors three times. Fine. I did it five, and changed schools twice! But I\u2019m graduating in four years, managed to keep my debt under 25K and I will at least have a degree to show for the whole charade\u2026and a ~3.9 GPA.\n\nThe worst possible outcome is that you spend tens of thousands of dollars to go to school for 2-3 years and then wash out and drop out. You will have wasted nearly $100,000 and not even gotten a degree to show for it. And you\u2019ll probably feel even more lame than if you had just taken a gap year and tried getting a job and your own apartment.",

      "text": "Making friends in college is honestly harder than in high school. I took my high school friends for granted. Now everyone is socially awkward and its hard to make friends unless you\u2019re close with your roommate (I commute to save money so can\u2019t relate) or if you\u2019re active in enough organizations to make friends through there. But you need to maintain good grades to be involved, even with sororities. And as a current college junior, I can say with 100% honesty that maintaining good grades when you\u2019re uninterested in the education is extremely difficult in college. I went to a liberal arts school which means 90% of my curriculum is liberal arts core and my grades plummeted compared to high school. A lot of courses feel like a waste of time and they all go further in depth than what my brain wants to learn which means understanding the material is even harder. At least find some interest in a career if you\u2019re going to college",

It is easily one of the best financial decisions someone your age can make, and comes with the excitement and party scene you are looking for. Simultaneously, one enlistment contract pays for schooling afterwards, should you decide you are ready to actually pursue further education a few years down the road. \n\nCollege is clearly not in your best interest at the moment. This mindset is a classic mistake so many make, and essentially end up paying $20,000 to go to a bunch of parties - totally worthless. Might as well just move to a college down and hang out at the bars without actually attending the school if that is all you are looking for.\n\nI was a soldier, so I am pretty biased towards the Army, but I would urge anyone not entirely interested in the gritty military experience, but interested in the benefits and some adventure to look in to the Airforce. Clean, climate controlled life style, far more relaxed than the other branches, and will likely take you all over the world.

And its just--idk how to explain it, I feel like I'm becoming more human, and more connected to the world (even though I don't know 1 person from any of those regions, but I feel like I'm part of them idk if that makes sense)\n\nOh, also, I'm from lower to middle class background so I really want to live with a better financial situation, and a degree really allows me to do that.\n\nBut aside from future financial situation, I just think that it'd be better if you go to a university with diverse student body. I feel like it will really make you \"grow\" as a person, and really really help you to empathize with people. And it feels so good to embrace and tap into our humanity (idk if that makes sense. I mean I have friends from diff countries and I really get to celebrate and appreciate the differences and yet the similarities of our experiences--it makes me feel less alone, in the existential context)",

Still, the college experience needs to fit around a student's academics, not the other way around.\n\nDisturbing facts are that you mention student debt you will incur, and also that your parents intend to force you to go to college.  You will soon be an adult, and you have to choose your own course in life.  Its especially unfair to you to have the double whammy of paying off student loans for something you don't see as part of your life plans.  I suggest a calm and mature talk with your parents about your future.",

It really depends on the sorority, but in the end, are people you party and drink with worth $5k-$10k a semester? You can do that without going to college. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want real tangible experience, but aren't worried about attaining a degree, take classes that interest you and forgo the stupid electives they make you take. One thing's for sure, your majors are what's most important, not the partying lifestyle. People that live that life often don't stay around long in college.",

      "text": "I'm gonna answer your post in a way that's not condescending like all other comments here. You have the right to think that way about college, as everyone else did before they went to uni. And nobody should judge you for it. I'm glad that you're considering higher education and I'm excited for your academic journey as a college student. But here are some things to think about:\n\nTo answer your question, no. Those are not good reasons to waste your tuition or financial aid on. \n\nFor starters, college parties should be the last thing on your mind as a freshmen. Those are usually hosted by frats and sororities in dorms or off campus. and most of them will charge you $200-$1000 a quarter to cover the fees of enjoying those perks. There's also the question of commitment before your first rush, and whether or not you'll survive the hazing process. \n \nMaking friends will be a challenge. You have to understand that nobody in uni will care about you, let alone greet you on the very first day. Everybody's wearing masks and everyone's busy walking to their building or studying for their next class. You actually have to make the effort of introducing yourself, attending club meetings, or approaching people during lecture. Otherwise, no one will notice you, and those four years will go by without you making any connections.\n\nFreedom from family is nice, and dorming on or off campus is a new and exciting experience. Atleast that's what i thought when I moved out. You'll eventually realize that independence will demand alot from you. You'll have to learn how to be financially responsible, how to budget for groceries and sustain yourself with healthy food. You'll learn how manage your bills, pay for your housing, and your car. You'll need to know how to balance part-time job with classes while working enough hours to cover after-tuition expenses. If you're more than a 2 hour drive away from family, you will get homesick and you will wish that you never moved out. It's a depressing phase, but you'll soon get used to it. \n\nUnless you do community college or commute, going to a public 4-year and dorming there will be one of the most expensive things you'll ever experience. If you go to a research university like UCs, you'll be paying hundreds of dollars a quarter on top of your 5k in tuition. Aside from your usually housing expenses, these includes your textbooks, access codes, club fees, tutoring fees, etc. \n\nSo no, I won't advise paying that much money just to party and make friends. America is the most capitalist country in the world and colleges are becoming businesses because of it. It's a luxury now, and an overpriced one at that. The best things about college aren't the frat parties, or that good stuff you see in hollywood movies. It's the academic achievement you get from learning new things, doing study groups, work-study, doing research/internship opportunities, and making connections with your counselors and peers. And no it's not a waste of time and money if you choose the right major. Even if you still work at starbucks after graduation, a bachelors degree is better than not having it.",
