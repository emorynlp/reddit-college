A time for me to eat better and get financially squared away. It's also a place where I can develop friendships and reunite with old friends. In all, college is a way for me to have a better quality of life while gaining new skills and credentials in a profession more accommodating to my disabilities. ",

It's not safe here to walk around, even during the daytime, so there's no chance of me getting exercise by walking around. The last grocery store here closed down years ago and the only way to get (overpriced) food is to go across a 6 lane highway.  The food is all low quality stuff that's bound to kill you if you don't eat too much of it.\n\nIt's just... A mess. Anytime I'm on a college campus everything feels right. I can work out, eat well, meet people, go outside, and enjoy my life without fearing a stray bullet or a widening waist.\n\nIt's all a year away, but I'm closer than I've ever been",
