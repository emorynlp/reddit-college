  "title:": "Does anyone not pay attention to ANY of their classes? I literally just sit there and \"chill\".",
  "text": "Hi, so for me, I am not sure if it is a combo of my absolute horrible (and diagnosed) ADHD,  me being so distracted with my laptop/phone, or maybe I am not interested in any of my classes, but I legit don't pay attention in ANY of my classes. If you asked me what we were talking about in each class, I wouldn't have 1 word to say , I am not kidding lol. This isn't a flex, I genuinely wanted to see if anyone else was like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe weird part is my GPA is pretty good (3.7) and I am a senior who has done classes like this since freshman year, pretty munch blanking out all class and not paying attention at ALL. For me, I've learned that lectures are kind of pointless, and the importance should be based around exams/papers/assignments. Even though I learn absolutely nothing, I found papers and assignments are easy to do with all the plethora of resources online. Same goes with exams, I would just teach myself with youtube videos the day before class. My major is finance, I probably understand this would not work at all in engineering/STEM/Medicine or something lol. Should also add I am at a decently prestigious school (below 30% acceptance rate, just incase people will assume this \"strategy\" only works at like community colleges)  Anyone else similar experiences?",

      "text": "Same here, specially since remote teaching started. I have three hour long lectures and my total attention span in them is like 20 minutes. I also have a pretty good GPA (about 3.5) and I've figured that it's much easier to just go back to the power point slides when you're doing homework, or trust good old Youtube. Also, I'm a senior and I don't think I've ever read more than 5 pages of any textbook that my classes require",

      "text": "This describes me from the moment I learned to read, pretty much (so... like first grade). I'm pretty sure I have an auditory processing disorder of some sort-- I find that I really just *can't* pay attention to a lecture. But I'm good at teaching myself just about anything, so 99% of the time buying the textbook and reading it is all I need to do to get good grades. I'm currently in STEM, and I actually think it's likely easier to learn this way in STEM because every subject you learn is neatly organized in a textbook somewhere. It's not always like that in the humanities, which also relies sometimes on class discussions, which means paying attention is much more important. \n\nI've always been a good student, and I think it's because I take initiative to teach myself whatever I'm learning. Many students think that they're just passive recipients of education and can just listen to lectures and magically know what they're doing, but that's just not how \"learning\" works, at least once you get to the university level-- high quality learning takes a whole lot of work outside of class-time. In reality, classes themselves are more or less there to supplement whatever studying/work you do outside of class to learn material, but again, most students think it's the other way around, which is why most students get worse grades despite paying attention in class when some students get better grades while not paying attention in class.",

      "text": "Haha I know how you're feeling OP. I was a dual CS/Finance major at a fairly rigorous business school (Stern) and for all of the business+finance courses, like you said, you can skip most of the lectures, just take a few old practice exams and you can probably nail the A lol. \n\nNow the cs/math theory courses on the other hand lol... yeah... if i dared pull that I would probably be getting B's or lower lol. Like you said, I think STEM/engineering courses just don't work that way... unless you're a really super genius which I was certaintly was not lol. Still graduated with a decent GPA (3.7) but I put in a lot more work in the STEM courses.\n\nGiven you are sitting at a very good GPA yourself, I'd say your strategy is working perfectly fine lol. I feel like 3.5+ is more than enough for any employer screenings/or even grad school if thats what's in your plans. Also looking back, I think you'll far remember the experiences/fun times you had vs some measly number on your transcript which will long get forgotten lol!",
