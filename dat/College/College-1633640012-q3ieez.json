  "text": "I have like a 97% in this class and I didn\u2019t do this discussion assignment which would hurt my grade but at the end off the semester it\u2019d only be by 3%. It\u2019s US history and I only didn\u2019t do it because I got behind in my calc class. I just agreed to doing it by tomorrow because I freaked out. I\u2019m so bummed because I have to do the midterm too :/\n\nI\u2019m definitely grateful this teacher is so kind but it\u2019s such a surprise",
