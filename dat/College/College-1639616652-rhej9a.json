  "text": "My name is Sotiria Vamvouris, and I am a student in the Clinical Psychology program at Midwestern University in Downers Grove, Illinois. I am reaching out to undergraduate college students with an invitation to participate in my dissertation study. My research examines how a college student\u2019s mindfulness may be related to their perceived anxiety, depression, and stress. Participating in this study will take approximately 10-15 minutes, in which time you will be asked to complete a few surveys. Participants will be given the opportunity to be entered into a drawing for one of four $25 Amazon gift cards. More information about the study as well as specific eligibility requirements can be found at the following link: https://redcap.midwestern.edu/surveys/?s=7RTR7MXWPR\n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration! I greatly appreciate it!",
