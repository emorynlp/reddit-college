  "text": "I have had a rough time at school and am going to be back at college soon finishing my AA degree. I hope to continue my education at a university but am unsure if I am able to given my current academic qualifications. I am really passionate about mechanical engineering but my math skills have gradually decline over the years due to no practice. Has anyone here faced similar challenges and been able to overcome them? I would appreciate any guidance!",

      "text": "I\u2019m currently majoring in Comp Sci with mediocre math skills. For context for the first two years include Calc I-III which heavily rely on an extensive knowledge in algebra. The last time I took Algebra was in 8th grade. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but I\u2019ve busted my ass doing practice problems everyday, and reviewing a week in advance for exams. \n\nYou already answered your own question. You just have to practice to improve your math skills and do well in your classes. If you want to pursue mechanical engineering you\u2019re going to have to put in the time and effort to succeed.",
