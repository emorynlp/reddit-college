  "text": "didn't let me in the first day because they weren't sure if I was a student there. had to get my roommate to look for the fee receipt and send a digital copy of it. can't ask any questions because everything I'm concerned about seems to be unnecessary. can't enter lecture halls unless we have a lecture. can't remain in the hallways either because it'll count as us skipping the lectures. the professors won't hear us out since they said we weren't worth their time. was told off for entering the lab without asking for permission even though it was the TA who told us to enter in the first place. they said I won't get a placement if I continued to behave in this manner. the students which they have a problem with are always marked absent and are told to leave the class. we're now being punished for having a low attendance rate. the students will always be the ones at fault :(",
