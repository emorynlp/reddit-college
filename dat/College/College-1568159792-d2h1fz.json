  "text": "I was told this would be appreciated here.\n\nI'm 21 and in my senior year of college but I know there's people here that can relate to this in one way or another.\n\nSo last semester, in the final weeks of the semester, I had a powerpoint presentation due in my nutrition class. We were all assigned a vitamin and had to make a presentation about this vitamin.\n\nThis project was assigned to us on the first day of the semester and I knew this was going to be a quick, easy A, so like every student ever, I said \"meh, I'll do it later.\" WELL, later never came but you know what did come? The day of the presentations. So I stroll into this class, 9:30 am, iced coffee in hand, laid back, no concern over anything. The kid (S) next to me (B), leans over and goes\n\nS: How's your presentation look?\n\nB: Ha, what presentation?\n\nS: ...\n\nB: ...\n\nS: ...\n\nS: The presentation that's due today.\n\nLet me just say that my heart has never dropped so low, out my ass, and into the center of the Earth so fast in my life.\n\nB: ...oh shit.\n\nSo, my last name starts with A... and the professor (P) goes:\n\nP: Alright, we're gonna start the presentations soon and I'm just gonna go in alphabetical order.\n\nThank fuck that there were a few people before me that also had last names that started with A. So I I M M E D I A T E L Y open a fresh powerpoint, make a title card, and start Googling like I've never Googled in my life. I pulled up the project rubric in a small window on my laptop and I literally just started copying and pasting every question that was required to be in the presentation.\n\nI literally made a decent looking in 10 minutes and long story short, I got an A somehow. I somehow got an A on the most rushed piece of a shit thing I have ever produced in my academic career. It was so hard for me not to laugh while I was presenting and S was sitting there giggling his ass off cause he knew what I had done and that he had saved my ass.\n\nBut yeah, don't procrastinate, set reminders, keep a planner, use a calendar, something.\n\nIf anyone wants to see the powerpoint, I can post it in the comments.\n\nThis is the powerpoint:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11_cSS0KX-ppUgD3pN-bKWRoDR_RZq27pME9CD2R_tVE/edit?usp=sharing",

It gets so tiring you eventually lose all motivation and wont do it at all... knowingly!\n\n\nI remember I just didnt do this one project, it was a combination of procrastinating and not wanting to do it.\n\n\n\n\n I walked into class knowing I had a presentation due that I hadn't done\n When the TA got to me I just said\n\n \"I didnt do it\"\n\n \"why not? Its 30% of your grade\"\n\n\n *shrugs*\n\n\n\nIt got to the point where failing a class didnt bother me. Dont get to that point.",

Since the teacher allowed you to furiously work on this (and not require everyone put away their electronics or pre-submit the file) - I\u2019m assuming you also had a very easy teacher.  Not to mention not requiring a paper to be due along with it. \n\nEven as a student, you could easily tell the people just reading their power point word for word, vs the ones who actually took it seriously and put in the effort. \n\nGet a task manager (I use Things 3) or put assignments on a calendar. \n\nBut I feel like this story is like beer googles - the drunk person sees one view, while everyone else involved sees another.",

However, 2 of the 4 people in my group dropped at the very beginning, and because my lab partner and I worked so well together, our professor never assigned us new partners. He said we could split up into different groups, but we had way too much fun together to do that.\n\nSo the last week of class rolls around, and my lab partner gets there before me.  I\u2019m on my way when I get a text like \u201cshit!! There was a presentation due tonight!\u201d It was designed to be split between 4 students, so there was a lot of work that needed to be done on it. I wish I could even tell you how, but I have no memories of those moments, but some how, some way, we collaborated in such a way that allowed her to get the experimental data from me, make the PowerPoint in a few minutes, email the PowerPoint to me, I jumped on a campus computer and added pictures, then printed the PowerPoint off (which was required), and then emailed it back to her. We got 100% on that presentation. Neither of us even knew what was in that that PowerPoint honestly, we just BS\u2019d it well enough to get by. We were so proud of ourselves lol",

I picked something I was familiar with. But besides that, there was times where I could sit down and type out 2 to 3 pages worth of content in an hour, then turn around and spend 3x longer puttin in source information (which tbh was harder to do) and touching it up.\n My history proffesor and advisor on the paper loved it, however he wasn't the course instructor for the class, and she (the instructor) wasn't much into my sort of history.

Anyway due to a loss in the family I took incompletes on that semester and came back the next fall to finish it. Had the same professor, and he tells me \"well I didn't change anything in the course and that paper you didn't finish was the last one of the semester. I'll copy your grades over you just need to hand that paper in when its due around finals period.\"\nWell, I didn't even start righting it the first go around, and even with a year of knowing that I'll have to write the paper I still waited until the last 3 days to do it. Professor told me that it wasn't just the best paper I've ever wrote for him, but one of the best in his last 2 semesters.",
