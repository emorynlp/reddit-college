  "text": "I decided Going back to school at 35 with a toddler was a good idea, and decided I would take one class online to get back into learning. I placed into an accelerated english composition class so I don't have to take two separate classes. After I decided to do this my work announced a reimbursement benefit if we go to school for a specific degree. Now If I get a c or better my work will reimburse me! Wish me luck I haven't written anything substantial in 17 years! Fortunately my so has an english degree so I have a lot of help!",
