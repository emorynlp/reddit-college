  "text": "I\u2019m currently taking a psychology class that I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gonna end up with a D or D+ in. How do I tell my parents, more especially my mom, that I\u2019m failing the class? She\u2019s paying my tuition and I\u2019m scared of how she\u2019s going to react. I\u2019m passing all my major classes at the moment and I\u2019m only taking the psychology class for a minor I want to pursue but I didn\u2019t plan to fail. A lot of things just went south and the final was the cherry on top. I just transferred from community college to university this semester and luckily my school has a transfer forgiveness policy where I can retake the class and the better grade will be factored into my cumulative gpa. However, the D will still appear on my transcript. I\u2019ve just been having anxiety thinking about how I\u2019m gonna tell them. Maybe I just won\u2019t mention it unless they ask. Idk, someone help. \ud83d\ude05",
