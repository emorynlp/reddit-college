  "text": "Hi, I want to enter a college/ university 2 years from now. Preferably somewhere in Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, considering Netherlands and the Baltic countries as well.). I'm looking to study something like History, Anthropology, Theology, (Historical) Linguistics or Archaeology. I live in the EU. I have a few questions about it such as: what are some good colleges/universities, how much do they cost and with what type of grades with I could enter them.",
