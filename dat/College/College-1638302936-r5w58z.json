      "text": "It depends on your academic program and where going abroad fits into your schedule. One of my degrees is biochemistry, so after rearranging my graduation plan, the best time for me to go was my sophomore spring semester. In general, you should plan to go late sophomore or junior year. Senior year you\u2019re either looking for jobs or applying to post grad programs, so it\u2019s not ideal to go then. Also, some schools like mine require you take your last portion of credits within the home institution in order to graduate. I would recommend talking with your academic advisor and your university study abroad advisor about when the best time is for you to go.",
