  "title:": "My teacher accused me of cheating on a test",
  "text": "My Latin professor thinks that because of the fact that I moved a rolling chair during a test (supposedly out and in under the desk to look at something in my lap) and occasionally looked down that I must have been looking at a phone or note or something during a test. He also thinks that he saw me put something that appeared to be a phone in my backpack at the end of my test, when it was actually the case I keep my pens in. But to prove that I wasn't cheating, I had to retake a portion of the test while he watched the entire time so that he can decide if my answers were equally correct. Problem is, this accusation caused my anxiety to go through the roof and I'm pretty sure I mixed up a few of my translations from the stress, which is just going to make me look guilty. I have no idea what to do here. Please help!",

Worst case scenerio she tries to report you and then the case will die from there.\n\nMost professors dont want to go through all that trouble unless like I said they have solid proof. Dont cave in it sounds like she might be trying to get a false confession out of you.",
