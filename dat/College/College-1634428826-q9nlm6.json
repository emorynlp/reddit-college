  "text": " For the past few years I've been able to manage my time while being a full time student and having a full time job. But lately I feel like I'm struggling with burn out. I work 40 hours a week, sometimes more along with my online zoom classes and I am now starting to feel like I need a break. However, whenever I tell myself that I become frustrated because I know that graduate school will be a lot worse. I feel like if I cant handle it now then I wont be able to hack grad school. I know that time management is important and I'm good with my time. But I am mentally exhausted. I don't have the energy to study anymore or even get up for work. Does anyone have any advice for what helped them instead of the whole \"manage your time\" or \"don't procrastinate\" stuff?",
