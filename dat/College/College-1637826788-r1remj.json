  "text": "My Professor always responds to my emails within a few hours, and my classmates have to wait about a day to hear back from him. I think he is also grading my assignments before my other classmates. We communicate often, I tell him if things aren't visible on Blackboard. It is nice to have a Professor that I feel is happy to have me as a student. One of my peers said I'm his favorite, jokingly of course.",

There are a lot of other women in that major who like to bring other people down, so I think you would fit in perfectly. Also, I'm not sucking-up. I'm just expressing that I'm happy to have a good relationship with my Professor which can help me in the long run. Furthermore, I really dont care what my peers think when it comes to my style of receiving my education. If you care about that so much and you are projecting your insecurities onto me, then you should remember it doesn't matter what other people think of you.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!!\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

I wasn't sure if you were a freshman or something and just didn't know. I  genuinely had no intention of offending you, so I am sorry if I did...really, I am. My apology probably doesn't seem genuine to you because it seems like I triggered some kind of defense mechanism really insecure people have about academics.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to you, too!",
