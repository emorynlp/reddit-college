  "text": "\u201cWhat is better \u2013 To be born good, or to overcome your evil nature though great effort?\u201d (Paarthurnax).\n\nI just went from a 1.2 gpa during my freshman year to a 3.0 this semester (first semester of my sophomore year).  \n\nI was always one of those kids that was in gifted and talented  and never studied, but university hit me like a ton of bricks.  High school was an absolute breeze for me; so much so that I never really learned HOW to study. Fast forward to college, and I\u2019m the type of student that never studied/cared about classes too much, and that resulted in me being forced to leave my university due to not meeting SAP.\n\nI\u2019m attending a community college online this semester (while working full-time at a grocery store), and have managed to get a 3.0. I\u2019m absolutely ecstatic rn honestly.\n\nI\u2019m posting this to say that, if anybody else is currently in that position that I was in, it\u2019s NOT the end of the world. You CAN improve your grades. You decided your own outcome in college, so please don\u2019t squander it. Don\u2019t come this far just to miss the mark because of procrastination/lack of effort.\n\nAnyways, this was just something I felt like posting. It\u2019s only up from here bois. Thanks for listening to my incoherent ramble \ud83d\ude01\n\nEdit: \n\nTHANK YOU to everyone that has commented on this post/awarded it.  I made this post off a whim after finishing my final exam for true semester. It\u2019s crazy to think that so many people can connect with a 19 year old\u2019s shower thoughts lol.\n\nAgain, THANK YOU ALL and I hope y\u2019all have amazing spring semesters filled with growth and determination \ud83d\udc99.",

On a weekly basis, these are my stats: minimum 43.5 hours (was sick for 3 days that week), maximum 116.5 hours, median 70.2 hours, average 71.7 hours. The past 12 months it has been a 74 hour average. Money is WAY better though.",
