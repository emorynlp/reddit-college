  "title:": "Is a History Degree really worth it?",
  "text": "I'm in my first year of college and I'm having a very hard time deciding whether or not a history degree is right for me. There's a lot of pressure around me to go into a STEM field since this is a school with a lot of pre-med students, and I've been getting a whole bunch of imposter syndrome because of it. History is what I really enjoy but it feels like everything around me is telling me that it's useless and I might as well get a chemistry degree because that's what gets you a job right out of college. Can anybody give their experience just to help out?",

      "text": "Archaeologist here. With history, it depends on the specific time period, but you would have to get at least a Masters degree to work in academia. If you feel comfortable with that, go for it! You can write books, teach, do archival work with historical societies or museums, work with historical site preservation and education, become a librarian with a little extra school (it's way more fun than it sounds). What do you envision yourself doing as a career?",

              "text": "Both of those are career paths where a history degree would be applicable. I would keep exploring those jobs if I were you. Teaching may be a hard field to break into, but I hear some teachers are quitting due to COVID, and there is a huge need for teachers in rural areas... Maybe make some posts to a specific subreddit for teachers or lawyers to see what the job market is like and to get some advice.",

      "text": "2020 graduate and history degree holder here. I worked in public history at my city\u2019s historic preservation non-profit while in college. I got a lot of great experience and made some amazing community relationships that helped me to build my career.\n\nI would suggest tapping into the local network to take full advantage of your academic experience and begin to work on building your ideal career while you\u2019re still in school.\n\nI worked with professors on research gigs having my work published in books and publications and with locals to assist in litigation support and miscellaneous newspaper and genealogical research. After college I began working for a national consulting corporation on location-based research for environmental impact for real estate due diligence project. I am again using my research and writing experience to pivot my career into the media sales industry in a research role that uses insights and research to connect media companies with prospective advertisers.\n\nI love history and have been able to pivot around the foundation that my degree provides. Ultimately if you want to specialize within the field or go into law you must prepare for further education. Otherwise be sure to enhance your resume with extracurriculars and meaningful experience.",
