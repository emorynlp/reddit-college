  "text": "I went to community college for a year got a 3.3 gpa which I am proud of since academics was not always the easiest thing for me. I transferred to a university branch campus this semester and found myself struggling mentally insanely and having horrible roommates who would scream at 3 in the morning and even the Dean of the school knew about this problem but refused to kick them out. Even though I have finals next week I decided to go back home this week because if I had to stay there for one more day I would have done something violent and that would not solve anything. I do plan on going back to community college this semester and transferring again to a university but how will a almost full entire semester of failed classes effect me getting into somewhere else despite still getting a decent gpa at my community college.\n\nAlso I am a veteran who uses the GI BILL so I was not able to drop out since that would leave me in debt with the VA of thousands.",

It was a red flag the 2nd week when I made a complaint to my RA about it smelling like weed on the whole floor in the afternoon on a weekday and he just shrugged and later found out he was also smoking with the residents. BTW this is in PA and its illegal there.",
