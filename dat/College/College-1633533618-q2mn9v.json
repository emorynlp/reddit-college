  "text": "In the moment I was super excited to share the find! It\u2019s an interview with a philosopher on the neurodiversity paradigm in psychiatry. ( https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/neurodiversity-paradigm-psychiatry )\n\nIs it overstepping to email professors about these things? I\u2019m a little worried that I might have done something wrong. The last thing I want to do is waste their time.\n\n(Also, I included the link just to show what kind of article it is haha)",

They said that some professors could take offense or just dislike students trying to \"school\" them. But I guess that's only the unreasonable ones. I had only sent it because I had gained an understanding of the kind of person my professor was, so I felt like they'd appreciate it - and they did! They added it to the course materials for the students right away. I guess if you really think it's helpful then you just have to judge if your professor is the kind of person who would appreciate it or not.",

Your make believe world in which you randomly get to assume things about a stranger and then use that as an insult have missed the mark twice now.
