  "text": "Hello. I\u2019m currently a sophomore in college and I\u2019m honestly not happy with where I\u2019m attending school. The only reason I attended the college is because I was offered a full ride and my family pressured me into taking it. I feel like I\u2019m missing out on opportunities for growth being that the school is 10 minutes away from home and I\u2019m not getting the experience of being away from home in a new area. The school is also very small and there\u2019s not as much extracurriculars or diversity as I\u2019d like there to be. Since I\u2019ve already made it through half of sophomore year, I\u2019ve been contemplating on whether I should stick with it until I\u2019ll apply to another college for grad school or if I should just transfer even if it means I\u2019ll be paying out of pocket for my undergrad. \n\nI\u2019m grateful for the scholarship I just wish I could be happy where I\u2019m at.",

      "text": "What are your goals? Does the school you\u2019re at have a program that will give you the basics you need to do well in grad school? How is the quality of education at the school you currently attend?\n\nUnless the academics of the school are actively failing you or limiting you in your ability to advance towards the job field you want, I\u2019d suggest sticking it out. A full ride is a wonderful thing and being able to go into grad school without any loans is an amazing accomplishment that will make life easier down the road. \n\nNow if transferring will get you into a better program, will increase your networking ability, or in someway help your career goals, then it might be something worth looking into. But run the numbers because it\u2019s important to know what you can and can\u2019t afford. \n\nAlso if you transfer, make sure your credits also transfer. Work carefully with both schools to see what classes will/won\u2019t count towards your degree and make a graduation plan. You might end up graduating later than originally planned if your new school does not accept all of your current credits. \n\nGood luck friend!",
