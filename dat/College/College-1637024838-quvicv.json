  "text": "My health\u2019s been worsening and it looks increasingly likely I\u2019ll need a surgery with a 6-8 month recovery time and I\u2019ll be out of college for two semesters. Since so much of college is about momentum, how can I make sure I don\u2019t lose my \u201cedge?\u201d I already read regularly particularly popular physics books but was wondering what else I could do in the meantime?",

      "text": "Learn a new language. \n\nGet on Khan Academy and do like twenty minutes of math a day. Does not have to be particularly difficult math, whatever that means for you (although do primarily focus on word problems), the point of the exercise is more about the problem-solving and analytical thinking. \n\nRead the \u201cgreat books\u201d of your field. Bonus points: you\u2019ll probably be assigned at least parts of them in class later so this one actually gets you ahead. If you\u2019re so inclined, look up some interesting research papers as well - if you have to give up your institutional database access while you\u2019re out of school you probably have a friend who wouldn\u2019t mind sending you a PDF every now and then. \n\nLearn/keep practicing an instrument. Def also a low-stress and low-impact way to raise your heart rate a bit that you can tailor to wherever you are in the physical recovery process. \n\nBest of luck!",

          "text": "Thank you so much! These are great suggestions and I will be sure to do them since they fit perfectly- I used to be fairly good at piano so I can pick it up again. I also think that I\u2019ll be able to keep my institutional login (or at least I hope) so I\u2019ll be able to access scientific articles (i\u2019m going for biology). Also the word problems are a good idea, and 20 minutes a day sounds reasonable. Thanks again! :)",
