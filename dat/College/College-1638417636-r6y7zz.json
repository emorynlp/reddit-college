  "text": "Title. I am a non-traditional 26 year old undergrad. All I wanted was to get adequate certification (degree, tade school certs, whatever) to get a salaried job and stand on my own two feet. But things kept not working out. My family fell apart meanwhile, I had to leave them for my mental health. I found there's a high likelyhood I have undiagnosed ADHD. some combo of that, depression, burn out, CPTSD have left me totally depleted. School keeps expecting me to do well but I am this depressed and although I got some leniancy when I spoke up, I still have to deal with just, a lot. Yeah school is over for me after next Wednesday, but there is still work I need to do and I am just so, deflated. None of these classes spark joy in me to begin with, but I've dragged myself through them through sheer fear of failing alone. I finally got evaluated by neuropsych, hopefully I'm deemed worthy of trying stim medication for next semester so it isn't as hard . . .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am just tired of giving my all in a world that is so reluctant to give me much support.",

I\u2019m 25 going thru the exact same thing, just got enrolled in health insurance so I can try to get some help for my suspected adhd/possible autism + more next soon. It will make school so much easier. I hope you find the peace you deserve \ud83d\ude04",
