  "text": "I\u2019ve already cheated on a couple of tests and an assignment so far. I only did it because I\u2019m not learning anything, I really don\u2019t know the material and obviously I want to pass the course. I\u2019m disappointed in myself and I feel like I may as well drop out. I don\u2019t know why but I feel like it\u2019s really difficult for my brain to retain information. I suck at taking notes, I\u2019m not organized, I remember quizzes the date they\u2019re due even though I wrote down all the dates earlier\u2026I have five classes. How the fuck am I supposed to soak in all this information from five classes so quickly? Plus I work part time and I\u2019ve been dealing with depression/anxiety and other mental shit for the past 10 years. I haven\u2019t been to school in 5 years and I haven\u2019t been educating myself since so all this new information at once is just not sticking. I feel like I\u2019m incapable of learning and it\u2019s not possible for me to get through school without cheating. And I feel like since I cheated I won\u2019t earn my credentials even if I pass. I just cry all the time and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "Being \"book smart\" isn't real. Science proves that intelligence is malleable. Look up growth mindset. \n\nI know it is really hard working a job and going to class. I work two part time jobs for a total of 36 hours a week and I also take 5 classes a semester. I promise you I get it. What that means is you will either have to cut back on course load, cut back on hours you're working, or accept that you will not have the time to make 100s in all of your classes. However, you are paying too much money to go through college without getting your degree. \n\nIf your studying isn't working, it is likely you are not studying effectively. Fun fact: rereading your notes is the most common but least effective study strategy! One of my part time jobs is meeting with my peers and providing academic consultations. Please let me know and I can provide you with more study strategies. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend regular counseling/therapy. I go every 2 weeks and it greatly improves my life. Your school likely has a counselor available that you can meet with for free. \n\nWorking and being in school really sucks sometimes,  but it's a means to an end so you can live more comfortably and enjoy more free time in the future. \n\nCheating is a very likely way to get in trouble with your academic integrity office, and you will likely not be able to finish your college career anywhere if that ends up on your transcript.",

I wish I had gone sooner because if I had, I wouldn't feel like I wasted the last 6-8 years of my life. My advice on that is if you feel like you should talk to someone, do it asap. \n\nAs for school, have you tried changing the way you study?  As I've learned, the only way to remember stuff is by writing it down, so I take notes in class. Usually definitions or concepts and when I study, I write it down again a few times and then I try to do it from memory and repeat it. As for dates I've taken to putting everything in my calendar on my phone and laptop and I've forced myself to look at it several times a day so I remember what's coming up, I also have notifications set on different timers. \n\nAt the end of the day, you have a lot going on between FT school, PT job and life in general. The biggest thing I try to do is take time to remind myself of why I'm doing what I'm doing and what my end goal is.\n\nEdit: Don't cheat. If you get caught you'll be expelled and you'll have trouble getting into other schools. Try your best, and keep trying. You can do this.",

Try and plan out a time to do assignments and studying for classes outside of your part time. For studying, try looking up different note taking methods you can try out. And seek additional resources like videos or the tutoring center at your school to assist you. Realistically though, 5 classes and a part time job seem too much for you to take on. Have you considered taking a lighter course load? \n\nAnd I strongly recommend you reach our to your school\u2019s counselor for guidance on everything you\u2019ve been going through. They may be able to provide you with some insight or assist you in some way.",
