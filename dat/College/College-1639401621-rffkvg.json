This semester i took 15 credits hours, and while this is the least I\u2019ve ever taken, it was by far my hardest semester. However over the summer I did take Calc 2 and Linear Algebra, but these were different \u201csessions\u201d so i didnt have them at the same time. I did well in calc 2 and linear algebra, but I definitely didnt do as well as i couldve in calc 3 and differential equations. I think if you are willing to put in a ton of study and work hours, it is definitely possible, but if you want to go out and do things with friends and relax sometimes, i would lightest the load. Personally, I think i made a mistake taking what I did this semester, but i think if i had been more willing study, I would\u2019ve been perfectly fine. Do what you think you can do, but dont rush it too much\u2026",
