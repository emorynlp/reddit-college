The assignment is completed now (thanks to me, myself, and I lmao) and I just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s okay that my other group members will all be getting an A+ for *my* several weeks of research and hard work.\n\nLike man I\u2019d love to do absolutely nothing and get an A for it\u2026. Should I just let it happen and move on, or should I say something? \n\nUgh. Group projects should not exist in online uni- let alone one that\u2019s worth 40% of our final grade. \ud83d\ude2d",
