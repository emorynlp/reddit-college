  "text": "I\u2019m not the academic type, but i\u2019ve been fighting my way really hard through uni. i\u2019ve come to my first class which i\u2019m going to fail - i\u2019ve basically been neglecting it all semester to focus on my other subjects (i\u2019m going to drop a subject next semester so it doesn\u2019t happen again) i have an online exam today that\u2019s 2 essays in 2 hours on questions based from weeks 5-12 but i literally haven\u2019t done any of the content for those weeks (i started slacking around week 4). i just got a new job which has thrown my schedule and i\u2019m sick with the flu & just have a sinking feeling in my stomach about this exam because i know there\u2019s no chance i\u2019ll pass. i\u2019m considering just not doing it, because i\u2019m going to fail anyway and save myself the stress and focus on my new subjects to get ahead (i\u2019m studying via an open universities online program so we get no breaks and our semesters overlap a little bit) \n\nis failing a class going to destroy my gpa beyond repair? does failing with a better grade count for anything? i feel so stressed and stuck.",

One class isn't going to tank your GPA, especially if you are a good student and learn from your mistakes and do better in the coming semesters  or have the possibility to retake the class and have GPA forgiveness.",

I\u2019m actually a third year full time student who is also working 25 hours a week & this is the first class i\u2019ve ever failed. your comment wasn\u2019t helpful or constructive, but I hope it eased your weird need to be patronising & spiteful :)",
