  "title:": "Loneliness due to being the only person in my office (Ph.D.)",
  "text": "I started a Ph.D. in October 2021 (I've been here for a month) and I haven't met anyone yet. Before I started, I had seen what Ph.D. offices looked like a few times during my undergraduate years (in a different university) and it seemed like something that would also be socially fun; everyone seemed to be in an office with 4 or 5 other people and it seemed like everyone had formed a tight-knit community.\n\nWhere I am (in a quite crowded city), all the Ph.D. desks are in a massive open floor plan that's split up into different sections. There's no one in my section or the neighboring sections and I feel like I'm wasting my life. I just feel excluded because of where I am and I'm contemplating applying to a different university because of this.\n\nI get that I could try talking to other people in different offices but it just seems like it won't lead to anything as friendships often form when you are doing tasks together in close proximity. I would just effectively introduce myself, have to leave them to go to my desk where there's no one and not go anywhere further than make some acquaintances. I don't know what to do",

When I arrived, it was already filled with someone else's stuff so I had to contact them again and I had to clean the desk myself etc. which I don't mind, it's just I wish they would have told everyone at the start so that I didn't waste so much time. And now I would have to contact them to move.",

      "text": "Stick with it.\n\nYour PhD is yours, and yours alone. You are not an undergraduate working on the same course as 100 other undergraduates. You are working on a totally unique project with really zero input from other PhDs. And they are doing the same for their projects. So it actually doesn't matter if you share an office because you are working on entirely different things. **You will not do tasks together**. Expecting to treat your office like a social space is like expecting to treat the silent area of the library as a social space - people are there doing their own thing, and socialising mostly happens outside of that space, during lunch or coffee or seminars. All of which you can still join in on.\n\nQuitting an entire PhD after 1 month just because you have an office to yourself sounds frankly insane to me. A lot of PhDs would kill to have their own office. I'm guessing that there will be more students joining at some stage (since space is a rare commodity in departments, and desks basically *never* go free), so it'd be very premature to quit now. Either request to move to another desk closer to people or give it more time, but certainly don't just quit without putting in even a tiny amount of effort on your end to socialise. \n\nAlso, it will reflect poorly on you if you quit this PhD program. Other programs do not want someone else's sloppy seconds: they will assume you left because you were a bad student, and when they ask you to justify it, saying \"I didn't *get* to share an office\" won't be acceptable to them. If you drop out for truly trivial reasons then there may not be a second chance at getting a PhD.",
