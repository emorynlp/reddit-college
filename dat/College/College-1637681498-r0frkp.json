Missing 8 or more hours of class will result in failure of the course.\n\n\n-> so does it mean I can skip 2 classes without a deduction or does even skipping one class would affect my grade?",

Participation is a percentage of the overall grade, therefore if participation was at 100% upon a 3rd absence the *participation* percentage would drop half a letter grade to 95%, but that deduction would only cause a marginal percentage of the *overall* grade to reduce.\n\nWhoopsies.
