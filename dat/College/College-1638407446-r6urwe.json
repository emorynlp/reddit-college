  "text": "Hey guys so i'm currently active duty (US) and I am looking to start schooling on the side and CS is one of the majors I am considering as well as Civil, Mechanical, or Chemical Engineering. I really want to major in CS for the career opportunity, I am not sure if I can do it though. I'm assuming college is going to be hard for me since i've been out of school for a year and some change now. I also feel I need to take remedial math, and I don't know if that is even a thing in college. \n\nI honestly don't know if I can do college in general, and my self doubt is pushing me back from my dreams. I really don't have an interest in anything and I just want to find a good job that pays well. I am currently in a job I don't like and I just job out. Any advice?",

      "text": "I started CS at 32. From a bartender to a software engineer. I also took the lowest math possible and worked my way up, did not remember much of algebra or precalculus. Glad I did since it was pivotal in calculus.  I also had zero experience in coding.\n\nIt's a pain in the ass and not an easy degree, and I also work full time so it's a big task to undertake. I was committed to it and will do whatever it takes to finish this degree, I'm two years out until I graduate. Just know that you'll have to make sacrifices, for instance my dating and social life is nonexistent. After work I'm either studying, working on assignments or projects, or prepping for exams.",

              "text": "I'm 36, so four years in. I average around 20 credits a year. My college had remedial math, which was like high-school algebra. I think most universities give you a placement exam and place you in the math class based on your score. I opted to take mine since I wanted to start as low as possible just to form a good foundation, glad I did. CS is based from a math degree so lots of math, some more and some less, depending on the university.\n\nMy first year was all in person, and then became remote due to covid. Now we're going back to in-person or hybrid. I prefer online so I don't have to mess with my work schedule and can do work on my own time and pace. Plus even though I live close to the university, I really hate commuting, finding parking spaces and paying for parking permits. It's 30-40 minutes I don't need to waste. Unfortunately now with me starting upper division classes, online options are almost nonexistent. \n\nSome good resources for math that I used are khan academy, Professor Leonard and Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube.",
