  "text": "I have a finance final tomorrow that I don't feel prepared for. I know it's my own fault so I don't need anyone to tell me that in the comments. I'm actually currently staying up to study for it, but I still feel like I might get a really low score no matter how much I study. I don't know, I just feel so anxious thinking about the impending exam. Any tips on how to relax?",

      "text": "Usually the night before the exam, I like to have a cup of hot camomile tea, I tend to lose sleep worrying over exams so that helps a lot. Also relaxing music on YouTube is nice or whatever your favorite music is. If I\u2019m feeling extremely overwhelmed I like to walk outside for a bit, helps calm me down. I know these tips are cliche but it might be something to try. I wish you all the best on your exam \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udc9a",
