  "title:": "How would working as a research assistant in two labs at the same time look? (Side note- is it doable?)",
  "text": "My roles in the two labs are completely different. In labA, I\u2019d be doing some data analysis/entry/transcription. Here I\u2019m paid and have a set number of hours per week and have to come into the lab (8-10 hours)\n\nIn labB, I get one course credit. It\u2019s online and my job is to gather literature related to the topic. \n\nThe reason I ask is bc my dad said if I do both this would look on my CV like I can\u2019t focus on one topic \n\nThoughts? Thanks!",
