  "text": "Hello everyone! I'm looking to start a math tutoring lab at my university. We have an academic writing lab, and I've noticed a lot of students actually go to them for help, so then I thought that a lab for math tutoring might be helpful too. \n\nJust want to confirm first though. Do any of your colleges have them? Do you guys/any other students that you know find them helpful? What kind of help is offered, and how? Do they have fixed timings during random days of the week where you can go to a designated space? \n\nIf you're a tutor at one of these labs, how does it work for you? What do you make sure to do for the students that come over to help, and exactly which courses do you help with? \n\nI want to have a good, sort of set up plan before I actually start talking about it to the admin people, so I'd really appreciate if anyone could give any answers! \n\nThank you in advance!!",

      "text": ">  Do any of your colleges have them?\n\nYes. \n\n> Do you guys/any other students that you know find them helpful?\n\nWe had a number of students drop in and some told me they found it helpful. \n\n> What kind of help is offered, and how?\n\nWe were there to answer questions about material from any of the math classes students were taking. We had student volunteers sign up for times to tutor, and students could just drop in and ask questions.\n\n> Do they have fixed timings during random days of the week where you can go to a designated space?\n\nYep.\n\n> If you're a tutor at one of these labs, how does it work for you?\n\nWhen I was a tutor I actually got lazy and didn't sign up for official \"designated\" times to tutor, but I myself would drop in at random times to help out. I actually ended up being there more often than people who had \"official\" times they signed up to tutor for. It seemed to work well for me, at least.\n\n> What do you make sure to do for the students that come over to help\n\nI focus on explaining underlying mathematical concepts rather than just having students regurgitate the process of how to solve problems. Of course, we worked on solving problems step by step together, too. \n\n> exactly which courses do you help with?\n\nIt was at a community college, so all math classes offered at the school.",

          "text": "Ohhh okay okay this is really interesting, thank you! \n\nA couple of last questions:- \n\nDo you have any idea on how it was set up at your college? Is it official, or was it started up just by students wanting to help others? Was there a lack of teaching assistants for the courses offered at your college, that resulted in a need for the math lab? \n\nAlso, so since it was a CC, was the level of courses usually at a comparatively basic level? (I'm assuming that for example, at my college, the math lab could potentially help with all calculus courses+intro linear algebra+intro probability and statistics, but since I'm at a 4 year college, it probably can't help with stuff thats at a higher level).",
