  "text": "My English teacher wanted us all to write a page about each story we read. She did not specify page size in the syllabus. She had us bring in our notebooks the next day of class so she could mark that as our notebook for her class. Everyone had brought in standard, 8x11 notebooks... except me. I brought in a wallet sized 2x2 notebook. She commended me for it and everyone else had to use the notebooks they brought in with them. When she graded them at the end of the year, she just flipped through the pages like you would a cartoon drawing notebook and then gave me 100 lol",
