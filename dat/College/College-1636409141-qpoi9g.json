  "text": "this probably sounds like a stupid question but i just do not know how to effectively study for my biology class, which is a huge issue because i\u2019m doing exercise science so i obviously need more science classes. when it comes to science related to the body i have no trouble with that, and it\u2019s probably because im genuinely interested in it, whereas i HATE chemistry and i don\u2019t too much care about transcription elongation or 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 (i still dk wth that means btw) or whatever. \n\nhowever, we all take classes we don\u2019t give a shit about so it doesn\u2019t matter, my question is how the hell do i study for it? i take notes, make quizlet\u2019s, do the hw, i watch the lectures and i FEEL like i know what\u2019s going on but when it\u2019s time to take the test idk wtf i\u2019m doing. i\u2019ve failed every test so far and i have another one in an hour and i think i\u2019ll cry if i fail a test about something i\u2019ve been learning since middle school. if anyone has any tips on studying for science based courses i\u2019d be so happy to listen",

      "text": "I try to like subjects I hate.\n\nExample: I hated the hell out of my course on Lawns and Greenfields, but I forced myself to apply my knowledge when going around in the neighborhood, identifying types of grass and looking at it. Turns out grass is fun, some of it is really pretty( my personal favourites are Medicago Orbicularis and Agrostis Alba)\n\nThat's basically how I do it.",
