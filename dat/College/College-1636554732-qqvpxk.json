      "text": "!!!! This definitely should _not_ be a reason to bring you down, driving is a big deal and takes a lot of effort, no matter how many see it as second nature and should be learned quickly by everyone. \n\nMy sister is 25 and still learning to drive, she\u2019s literally still in driving school, and failed a test last month, but she\u2019s still going! Please don\u2019t feel discouraged about this, it\u2019s normal and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re less than anyone.  We are all different, maybe it takes you a year to learn driving and five months for someone else. \n\nI really hope you don\u2019t feel bad about it, because you simply shouldn\u2019t.",
