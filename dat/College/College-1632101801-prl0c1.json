  "text": "Yesterday I took an exam for my calculus class and I had to use honorlock. It was a very long process and I ran into a lot of problems installing it. About 45 minutes worth. Since my test, google chrome will not work. It always fails to launch. My laptop is sluggish, more than usual anyways. Has anyone else experienced this? I haven\u2019t been able to find much on the internet.",
