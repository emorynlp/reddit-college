      "text": "> being alone on your own for the first time\n\nThis part will depend on your upbringing honestly. For some its like freedom and independence, or others its being pulled away from the family. Some people it's a mix of both. Personally I loved it, I call it adulting lite.\n\n>making new friends without knowing anyone\n\nThis one is the one that is the contentious on the sub, and I say as long as you put effort towards it, you'll kind of find your people without realizing that you have. You gotta talk to people, and if they dont end up being it, then move onto the next group. Finding friends in your major has huge benefits too (Mine helped me with job hookups and saved my ass more than a handful of times in class).\n\n>what to major in, what majors are useless/not worth my time\n\nmy suggestion to you is this...go look at like a job board or explore different careers and see what you'd think you'd want to do. Then look at what kinds of stuff they are requiring in terms of degrees. Similarly you can look at degrees and see what kinds of jobs are available to you. There may be people at the career center at the college that can help with this as well.\n\n>how to support myself\n\nIf you have to work to pay for school, it is possible to do both, it just takes a lot of discipline to not fall behind.\n\n>study well and do well\n\nThe hardest part for me was to learn how I learn and retain information as well as how to study effectively for myself. I was one of those never study in HS people and that hurt when the first midterms came around. Yes there are some that you can get away with that attitude, but I would not recommend it until you get a feel for it. \n\n>college better than highschool\n\nI could rant for this one too, but in short it's a you control your own destiny type of deal. Want to do XYZ activity? go ahead. Lonely? go try and get more friends. Wanna go out and party one night? sure why not. For the most part you can do what you want, but that also means you get to feel the consequences of your actions. Also people in general are open and its a time of your life you can kind of experiment and see who you want to be without the whole politics of being a cool HS kid or whatever.",

When you fail, stay strong and try again. \n\nIf you were a good HS student, you\u2019re probably going to a good college. For many top HS students, you go to college and realize you\u2019re really not that smart, because now you\u2019re surrounded by thousands of people just as smart or smarter than you. Don\u2019t let the imposter syndrome kick in, you belong there just as much as them.",

      "text": "I just recently started a YouTube channel aimed at people like you with all those questions. Check it out here: https://youtube.com/channel/UCl0IAvv7PBSViz0k6tpuR1w\n\nBut if you don't want to go watch all those videos, I'll post some answers here.\nBeing alone can be very different depending on how far from home you are and if anyone is coming with you. I roomed with high schools friends at my first college, and then at my second college I had aunts and uncles within 10 minutes I could reach out to if I ever needed a ride or a friendly face or a meal in a pinch. Making friends, I usually did through my classes (group projects were actually good for something), because that's 18 weeks you're going to see someone and have something in common with them. Eventually you learn more and find people you have even more in common with.\n\nThe cop out answer is that any major is worth it if you have the right expectations. As far as a purely financial option, I would look at things that will pay you around 50k with a Bachelor's, so Engineering and Business degrees are pretty safe. After that it depends a lot more on what connections and opportunities you come across.\n\nMaybe don't work your first semester if you have the room in your budget, but if you do have to, try to work a campus job. Things like custodial or food court are usually pretty flexible and always looking for people, and work your way to more enjoyable or \"better\" jobs like being a TA when you can.\n\nOverall, college is better than high school because you get to be the master of your own fate (for better or worse). There are some classes I got poor grades in that were my own dang fault. But also some projects and classes I'm really proud of. You also start to get a picture of what your life in the adult, working world will be like and that's exciting to me. In high school, everything was about your \"permanent record\", now it's not about your permanent record, just your future, which is much more important. Where you'll work and live and interact with on a daily basis, and that's entirely up to you.",

      "text": "1. I personally liked being by myself for the first time. I love my parents and have had nothing but a good relationship with them, but I liked being by myself. Some people get homesick, that is normal, some do not, that is also normal.\n\n2. College can be very lonely. Don't become isolated, it is the easy route but very quickly it will become unbearably boring and lonely. Try everything possible to make at least acquaintances if not friends. Most college students are lonely too.\n\n3. Major in what you enjoy. Some say do a major that will lead to a well-paying/enjoyable job, but if you don't enjoy your major for-its-own-sake, not simply for the job, it will be a long 4 years.\n\n4. No majors are useless. Yes, on average engineering majors make more than philosophy majors, but this isn't guaranteed to be the case for each individual. I know philosophy majors who landed great jobs such as CIA analyst, Lawyer, and Diplomat, and engineering majors working retail. Major in what you enjoy. The top 25% of philosophy majors easily get paid more than the bottom 25% of engineering majors.\n\n5. The best way to support yourself through scholarships/grants. If in the USA, apply for FASFA, apply for all scholarships you are qualified for that you can find. If you get lucky, you could get a free ride scholarship or cobble together enough scholarships to be the equivalent of free ride. However, to avoid debt if scholarships don't work out, working part-time is possible (I even knew some who did full-time). Colleges often have on-campus jobs for just such an occasion.\n\n6. The only real study advice I can offer is do the work. Sometimes it might seem like a lot, but it is possible. That being said, also be good at knowing yourself. If you already know something, don't study it, you are better off devoting time to something you don't know. Participate in class, don't be afraid to use campus resources to help, and don't be afraid to visit professors during office hours for specific help.\n\n7. I know nothing about dorm life, my dorm was weird, so I can't comment on that.\n\n8. On top of the standard independence arguments about the difference between college and high school, college is where serious learning happens. High school is a lot of memorization, college involves much less. Disagree with your professor? Tell him your view and most professors are happy to be challenged, just be prepared to defend your opinion. Want to learn about something? The whole world is open to you and professors are more than happy to recommend books/articles on any subject. Want to participate in an archaeological dig abroad in Ireland over the summer, you can do that with no experience necessary! Esoteric subjects are all seen as relevant and important. Hobbies and bizarre interests are prized. I knew a Criminology major with a keen interest in Nuclear Weapons who went to Med School. There are few social cliques. The \"cool kid\" might be cool in high school, but in college they are seen as decidedly not-cool. The world is open to you to learn about anything, so take advantage of that.",
