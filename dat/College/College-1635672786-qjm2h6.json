  "text": "Hi guys\nI'm a 26 yo dude who has been a huge fan of space & astronomy for many years.\nI've wanted to pursue my studies in space engineering but i took another turn and studied accounting (currently sitting for my CPA exams in my country)\nWhy didn't I seek space engineering?\n2 reasons:\n1/ my country doesn't have universities that teach space engineering\n2/ going to study abroad would either cost a fortune or get a scholarship which i didn't have a chance at.\nBut I've been thinking, what if i would do crazy turn and seek my dream job? How hard would it be?\nMy main target would be studying in France but IDK if i'd be able to do it.\nWhat do you guys think?",
