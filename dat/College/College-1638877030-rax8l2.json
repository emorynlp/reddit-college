  "text": "Hi guys, I\u2019m supposed to graduate this weekend and finals are this week. I have all my credits and know I\u2019m passing all my major courses but i\u2019m worried about a class i\u2019m taking for my ECON minor. I took the final yesterday and don\u2019t feel to good about it. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering what will happen if I do fail the class? Will I not receive my diploma at all, or will they just remove the minor from my degree plan? I have a job lined up and it starts in January. I\u2019m worried that I may have to retake the class or something and lose my job offer.",
