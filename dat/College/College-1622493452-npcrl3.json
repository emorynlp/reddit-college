  "title:": "One of my favorite professors collapsed on exam day (May 28)",
  "text": "I remember everything. He was just at his computer and also working on stuff at his lectern. He looked kinda pale, but I thought nothing of it. Just as I was finishing the multiple choice questions, he collapsed and was holding his stomach. A couple of us ran over and tried to help. I\u2019ll never forget that scene. He was saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you guys.\u201d and other variations. I didn\u2019t hear what he was saying because I ran straight to security begging for help. \n\nOnce we got there, another prof told us the truth. He has pancreatic cancer and didn\u2019t want to admit it. He\u2019s 63, and pretty healthy. It kinda makes sense because he kept adjusting his suit jacket while teaching because he was developing stomach bloating. It\u2019s been on my mind ever since. I\u2019ll hopefully see him in the morning. \n\nHas anyone ever dealt with this? I\u2019m scheduled to have him next semester. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be teaching",

      "text": "Last school year I took physics I with a professor that was pretty goofy. You woulda thought he was a janitor and not a professor tbh, from the way he dressed to the way he talked. You could tell he lived an interesting life before he decided to go back to school for physics. We got tight because I felt a little like an outsider to all of the STEM students and I could tell he felt like an outsider with all the STEM professors.\n\nI ended up taking physics II with him the next semester (spring 2020). The weeks leading up to spring break I could tell his health was going a little downhill and he was talking to me differently. Pretty much told me he was dying. Idk who knew but it seemed like I was one of the only people he had told. The last thing I said to him was \u201csee ya in a week\u201d as I turned my exam in and left for spring break.\n\nCOVID got real halfway through that week and we never came back from spring break. 2 weeks later online classes started and he couldn\u2019t keep up since he hardly ever used technology. He passed away a week into online classes. Only\nProf I\u2019ve really connected with. Miss ya Bill",

      "text": "I had a professor last fall who was 96. WW2 vet, top of his field. \n\nIt was kind of unfortunate that this class was via Zoom, because all faculty was struggling with this online thing but him in particular. His lectures were great, but he didn\u2019t grade any assignments. I went into the final having literally no idea if I was passing or not. Ultimately, the department took over our class and our assignments were split up and graded among other faculty. \n\nHe got sick towards the end of the semester. At 96, I felt bad that his final days teaching were spent on Zoom and that he would likely die with the world looking like this. He seems to have rebounded from his health issues, but they\u2019re not longer allowing him to teach full courses. He\u2019s been given a public lecture series this coming fall, but I doubt many students will attend the lectures of a 97 year old man for fun.",

Hugs for him and for all of his students too!\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t end up teaching next semester, do try to keep in touch with him! It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big - just a hi email every now and then is huge when you\u2019re Dealing With Stuff. If he doesn\u2019t respond, or not right away, keep doing it anyway (it\u2019s appreciated!); sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what to say for the receiver too, and sometimes answering notes would just take more energy than he might have. \n\nUnfortunately this kind of thing happens the other way around, too - I had a student who I saw on a Friday and then she was just *gone.* Accident over Memorial Day weekend, never saw her again. There have also been a couple of more minor collapsed-in-class incidents, too: twice now I think I\u2019ve had kids just pass out (and admittedly I was that kid once when I was an undergrad), somebody else had a seizure, handful of people with panic attacks, etc. Now that I\u2019m tallying it up it\u2019s actually been quite a few, geez. \n\nI got lucky with my own profs, I guess? My primary music faculty were three for three on Dumb Dude Accidents (slipped on ice and dislocated a shoulder, did something suspiciously vague and screwed up a knee, stepped off the podium wrong and ended up with a cane for a couple weeks), but fortunately never any sort of long-term or potentially deadly illness.",

He was one of those interesting people you kind of admire in the sense that you could tell he was over qualified, & extremely smart but had a pretty humble life just teaching college kids. \n\nOne day we were told there was an emergency so he wasn\u2019t available, got appointed to a new professor w/ an extension to drop the class. Found out he passed away a few days later. \n\nPretty different from your post, but that\u2019s the first thing I thought of. \n\nHis passing felt so random and it conflating w/ everything returning to normal so fast made me google information about the guy, and I was down a hole of thinking his life should have been more than what it seemed. Idk why I was so centered on finding answers when there was no question to begin with. \n\nMy b for the randomness, hope your Prof is alright.",

I had a realization probably around my sophmore/junior year and thought about how students we get sick pretty often in a semester things happen. And had a realization professors aren't any different. They're still human like us and get sick, but I noticed most don't take off at all during the semester or much at all. Considering how most professors are treated it's a poor system that doesn't promote healthy lives similar to students. Hopefully your professor can rest possibly retire with the time he has left.",

There's nothing like the flow that comes from a good time with your students. It's been the only thing, actually, that's gotten me through times of depression and suicidal ideation.\n\nI've struggled with disclosing tough things to my students. On the one hand, I want to be honest with them and model what it is to be human. On the other hand, I don't want to burden them with worry, nor do I want to break the illusion of that drug-feeling. I can leave whatever is bothering me outside the classroom and be someone else in it--someone knowledgeable, patient, and fun, someone who wears cool outfits, someone selfless who my students might even look up to. Someone healthy. The best version of myself. \n\nI can't imagine what it's like having cancer, but I can imagine your professor wouldn't want you to worry too much. Of course, it's good to worry about people we like, and to take time to sit with your feelings. You might thing about what, if anything, would make you feel good to do.\n\nMaybe writing your teacher a card, like others have suggested?",

I\u2019ve also been around when people have had heart attacks in restaurants and such. Unfortunately poor health is something that comes with age and there is really not much more that you can do that be prepared in case thing like this do happen. Look into cpr certification and first aid classes if it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. Now it\u2019s probably best if you just offer your support, maybe send him an email wishing him well and telling him how much you enjoy his class",
