On top of that, I have one B-, one B+, and only one A.\n\nI'm just a big waste of my parents' money and space.\n\nLiterally I don't even have to worry about student loans, since my parents are paying for everything. But despite my privilege, I still haven't accomplished jack shit in my life.\n\nWhy am I even alive? Honestly.",

      "text": "Freshman year is probably the hardest if I am honest. There is a lot of change happening at once. It was smart of you to drop the courses you were not going to pass. Your grades are actually really good. It is hard in college to gets A's and B's most times, but you still did it. Look on the plus side man, you get to pass those classes and you didnt have to tank your GPA. Once you get a break for winter I am sure you'll feel better, as being removed from it for a bit often helps with anxiety.",
