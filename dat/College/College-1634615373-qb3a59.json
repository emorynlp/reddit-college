  "text": "So, I'm taking Anatomy online and I failed my first lab exam due to technical difficulties. I asked the professor if I could do a makeup test, but he sadly denied my request. So, I have a D (67%) in the class now and I believe it ends on 12/15. There's 4 exams left (2 lecture, 2 lab). The lecture exams are worth 28% of my grade and the labs 28.8%. Do you think I could still pass the class with a B by 12/15? Will I need to get good scores from here on out?",
