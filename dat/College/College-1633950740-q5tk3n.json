  "title:": "Terrible Roomate abusing our room",
  "text": "I need help. My roomate is just not good and I don\u2019t really know what to do or how to handle it. I could list many things he does but it\u2019ll sound petty, it\u2019s the accumulation of these small things that just make my experience so much worse. For instance, he takes my snacks, doesn\u2019t let my friends in the room but always has his own friends inside, leaves messes all over the room, uses my storage for his own things. I bought an Xbox and he uses it and doesn\u2019t really give me a chance to use it. He has friends over when I\u2019m trying to sleep. He uses my trash can for his own trash expecting me to take it out. It\u2019s infuriating to me but I don\u2019t want to have a conversation where tension is created between us, living in a hostile environment is really not what I\u2019m aiming for. I\u2019m sure people have worse roomates, I\u2019m not trying to sound like mine is the worst, but it\u2019s just so annoying.",

      "text": "Dude you really should not be having to put up with all that.. I think you've been too nice and unproblematic so he thinks he can walk over you like that but damn, even if you are nice and dont want any problems you still have your boundaries and u should try to make that very clear to yourself and then to your roommate. Its not gonna be easy and he may reaaally not like it but theres no other way if you don't want to just move out. \n\nP.s. confront to him that its a two way street if he still doesnt respect your boundaries, and start acting like he does no matter he \"lets\" you or not (seriously wtf) if hes not a total ahole he'll understand but if he is, u gotta make a drastic change in your life man... wish you all the luck and try not to ever let anyone disrespect your efforts like that for your own good",
