  "text": "I\u2019m graduating in the spring and want grad photos, obviously. I\u2019d like some solo ones as well as some with my friends\u2014 the issue is I do have friends but they\u2019re scattered around and aren\u2019t really friends with each other (ie all my pics would be just me or with one/two others; I have no one to take the cute group photos with).\n\nmy impression (from prom) is you pay a photographer to take group + individual photos all together, and you split the cost. I could hire a photographer to follow me around all day but that's expensive + it would be hard to get everyone free on the same day. also I don\u2019t think individual people would chip in money to *just* take a pic with me so I think if I were to share the cost it would have to be an actual group. I could try to just make a giant group chat with all my friends and let them add their satellite friends and see if we can arrange dates + payment through that (but I imagine about half or more would have their own friend group that they\u2019d prefer to contribute $$ to than my franken-group)  highly open to any other smart suggestions. even if I don\u2019t get a photographer for group photos and just get a stranger to get them on my phone, I don\u2019t know how to work everyone out on the same day (or is it normal to wear your outfit + sash on multiple days if you want a lot of pics?)\n\nTIA!\n\ntl;dr how to get a group together for grad pics if all your friends are individuals, some of whom have their own groups",
