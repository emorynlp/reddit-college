  "title:": "Failing 2 major classes early in the year as a Freshman",
  "text": "I\u2019m now concerned. I\u2019m failing both my Chemistry and Bio classes because of my poor time management, and study habits I never developed in High School. It\u2019s been 6 weeks into my classes and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t end my academic year with a 3.0.\n\nDo I still have time? What can I do? The problem with falling behind early in the year is that i have to catch up with the material, and it\u2019s a lot.\n\nI just feel like the stress of being by myself for once is finally going away but it took me so long. I\u2019m finally getting settled but I\u2019m failing my classes now. All I can think about it crying now lol",

      "text": "You have time but you\u2019ll have to buckle down and learn to study. \n\nGet an academic planner or find a calendar app you like - write down every single assignment and test you have this semester. Color coordinate each class if you like. \n\nMake a plan at the beginning of each week for what needs to be done and then add in extra time to study, do practice problems, and ask for help during office hours. Make a schedule of what you\u2019re behind in and work everyday to build a strong foundation and get through that material as fast as you can so you stay caught up when you get there. \n\nI also didn\u2019t really learn how to study in high school, by the time I got to some higher level classes I was struggling a bit, but you can do it! Find a quiet place, find some music that isn\u2019t distracting and get to work. Do a little bit everyday so it doesn\u2019t overwhelm you cone exam time. \n\nStudying can look like:\n-practice problems for math/science classes\n\n-reading the textbook for most classes\n\n-making flash cards and testing yourself\n\n-redoing old test and quiz questions you missed\n\n-working with a friend and quizzing each other \n\n-answering questions in the textbook \n\n-reviewing old homework \n\n-rewriting your class note by hand",
