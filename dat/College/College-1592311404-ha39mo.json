  "text": "For me, I\u2019d say: \n\nEvery roommate has a small, petty habit that gets on your nerves. And yes, you probably have one that gets on their nerves, too, they just don\u2019t tell you. It could be something like they put their calls on speaker or never leave the dorm except for class. In my experience, I had a roommate who would always lock the door into our bedroom because she was scared we\u2019d get robbed. Our room was a suite with three rooms: the kitchen/living room and two bedrooms, and the front door. This got kind of annoying at times because I\u2019d always have to get my keys from off the counter after putting them down. And one morning, I was half asleep and needed to use the bathroom so I got locked out of my bedroom because I didn\u2019t realize she locked the door. This is coming from somebody with anxiety disorder who worries about safety to an ungodly degree, it was annoying, and our school is in a bad area, so you better believe it\u2019s well guarded. Because of this, there\u2019d be times when she\u2019d lock herself out and make me stop what I was doing on campus to go open the door, as you only got three free tries from security before they fined you. \n\nBut it\u2019s a small petty habit like that, who gives a shit? You\u2019re allowed to be annoyed but your roommates are going to have that. If it\u2019s something like they go through your clothes without permission or make you uncomfortable, then tell an RA.",

      "text": "If your school has a questionnaire to put people together, DON'T LIE ON IT.\n\nMy school uses questionnaires for freshmen to fill out so they can match like-minded freshmen. All of my roommates were great: relatively clean, super nice, we became great friends...except for one of them. This dude was an asshole all semester. From starting fights with us, to filming our friends to gossip about them later, to trying to meddle in our relationships, to keeping our apartment a disaster (I could go on) he was literally the only one causing any issues all year, and it dampened the whole experience. Finally a few months in (and in a much-needed RA meeting) he admitted he lied on the questionnaire about the fact that he's fine with sharing space and wound up living in the dorm that fits the most people per space on campus. He was an asshole overall, but if he had been honest and just gotten his own room (he loved bragging about his money/expensive things so we're sure he could afford it) it wouldn't have been nearly as bad. \n\nIn short: Residence Life people won't hate you for being honest, your roommates will once they realize that you totally lied about who you are and how you live.",

Dorm rooms get broken into all the time, and sometimes what happens is worse than just getting some stuff taken. Just a warning. \n\nAnyway, the number one thing I've seen is people not liking is that their roomate has their SO over too often. If they're spending the night, or quite frankly laying next to you in bed, you've crossed a line with most people. \n\nBesides that, just don't be a dick.\n\nAnd if you do have a concern, just tell your RA. That's a lot of the reason we're there, we can usually handle the situation a lot better than you could yourself, and at least for the RA's I know, it makes us feel like we're doing some good.",

A lot of colleges require roommate agreements, and you can totally gripe about them to be not seen as an uptight rule follower, but they\u2019re actually really helpful. Don\u2019t expect to hate or be best friends with your roommate\u2014you should expect to have a fair and reasonable relationship, because that\u2019s what you deserve and if you\u2019re not getting that you should intervene, but everyone\u2019s feelings get hurt if you expect to be close friends. Sometimes you will be, but most people aren\u2019t. Ask before you do something that affects your roommate (mostly in the beginning\u2014you want to ask obvious questions now so you\u2019re used to each other\u2019s habits later). Some major areas of content you should talk about: having guests (sexual or not) over, how each other\u2019s items should be treated, how you each prefer shared spaces be kept, how much both of you care about rules, cleanliness expectations. Most of all: \u201chow do you want to talk about it if we\u2019re having a disagreement?\u201d Just going through the motions of asking consent in the beginning will establish that you care about your roommate as a human being with preferences over the space just like you have, and will do so much to prevent the uncomfortable fights that are so common in dorms.",

So have plans to spend time outside your room because if everything you do surrounds the idea of being in your room and you and your roommate can\u2019t be in the same page then the experience forming won\u2019t be what you envision. Luckily me and my roommate got along very well and we both had the same ideas and personal ideals for our dorm.

If you're going with a random roommate, they probably come from a completely different background and have completely different ways of doing some things, and sometimes being open to trying things their way can make you closer and help you get more out of the dorming experience. I went into college with rigid expectations for myself and specific habits that I planned on keeping. My roommate was super spontaneous and a little on the messy side. She helped me let my guard down and unlock my inner crackhead, and I am having a great time at college in part thanks to ideas I got from her and tied into my own life.\n\nYou don't have to become best buddies with your roommate or transform completely but understand that you're not always gonna be right about things. Good listening and open mindedness are key to the start of a great friendship or at least a civil roommate relationship.",

She would remind me to take my birth control, remind me to bring my room key with me when I left, would randomly ask if my work schedule changed (she really liked knowing my schedule), would ask where I had been if I came home late like she's my fucking mom, and wrote her name on the bottom of MY rug. This happened a in the span of like 2 months or so. As you can assume I was super miserable and ended up moving out. I didn't tell her (I didn't have to and I hated her) and her mom ended up calling my mom, like we're fucking 10.

      "text": "I think that my number one tip is to communicate **in person** with your roommate. My first roommate would always act okay in person when she was around, but would always leave super passive-aggressive notes laying around for me to read. This all culminated in her sending me a text requesting me to take showers at night bc I would always blow-dry my hair at like 8:15 in the morning and it would wake her up (I also gotta mention here that she had a class at like 8:30 so idk how she got to class on time). \n\nThe text had super happy emojis littered in it so I didn't think it was that big of a deal, so I told her no. She totally went off and texted back saying that she was going to tell the RA and have us meet with her to solve this problem. She never bothered to talk to me in person about this until the meeting with the RA when she told me that she wanted to move out. During this meeting, she also brought up a ton of problems that she never mentioned to me before so yeah. I don't know if talking in person would have prevented the situation from happening, but it would've improved it. \n\nOnly communicating with your roommate via notes and texts is super shitty, and it shows that you still gotta grow up. It's been like four years since that happened but I still get nervous about having roommates because of her lol. In-person communication is key, or just spend the extra money to have your own room. I noticed that my college experience got better once I had my own space but that's just me I guess lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Made it easier to read",

When you come back from a busy day or a hard class, it's really nice to have a space that feels like your own. \n\nMy freshman roommate was not my friend, and she was horribly messy. Luckily she kept it contained to her side but it made me appreciate my own side because I was very clean.\n\nHaving a coordinated space with your roommate is fun and all, but it will feel like a drag after a while. After all, your dorm is kind of the only place on campus that is private and away from the bustle. \n\nDon't let your roommate control what you put on your walls for example. If you want posters from your favorite video games or whatever, do it!! If you want your own artwork up, do that! If you want a tapestry and string lights, go crazy! But do not let your roommate dictate how you should decorate. Just because they want string lights on every wall doesn't mean you have to give in if you don't want that.

We bought a fridge, microwave, a rice cooker, pots, pans, plates, a whole pantry, plants, holiday decorations, etc. All of this made our dorm feel homey, saved us TONS of money in food and even tho it was crammed, it allowed us to interact with people from our suite/ other floors because they said it felt \u201cwelcoming\u201d. Most of my fun memories involve random people stopping by my room (always kept the door open), chilling, and eventually becoming super close, cooking a random dish at midnight while we studied for finals, or having more seating for people to gossip in.",

      "text": "My advice is to set very clear boundaries at the very beginning. I did not do this and I never spoke up about anything my roommate did, so she began to quickly take advantage of me and my laid back attitude. First she would have guys over all the time and not tell me and just lock me out of the dorm. Then she\u2019d ask me to not come back at certain times of the day so she could have her guys over. Next she started dating one of these guys and have him over ALL the time, in between every class, before every meal, late at night, and then sleeping over without ever asking if I was ok with it. \n\nAt the start of the new semester, I finally told her I needed her to ask permission before she wanted to have him sleepover because it became disruptive to my sleep. The ONE time I told her no, she snuck him in the dorm in the middle of the night and I had to kick him out and have a long talk with her. She was really mad at me because she didn\u2019t like that I was in the room when the two of them were there despite the fact I always was out when she asked for time alone with him... and the fact that he quite literally lived with us. The rest of the semester we ended up not talking to each other at all unless it was about breaks or moving out at the end of the year. \n\nI learned a valuable lesson which is that you need to at least have a casual conversation with your roommate about what you\u2019re cool with and not cool with right from the start. There may be little things they do that annoys you here and there, but you can\u2019t let the big things go. I ended up having a horrible second semester because I was too worried about what she\u2019d think if I asked for us to make some rules about when people could come over, how long, and how often.",

I wash my dishes within a day of using them. My roommate is fine with leaving them in for a week if he doesn't have to use anything in there. \n\nI waited too long to come up with rules and had to learn about all of his bad habits the hard way. We're not really friends or anything so it's just awkward to bring it up at this point and I prefer our bond to stay neutral like it is now, rather than turn hostile because I have to point out every pet peeve. The result of my attitude however, is a shared kitchen, toilet, and bathroom that are almost never clean. Yesterday some friends of mine were staying over and wanted to take a shower before bed. When they walked into the bathroom a bunch of hair was just scattered all over the wall. It was fucking disgusting and embarrassing. Don't be afraid to point out these things because they will not change if you don't!",

The new one I got started out fine but we were too freaking different and she wouldn\u2019t let me get sleep or even eat in my own dorm, no matter how many times I told her to stop. I eventually got my own room, but damage was done. \n\nI went to a new school, and I got a suite. At first, one of our roommates opted out, but the three of us got along. But on the second day of school, we got a new roommate, as her dorm was full of mold and her mom was an administrator so she basically got to choose. We started off as friends, but she quickly became a burden and a pain. Because I had to work full time and because my roommates were either chill or afraid of their own shadow, she basically overpowered them and told us what to do. Let me put it this way: she invited a guy over to watch movies and then have sex, and he had a towel with his snake sticking up. Also it\u2019s important to the story that me and said kid had chemistry but didn\u2019t date, we were just friendly. Next week he was over, I walked out of the bathroom with a towel because since he did I thought it was ok. About a week or two later, I was told I couldn\u2019t do that in front of guests.",

Luxuries like cooking your own meal, taking a crap in peace, or taking a shower without the person in the next stall singing and blasting music are simple luxuries you'll most likely miss throughout your first year (if you have a dorm like mine was) but that makes going home all the more enjoyable and finding an apartment or other housing option next year more special. \n\nI won't say its very likely you'll get a bad roommate, but if you do, try to talk to housing staff and try to work out a deal so you can get a new roommate or move rooms. I had pretty great roommates for both semesters of my freshman year so I didn't have many problems with them. Some nights we would unknowingly stay up late just talking, and those night were really special. \n\nLiving conditions and roommates aside, living in a dorm helps you sort out the housing situation you want when you live on your own, it provides you resources and opportunities you won't get if you choose to live elsewhere, and there may be special events going on in the dorm that provide you way to get connected with other dorm residents and professors.",

I live in a pretty safe city, but I do have to be careful at all times because I'm a 5'2 XXS girl with the strength of a hamster. \n\nI go to the toilet in weird places all the time. Most of my lectures are in a huge building and the 'main' toilets are crowded and gross. There's a queue all the time as well. At the end of that hallway is another toilet, hidden away in a little corner (it might be a staff toilet, but there's no sign or anything) and I use it all the time. I love walking past that disgusting, busy toilet and seeing a 10 people queue and just walking 100 metres and being able to shit in peace in a nice, clean stall.",

As someone who becomes suicidal after any stressful event like that or even minor inconveniences, please hang on. The whole world is kind of on pause and everyone has no idea what they are doing. I\u2019ve seen a lot of death lately and I can promise you the amount of suffering that will be brought upon others isn\u2019t worth it. That\u2019s the only thing that keeps me from doing it - because I often feel like I suffer so much it wouldn\u2019t matter to them, but it would. Coming to a point where the suffering eases can take time and commitment. I\u2019ve come out from being suicidal for three years. I know what it is like to be going about your day and have those thoughts like, \u201cif this little thing doesn\u2019t end up okay that\u2019s it I\u2019m ending it.\u201d Every time you make it past that, you are going against the resistance within yourself. Revealing your strength, your ability to keep going. You are valuable and worthy of giving yourself another chance. Try to find some healthy coping mechanisms for the time being. When I became psychotic I would paint everyday and lately I\u2019ve been teaching myself to skateboard. Sometimes distraction is key. I wish you the best. If you want to talk to someone further you can always PM me on here I\u2019m glad to talk.",

I went there and the room was atrocious and disgusting: garbage everywhere, it smelled like sex, there were empty vodka bottles everywhere, etc. It was a sanitation police\u2019s wet dream. And I found she stole my tv because hers broke, and my roommates got angry at me about this. \n\nA few weeks later she called me and had the gall to get mad at me for making a small ding (like an inch big not even) in the wall when I tried to get my picture off. Like you messed up my room and went through my shit and you\u2019re mad about that? And I\u2019ve been in such a situation like that before: if it\u2019s an inch big, nobody really gives a shit.",
