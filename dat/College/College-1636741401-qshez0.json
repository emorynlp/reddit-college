  "text": "Okay so I know what you are going to say \u201c it really depends on what you want to do.\u201d But I\u2019m just going to college to get a degree that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not interested in any of the degrees my college offers but want a degree for higher pay. I feel like once I get done I would have wasted my time cause I studied for a degree I\u2019m not going to use. \n\nI want a life for myself but not sure where to go. What are your experiences with college and how has it affected your life?",
