  "text": "This is literally so stupid. I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of shit these past few weeks and have been feeling absolutely terrible (my grandpa whom I am close to got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer - I won\u2019t go into details). Anyway, as you can imagine that threw me off my game and I haven\u2019t been able to focus as much in school (I\u2019m on a scholarship). \n\nBasically I\u2019ve emailed like 3 professors explaining that due to some sensitive issues I\u2019ve been having trouble attending and with schoolwork and none of them replied. I\u2019m especially worried about one I sent 2 days ago where I\u2019m explaining why I can\u2019t present something today - it\u2019s actually not that serious of an assignment and could be done later but I would really like to know if everything\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve tested my email so it couldn\u2019t be because of it.\n\nDo uni professors literally never check their emails? This is bullshit. To be fair I did ask one professor once if we could send him emails regarding things we didn\u2019t understand and he said responding to emails is a \u201cdrag\u201d, so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting\u2026",

          "text": "For 2 of them I actually sent them an email on Monday regarding making up some lost attendances on Friday. I definitely don\u2019t think I was being unreasonable for these ones - and yes, I was expecting an answer to see if that\u2019s possible at all.\n\nAlso, my university is full online and my professors don\u2019t have \u201coffice hours\u201d. The only way to contact them is via mail. Even if I asked for a meeting to explain everything, they wouldn\u2019t see it because they\u2019re too lazy to respond - and I didn\u2019t plan on my grandpa having cancer, so I didn\u2019t even get the chance to ask for a meeting during the lesson. I don\u2019t care that they feel like responding to emails is a drag when it\u2019s literally the only way we can communicate with them. That\u2019s just bullshit. \n\nAs far as my extension goes, I agree it was last-minute because I genuinely forgot - but I definitely didn\u2019t deserve to be called a slack when I literally did every single assignment perfectly & on time for the past 2 years - it just happened today, which is why it\u2019s not mentioned in the post. This just shows how oblivious she is to students\u2019 effort. Not to mention the reason we are behind and she was so panicked about that is because she didn\u2019t hold the seminar last week also because of some personal issues - she\u2019s the only one allowed to have them, apparently\u2026",

I know right now it probably seems like they don't give a fuck and could care less about your problems but I think assuming that is dangerous. \n\nI think expecting shit behavior out of your professors may put you in a position to come off to them a certain way that would probably affect their willingness to respond. \n\nLook through their syllabus. They usually contain parts for this kind of thing. You may have to get an extension through the college, not your professors, for these things.",

I\u2019m sure I sound like an absolutely edgy asshole, but most professors do nothing to assist students and as someone who has always given their all to school I really feel like all my efforts have been in vain and my work was never appreciated. \n\nI might not sound like it but I am actually a nice person and I totally understand where my prof is coming from - but I still think calling me a slack is unprofessional and unnecessary. She obviously only wanted to make me feel like shit or was projecting her own frustrations on me\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for much: just to be respected the same way I respect them, extension given or not. Frankly, I don\u2019t care whether I get it or not anymore. How would you, or anyone feel being called out and insulted in the front of the whole class in uni, on top of other huge personal issues? Shit, we\u2019re not in 2nd grade anymore. We should be more considerate of others, which is something we did for her when she didn\u2019t hold the lecture due to her own personal issues. And she should\u2019ve accounted for that lost progress, not blame others. I have also never given her a reason not to believe me, and negating others\u2019 feelings is the shittiest thing you can possibly do to someone. \n\nI must sound crazy for giving so much attention to this, but this really was my last straw.\n\nI hope nobody will ever bump into my kind of professors. You can only see the best in people for so long, but when they never give you any reasons to do that, it becomes much harder.\n\nAny anger that might sound like it\u2019s directed towards your response, I can assure you it\u2019s not. This is mostly just venting.",

                      "text": "Yeah, I hear you. I hate when that stuff happens. Like all things, take it as a learning experience. \n\nI think in certain circumstances, if a professor was willing to make comments like that, it's equally important to push back a slight bit to make them consider what they said. \n\nI learned to stand up for myself after being walked over by all the jobs I'd held before coming back to school. They'd not let me take more than a day off at a time regardless if I had the time or not. I got so fucking tired of these people telling me no when I needed time off. \n\nNow, when people do these things to me, I always make sure to get one more transaction out of them. It's easy for people to say things like that and get away with it. A single rebuttal makes them rethink their actions pretty strongly. It doesn't have to be crass or mean, it just has to be there. In the example of them calling you a slack, there's always an opportunity to keep that conversation going longer than they wanted. Be inquisitive and polite and ask why. State your positions well and force them to hold that conversation. A 1 way conversation will always be the easiest for that kind of behavior. Most of the time, any little blip in the radar can stop them from doing it again. \n\nYou're allowed to speak up against stuff like that. Just know that your college expects you to act in a certain professional way and going outside of that can cause problems. Respond respectfully and professionally yet stern. \n\nAnymore, I love sending shit right back to people who deal it. I put the ball in their court and do what I need to do. It takes more than \"we can't give you two days off in a row\" for me to stop trying to get it.",

Even with the more responsive ones, some take a few business days, or some forget to respond here and there. It's frustrating, especially if you can't tell if someone has seen your email.\n\n\nThe only suggestion besides following up that I can think of is this: was there a specific ask you were making? If it's something where you need an answer (ie, asking for an extension or excused absences) it's definitely something you'd want to follow up with or ask them in person. If it's just giving them a heads up, it's possible that some of them don't see a need to respond. A \"thanks for letting me know\" would obviously be better for you, but some profs unfortunately won't give you that. \n\n\nBest of luck, and I hope things cool off for you soon. At least where I am, the holidays are in sight, so hopefully you can have some time to decompress.",
