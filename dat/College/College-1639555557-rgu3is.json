          "text": "Yeah, I\u2019d likely finish on time. It\u2019s just that in double majoring at my college you have two separate advisers which you have to meet with at least once a semester. Which can be difficult finding time for and by delaying my commitment I wouldn\u2019t have to meet with them. I\u2019d just have to be careful making sure I was getting things done properly.",

      "text": "Anytime. Probably the sooner the better though. You can always decide to change your major or drop it. At least declare a minor for now. \n\nBut for what it\u2019s worth, I declared mine just before my sixth semester. (I declared it as a minor before my second semester). I\u2019m graduating on time. My majors are completely different (humanities versus sciences). Before I declared my double major I was setting up my courses myself with the idea it would maybe be a double major. It mostly worked out. I only messed up on one requirement but I was able to petition to have it count. But I think unless you\u2019re very familiar with how the major works and the major is flexible you should probably get help from an advisor (in my case, my major was easy to find and follow, my dad is a professor in the department for my second major, and my second major is already a very flexible major without a lot of specific requirements).",
