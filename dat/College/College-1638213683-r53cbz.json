  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m currently studying at community college majoring in Physics but I\u2019m planning to transfer and taking Biomed Engr. A lot of people have told me that having a study group would really help me but I don\u2019t know how to find one. My friends are not that academically inclined and I don\u2019t know much people in school since it\u2019s my first year. So what is the best way to find a study group?",

      "text": "Whatever class you need help in, arrive before the lecture and suggest to your professor that study groups should be formed for those that would like to. The professor would most likely be more than happy to announce it sometime during class. Then have the interested students meet in the hallway after class to exchange info and schedule a weekly meeting time.\nMaybe you college has a tutoring program that you can sign up for too.",

      "text": "Office hours. If someone is at office hours, they are one of two kinds of people. 1) really struggling with the class (and therefore open to a study group) or 2) want to make sure they're doing things right with the TA (and therefore would probably enjoy someone to bounce ideas off of). Show up there, listen when someone asks a question to the TA, go over there and listen in or offer and explanation. Or if the TA is super swamped, just start talking to people who look like they have a question, or maybe even just ask a question yourself, even if you're not that stumped. It breaks down the barrier and gets the conversation going.",
