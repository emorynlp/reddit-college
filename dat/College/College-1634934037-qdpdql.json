  "text": "haven\u2019t been doing actual \u201cplans\u201d with people in weeks \n\n\nI am behind in my classes (100% my fault), and the work in itself takes me an incredibly long time to finish. School has always been very challenging for me \n\n\nI have a test next week, and am more behind that I\u2019d like to admit. **i already failed this class twice**and am scared to mess up \n\n\nI made plans with my sister today but she could tell how stressed I was about my classes so she said it was fine if I couldn\u2019t go (we were going with her bf too so i didn\u2019t leave her alone). \n\n\nI said yeah if you don\u2019t mind I have to go to the library and study. She said it\u2019s fine she\u2019ll just never invite anyone anywhere again. \n\n\nNow I feel bad and am not sure if I made the right choice \n\n\nWhat do you think? I feel bad cause I know my sister is depressed (not because of this, In general), and I was excited to do this since I know she was looking foward to us hanging out outside of our house\n\n\nI\u2019ve even been needing money and was planning to get my plasma drawn but haven\u2019t went because I can\u2019t fit it into my schedule\u2026 and I literally need the money",
