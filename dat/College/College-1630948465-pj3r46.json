The other 1% are either extremely smart and dedicated (i.e. scholarships to Harvard or Yale) or they just have the TV American dream in their head (plus rich parents). \n\nYou're more likely to see an Australian go over there for student exchange (usually around 3-6 months) - but even that's rare. \n\nBut if I had to guess, I'd say you'd probably find us in:\n\n1) New York City  - mainly due to tourism \n\n2) California - mainly due to tourism + weather\n\n3) Arizona, Texas, Florida - mainly due to weather \n\n4) Wherever the elite, populated universities are located - you're bound to find some of us. \n\nAs for myself, I went to ASU for like around 6 months - met a few Australians who were there for the exact same reason. Never found an Australian who actually moved there to study from start-to-finish.",

          "text": "Possums are the most common (**not** opossums), but depending where you are you might see kookaburras, kangaroos, koalas, wombats, echidnas, and platypuses (kinda rare)\n\nI'd never seen squirrels, foxes, badgers, or snow before I moved to the UK!\n\nBut yeah, kangaroos are boring. And dangerous. If they're feeling aggressive, they can disembowel you pretty quickly. They're not *as* common as squirrels though, I guess because they're so large and can't live up a tree.",
