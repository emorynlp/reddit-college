  "title:": "Should I transfer or bite the bullet?",
  "text": "I am currently a sophomore at a very small liberal arts school (about 1600 students) and I am a chemistry major. \n\nStarting college in COVID was incredibly isolating and created a situation where you didn't make friends unless you were actively breaking the rules, which I was not a huge fan of. Since then, friend groups formed and I ended up losing about half of my friend group over a variety of different things. Thankfully, I kept a few good friends close and have a small support system as of right now, about three people. \n\nI tried to join a sorority to branch out and make more friends, but that pretty much just ended up in a hazing trial, and obviously, the last thing I want to do now is associate with anyone in that particular org.\n\nMy roommate and best friend stuck with the sorority and I did not so I barely see her anymore. One of my closest friends plans to study abroad and I am growing increasingly unhappy about my social life on campus. It's already difficult enough to branch out and meet new people with taking Genetics and Ochem at the same time and all of the studying these classes entail, so I'm growing increasingly hopeless in that regard.  \n\nI find myself craving a fresh start somewhere where a decent portion of the campus didn't haze me or didn't backstab me at one point or another. Obviously, the first thing I thought of was transferring to a bigger school where I can try again. \n\nHowever, one thing is holding me back: the education and opportunities I am receiving here. I am incredibly close with a lot of the professors in my major and I have incredible research opportunities here with collaborations with well-known schools. I got a really nice opportunity to work over winter break at a big corporation and get some hands on experience. I find myself holding back from transferring because of the connections I've made with the incredible faculty on this campus and I am afraid I will lose the opportunity to get these intimate experiences if I transfer to a bigger school. \n\nThe school I look to most is about 10x larger than mine currently. There are other schools I am considering but this one is the closest and cheapest alternative. \n\nSo...r/college...what should I do?",
