  "text": "So I just finished my last exam for a subject and I feel gutted after skipping alot of questions due to lack of time. I know that I should move forward and continue studying for my other exams but I keep trying to guess my overall grade and it's very stressing. Anyone else in a similar boat?",

But even if it does happen again, accept it, get chicken nuggets, and work harder for the next one.",
