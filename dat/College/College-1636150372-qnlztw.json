I'm not sociable person and I'm afraid of heights so that wasn't really a fit anyway. \n\nGot a job at a factory same day. Worked there until October. Got a job as a network engineer at a dying telecom company. \n\nConstant fear of layoffs, petty corporate rules about dress code, constant time monitoring. \n\nApplied to grad school and quit. I'm now about to have a PhD and graduate in May. \n\nHopefully I don't have to work as a roof salesman.\n\nEdit: unless you're from a top school, don't expect to get a well paying job in your field unless you go to grad school. Colleges turn out way more graduates than the economy needs.",

      "text": "graduated in 2018, struggled the first year. BA in history minors in business and computer science. Also needed a break tbh but ultimately got into \"gig work\" which amounted to a survey to see if a product was in store, good experience etc. I made $4k in 2019 in seeing if I get carded for buying cigarettes (never smoked in my life).\n\nEnd of 2019, got a internship thinking it would be until may 2020 then crap hit the fan with director having stage 4 colon cancer then pandemic, new guy and by the time new guy and the pandemic they extended it to end of 2020 (no raise).\n\nThen 2021, worked more side jobs but I mid 2020 got a vendor job at walmart. I have had a lot of serious home stuff in 2021 (worse then 2020) but at the same time, I found more auditing employment (built on 2019 experience) but now I am back in college getting my cpa license (or close to it). so I have 7 more classes to go for that.\n\nSo hopefully 2022 is full time job, reality if I married a guy who is a bit settled (I am 27 for reference), with everything else, I might be ok with low-key no full time job but continue on with what I got, but I travel so much in my area. so 500 miles a week easily. I am exhausted but its slow and steady.\n\nI use all my degrees but have to finish projects and build on what I got and that's the issue.",

      "text": "Graduated right at the start of the Great Recession. A friend worked for a government contractor who was in the progress of renewing their contact. The new contract would have created a few additional openings, one of which was promised to me. Needless to say, their bid was not accepted and they lost the contract.\n\nSo, I decided to go to graduate school and wait out economic downturn. During my last semester I sent out a few thousand (literally) applications and ended up being hired by a Fortune 10 company. Worked there for several years only to see my job be outsourced. Was hired a few months later by another Fortune 10 company where I worked for several years before I accepted a job with different Fortune 10 company (where I work today).\n\nYeah, I consider it a success. My current annual compensation exceeds the combined earnings of my parents and siblings. No, I do not live in a HCOL location.",
