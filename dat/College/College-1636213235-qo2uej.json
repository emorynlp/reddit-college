  "title:": "How To Wake Up Earlier?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a university student who struggles with sleeping too much. I am currently on 5 medications for a slew of mental illnesses (autism, ADHD, depression, OCD) which may affect my sleep. I tend to sleep 10 hours a day because I have school commitments, but I could easily sleep 12 hours if I wanted to. I've slept up to 17 hours on particularly bad days. My pattern is to sleep around 11-midnight and wake up at 10am.\n\nI imagine one strategy you may think of is \"Go to bed earlier\". This would be very difficult for me because my medications have specific times to take them, and it would be very difficult to change that schedule.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to survive on less sleep than they are used to? I feel like I waste time by sleeping so much, and it affects my productivity.",

      "text": "Perhaps saving time in other areas would allow you to still sleep for the amount of time you need to without taking such a hit to your productivity? Keeping to 9 or 10 hours if that works for you. If you need to wake up earlier because of classes, perhaps going to bed earlier and setting an alarm so you can wake up to take your medication and go back to sleep. Have it with you next to your bed with some water. If you\u2019re somebody who can fall asleep after waking up, that is.\n\nEdit, for more information: I know some people who can survive with little sleep and still function fairly normal. I am personally not one of those people, and losing too much sleep over one day or a period of days really triggers and exacerbates my own health and mental health challenges. If you can be consistent about getting enough sleep for you, it might reduce the likelihood or number of times where you oversleep. Of course that is contingent on other factors as well, so I do hope you have adequate support for the challenges you\u2019re facing and potentially even accommodations from the school you are attending. If you haven\u2019t looked into this, I would very much recommend it for your next semester. \n\nFor reference, I am not currently attending school, but I do have a job where I need to wake up at 5am. I aim to be in bed by 9pm and asleep by 10pm. This leaves me with only 7 hours of sleep and I generally need around 8-9 to feel well rested. If I am out late and get 6 hours of sleep, the next day is much more difficult, and if I don\u2019t get more sleep the next night, the second work day is nearly impossible to get through. I also find, with an average of 7 hours of sleep, I feel more upset during the week, have a lower tolerance for dealing with bullshit, and oversleep more the weekends. \nI\u2019ve wanted to do more work and make more money, but that isn\u2019t something that is realistic for me, and this is something that I have learned with time and experience and have also learned to be okay with. \n\nPerhaps taking fewer courses until you feel ready to take more could also be an option. \n\nP.S. coffee is not a replacement for sleep, or sanity.",
