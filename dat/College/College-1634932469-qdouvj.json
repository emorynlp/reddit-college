  "text": "The school i\u2019m currently at is horrible. \n\nFacilities and dorms have a plethora of issues that never get fixed, despite the 45k a year everyone pays to go here. \n\nThere\u2019s a residency requirement here that won\u2019t allow me to commute despite the fact that I live within a qualifying distance from the school. \n\nCampus is dead all the time and nothing happens here. \n\nI\u2019m really considering transferring at this point but if every school is like this i\u2019m not even going to bother. Are a lot of other colleges like this? Is all of college really just a money scam? Some of my friends have better experiences, so i\u2019m hoping that\u2019s not the case. \n\nPlease help me out here.",

If you have another college within commuting distance from where you live, I'd suggest transferring there. Commuting is worth it for the money saved, imo.",

Sure some of the buildings have a few issues from time to time, but we have a number we can call when we notice something and they fix it. We have that same residency requirement for on-campus residents, but the furthest walk to class I have is under ten minutes, on average it\u2019s about 2-3. Our campus is lively and events happen all the time outside the Student Union Building and on the Quad. I think it may just be your college, I\u2019m sorry to hear that things are rough there",

Look at the syllabus, create your own modeled off of that, challenge the exam, create a portfolio if possible for your field,  apply to jobs. \n\nI got hired out of my first year of college doing this. Now I make $60k/year instead of paying $12k/year to sloth my way towards a piece of paper that says I'm qualified while not learning anything I didn't already know. \n\nThere's always pushback on this, but I think people are just in denial",
