I studied for hours, went to office hours, went to the chemistry help center, got tutoring, etc. I just didn't get it. It was like I was physically incapable of understanding wtf was going on. \n\nI switched majors to a much more interesting degree, but I did have to give up on my dream of vet school (also due to the fact it's too expensive and probably too much for my anxiety). I stopped trying the last month of the semester and my grades did not change. Just guessing got the same grades as actively trying and that realization really upset me. A 45% was a C- in that class lol\n\nI am much happier with my hard work paying off. It also helped that the first major course I took in the new plan of study was about trees and tree identification which made 1,000x more sense to me!",

I have no idea what ops study habits are like, nor anybody else in this thread, so \u201cwork harder\u201d could be a ridiculous comment to make. Some colleges are harder than others and some people just aren\u2019t in the right field, and that\u2019s why they are receiving lower grades. I\u2019m in my first year of university (nursing), and I can tell you that there are people in my classes who study for twice the amount of time I do. We get our marks back and our grades are either the same or still lower than mine. Conversely, there are probably students who spend even less time on school than I do and simultaneously earn higher grades than me. My point is, \u201cwork harder\u201d is a doltish thing to say when you know nothing about a person\u2019s situation.",

To work hard also means to manage your time, form adequate study habits, etc. I am not necessarily saying that people who have bad grades are not hard workers, but people who work hard typically possess a rhythm that works for them and they stick to it. Also, if a major or college is not beneficial to your development then it should be common sense to find programs that are. \n\nIf one gives it their all and does not measure up then they should likely consider alternative routes to success. One could \u201cwork hard\u201d to recognize their weaknesses and choose to overcome them or bypass them\u2026 but all that introspection still takes hard work.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand my \u201cdoltish\u201d comment more.",

I go to office hours with questions and I participate in class. I'll inquire why I got a question wrong on an assignment, sometimes they'll see a mistake they made or something they didn't understand. I'd even ask to resubmit/redo assignments if was something super serious or some crazy circumstance. But what really can the prof do at the end of the semester? It's not like they can resubmit grades. You don't have time to ask for an extra credit assignment.",

But you also have to realize somethings are just out of your control. So at least try what you can try and look for grading errors/ask your professor and once you\u2019ve tried that you say to yourself \u201cwell I did my best\u201d then you forget about it.\n\nAlso, my entire college experience can be summed up by \u201coff by .02\u201d\n\nEvery semester that I failed to get dean\u2019s list I was literally .02 away. This happened around 4 out of 7 semesters. 1 was completely out of reach and 2 I managed to actually get it. But yeah 4 semesters I got a 3.582 when the cut off is a 3.60\n\nI have one sem left but I already anticipate that I\u2019m gonna end up with a 3.58 as my final gpa and the cut off for graduating with honors is a 3.6.\n\nBut its wtv.

Your whole argument is that asking for free points is better than asking for an opportunity to EARN a few points to bump an A- to an A.

Have we came to the point where professors are annoyed at a A- student looking to earn an A?? The student clearly out in a lot of work in the class. You just dont want professors to be inconvenienced.  This is the heir career and student interaction is part of the job. My advice was ask the professor if there was an opportunity. Lets be honest here, the TA is the one who will grade the work anyway so dont feel bad for the professors",

Not only does it feel bad to be the deliverer of bad news that they did not deserve such grade but it is also annoying to see students who didn\u2019t put reasonable efforts demanding higher grades. But as a student, I believe you should always ask as you miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take. Also, my advice are mainly for those who worked hard and it shows (through the professor recognizing their name and face by class and OH participation), as those are the ones that are more likely to receive a grade bump.",

Speaking directly is the best way of getting the message across and I know some professors are more likely to grant the bump to someone who asks them directly instead of over the email because that show extra effort and care. And based on my experience, most professors don\u2019t care if your grade increase from B to B+ or A- to A. Sometime, just asking does the job. And ultimately, the choice is the professor\u2019s to bump my grade or not. It is not like I am holding their family hostage by speaking directly with them",
