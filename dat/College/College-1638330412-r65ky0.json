  "text": "so, i\u2019ve been arriving 10 minutes late lately due to personal reasons. sometimes i\u2019m on time, sometimes i\u2019m 10 minutes late and I try to refrain from doing so but there\u2019s been a lot going on lately that is out of my control. \ntoday, I walked in and walked up to my professor. she doesn\u2019t say anything, just puts her phone right up to my face. I asked,\u201d uh\u2026 what?\u201d she says \u201cthe time. you\u2019re late. again\u201d (this is in front of everyone). she asks me why am I being late often, and says this wasn\u2019t like this before. I say \u201cuh idk\u201d bc it\u2019s none of her business. but she keeps pushing it and she makes me tell her why i\u2019m being late IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE class bc she\u2019s like \u201cyou don\u2019t know why you\u2019re late everyday?\u201d so I say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 home stuff there\u2019s just been a lot\u201d. \nshe quickly asks me the questions that are on the board, but since i\u2019m so overwhelmed with what\u2019s going on I say I don\u2019t know for all of them and she chuckles sarcastically and throws her hands in the air, basically making me look stupid in front of everyone because I don\u2019t know it. \nI hate what happened today. A part of me says it\u2019s my fault since i\u2019m the one being late, but another part of me thinks what she did is completely unprofessional. Has this happened to anyone else?",

      "text": "You did seemingly set yourself up for this one, but that doesn\u2019t justify the teacher\u2019s approach. Unfortunately, when you come to class late this can be seen as an interruption. It is an inconvenience to the class, and honestly disrespectful to the professor if it happens frequently.\n\nThey don\u2019t get paid to care about your personal life, what has you behind schedule, etc. I think if you had approached it differently such as giving your teacher a firm response like  \u201cI\u2019d be happy to explain my circumstances to you after class\u201d this story might have had a different outcome. \n\nSo to wrap it all up - yeah it was unprofessional that she made a scene in front of the class, but then again maybe she was making a point. Some teachers have zero tolerance policies often outlined in their syllabus. Doesn\u2019t make it right, but you do have to accept your share of blame because your actions of showing up late on a regular basis is also disrespectful - was your situation not explained to your professor prior to this incident?",

I wish I handled it a lot better, I wish I was more firm with my responses. \n\nThis is the first time this has ever came up. Never received an email, or a talk after class.\n\nShe did this in front of the class but people were working in groups, so they were already occupied with what they were doing by themselves.",
