  "title:": "How to find/rebuild new friend group after being kicked out of old one?",
  "text": "So basically one of my friends started saying I sent nudes, which I didn\u2019t, to some people. And I called him off for it and told him to give me some distance. So he recruits his new friend and decides to ghost me and ruin my reputation in the group. Saying that I spread rumors about people. I may have let some small things slip, but he was exaggerating all of it, and got some people to hate me when I did nothing to them. Mind you he loved me like a sister the day before this all occurred, and made a decision to cut contact over some boundaries.\n\nHe is a known assaulter and a drug addict, and his new group he made is full of drama, severe substance abuse, and enabling. Even though it was a severely toxic group, I don\u2019t have many people anymore and I feel really sad about it. I\u2019m a junior, is it impossible for me to get a new friend group?",

      "text": "You dont need crappy friends like that. Seriously, you are at a point in your life where you need to reconsider who your friends are. As far as you making friends, I'd start small talk with classmates, coworkers (if you work) and try to keep a positive outlook if you get rejected. Those toxic friends of yours will only worsen, and I suggest you cut ties with them. I hope this helps.",
