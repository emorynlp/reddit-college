  "title:": "What to do after flopping a final exam?",
  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nBasically looking for some advice. I went into the exam with an 89% average, just a percentage off the A+. I needed a 76 to secure the A and I completely flopped and got 50%. I ran out of time and overall just didn\u2019t perform well, I think this drops by average down to a B.\n\nThis happened twice in the same day, I had a similar average and missed the 76 and will end up with and A- for the class. \n\nAnyway, what would you guys do for the class I have a B in now? I was literally so close to the A+ and thought I secured the A, what can I say to the professor?\n\nAny help appreciated",
