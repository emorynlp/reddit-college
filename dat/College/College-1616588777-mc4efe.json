  "title:": "Last minute students - is there anything instructors can do for you?",
  "text": "I'm an instructor, and I give students two weeks to submit a lab that takes about an hour.\n\nUnsurprisingly, about 75% of students submit their work on the last day, and about 50% in the last hour.\n\nWhat did surprise me is that nearly 50% of the students didn't even look at the instructions until the final day. They're not waiting till the last minute to finish, they're waiting till the last minute to start.\n\nI offer lots of assistance - live help sessions, video instructions, discussion forums, email, etc - but I can't help students who start their work on the last day after I've already gone to bed.\n\nLast-minute students - is there anything your instructors can do to help you? Or is this a lost cause?\n\n*UPDATE:*\n\n*Thank you all for your thoughtful feedback. I knew that students lived a stressful life, but I didn't realize just how bad it is. You have my sympathy!*\n\n*For what it's worth, I've observed the same behaviour in traditional, in-person labs. We had a lab that used to be two hours long, and students would just barely get it done in time. We expanded the lab to three hours, without changing any of the content. Students still barely got it done in time. I'd wager that I could make the same lab 1 hour or 4 hours, and nothing would change. Whenever you give a deadline, students will just barely meet it.*\n\n*This is why I'm wary of suggestions to break a lab into pieces, each with their own deadline. If students are struggling to meet one deadline, then making them meet three deadlines doesn't help.*\n\n*Good luck in your studies! Start early!*",

At the end of the semester apply a test grade equivalent to the percentage of number of assignments required to turn in early.\n\n\n For example, if you have 20 assignments for the semester, require 10 to be turned in a day early. If a student only does 9 early they get a 90 test grade. If they turned in 0 early, they get a 0 test grade. It's a bit ridiculous for college but it'll help encourage students to start early for an easy 100 test grade.",

      "text": "Excess office hours help motivate me to begin at least a few hours earlier, though I know it isn't always possible for every professor to make extra time in their work schedule. I sometimes still don't show up b/c an \"office hours clique\" usually takes over and asking my own questions feels like interrupting. Maybe spending ten or fifteen minutes in lecture introducing the first problem or two would at least get me to *think* about doing it.\n\nThe root of the problem is that I don't feel connected. I am motivated when I do things with and for people, and I mistakenly thought things would change after I slogged through 2 years of prereqs. Covid is a major catalyst obviously but I have always had a very hard time when I feel like I am competing against my peers. Completely demoralizing stuff but whatareyagonnado",

      "text": "Not sure if this applies but I usually don\u2019t procrastinate on an assignment until the last day and that\u2019s cuz I\u2019ll have an overlap of work or the assignment might take longer to do. So I\u2019ll start my assignment 2 days in advance knowing that it\u2019ll take me about a day to finish and if I start it the day before or the day it\u2019s due, I\u2019ll probably be working all day/night. So I think it\u2019s a good idea to tell your students how long you think the assignment will take them. Also, reasonable expectations! A student who\u2019s a good writer for example, might get through an assignment that requires a lot of writing faster than a student who\u2019s a poor writer. So make your assignments with that in mind. Some people will struggle with it more than others, which will cause them to submit it on the last day",

The one thing that is helpful for me is when the professor breaks projects and assignments into chunks with things like first drafts, outlines and preliminary bibliographies being due before the final project. It sort of forces us to plan ahead. Along with this, I\u2019ve had had professors take a class period to have brief meetings with individual students, like mini conferences to touch base on final projects and such, and it\u2019s helpful. Obviously that may be impossible with 100 students, but if you have 15 it\u2019s feasible. Honestly Covid has turned me into a terrible procrastinator, when I once was not one. Without being able to go to the library and coffee shops I\u2019m in my room 20 hours of the day sitting in my own depression (there\u2019s my gen z bluntness coming out), but it\u2019s just been extremely difficult to do work until the last second.",

All this to say that one of the best things for me was when I was allowed to turn in papers and projects *early*. It gave me my own timeline and I was able to focus on that - especially if it was a big project - and know that I could turn it in as soon as I completed it, which gave me one less thing to think about. Some professors were able to quickly give me feedback, too, which was amazing. They still graded it the same way they did the others, of course, but It cut down on the anxiety of waiting until the rest of the students turned in *their* projects or papers. \n\nThere were a few occasions, especially with lab reports, where they would give me the chance to go back through it and look over it again. In those instances, option was open to any student who turned in their work early. My keystone project professor allowed us to turn in work early for five bonus points so he could give us legit feedback before the end of the semester, but if we turned it in early then the grade we got was the final one and would go on the books right away. \n\nBefore/during my final three semesters of college I was properly diagnosed and was allowed accommodations, and although finishing early wasn\u2019t something specified on the list of \u201cwe\u2019re not neurodivergent but a book said this would help\u201d accommodations, most of my professors were fine with it and it drastically improved my ability to focus and get work done, and to do the work *well*. \n\nIt didn\u2019t always work, and there were times when I had to choose which assignments I was going to turn in vs take the zero for, but I graduated with honors in three years. I couldn\u2019t have managed that if I hadn\u2019t had such incredibly understanding professors who asked questions like you\u2019re doing right now: what can I do to actually *help*. Some of that was due to plain old procrastination, other stuff was due to other mental and physical illnesses. \n\nOne other thing that helped me succeed was having an accommodation that allowed me to take exams ahead of time. The legal wording was \u201cprivate, calm space\u201d or something, but I had to schedule the exams ahead of the day the rest of the class would take them and not attend class the day before the rest of the exams so I couldn\u2019t cheat or help someone cheat. (Their rule, not mine, of course.) I tried to get them scheduled the day or two before, but some of my professors who were \u201cin the know\u201d allowed me to take them up to a week ahead of time. Sometimes we went through the SPED department, and sometimes I just went during their office hours. I know this isn\u2019t something that every student could do - I went to extremely small schools so I legitimately got to know my professors and had the same professors over the years - but if you know a student is really struggling that might be an option. \n\nThat was a lot more information than I planned to write out, but having \u201cearly\u201d deadlines and the ability to test ahead of time relieved so much pressure. I was also working with therapists, the SPED department, and a psychiatrist during that time and part of my success is due to the time and effort they put into helping me succeed as well. \n\nI\u2019m very glad that you\u2019re asking for the students\u2019 side of this issue, and I\u2019d be happy to discuss some of the other things I struggled with and how the school helped me get through them with you via DM if you\u2019re interested. College could have been a nightmare, but the staff, professors, and leaders did everything they could to understand the problems. That made a difference.",

It's silly for professors to be harder on students than a court of law would be on the lawyers in a court case.\n\nSecond, I think the root cause of a lot of procrastination is a low level of brain fog, due to something like lack of vitamin D or vitamin C.\n\nThere's probably nothing you can do about students' brain fog.\n\nBut, on the other hand, even minor brain fog is a big problem for students, and severe brain fog is crippling. Most of the homeless people you see who aren't hooked on drugs or alcohol, and who aren't severely mentally ill, probably have severe brain fog.\n\nSo, high schools and universities ought to do what they can to address the problem, not just wash their hands of it.\n\nIn a perfect world: A university would give incoming students some kind of simple kind of executive function/brain fog assessment. Example: Ask them to complete three fairly simple assignments with three different deadlines. Flunk students who miss any of the deadlines.\n\nIf a student fails the executive function/brain fog test, put the student in some kind of class or group therapy program designed for people with brain fog. Encourage students in the program to get screened for health problems, exercise, get exposure to natural sunlight, take appropriate vitamins, etc. Maybe have any medical schools or counselor training programs on campus try to come up with strategies for dealing with brain fog.",

What helps me get started on an assignment is breaking the assignment into at least two parts with different deadlines. The first part should be very easy and approachable, because it makes starting feel easier. Like the first part could be as simple as a two-sentence statement about what I intend to write about and a barebones outline (with no reading or research required). It sounds pointless because it's so easy but seriously, merely getting the ball rolling on the assignment helps me start the real work on the assignment. Yes, I may start this \"easier\" part of the assignment right before it's due but I'll have an easier time starting the second, harder part.\n\nAnother thing that helps me get work done before a deadline is a positive incentive to do so. For instance, I had a professor who offered one point of extra credit to each student who completed 2 paragraphs (of good quality) of an essay a week before the deadline. Yeah, I did only start writing it a few hours before the extra credit deadline but once I finished it, I had two paragraphs done, which made it super easy to keep going right after and I ended up finishing the rest of the essay a few days before the due date. Another positive incentive was a self-imposed one: pre-covid, my mom was coming to visit the day before a big paper was due and I knew I wanted to see her, so I did my best to finish a significant portion of my paper before she arrived, and was able to finish the rest of the paper in the hours after she left. I'm not sure what positive incentives professors can really offer during covid, but ik that students like when teachers do something funny during lecture or bring their pets or something so maybe you could incentivize that? I'm not really sure. Regardless, I wish I had professors as concerned about this as you are, but it gives me hope that there's at least one professor who cares!",

Also, if you know people aren't even looking at the directions until the last day, maybe skim over the directions in class when you assign it. This works more for essays, but the longer students have to process instructions (even subconsciously) the more prepared they will feel when they go to start their assignment at 10:59.\nEdit: also really helpful to let people ask for help on bigger assumptions even if the deadline is close and they're on the first few steps. It can be intimidating to get help when you're weeks behind, so being really open to helping in that situation could really appreciated.",

I can work at my own lace and submit things as I go. This allows me to focus on the weighted assignments first and work on it throughout the semester and asking questions along the way instead of a short period of time. It also allows me to knock out smaller assignments quickly giving me more time for larger assignments/projects. I understand this isn't practical for large class sizes or a more traditional college/uni environment but this has helped me a lot.",

Those people who look at instructions until last day they just won't make it in real world and jobs, but they have to learn the hard way.

All of a sudden what was supposed to be a short assignment turns into a long assignment that needs to be put off to complete later because there are only so many hours in a day.

I had professors in the past that would make their due dates early in the morning and that helped curb a lot of the students who would submit just hours before the dead line. For example, the homework is due Thursday at midnight. The professor would make it due at 8 am or 10 am on Friday instead. Most students continued to turn it in Thursday evening but we rarely received students turning it in the morning of Friday. It helped in the sense that the students work was more authentic and good quality. Before we would get students turning things it at 11:58 pm with a million typos and rushed thoughts. But this is just a suggestion! :) do what works best for you and I hope the rest of the semester goes well for you and your students!",

All you can really do is communicate what positive behaviors look like or possibly create some structure to require engagement before the last minute. Some ideas:\n\n* Create a mini-assignment or class activity to ask and answer questions with their peers about the assignment like 3-4 days before it's due. Spend like 10 minutes at the very beginning or end to just give them space to talk about the assignment. If nothing else, the couple of stronger students will share some expectations.\n* Communicate your email response policies. Let them know clearly that sometimes it takes you 48 hours to respond to emails. So assignment related questions should come in at least 1-2 days ahead of a due date.\n* Describe how students perform - \"Oh, I noticed that the students that started this activity earlier also got better grades\"",

The ones that their class is Tuesday/Thursday and assignments are due the following Tuesday or Thursday and the ones that class is on Tuesday and something is due that Thursday, Saturday and sometimes Sunday or Monday. The first type help keep the rhythm of normal in person class. The second type throw a wrench into my ability to focus with equal attention to the other classes. \n\nI do wait sometimes until the last day before pulling an assignment but I've downloaded the syllabus and if the professor generally sticks to it, then I'm already aware what is expected without the professor seeing that I pulled the assignment. I can budget my time and I plan \"chaos time\". (If I think an assignment takes 3 hrs, I plan 5 hrs.) Today, in fact I have stuff due at midnight that I've read over but haven't started. (Read 15 pages and do 5 questions.) It may appear as procrastination on the professor's end but it's really me juggling all the things I have due this week. I had two bigger projects due this week, I completed those early in order to budget at least 5 hrs for the 15/5 assignment.\n\nWill I turn things in the last hour? Yes. Does it mean I've been procrastinating? Sometimes, yes, but also no. I juggle about 65 hours a week between work and school and my assignments are never late. (45 for school and 20 for work)\n\nI don't think all last minute students are procrastinating in the sense that they are just not doing school work because their assignment is gotten in an hour prior to the due time/date. Those students exist for sure, but not all of us are careless, we're just damn busy.",

I am often completing assignments just before they\u2019re due\u2014and I don\u2019t like it. Personally, I\u2019m a full time worker and full time student. Sometimes things just have to be done when they HAVE to be done. But if I get sick, or something comes up, it can be difficult to ask for help. I know I should have started it earlier. Even if it was impossible to do so, even if I\u2019ve been working on assignments for 8-9 hours each night after work and know there was no wiggle room. So try to avoid placing that blame on students. When possible, assume they\u2019re struggling\u2014not intentionally disregarding your class. And while you have no requirement to help them, do your best to be patient and kind, and avoid any condescension. I know which professors I feel safe going to, and which I don\u2019t. That changes who I visit in office hours, who I reach out to if I\u2019m struggling with health, and whose assignments I panic over. \n\nI have a good reason\u2014me being a fulltime worker is a good reason. But most times you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, unless you\u2019ve been told. It places a lot of emotional burden on you to assume the best, but honestly that is the best advice I can give.\n\nAnd record your help sessions, if possible. Just because a student starts late, it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to succeed. It just means circumstances make that difficult. Sometimes those circumstances are self created, sometimes they aren\u2019t.",

They may have labeled your class as the easiest, when compared to others and leave that work until the end because they have many other things to focus on.\n\nI see that sometimes I do similar. If I have 10 different assignments due in 1 week, I usually start with the hardest since they may take the most time. Once I see some significant progress has been made, I move on to the next one in line. Organizing coursework by difficulty along with the amount of work I expect to put in slightly eases the overwhelming doom of the sheer scale of work. Knowing that I have a couple assignments that I can safely and easily work on a day before or on the due date eases some of that stress for me.\n\nYou said that the lab takes about an hour. They may recognize a pattern if all your past labs have also taken about an hour to complete. Only way I'd start an assignment earlier is if I know it would be more difficult. Increasing difficulty or length would make me start earlier, although I would definitely take advantage of the due date/time.\n\nNot sure there's anything you can do about it while maintaining the same hour-ish long labs. Talking with my peers, I have noticed that a significant portion of them function on stress and/or prefer to finish an assignment in one go. So quickly approaching deadlines boost productivity the closer they get, at least for me. Sometimes I have some free time and start working on a project early. Almost 90% of the time the beat breakthroughs come closest to the due date.\n\nSorry for the rant, hope I provided at least a modicum of insight.",

But I have more life experience than a lot of my classmates, so I'm always expecting some sort of curveball to show up (like an assignment that requires doing an activity with other people or over multiple days)\n\nSometimes I'm scared to look at the instructions or don't feel like I really have the time to do that since I'm working on another project. But by now, I know that if I don't at least read the instructions, I might have some problem with them, and I do not want to be the person to email a professor at 9pm the day an assignment is due. If I did (and I got close to that once, emailing the professor the day of or the day before an assignment was due with a question) I don't really expect an answer and it's more of a last ditch effort. \n\nIf you're working with freshmen, or maybe even sophomores, and you really want to help them, instructing them to \"go right now/after class to the assignment page and look it over.\" If you're so inclined to do a bit of hand holding, read through the assignment with them, even if it's just opening the doc, and scrolling through it for about 30 seconds with maybe a <30 second \"this is your assignment for the week\" type statement, Certainly not necessary, but recommending it since it sounds like you really just want your students to stop being blindsided by info they easily could have just read on their own.\n\nWhile it's great that you offer so much assistance, the hardest part for me as a student, and why I often don't take professors up on their offerings, is because I just suck at time management and forget to attend office hours, or leave things till it's really too late to ask questions about it. \n\nEven though it might look like the assistance and effort you're putting into this is worthless, you do have a few students who really appreciate all of your efforts. \n\nMy suggestion is to not cut back on what you've been offering, and maybe make it clear in class that they need to read the assignments BEFORE the due date, and that you will (most likely) NOT answer emails after 5pm on the due date (or whatever time sounds reasonable.) And when the emails come in about \"how do you do X\" at 11pm on the due date, use your discretion as to whether answer the email then or not. If it's the same student every time, make it clear to them that you can't keep answering this late, and then just stop.  \n\nSometimes, NOT offering help late at night pushes them to start earlier. It does for me.",

Boundaries and set rules help me as a student so I can know what is and isn't acceptable. It saves both my professor and I time.\n\nThat being said, I have had professors give handouts that detail great study methods for the class they are teaching as well as time management strategies. Those have helped me a lot and I have implemented them in my life. Notable strategies include: using an eisenhower matrix instead of to-do lists, setting reminders on amazon echos or phones about recurring quizzes, how to use a planner and what types of planners are good, etc.\n\nI have ADHD & Bipolar I, so school is really really hard for me. I try and communicate with professors, but I also understand that it's my responsibility to do so. I have accommodations for ADHD (extended time for testing and quiet room for testing), but it's been really hard to get accommodations for my Bipolar. I have been on meds for a long time and \"seem\" normal, so I get told that I don't need them, even with documentation from my doctor.\n\nAnyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that what helps me is clear boundaries and handouts that have my professor's contact info, office hours, what kind of communication they prefer, and if they feel like it, study and time management strategies. Also, making it clear that you are very open to communication is helpful.\n\nAt the end of the day though, there are going to be students who don't care or aren't in a place mentally or in their life where they can be doing well in school and you can't do anything about that. I'm not a professor, but I think I would struggle with not being able to help, save, or turn people's grades/habits around. You seem like an awesome professor who is already doing more than you need to be doing. Thank you for being the professor who cares and wants to help! Make sure you take breaks every once in awhile, my professors that are like you tend to work themselves to death.",

For OPs case, it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of room for experimentation. In that case, doing a small experiment of watching how assignment submission times change in accordance to a material reward (being the extra credit points) could reveal those who submit late on purpose and those who submit late due to external circumstances. Extra credit points for attending office hours could even be applicable here as well. Lots of options here besides moving the deadline up (which doesn\u2019t sound very helpful at all).",

A lot of the time people with (and without) learning disabilities form bad habits because of executive dysfunction, stress, snowballing, anxiety, taking shortcuts to offset limited time, and lack of coping skills. \n\nPutting aside how they get to the point of handing in work last minute... giving an opportunity (positive reinforcement) for bonus marks would work for many students. Who cares if it helps the person who has no excuse for doing it last minute? If its helping the students who are really trying their best with what they have. Profs shouldn't be in the business of deciding *why* student's have bad habits, or who deserves the extra grades, it's pointless. This prof is trying to find out how to help *now*. \n\nIf op is okay with doing a bit extra, they could say \"if you hand in early, I'll grade it and give partial marks for fixing the questions you got wrong within x amount of time.\" Even if its 24 hours. Before moving onto another section most haven't had time to understand what they've done wrong and then retention rate drops. Not to mention when finals come and they need to brush up on old material, but they're *also* expected to learn concepts they didn't understand.\n\nThis being a good option just doesn't seem debatable imo. Even if you mention studies about why students with disabilities form bad habits, its not productive to the point you're trying to make without adding links. I can say I've read studies about the effectiveness of positive reinforcement and redoes but I don't expect you to change your mind based on me saying I've read them. If you're going to bash an idea, come up with a better option or move on. If op doesnt think it's a good idea they obviously won't use it.",

Once remote learning became the new norm, many teachers tripled their courseload with busy work to fill in things that we would normally have during class that didn't actually require an assignment.\n\nFor example, two of my classes now have \"required weekly discussions\", in which the teacher gives a topic of discussion and the class responds in a forum-like post as short essays. The discussion opens on Monday, the initial post is due on Wednesday, and two responses to other classmates are due on Sunday. Rinse and repeat. So they've basically assigned us a weekly essay on top of new weekly quizzes and tighter deadlines.\n\nThere is so much to keep up with that most students I know are working from the announcement of an assignment until the last possible moment in a waterfall that spills over every week, eschewing sleep and having to prioritize the completion of projects based on what grade needs the most help or which teacher has the highest late penalties.",

Being an educator can sometimes be thankless work, especially in the current world situation. This may be a \"lost cause\" situation - I am not trying to excuse the behavior, but rather trying to explain it a bit for you.\n\nSo more than likely this is not the case for all of your students, but I have ADHD and a byproduct of that is that I physically cannot do work spread over a long period of time. A good example of this is a paper - while I know that writing an outline/rough draft is generally a good idea, my brain considers it done after that draft. When I am required to turn in a rough draft I usually turn in something that I would turn in as a final paper, but just converted into bullet form or jumbled a little bit. I cannot regulate my attention to the same project long term.\n\nThat being said, one question remains. Do you allow your students to turn things in early or late? A lab that takes about an hour is something that I would be able to do. If your students are able to turn things in early that certainly helps because if I were given an assignment on day x and couldn't turn it in until two weeks later then I wouldn't do it until two weeks later because even if I do it the night it is assigned I will forget to turn it in because my brain thinks I am done with it. \n\nWhen a deadline is coming up, many students, not just students with ADHD, will feel a sort of \"emergency response\" that gives them the energy/focus to get things done (The \"oh no it is 11:00 and my assignment is due at 11:59\" experience is way more powerful than most people care to admit).",

      "text": "I've always been a contentious student, and I really try to learn and apply the material instead of bullshitting my way into an A. In high school, I still had to deal with the lovely ADHD-variety of procrastination, and I am no stranger to waiting until the day of to read the assignment instructions. Sometimes it's easier to open up that Canvas assignment in a new tab, minimize it right away, and let it be a nagging reminder until you're \"ready\" to open it. The inflection point comes right around when the anxiety about the impending deadline surpasses the anxiety of the unknown.\n\nWhen you're already stretched so thin, the last thing you want is another opportunity to feel stupid. Maybe the assignment will be a breeze or it could even be something you end up really enjoying. But it could be a theorem written more in Greek than it is in English. And now you have to prove it. Good luck with your Stack Exchange rabbit hole.\n\nNo one likes being handed something they can't understand but feel like they \"should\". Whether that's an unfair self-imposed expectation is another issue, but it's human nature to grapple with insecurity. It can be hard to not see each new assignment as a gamble in your own stress levels. What if you open that PDF only to find out that  Schr\u00f6dinger's cat really is dead?\n\nOf course confidence and self-assurance are important lifeskills that shouldn't be ignored. At the same time, when you're burnt out, you run out of the stamina needed to constantly convince yourself that you're not stupid. Or maybe you know you won't have the time between work, other classes, family obligations, etc. Then you have to worry about which \"required\" obligations you choose to let fall through. Less sleep? A missed appointment fee? Disappointing a friend? Getting a 0 on that assignment? You can't have it all.\n\nLike many students, I have been benumbed by online classes, social isolation, and the exhausting increase in assignments. I was also diagnosed with Bipolar 1 last year and took a quarter off of school. I came back and experienced my most severe manic episode during midterm season. My professors were incredibly kind and accommodating, and I ended the quarter well!\n\nBut I soon started to feel like I was burdening them. Upper div math tracks are pretty insular...I was going to have these professors again. The next quarter I was healthier, but I was barely keeping my head above water when it came to deadlines. I hate disappointing people, and it sucked to watch the professors who once mentored me gradually become less warm, less personal, and more inclined to expect me to overpromise and underdeliver. I wasn't the same bright, successful freshman who always turned things in early and never missed a class. We as students don't all have the same experiences, but it was depressing yet comforting to learn that this was happening to my friends too. We were all going through the motions, trying to escape the shame of continuing to fall short despite our best efforts.\n\nYou should see my sent emails folder....\"extension request\", \"my deepest apologies\", \"thank you so much for your consideration and understanding\", \"hi prof it's me again! i'm so sorry for asking for more time on yet another assignment pls don't hate me\"\n\nDrowning in deadlines, we have to put out the biggest fires first. We desperately want to get \"ahead\" but if there's something due tonight (or better yet, yesterday), it's going to bump the other stuff down a few spots on the to-do list. It sucks and some of that it is just how college is and even how life is. It's impossible to prioritize everything, even if it's important to us. We have to make sacrifices. At least for myself and my peers, college life has now ventured into an existence that is Sisyphean at best. Deep down, you're dreading the day the boulder will inevitably come crashing down.\n\nIf I knew how to fix it all, I wouldn't be going from a cumulative 4.0 to praying the rosary every night just begging for C-'s this quarter. But I'm holding onto hope and doing everything I can to hoist me a little bit higher up from the bottom of the canyon. When it comes to support, both that I give others and that I need from them, it feels like it's comes back to understanding and collaboration. \"You and I are on the same team.\" Whether it's from a partner, a friend, a professor, or a colleague, it can mean so much, especially when even just asking for help already felt like the hardest thing to do.The fact that you're working together means options and solidarity. It also pushes you both to grow.\n\nIn practice, it can look like first figuring out where each person is at. What does the student have on their plate right now? What about their professor? What do we each want and what do we both want? I'm not saying a whole therapy session but just a casual check-in to get a read on the situation and set the tone of collaboration, not cutthroat negotiation.\n\nPlanning out deadlines with my professor helps me a lot, whether it be extensions/catching up or informal checkpoints for myself to know that they're willing and able to read my latest draft or chat about what's making sense and what's not. The latter can be more preventative than abortive too. Making the labs due ASAP will probably just shift the spike of submissions from right before midnight to.....right before midnight again, just a different day. Chunking things down--especially if each intermediate task doesn't have a strict/mandatory deadline--might help, so that way flexibility is preserved. Most iPhone users don't bother to toggle off Safari as their default browser. Likewise, students will take the path of least resistance, so if informal but integrated checkpoints are the norm, the ones who opt out will probably be the ones who need to for whatever reason, or maybe they really refuse to give up the 11:59pm adrenaline rush.\n\nIt's mostly just architecture. It's passive, but it's genuine. The various resources and support you already graciously offer is just being advertised in a new way (and hopefully in a way that gets more students to actually take you up on your offer)! It doesn't even have to be graded. The class norm is to stick something, no matter how small, in that progress portfolio when you can. If a student wants feedback too, there's a seamless way to ask for it. Sure it's just going to office hours but it can feel less awkward to show up when there's an unassuming flow that nudges you there. And if the labs only take an hour....they might eventually figure out that it's easier to get it over with when they have gentle guidance on breaking it in a few chunks over the week. They can even just use it as a \"break\" from the intensity of juggling those more urgent, official deadlines.\n\nHumble disclaimer, I am obviously not a pedagogical expert and what I personally think could work is naturally subject to my own biases and learning experiences. :)\n\nYou seem like an incredibly caring professor who is genuinely invested in your students' success. Thank you for asking this question in the first place. Your students are lucky to have you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: I've had a pretty brutal experience in college since the pandemic, turns out my friends have too, we're honestly just stretched too thin, and everyday feels like you're swimming against a current that only gets stronger. But breaking things down in an approachable manner really helps me and I think it could be an interesting thing to try even if it doesn't actually require more effort, just using different wrapping paper.** *Thank you for being such a compassionate and dedicated educator. Those professors are the ones who have impacted me in ways they'll never know, but I'm eternally indebted to them nonetheless.*",
