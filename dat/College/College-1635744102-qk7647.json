  "text": "So I\u2019m a first year student in college and I\u2019m doing terrible. All throughout high school I got pretty decent grades and never failed a class, now in university I\u2019m doing so shit. There is such a huge workload and I barely have any time to do it. Any tips on how to do better in college because I\u2019m at the verge of dropping outta all my classes.",
