  "text": "hello :)! i made a post prior during halloween about our party and it went very well (excluding the cops) but if you were there at 10 it was a great time. around 500 in attendance bc we tracked at the door - give or take 40 or so around 1 when the cops arrived.\n\nwith improvements to parking which is what got us copped last time - we'd love to invite you once more to our ugly sweater party. it is 12/17 starting at 9pm and ending around 2am. ugliest sweater wins 100$ as well.\n\ncome party with us and enjoy the end of finals! so many college kids from around ga will be there and i would love for you all to meet eachother. and i personally would love to meet you guys if you aren't flying out for the holidays.\n\ndm @stevwk for rsvp and info",
