  "text": " I had a quiz due December 7th but I couldn't do it because the website that my college use for homework, quizzes, and exams were down that day. I emailed my Professor and she said she will extend it to December 9th. Couldn't do it yesterday because I had 7 assignments due for one class (800 questions). This whole time I'm thinking that I had until 11:59pm tonight (December 9) to take my quiz, and I noticed it said due by December 9, 12:00 AM. I emailed her again and notified her that it was locked and she told me she gave us two extra days and that I need to call customer service. So, I called customer service and they couldn't do anything about it, and agreed that it was a error my professor had made. Do anybody else agree that I should've had until 11:59 pm TONIGHT to take my quiz? Or am I wrong? Please help, because I have a 88 in this class and I don't want a 0.",
