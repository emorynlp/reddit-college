  "text": "Ive been browsing reddit about MIS (management information systems) major and career prospects, and some people are making it out to be not that good. Should I do it? People are saying CS is just better but my local college's program is so much better ranked in MIS than their measly CS department. What are the future prospects for MIS related jobs? Im a hs senior applying to colleges btw.",
