Dont go to college just so you can say you went to college. Its doesn't define you or your abilities. Don't tell yourself you dont want to do something, just because its hard. hardship builds character and if its hard for you, its hard for everyone so you have a fighting chance no matter what.\n\n\\-mechanical engineering undergraduate",
