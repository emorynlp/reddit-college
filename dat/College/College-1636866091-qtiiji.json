  "title:": "Did I plagiarize??",
  "text": "Recently I had an essay to do for class. The professor said it would be good if we could do apa, but he didn\u2019t say we absolutely had to. I never did apa before but since he said it would be good if we did I gave it a shot. I did my in text citations, but I put it after paraphrasing. To try to make it clearer I would paraphrase or write about information in multiple sentences and then I put the in text citation at the last sentence. I just heard after I submitted it though that you shouldn\u2019t do it like that and it could be considered plagiarism! What should I do?\n\nEdit: thank you for everyone\u2019s replies they made me feel a little relieved. I emailed my professor and hopefully he will reply when he is able to. Sorry I didn\u2019t hear it I read it in an article and then when I asked my dad he confirmed that my way of citing could be a problem. The reason it may supposedly be plagiarism is because it may lead others to think those are my words.",

However, if you have questions about writing and formatting in APA style, you can ask me and I will guide you for free. Alternatively, you can talk to your prof during office hours.",
