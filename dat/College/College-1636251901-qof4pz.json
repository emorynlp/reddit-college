      "text": "I took notes on zoom classes, just like regular class. I like writing them down but it\u2019s hard to do if a professor doesn\u2019t show slides or goes too fast talking.  I do notebook since a lot of my classes are more equations or similar than definitions. If you got a iPad and Apple Pencil then you could do either. If you get nothing out of the lectures see if their lectures are literally based on the book and if the book is easy to follow do that. Hard situation when they only speak which is so unhelpful if you\u2019re a visual leaner.",
