  "text": "Good afternoon ladies/gentlemen, I have recently joined college. I find myself lost but also doing fairly well, and keeping straight A's. We are only in the 4th week so I can't get too ahead of myself. My biggest problem right now is retaining info I read from textbooks. What are your strategies as a student that you use when reading to retain info from any material? I also forgot to mention I was a C- student in high school and did not give any crap about school, so I missed a lot in high school. I feel like I don't have the proper knowledge tools at my discretion to thrive in College.",
