  "text": "I moved to a different country when I was in 8th grade, finished school in that new language, then came back to my home country. I am now in University and study a humanity which is lots of talking, discussing and essay/research papers down the line.   \nIn my native langauge I can understand academic texts etc. just fine, when I see complex sentences or texts I have no issue understanding a thing.   \nBut when I have to speak freely I literally still sound like I belong in 8th grade. Somehow my grades are good, slightly above average. But I feel like I dont belong in uni when I hear the other students express themselves. I genuinly sometimes feel like I dont deserve the success I am experiencing academically right now.   \nI am now fluent in three languages (my native language, english, and the language I finished high school in) but neither one of those languages I can use at an academic level.   \n\n\nAny advise how to deal with impostor and maybe work on my lanuage skills? My uni offers classes for academic speaking/writing etc. but my schedule is literally so full and busy I cannot fit any of those extra classes in.   \n\n\nLike to add that I genuinly enjoy my major and also changing to a MINT major (or something that revolves a bit less around talking) is not an option as Ive neglected MINT-subjets my whole life and now dont even know the basics to any MINT-related things",
