  "text": " I'm in my last semester at Community College to get my Associates of Science degree. Previously, I wanted to major in IT but then I realized that within a decade or two, they will start outsourcing jobs to places like India. I always found medicine and the human body to be more interesting than coding to be honest. Is it possible for me to start? Or is it too late to start at 23?",

How ever you decide to treat it (act on it or let it just stay as a dream), will either make you feel good or make you feel miserable about yourself. \n\nRegrets sucks!
