  "text": "Hello everyone, \nPlease give me any tips on how to minimize my presentation anxiety. I overthink a lot and my hands start to shake just thinking about a presentation I have in a month. It\u2019s only a few minutes long but I feel like with COVID shutting down colleges in person for so long I\u2019ve forgotten how to conduct a presentation without internally freaking out. All my classes are online but for this one presentation I need to be in person.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm like you in the sense that I experience presentation anxiety too. So you're not alone! What has worked for me in the past was:\n\n**Before D-DAY**\n\n1. **Practice and practice a lot!:** I rehearsed my script many times to a teddy, my mirror, family or friends. Speaking in front of people can be intimidating so, I usually practised in front of inanimate objects first. After I felt confident in my work, I \"talked\" to my mirror, family or friends as a simulation for D-DAY. Unlike my teddy, I gained direct feedback from my family and friends and seized this opportunity to better my presentation skills. Was I speaking within the time limit? Was I using hand gestures? How often was I making eye contact? If everyone was busy, I recorded myself with my phone and judged myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**D-DAY**\n\n1. **Eye contact:** I set three points across the room (On the left, centre and right-hand sides) and looked at these points when presenting.\n2. **Breathe:** Before presenting, I would take a deep breath and tell myself, \"No one's gonna remember me or what I say in the next few minutes because they will be too busy focusing on themselves.\"\n3. **Fake it until you make it:** While it's okay to be afraid, I also reminded myself that I'm presenting to my peers and tutor. I think of them as my teddy, family or friends! If I must, I fake it until I make it! Something I realised over time was that when I'm comfortable, my confidence naturally prevails.\n4. **It's okay to make mistakes/stumble over your speech**\n\nNot sure if this was helpful at all hahaha I'm sure you'll do great! You got this, ma friend! :))",

      "text": "This is going against the grain a bit, but don't practice too much. I'm a former debate student who also has done ALOT of public speaking. In general make sure you know your information all the way through. But don't just practice giving your speech the same way 100 times. The best way to get prepared is to just talk to friends and family about the subject matter of your speech. Do this four or five times and I promise the anxiety will start to decrease. \nThe goal is to give a really nice and formal conversation to your professor, so the best way to practice is by having conversations. Every time you talk about it try doing so in different ways.\nIf your presentation is about turtles, try emphasizing different things about turtles everytime. \nThe absolute things you should not do, is become rigid in the way you preform. If you do practice rehersing your speech break it up into chunks. Do it forwards and back words. Start from the middle Etc... \nIf you get locked into one way if doing it, and then you fuck up, your brain will have no paths to recover. The best way to about freezing on stage is to make sure you have enough ways to recover from that moment, not by avoiding it all together.\nGood luck! You got this!",
