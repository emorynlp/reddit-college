  "title:": "Stop Self-Sabotaging Because You are Capable.",
  "text": "Fellow students,\n\nI know it's so easy to procrastinate, to push your work aside and cram in the very last minute. You tell yourself that you'll work on it after watching an episode of your show, or after taking a nap because you're too exhausted to start this assignment. After hours of putting off your work, you finally decide to open your laptop and start. You click on the assignment and 5 minutes later you find yourself on your phone, distracted once again. \n\nI just wanted to remind you that you are completely capable of acing your classes, of earning the grades you'll be happy with. All it takes is a conscious effort to complete your assignments and set aside time for your studies. \n\nProcrastination stems from fear, and the key is to do your work despite *feeling* like you want to procrastinate. There is no physical barrier between you and your assignments, it's all mental. So, ground yourself, stop the self sabotaging, and get it done. You\u2019ll feel awesome and accomplished and still have time to do everything else you like. Nothing is above you, nothing is too difficult for you, and you are more than capable of being *that* student.\n\nEdit: The intent behind this post wasn\u2019t to completely change lives, to sound cheery, to oversimplify a bigger problem or to sell something. It\u2019s a short post and I personally love coming across things like this because it makes me feel not so alone with these struggles. I know the internet is saturated with fake positivity these days. You are free to take it or leave it. On the other hand, I\u2019m so glad many of you could relate and found this motivating. I often journal stuff like this but I wanted to share it today because I thought it might resonate with people.",

My lectures for math are like 55 minutes and yet they still feel too long. \n\nThat's not to say that I don't procrastinate on physical schoolwork, but I certainly think I procrastinate on learning more.\n\nI've also found that I'm super inconsistent with what let's me focus. One day I was listening to some music and it helped me focus on an assignment. Next day I try listening to the music again, and its a distraction. I can't seem to find what works for me.\n\nI'll also add that there are legitimate reasons to procrastinate: if I can, having fun first so I can be satisfied prevents me from being distracted of the thought of wanting to do something.",

The fact that you have no hope tells me that you should probably see someone sooner than later. A therapist may be able to help you work out issues you didn\u2019t even know you had. \n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a therapist for several months now and I\u2019ve been on a depression/anxiety med for around two months. The only side effect I\u2019ve had is a little drowsiness, but I just take it at night and I\u2019ve slept the drowsiness off by morning. I was pretty nervous about it at first, but my therapist explained it to me so I could feel comfortable with it and it real it does help me a lot.  There are always horror stories of these medications making a somewhat stable person extremely suicidal, but honestly that is EXTREMELY rare. Doctors wouldn\u2019t prescribe anything that they think is likely to hurt you. \n\nSomething my therapist tells me is to NOT google potential diagnoses or medications because the bad stories are always what floods news, never the good stories. She says if I feel like I really need to look it up (because I\u2019m a control freak and a planner) then I should stick to reputable sites like WebMD and never look at personal blogs or news reports. \nI highly that you seek care, and if you need to look into it before feeling comfortable trying it, then do, but make sure you aren\u2019t purposely seeking the scary stories and opinions out and giving yourself confirmation bias.",

Unfortunately, I failed a chem class that semester that I later took when I was at a much better state mentally and scored a couple of 100%s on the same exams I previously failed. What I truly wish I had done was to not take classes that semester and try to figure out a way to relax and calm myself down. If that\u2019s not an option, or if taking a break may put you at risk of never going back to college, another thing that truly helps is to take classes with friends or at least try to make some in class. I know it\u2019s extremely difficult when you\u2019re battling depression, but when you have someone you can rely on in class it makes it so much easier to go through with it and takes off some pressure. Wake up early and shower. Put on some positive music and only think of *this* moment . If you have a goal like graduating or traveling for example, make a mood board. I also found that journaling helps a ton when my mind is cluttered and I have no one else to talk to. The key is to do what you have to do *despite* the circumstances. It\u2019s tricky with depression because I know there isn\u2019t a barrier there physically but it can literally feel like it sometimes. You\u2019ve got this, so many people in academia suffer from depression and they accomplish great things. You can too. The key is to not make depression your identity because realistically you are so much more than your depression. Not to sound cheery or over simply depression because of course, one post won\u2019t cure it but some of these methods have helped me in the past. If you\u2019re seeing a professional that\u2019s great and I hope you see improvement, but I know some people may not be able to afford that.",

I have treated my mental illness like any other illness because quite frankly depression is much more debilitating than the common cold. I always try to email professors before my mental health tanks my grades- it shows I'm willing to put in some effort and also demonstrates it's not just an excuse for a missed assignment. Also, having a letter from your therapist as documentation is always good!",

On the day I get the assignment I just tell myself \"I'll only write two sentences\" or \"I'll just do two questions\" and I find that sometimes once I've done that I have the motivation to keep going, and if I don't, I take a break for a bit, and come back to do two more. It really helps to break down tasks, especially if you're drained and just want to sleep.\n\nFor longer assignments like essays, if you start right away, you don't have to do too much all at once and it makes it much easier. You do need to keep yourself accountable to an extent, but it doesn't feel so hard when instead of beating yourself up for not \"doing better\" (which I did to myself) you acknowledge that it's difficult but that you are still able to work around it, even if it's not as conventional.",
