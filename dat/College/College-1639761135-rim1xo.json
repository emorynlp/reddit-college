I\u2019m failing in most of my classes since most of them are asynchronous which doesn\u2019t give me much motivation to do work.\n\nI want to take a year off to focus on a full time job before returning but I have several problems. \n\n* I\u2019m on scholarship which I think means that I have to attend another semester.\n\n* My parents are adamant about me attending another semester and won\u2019t accept my choice to take the gap year off. \n\nSo what should I do?",

          "text": "^ second this. A counselor. Personally, I would try to get through the next semester and then take the year off since you know, scholarship money shouldn\u2019t really be wasted. If you didn\u2019t have the scholarship sure taking the semester off would be a little bit of an easier decision.\n\nI wanted to take a semester/year off in the spring \u201821 but my parents didn\u2019t accept my choice and I ended up failing 3/5 classes. \n\nIt\u2019s a tricky decision, because majority take the year off, they never really want to go back. Just make sure you know what you want. Where will you be working? How long do you want to work for? What if it doesn\u2019t work out? Will you eventually return back to school. Think about it, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find your answer",
