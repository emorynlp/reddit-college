  "title:": "Question about my lowest homework score being dropped",
  "text": "Question about my final grade\n\nSo my professor posted an announcement saying that for our final grade of the class, he is removing the lowest score on a homework assignment for each student. In this case the homework is out of 20 percent. By him doing this will the final grade get fixed and go up? since he is removing the lowest score I got on an assignment which should take away from the final grade before the removal of the lowest score on a homework? This is in Canvas btw. If so will it go up by 20 percent or half or what. It probably will go up though but not sure\n\nI have a 58 percent now as my total grade for the class because of me getting a low score on my final exam and I was wondering if you think the fact that he is dropping the lowest homework score will bump my grade up to a 60? The lowest homework score I got is out of 20 percent like all the other homeworks.",

      "text": "I'm not sure I'm clear but I'll go for it. You're saying homework is worth 20 percent of your final grade? So let's say you had 20 homeworks, and your average was an 80, but one of them was a 0. If you remove that 0, let's say your homework average goes up to 83. That's a 3% difference, but only for 2o% of your final grade. 0.2 * 3 =0.6. Most likely this will affect your grade very minimally but it might just barely bring you up to a D if the stars align correctly.",

          "text": "In this case there were 8 homeworks in the class. He\u2019s dropping one so that\u2019s 7 homeworks he is only counting. Yes every homework was worth 20 points. That might mean him dropping the homework might boost my grade up to a 60. Have you ever had a low score dropped and noticed your grade bump up? If it does bump not sure if it will go up 20 percent. It might. idk but if it removes from the calculation and it\u2019s worth 20 percent",

Your 58% is equal to (current point total)/640. Once he drops it, it will be (current point total - score on lowest hw)/620.",

Since he is removing literally the whole assignment not counting it towards my final grade that means the weight of the assignment with the low score that affected my total grade is being taken off the final grade. So theoretically it should bump it up",
