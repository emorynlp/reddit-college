  "title:": "wanting to move back to school after my brother was diagnosed with brain cancer",
  "text": "my brother was diagnosed with brain cancer last week. it\u2019s been a really hard few days, our parents are visibly broken up about it and so is our other family. he\u2019s 24 and i\u2019m 22. i haven\u2019t been able to wrap my head around it. he looks and sounds and acts the exact same. nothing has changed about it. but we now know he has a brain tumour and it will most likely take his life in the next 10-15 years.\n\ni feel like i should be handling this a lot worse than i am. the first day we found out, i was crying at the thought of it. every time i\u2019d be able to calm myself down, i\u2019d think about it again and trigger more crying. but in the days since, i think about it and don\u2019t really think anything. my brother moved across the country to start dental school a couple months ago. i\u2019m in my senior year of my undergrad and moved back to school almost 2 months ago as well. he\u2019s moved back home now because he needs surgery to get the tumour out then is supposed to do chemo. i was supposed to be home last week for an autumn break my school gives us. i know the circumstances for him being home are grim, but it feels like we\u2019re just both on break from school at home (even though he\u2019ll now be taking the year off school for his treatment).\n\ni find myself getting annoyed with him like i used to. he eats all the snacks we have in the house and it drives me mad. he watches tv too loud and it still annoys tf outta me. but every time i think these thoughts now, i tell myself to be okay with it because he has cancer. i feel like this isn\u2019t a healthy way to think; i shouldn\u2019t treat him differently just because he has cancer. or should i? i\u2019m so confused and don\u2019t know how to be around him. we didn\u2019t have an amazingly close relationship to start, and now i feel so lost in how to be there for him if i\u2019ve never had that kinda relationship with him.\n\ni also feel kinda trapped. i know i should stay home with him and my family, at least until he gets his surgery and starts treatment. they\u2019re looking for neurosurgeons rn, trying to find the best dr they can. but all the best doctors have waiting lists that are weeks long. i\u2019m in my senior year rn. i\u2019m living with my bf of almost 2 years this semester, for the first time ever. i\u2019m currently registered to do my final semester as a study abroad term, with a departure date for january 2022. i feel like i\u2019m losing time. i haven\u2019t talked to my parents about this yet, but i have a strong gut feeling that they\u2019ll ask me to cancel my exchange semester to be with my brother. i feel like they want me to stay home from school for the rest of this semester to be with my brother.\n\ni feel so selfish for wanting to go back to my normal life. nothing is normal anymore. 2 weeks ago, i was still living at school with my bf and hanging out with my friends. no one knew my brother had cancer yet. now everything changed. i already felt like covid stole the last 1.5 years and took away 2 years of my university experience. i finally was able to live at school again and now it\u2019s being taken again.\n\nand then, again, i feel selfish and mean. my brother has cancer and i can only seem to care about the experiences i\u2019m losing out on. idk how to feel. i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019m an asshole. was hoping someone on this sub may have some words of advice or anything.",

      "text": "I know this is a tragic experience and he is tragically young, but 10-15 years is still a good long time for him to live life to his fullest as best he can, and as hard as it is to know he's going to die, this will give you an opportunity to not take your time with him for granted. That being said, you also have your own life to live. Like, I know it's not the same, but for the sake of analogy, I love my dad to pieces but realistically he's going to die in the next 10-15 years too (of old age, there's nothing wrong with him). I still live my life like normal and try to spend time with him when I can, but in the end, you've got to live your life, you know?",
