  "title:": "All my classes are still online and I am struggling, what should I do?",
  "text": "I am a sophomore at VCU in the kinetic imaging major. I am attending art school because I know while there are not many jobs I want to get better and network with other artists. In my department we have been tricked into being put into mostly online classes despite the mandatory vaccine requirements and small class sizes. I don\u2019t seem to be making any art student friends, am uninspired to work, and sometimes lonely due to constantly going to to zoom classes and not leaving my apartment often. I have brought up the issues created by this to my advisor but was told to switch to in person classes (which are not offered) or to leave, which completely denied my concern for my education and mental well-being. I want the school to acknowledge the waste of time and money that is being put on me and that other art schools are back in person but happen to be way too expensive and out of state. I am thinking of various ways to make the school notice like telling investors to stop putting money into art facilities because students aren\u2019t allowed to use them or threatening to transfer or drop out. I also attempted to contact the local news station but received no reply. Any other ideas to make the school consider the feeling of many students?",
