  "text": "Wth is wrong with english courses? \nIm taking a CS major, but is required to take english courses, which I don\u2019t see where it\u2019s useful at all. This professor, let\u2019s call her prof. A, assigns us essays every week. Throughout, idk how long it\u2019s been since college start, my in-text citation is always wrong, according to prof. A. The only comment I ever get is: Please refer to purdue owl writing lab. Istg I\u2019ve never been as fristated as this. She never once showed me how to properly do an in-text citation! All she do is\u201drefer to\u201d this or that, ask a tutor.. Btch YOUR JOB IS TO TEACH ME! \n\nWhich brings me to a conclusion that english courses is only there to lower your GPA! They dont want you to get the scholarship!!! What else is there? I do not need to study how to analyze someone\u2019s writing to write a god damn prgram! IF ANYONE HAS A LINK FOR A PETITION TO REMOVE ENGLISH FROM A REQUIRED COURSE, GIVE IT TO ME! I\u2019LL SIGN IT VERY HAPPILY!\n\nNote: English is not my first language",

      "text": "OWL Purdue really is a good resource, and it's also the tutors' jobs to help you. It can be very frustrating when professors aren't addressing you in a way that's directly helpful, especially if you're already upset. That doesn't mean there aren't other ways to learn what you need.\n\nKnowing the conventions of a language, be that English or your first language, is important because it will let you be able to follow along with others better. You personally may not do work involving writing papers, but you probably will read some throughout your life. If one doesn't even meet basic written conventions, you would probably question its reliability, but you have to know that it's not meeting the conventions to even recognize that at all. \n\nLiterary analysis, really, is just taking an investigative eye to something someone has said. Maybe you won't use that in the same way while making a program(though comments within the program would probably involve it), but you'll definitely use it in the rest of your life. It's a shame that your professor and/or institution aren't helping you better since this stuff is actually important.",

      "text": "By pointing you to the OWL site, she was showing you a resource that has the right way to cite. Her job doesn\u2019t require her to hand you the answers; in fact, it was nice of her to give you a specific resource and not just say \u201cgo figure it out.\u201d\n\nEnglish courses help with developing one\u2019s written communication and critical analysis skills. No matter what field you\u2019re in, these are good skills to have.\n\nGood luck!",
