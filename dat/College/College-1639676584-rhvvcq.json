      "text": "Who knows, I suspect STEM-orientated people are more likely to use Reddit. People are under the impression they are useless, assuming firstly that university is about getting a good-paying job and secondly, that those are impossible with arts/humanities degrees. I know plenty of people, myself included who got decent jobs with humanities degrees, and most are not teachers. Lawyers, librarians, diplomats, analysts, editors, journalists, designers, policy planners, teachers, etc., are all jobs open to humanities majors and I knew people who successfully got into all of them.\n\nWill you be a millionaire: most likely not. Will you be a millionaire with any major: most likely not. Humanities degrees are not career-orientated, meaning you have to do the work to make your degree sound applicable for resumes and cover letters. However, there are jobs for every major. Perhaps not where you presently live, but there are jobs.",

      "text": "Depends on the major. Most people trash talk psychology majors because they are notorious for just picking it because they don\u2019t know what else they want to do (not always true but this is the generalization). And in terms of stats, STEM majors tend to go into jobs that pay higher but that\u2019s not to say an arts/humanities major can\u2019t land a high paying job (that\u2019s clearly untrue) but the opportunities may not be as plentiful or easy to achieve as some STEM majors\n\nAlso keep in mind, many STEM majors plan for graduate school but their individual degree is also kinda useless. I\u2019m a neuroscience major with the goal of going to med school but if I dont end up going to med school, my neuroscience degree is probably not gonna get me much at all",

Whenever I tell someone I\u2019m a psych major they\u2019re like \u201cyou realize you\u2019ll make no money\u201d or just tell me that I should have picked something more useful. Not everyone is into stem and if I went that way, I would have dropped out and been super unhappy. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any useless degree, I think it\u2019s how you leverage it and market yourself. If you choose a so called useless major, have a plan for what you want to do it with. like for instance biology, maybe someone wants to become a PA or go further on to get their PhD. Im a psych major and I pretty much knew I wanted to go to grad school since I was a senior in high school.",

You don\u2019t have to do a ton of research to know that therapists are in demand, especially with the downward spike in mental health. It just depends on how good you are, and maybe depends on how good a businessperson you are (if you\u2019re doing private practice).\n\nPolice departments need therapists. CIA needs therapists. Athletes need therapists. Military definitely needs therapists. That\u2019s the only psychology career I can think of that\u2019s the most useful to society, but it\u2019s a big one. Who you gonna go to if you suffer from OCD? A doctor? Don\u2019t think they really know how to help. \n\nPsychology research is also very important, since we don\u2019t completely understand some major deliberating disorders, say schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Do I think all psych research is useful? No. But some of it definitely is.",

      "text": "There are no \"bad\" degrees. They are all perfectly valid educations.  \n\nBut, there are certainly bad career-plans that are not properly researched or validated.  \n\n\nThere nothing wrong with a Journalism degree.  \nBut building a career-plan around working for a newspaper or magazine is a bad plan. Traditional published media is on the verge of bankruptcy and jobs with reasonable salaries are tough to find.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with a degree in Lesbian Dance Theory.  \nBut building a career-plan around working as a Public Speaker on the histories and motivations of various Lesbian Dances is far too niche to earn a living.  \n\n\nThe age of going to college specifically for self-enrichment is very sadly dead.  \n\nThe astronomical cost of attendance in the US killed it.  \n\nIt is true that you do not **have** to have a degree that is perfectly aligned with your career-plan.  \nBut if you don't, you had better have something else up your sleeve to make up for the fact that you are going to be a less-attractive applicant for the jobs you are competing for.  \n\n\nBorrowing $80k to get an undergrad Psych degree to try to figure out who you are and why your mind works the way it does is a terrible way to spend $80,000 borrowed dollars.  \n\nYou could get a degree in something more career-productive, get a job with benefits and see a shrink once a week for the rest of your life for $25 per visit in co-pay.  \n\nIt is your life and it is your money and we shouldn't tell you how to spend it.  \n\nBut people keep going to college and getting degrees with no career-plan, and spend **decades** fighting to defer and refinance their loans, and voting for loan-forgiveness hoping someone will rescue them from their poorly-planned decisions, and we're trying to encourage you to not join that statistical pool.  \n\n\nGo get whatever degree you want. For whatever it's worth you have my virtual-reddit-enhanced blessing and support in your endeavors.  \n\nBut I'm asking you as nicely as I can to have a career-plan that is supported by your college-plan.",

While some degrees may warrant higher salaries, you probably won't make much money compared to other degrees or professional certifications (financial industry certifications, real estate licenses, aviation certifications, etc).",
