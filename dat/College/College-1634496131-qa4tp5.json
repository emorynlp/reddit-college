      "text": "I lost a good friend of mine at the beginning of covid, and these last two semesters, I've gotten 3 F's, a D, and 2 B's.\n\nI can't even imagine how you feel losing your mom. My advice is similar to the others, take some time off to regroup. You're stressed, probably overworked, and you feel like a failure. That's pretty much a perfect clinical description of depression. I think you need to leave and rethink things, as you mentioned you also don't like your major. Maybe take some time to try different things and see what you like.\n\nI really wanted to do this, but unfortunately I'm in a state sponsored program and I can't take semesters off. If I had the choice, I would have taken at least one semester off instead of banging my head into a brick wall for a year. The summer gave me some clarity, but I'm still struggling now despite being back on campus.\n\nYou're not a failure/loser/quitter because you've worked your ass off and don't feel like you've gotten far. It's more likely you're in the wrong place and miserable. Take some time off to help yourself, in the end your life and happiness is more important than a piece of paper that might get you a job.",

I turned to alcohol and I literally boosted my grades up by 20% (not condoning this at all as it was also a big mistake to go down that rabbit hole.)\n\nIf you are actually mentally well, maybe. I would honestly stay in the cap of your full time status to not increase prices. With that being said, if you choose a new major, try to pick out your classes and make a schedule ahead, it wouldn't be any use to take 20CH and then have to take another semester with 2 classes. I, too am an overachiever (3 jobs, 15CH) I dont have any social life, but I make time. Take that into account (might not be able to fit the gym or other hobbies). \n\nWhat the military has taught me is that we are capable beyond what we do by SO much. Keep the motivation and keep the positive attitude and yeah, you could it. Keep mentally stable and sane.",

You\u2019re not the only one who feels like they\u2019ve fallen behind their peers. You have a completely valid reason for struggling too. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be doing yourself any favors by increasing the course load. \n\nThis is gonna sound like I\u2019m boasting, but, despite being far behind my high school friends, I\u2019ve gone from being on probation after my first semester to having a 3.7 GPA and being on the Dean\u2019s List. My point is that there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking it slow. There\u2019s no law that you must graduate by a certain age to be successful and the additional time might give you more clarity on what you want to do after college. I hope things get better for you.",

You\u2019re alive and you\u2019re breathing after all you\u2019ve dealt with. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. But you have to honest with yourself too. You know yourself better than anyone else, you\u2019re unhappy with your major, you feel like a failure (which you are so so not), \u201cI\u2019ve had weak moments\u201d, Life\u2019s tough.

But, and even if you don\u2019t believe this it, we are all rooting for you. \n\nYou said you wanted advice, here is my advice for you:\n\n1. Find out whether or not you want to continue Biology. Go into classes for other major\u2019s, see what it\u2019s like, talk to people/ students, be willing to meet with professors, ask your advisors. Research it extensively online. \n\n2. Take your time with #1. Don\u2019t be afraid to not have it all figured by January. This is a big deal. \n\n3. This isn\u2019t really advice, but Someone else here said it before, but \u201cthere\u2019s no deadline for finishing college\u201d. Figure out #1 and #2, classes only get harder the further you get into a degree. 20 credit hours as a freshman/ sophomore is different from 20 hours as junior; doing several consecutive semesters (especially if you still doing a major you don\u2019t like) isn\u2019t going to be very fun. Taking one more semester and doing 15 each may not be a bad option. Plus there\u2019s Summers too.",

And I dropped out. But im still happy with my life. I mean I make between 20-30 bucks an hour delivering pizza. Ya it\u2019s not a job title im proud to announce. But I make more than a lot of others my age, even some of my aunts and uncles. I\u2019m living on my own and am very comfortable finance wise. Who says you need a degree to have a good life.",

      "text": "Hey. I'm 20 too, and I had to take time off my first year because my mom died when I was 13, and I still struggle heavily with my mental health. I currently take a pretty low course load compared to my peers, and sometimes it makes me feel kinda lame, but my mental health is much more important.  \n\n\nYou are NOT a failure or a loser. I'm impressed you're still enrolled right now. I'm not sure what your relationship was like with your mom, but losing anyone that close to you or with that kind of relationships is devastating. I can assure you that you are doing amazing, even if you feel like you're failing. I'm going to be taking an extra year or so to graduate, maybe more, and it is okay. There is no \"on time\" for graduation, even if it seems like everyone is doing it in 4 years or less. What matters is that you take care of yourself and learn valuable things.\n\nCollege is not only about academic learning, but learning to care for yourself and also social stuff. And how can you expect to learn anything if you're so overwhelmed?  \n\n\nAnd my advice is that if you don't like biology, change your major! Bio is really hard. And college is to learn about things that you're genuinely interested so you can have a better life and learn about things that spark something inside of you. Doing bio just because is going to be terrible.   \n\n\nI suggest take your time, be very kind to yourself, be proud of yourself, and try out some different classes to see what you're into! And if you're feeling super bad, it's 100000% okay to take a break. Universities will allow you to take time off without having to re-enroll or apply and stuff. I had to do that too. Best of luck and message me any time :)",
