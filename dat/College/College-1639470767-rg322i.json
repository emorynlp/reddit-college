  "text": "I have no idea where on reddit this should go (something related to advisement) but maybe someone here can point me in the right direction, please.\n\nI was dual enrolled before Fall 2014 when Florida passed the foreign language credit requirement. I have since never graduated with my AA. Fast forward, am I exempt from needing foreign language credits to graduate now because I began my education before the requirement? 100% confidence value answers, please.\n\n\"If you started your college education before 2014 then foreign language is not required for your A.A. degree.\" - the words of a former advisor (wondering if there is any concrete support for this?)",
