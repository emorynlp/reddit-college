      "text": "it's a struggle but college is a journey. I make sure to take care of my physical health first or else my mental health will not be good. sleeping consistently and enough, eating balanced and healthy meals, exercising weekly. I also try to include self-care activities such as journaling, listening to music, FaceTiming with my friends from home. I think how you manage work in college has a big impact on stress. if you can, try to study a little every night so that when the exam comes up, if you have really bad anxiety, you know you're already prepared. it helps me a lot because sometimes I start to get panic attacks if too much work comes up at once.\n\nplease see a counselor or reach out for help at your school if you need it. you are never alone and they can likely help you with anxiety as well.\n\ntake care :)",

When I lived in my dorm I\u2019d go to a building I knew was empty at night, or if it wasn\u2019t winter I\u2019d sit on these sort of benches or the swings and hang out while watching the stars. Lots of peaceful things without other people basically, fresh air is always nice",
