  "text": "Hi!\n\nI'm currently enrolled in an Introductory Chemistry course (CHM 101). I've been doing relatively well in the class; my current grade is an 89.41%. My 'Lab Grade' (97.33%) will be added after my final so I was wondering what my overall grade for the course would be if I was to score an 80% on the final exam?\n\nHere's the weighting scale:\n\nAssignments 0%\n\nHomework 5%\n\nResearch Project 5%\n\nExams 30%\n\nOnline Quizzes 10%\n\nVideo Quizzes 3%\n\nAttendance 2%\n\n**Final Exam 20%**\n\n**Lab Grade 25%**\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

      "text": "If I'm not dumb. And I don't think I am. You would get roughly an 89.5% with an 80 on the final. Assuming your 89.41 does not include the lab grade.\n\nUsing the formula (w1g1 +w2g2 + w3g3)/(w1 + W2 + w3)\n\n((0.55)(89.41) + (0.2)(80) + (0.25)(97.33))/1 you end up with roughly an 89.5",
