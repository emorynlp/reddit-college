  "text": "I have been drinking coffee for most of the life but recently in the past years especially this year my freshmen year it hasn\u2019t been working. Especially after taking all my classes of the way which is basically 9-4. After classes end I\u2019m mad tired feeling mad sleepy. Anyone know alternative coffee/ caffeine that I can take maybe in the middle of the day (12pm) Other than exercising and walking of course.",

Or eat something that is higher in sugar like dried fruit to temporarily boost your energy levels.",

There is no substitution for sleep. \n\nThere is cocaine and Adderall too. As we all know, fixing a 'problem' with drugs instead of just fixing a sleep schedule is stupid. Cocaine is terribly expensive.",

      "text": "It might be helpful to take a mental break when you can. Your schedule sounds mentally exhausting! Maybe that's part of it. \n\nI agree with your thought: exercise is great! It can help people feel more awake and alert, and can also improve sleep. \n\nAnother commenter mentioned it already, but also examine your nutrition. Foods high in simple carbs - fruit juices, sugary cereals, sweetened drinks... - will give you short term energy, but will not sustain your energy. Try to reduce simple carbs and replace them with proteins, fats, and complex carbs. Make sure you're getting enough to eat (you need to fuel your brain!), but assessing how you are getting your fuel can help improve your energy. \n\nAlcohol can also make you feel more sleepy in the days after you drink. It also impacts your sleep, worsening the issue. If you drink, consider reducing your intake. \n\nFinally, sleep. Make sure you're getting enough sleep and that your sleep quality is good. If you have a smartwatch, look at your sleep quality. Personally, I find it helpful to stretch before bed because it serves as a mental barrier between work time and bedtime. Remember, you will perform better if you are rested, so dont sacrifice sleep for work, unless absolutely necessary. Some people recommend melatonin for sleep aid, but it's really important to know that melatonin can worsen depression symptoms in people with depressive disorders. Definitely talk to a doctor before starting that.",
