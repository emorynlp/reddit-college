  "title:": "Can I Register for a Class my Advisor and I didn't Go Over?",
  "text": "I'm an incoming freshman majoring in psychology. I spoke with my advisor about what classes I should take for my degree. She recommended math, but instead of math, I'd like to take a second-language, which also counts towards my degree. I'll take the math, just not this semester. Am I able to do this though? I want to make sure before I register. My advisor won't be able to take any appointments or questions until a week from now",

      "text": "So for the class you want to take check the \"prerequisites\" tab if there is one and carefully read all course description (sometimes they put them in there) you just need to make sure you are qualified for that class or it will automatically drop you about a week or two in. \n\n*As for the math, math tends to go in sequences meaning you must take math A before you can take math B and you need math B to take math C but maybe after that you have qualified for D,E, and F. It's possible that by delaying your math sequence you might end up moving your graduation back if in the last semester you are still in math C and need to take D and although you had the space couldn't take both simultaneously, so then you end up with a semester of just math D. \n\n^However this is unlikely to happen unless you are in a STEM major, or continue to delay your math sequence.",
