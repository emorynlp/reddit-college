  "text": "I am a freshman and I failed my bio class. My school has a rule where if you failed a class in  your first year you can retake it within 12 months and it will replace the failing grade. I will most proably retake the class but when should I retake it?\n\nEdit: What are some tips y'all have for repeating a failing class?",

      "text": "Did you fail by a lot or a little? Sometimes, if it\u2019s not your interest, it can be better to just let it be. You\u2019ll end up spending more time trying to bring that mark up, while other courses get lower marks because you\u2019re spending a lot of time on one course.  You have to weigh out what\u2019s best for you overall, academically and mentally. \n\nStudy habits- take you academic services and ask for study help. It may be the style of assessment that is hurting you, but they can help you figure out how to maximize your learning style. \n\nIn terms of retaking it- summer can be great if it\u2019s your only course so you can dedicate your time to that course, rather than trying to balance that with 3-4 other courses. \n\nA lot of students fail a course at least one, it\u2019s not as life altering as you think it is now. I failed 2 courses my first year, after realizing I was in the wrong program, switched majors, and graduated with the gold medal in my faculty, have 2 masters and working on my PhD. My husband failed a course and he has a masters and is an MD now. So try to relax a bit and not let it ruin you.",

Ask the college about their repeat policy and ask for help with studying habits. The college is there not only to teach - but they also should be supporting you so you can succeed. \n\nYou are not the first to fail, you won't be the last! We have all been there at one point!",
