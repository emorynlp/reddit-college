  "title:": "I'm in a tricky situation with my world history paper right now.",
  "text": "I recently got feedback for my world history paper. The topic I've chosen was the Spanish Flu. One of the main complaints I got from my professor was that my paper wasn't specific enough. Like, it didn't make a specific enough argument when talking about the Spanish Flu. As a result, my paper was all over the place with potential arguments I could make with where I could go with a specific argument. Unfortunately, no matter which argument I choose, I have to stick with it and take out certain sources. \n\nI could go with how the healthcare industry was not strong enough to deal with this pandemic, why World War I made the Spanish Flu pandemic worse, or even why conspiracy theories made this pandemic go as out of control as it was. **I CANNOT mention anything about COVID-19 in this paper**.\n\nThe final paper is due on 12/6 and is worth 125 points. So whichever argument I make, I would have to choose now and would have to take out certain sources no matter how much I don't want to. Wish me luck on the paper!",

You can use Google scholar too, and you might find some digitized books in Google or archives.org that coud be primaries.. Jstor is my favorite database.",

If you feel you are short on time, pick the topic with less bibliography yet enough to have content, otherwise pick the long bibliography topic. Wish you best of success with this!",

      "text": "I would do 15ish min of research finding more (potential) sources per argument and chose your argument based on how good your sources are. Most profs appreciate having lots of evidence cited as well , to bolster your argument. Plus if you need to turn your 10 page paper to only have one argument and want to keep it still at 10 pages, you\u2019ll might need loads more sources. Also, outline! Even a 5 min outline will help you keep your paper from going \u201call over the place,\u201d which you may need since you seem interested in the topic and have done extensive research on multiple areas:) (Also, if your school has a writing center, I recommend checking it out!) \n\nI have only written a handful of long papers, as I\u2019m a stem major, so maybe take my advice with a grain of salt based on your experiences, BUT that ^^^ is what I would do, and I\u2019ve been successful in all my papers so far. Best of luck OP!! \n\n(Sorry for any errors, I\u2019m on mobile)",
