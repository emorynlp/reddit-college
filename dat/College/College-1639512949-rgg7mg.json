  "text": "hey everyone! i tried to post this in the financial career subreddit and got taken down so let\u2019s try here.\n\ni graduated from high school last may and currently waiting to go to bmt (air force). i didn\u2019t perform well in high school, didn\u2019t take the sat or act, and only did two APs (art and physics) so i don\u2019t have a competitive resume. every since i was in middle school, my interest for finance has been growing and ultimately that\u2019s what i want my career to be in (CIB, or consulting). \n\nwould it be wise to go grind a no name four year uni or grind a cc and cross my fingers i can then transfer to a semi or target? i\u2019m a little apprehensive of the second choice as if i don\u2019t get accepted to the target schools (then im back to the first choice which then i should\u2019ve done in the first place.",

      "text": "Honestly, just wait it out till your GI benefits kick in for college. What you lack in grades/schooling resume will be made up for in your military experience and you'll get in almost anywhere. Plus you'll have up to 3 years post service to pick any state as your home state and get that in state tuition. For instance, my brother didn't do too well in high school but he knew he wanted to do a stint in the Marines. He got out last May (2020) and even though he enlisted out of the midwest, he picked California as his new residence since he lived there during his contract and is familiar with the area.",

              "text": "Yeah, definitely. I'm not sure exactly when, but I think GI benefits kick in 2/3 of the way through your first contract. I never served so I don't have the details. But in any case you'll need to wait a bit before the benefits start (specifically for college, other benefits are immediate like healthcare and such). \n\nA part of your GI benefits for schooling if you wait till the end of your enlistment contract is getting BAH (housing assistance) while in school. It's a base rate plus more for higher cost of living. I think base rate is around $850 per month, but both Chicago and NYC are higher cost of living so you'll get more to help with rent. A friend of mine went Navy, her base was Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and she decided to stay in Hawaii. Her BAH ended up close to 3K caise cost of living is insanely high in Honolulu. I don't think you'll get BAH if you start school while still in, especially since you'll live on base unless you're married or higher ranked.",
