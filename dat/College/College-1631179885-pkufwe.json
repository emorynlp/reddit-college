  "text": "I wear my mask because I don\u2019t wanna get sick again. They pack us into tiny rooms with 5 million students and 2 are wearing masks.\n\nMy professor who is also a medical doctor mentioned the \u201cmu\u201d strain of covid. It\u2019s a new strain that so far they\u2019ve found the vaccine is ineffective against. Y\u2019all need to wear a mask. I don\u2019t wanna get sick again. Our professors must be pissed that they\u2019re exposed to covid and no one is making students take safety measures. It\u2019s not fair to them or other students. Sure I could do distance learning but I\u2019ll fail math if I don\u2019t take it in person.\n\nEdit: If y\u2019all are that immature and bored with your lives that you feel the need to talk shit in my DMs suit yourself just know it\u2019s not gonna change the way I live or feel \ud83d\udcaf",

I have to pack up and leave in 3 hours to my dorm and the last time I went there 2nd wave of covid hit my country and many students were quarantined and kept in the worst condition. Almost no access to medication   definitely not food suitable for patients. Luckily I tested negative and got to go home. At present my state is highly affected , it's like covid never decreased here but my college doesn't consider these factors and reopened college risking everyone's health only cause they'll be facing financial loss if they don't reopen now. It's depressing I genuinely am fearful of going there and not be able to return back home cause we live in a pandemic and educational institutions couldn't give two shits.",

      "text": "There is risk inherent everywhere in life. We cannot prevent every covid death; it is unfortunate, but people will die of covid, just as people will die of other causes. People will die of heart disease, the flu, cancer, car crashes, etc., and so will people die of covid, which is becoming endemic regardless. It is time to hold covid to the same standard as other causes of death and stop making moral outrages about spreading covid being a personal failure of responsibility. We have to stop living in fear of scenarios like \"but what if such-and-such person gets covid\" because there are plenty of factors in life besides covid that we need to pay attention to; prioritizing covid above everything else in life is psychologically unhealthy. \n\nFor the record, I am in favor of the covid vaccine; I am vaccinated and at this point the ground on which arguments against this vaccine stand get shakier as time continues to pass. However, making moral outrages about not getting the vaccine is unproductive, won't convince people to get vaccinated, and in fact makes people with varying degrees of hesitancy dig in their heels more against the vaccine. The vaccine is effective, but we cannot compel people to get it if we want to maintain trust in relevant institutions. No wonder the CDC has lost a lot of trust given how Fauci isn't interested in educating the public in a reasonable fashion; he is so out of touch with the average American that he thinks they are just too stupid to do any better but comply indefinitely. \n\nAll this to say: at some point individual rights and liberties, which are among the fundamental building blocks of Western civilization, cannot be neglected any longer. It is mentally destructive to live in fear indefinitely, I know because I struggled academically and socially last year. Living life normally again (which the vaccine can facilitate) cannot be considered conditional. Given that rights and liberties are not conditional on there not being crises, and that simply existing does not infringe on anyone's rights, it is therefore beyond time to accept that life will go on, and perpetually fearing covid is unproductive in so many ways. This is perhaps a harsh assessment of mine, but some things are inevitable in this world.\n\nTL;DR: Generally speaking, fearing covid indefinitely will get in the way of living life in a productive and healthy fashion, and accepting risks in life, especially with covid becoming endemic, is inevitable.",

They\u2019re not taking it seriously at all and it\u2019s putting my school and the entire town in danger because of the horrible control over the pandemic here.

Then the school tried placing hard protocols on it but all the parents complained and went to the district and ultimately the school got a lot of heat for it and some pending cases to it , so they took out the hard protocols and right after they had to cancel the football season cause half the team got infected and guess who they blamed the school again lol. At this point I give a lot of respect to the school cause they try but the town is just filled with assholes so they don\u2019t care about covid, they only start caring until their loved ones get affected and even then people don\u2019t care",

Or that after vaccines we would never see new variants that might evade them? \n\nMy school is now mandating masks and vaccines. I have no moral or ethical qualms with that. Still, GREAT, now I can sit in a stuffy classroom with a stuffy mask on for two hours and not see anyone\u2019s face as well as have to talk about twice as loud to be heard properly. And Delta is MUCH more transmissible, so I sort of laugh at the fact we were online last year with a *much less contagious variant* and now that there is a much much much more contagious one? And we have higher transmission rates than last year? \n\nWe\u2019re in classrooms with masks on. *facepalm* If that was the plan/solution all along, why didn\u2019t someone think of that last year\u2026????\n\nI\u2019d almost rather be online and at least get to see people\u2019s faces\u2026",

I'm also immunocompromised + have been wearing my mask everywhere despite having the vaccine because I don't trust these people with my health. I don't trust that any of them *actually* have the vaccine. I hate being in fear of getting sick + possibly having the c-word but it's always a possibility because of the way no one has any regard for anyone else's health :(",

Slowing down cases isn't about you dude. Its about protecting those that can't get vaxxed. \n\nAlso, with 90% of the country going back to normal cases are rising. The hospital in my town is full. My sister broke her arm and was treated in a hallway because the beds are full of covid patients. \n\nThe lack of compassion people have is astounding.

I do apologize if I come off as uncompassionate if I think that wearing a piece of cloth over your face is something everyone should be doing to minimize the risk to people who can't get vaxxed. Im so fucking sorry that you can't \"live your lives\" while wearing a mask. \n\nIts not about you. Healthcare workers are overwhelmed and understaffed because people don't take this shit seriously. People are being turned away from ICUs because there isn't space for them because they're full of covid patients. \n\nAlso, the younger population is absolutely being affected by covid. My best friend who is 23 years old nearly died last winter of covid. One of her coworkers did die of covid, he was 24. Neither of them were overweight but its really really nice to know that you think overweight people just deserve to fucking die. \n\nIts literally a mask. No one is asking you to stop living your life. Just put the cloth over your fucking face and move on",

It still maintains 99% of all infections in the US, and just because Mu has spread to 49 states doesn't mean it will ever become dominant in any of them. Given how new it is, however, it's hard to say exactly how it compares to Delta. I believe that Mu does come with some slightly different concerns than Delta. I've honestly given up on daily research at this point though, so please provide any information you've found if it contradicts or adds to anything I have said.",
