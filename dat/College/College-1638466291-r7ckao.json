  "text": "Alright, so my first semester of college is coming to an end I have my finals next week, and not gonna lie things are going absolutely terrible right now so I'm hoping I can get some advice on what I should do. I have 6 classes and I'm honestly not doing that great in any of them I've struggled a bit throughout the semester I think the majority of them I'm barely getting by however 2 in particular my computer math and data networking classes have been the most difficult and I don't think I'm gonna be passing them even if I somehow do good on the final exams. \n\nSo yeah looking for help although I think I'm kind of just screwed.",

      "text": "So because you're so close to the end of the semester, there might not be much you can do at this point except study for your finals so that you can do the best you can, and hopefully pass to avoid retaking them. In the future, I recommend that you talk with your professors at the beginning of the semester, and ask questions if you don't understand something (not just before midterm exams).",
