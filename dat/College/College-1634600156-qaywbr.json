  "text": "I have really bad ADHD and im prescribed 70mg of Vyvanse and 10mg of Dextroamphetamine. I\u2019ve been taking vyvanse pretty much every day since the third grade (age 21 now) and my dosage has been 70mg as long as i can remember. i use the dextroamphetamine when the vyvanse runs out and i have lots of homework still to do. I have a test tomorrow (which I\u2019m not too worried about) and a test Wednesday which i am beyond screwed for. I took the vyvanse this morning and about 2 hours took dextroamphetamine. I have been thinking about taking vyvanse in about 4 hours (10pm) to keep me up through the night and then again in tomorrow morning to last me through the day. I\u2019m putting this in here to ask your guy\u2019s opinion. Do you think this is worth? At this point in time i feel completely fucked and that this is my only option. Also\u2026any tips to reduce the negative effects i may feel if i do this?",

      "text": "Proper sleep schedule helps your brain sort and convert short-term memories into longer-term memories.  \n\nThis is the key to information retention.  \n\nIn most cases an all-nighter this close to the test is more harm than good.  \n\nStay up later tonight and study. But go to sleep.  \n\nStudy harder tomorrow. But get a reasonable amount of sleep.  \n\nI'm sure the \"How to be a healthy young adult\" handbook says you need 8 or 9 hours of sleep, but if you could even get 6 hours of sleep plus an hour of relaxation IMO you'll be in better shape than if you keep yourself up all night for a night and a half \"studying\".",
