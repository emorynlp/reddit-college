  "text": "So I am a first-year who is getting a major in Management and Business Economics and want to have a minor since I am a semester ahead and will be taking classes over the summer. Because of this, I want to take advantage of the fact that I can graduate early by taking other classes that can help me later in my career. I want to know if there are any benefits to having a poli sci minor with a business degree?",
