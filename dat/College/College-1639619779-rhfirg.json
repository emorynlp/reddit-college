If they're along the lines of \"too much work/harsh grader\" then I still take them, but if there are universal issues regarding attitude then I don't.\n\nExample: Had a prof this semester who had a low rating because the reviews said he gave too much work, but it was my favorite course this semester. Had another one with a low rating who I dropped first week, most of the reviews were about how he screamed all the time and was generally an unreasonable person.",

I would always sit in office hours and just talk about world issues and whatnot.
