  "text": "Hello-\n\nI am wondering if I could have a chance to become a PA. I am a junior in college and am pursuing a degree in Speech Pathology. I originally wanted to be a speech pathologist, but since volunteering in a hospital and reading about the flexibility and demand for physician assistants, I want to become a PA. Can I use my bachelors degree in Speech Pathology to apply to PA school?\n\nI currently have a 3.8 GPA, am participating in research with a professor, am a Behavior Therapist, and volunteer at my local hospital. \n\nDo I have a chance at becoming a PA? I told my dad I wanted to become one and  he said it is really hard to become a PA because it is so competitive and the schools are super competitive. This discouraged me.\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated!",
