  "title:": "Should I quit my job and focus on college?",
  "text": "Currently, I\u2019m a sophomore finishing my third semester of school. I have good grades (3.25 GPA overall) but I have an issue. I work a fast food job about 15 hours a week with 16 hours of classes per week. I have worked at this job for about a year and a half, and I have gotten a raise and been in good standing with my boss for almost all of the time. It pays well to say the least. The only issue is that I am constantly anxious. People always call in and I usually have to cover their shifts. In the last 6 months, management changed and in its wake lots of people have quit (some during their shifts) and it makes me incredibly anxious because I\u2019m afraid to plan things if I get called in to work. \n\nAll this to say, I am currently failing one class and taking the final exam tomorrow to hopefully save my grade, part of the reason I feel like I am so stressed about work that it caused my grade in that class to suffer. I am also trying to get myself involved in personal endeavors and it\u2019s impossible to plan anytbibg because of work. \n\nI\u2019m currently living with my parents and they will pay for my rent/food/basic needs as long as I am in college, so I\u2019m not working to make ends meet. Part of me is afraid to quit this job because it brings in good money, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s taking away my happiness as well, and I have not enjoyed it very much at all for about the last half year and have been contemplating resigning since the semester started. Should I focus on school this last semester before my associates degree or am I just being soft? Anybody who has been in the same boat as me, I\u2019d love to hear what you think about this situation.",

Your priority should be your mental health and school. (I say this as a manager at a small coffee shop. I\u2019d never ask the college kids to come in more than what they ask for)",

          "text": "Yeah I think the problem really is taking on the extra shifts. You need to set boundaries, because they are basically just taking advantage of you at this point because they know you\u2019ll say yes.\n\n15 hours roughly a week isn\u2019t bad at all, considering there are 168 hours in a week (of course factor in everything else you do, including sleep). \n\nIt\u2019s just about time management, really. I\u2019d also always suggest seeing a therapist to discuss your anxiety issues. Your job should not be stressing you out this much, so you need to work on setting healthy boundaries and knowing what works for you.\n\nAnd no, you are not in the wrong for setting boundaries. You are not stubborn, you are not being mean, you are not ruining the business and everyone else\u2019s lives. You probably need to hear that. You are entitled to working when you agree to and only when you agree to. An emergency at work on your day off does not mean an emergency for you.",

I realize I am fortunate to be in this situation and I am very thankful. \n\nI did internships and worked in the summer so I don\u2019t feel that not working during the school year affected my job prospects upon graduation. I actually accepted my job offer summer before senior year / 2 years before I started working bc I went on to do a one year masters program.",

      "text": "one of the biggest mistakes students make in community college is prioritizing job over school when they don't need to (yes i understand some people need to). at a certain point you aren't doing it for financial necessity, you're just doing it to avoid school. It's a common trap \u2014 job is easy, don't need to think hard, collect money that you can spend for fun or whatever, whereas you don't see that with school. i had a neighbor who picked up multiple part time jobs yet was not doing very well in school, yet she still lived with her family, parents wished she worked less hours.\n\nin a decade or a few, you won't feel the benefits of working an extra 7-20 hours of minimum wage work, you'll be feeling the effects or missing out on a higher salary or better job because they didn't like your GPA, or you couldn't get a good enough GPA for (competitive) internships that affect your ability to get a better first job/salary.\n\nso while in a decade nobody will look at your GPA, they'll look at your job history, which is affected by your previous jobs and first job, which is affected by your college resume (GPA/internships). For new grad positions, nobody has ever hired a graduate with worse GPA and lots of part-time minimum wage work over another applicant with higher GPA and (competitive?) internships.",

That is, if you enjoy studying. If you enjoy your job more, take less classes. If you enjoy your classes more, work less. If the job won\u2019t reduce your hours, quit. Also, a professor can\u2019t say \u201chey you\u2019re cut from my class, I\u2019m no longer grading your assignments, leave.\u201d But a boss ABSOLUTELY can and will if it helps their bottom line.
