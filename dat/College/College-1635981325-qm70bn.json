  "text": "Recently the thought of becoming an Environmental (it could be something like immigration as well) Lawyer has popped up in my head and I've been thinking about it. I've always liked politics and I always naturally succeded in things like Model United Nations and public speaking like events for my school (more of this in a bit) and always had an ease with English although I live in Mexico. I obviously care about the climate and I feel like dedicating part of my life to help would be a positive thing. I also recently thought about political science and about going somewhere in academia in a field like that or at least similar.\n\nAs I said before, although I have Aspergers, I've never felt weird or awkward talking in front of a stage or any sort of public speaking (some of my teachers have even congratulated me leading me to believe that maybe this is what I'm good at) and I've always liked it as well. So after a lot of thought going through what I might want to do as a professional, I've hit the idea of becoming either some type of academic or lawyer but I feel like I want to do both. Do you think there's a way of mixing both of them? I know Woodrow Wilson did something similar.",

      "text": "\" I've always liked politics...\" My original degree was in Political Science.  Before taking it as a major, its important to know that Political Science is only slightly related to politics.  Political Science is actually the study of government and its related institutions.  That is a disappointment to some students, who expect to regularly discuss current issues and political campaigns.",
