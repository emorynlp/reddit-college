I\u2019m only supposed to get 15 to 20 hours a week and I\u2019m getting 40. I still live with my parents, and could get by with just 15 hours.",

      "text": "Ask to have a meeting with the scheduling manager and sit down to talk about your hours. It can be quick, but it should be formal and you should have each other\u2019s full attention. Explain that your priority is school and if they can\u2019t accommodate that, then you\u2019ll need to leave. If you were hired as part time, bring that up. Most places would rather have someone part time than not at all. If they agree to cut back your hours, hold them to that. If they won\u2019t, hand in two weeks notice right then. \u201cI appreciate your time, but this just isn\u2019t going to work out for me right now.\u201d Everywhere is hiring right now. You\u2019ll find something else. Work hard your last two weeks so that\u2019s their final impression of you and you\u2019ll get a good reference. \n\nBut it\u2019s also worth noting that it\u2019s the peak of holiday shopping right now. If you\u2019re in retail, you might be full time temporarily, but by next semester, you\u2019ll be able to be part time again. Either way, it\u2019s important to have that meeting with your manager so there\u2019s clear communication and expectations going both ways.",
