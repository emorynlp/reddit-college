  "text": "So I'm going to college a little bit late, I'll turn 23 before the Fall 2022 semester which is when I've applied for. I don't know if it would be a bit preemptive to join housing facebook pages for the colleges I've applied to to try and line up potential housing options, or if it would be weird since I'll be older than most freshman. I don't mind roommates since I've always had them, it's just that the colleges I've applied to are pretty far across the US from my current living situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm kind of drunk on a monday I just wanted to know if anyone had some pointers for looking for roommates or rooms for rent",
