  "text": "At U of Utah, food is not good. Around the U there are only a few restaurants. You have to take a train or bus to get to other areas of SLC and suburbs (luckily train and bus are free for students). I won\u2019t name the specific place, but let\u2019s just say I once got fried chicken that had literal blood in it and got burn grilled cheese multiple times (how can you mess up grilled cheese??). Luckily the places near are really good.\n\nI\u2019m curious about your university food scene!",
