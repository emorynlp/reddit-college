  "text": "Im an undergrad TA in the intro science class. I don't do any grading and mostly just host office hours and help the professor with discussion questions at the end of the lecture. There's a student taking the class who gave me their number offering to help me for another class I'm taking (They took the course last year). We are both the same grade. Is it weird or okay if I reached out to them for 1) study help but also 2) to get to know them more personally? They're cute.",
