  "text": "So one of my classes that I\u2019m taking is an advanced language class which mostly has seniors and juniors and I\u2019m like one of the only freshman and idk I placed into the class and I\u2019m doing decent but sometimes when we do work I just feel like everyone around me is doing so much better and I feel that I don\u2019t belong in that class :( the prof moves pretty fast too and like I said I\u2019m doing decent but it\u2019s kind of a discouraging feeling when all the people around me know more stuff and are more confident in their work. Any way I can overcome this and feel better about myself in class?",

      "text": "The only cure for this is hard work and study on your part.\n\nRemember, if everybody else in the class *truly does know more or have stronger abilities than you do*, then what you're feeling isn't imposter syndrome, it's merely a true recognition that you aren't as far along as they are.  In any event, it's not shocking that juniors and seniors might have more advanced skills than you do, despite what a placement test said.  Of course, that doesn't mean you're bad or dumb or shouldn't stay in the class, it just means that your skills are less developed compared to theirs.  So the only way to catch up is by working hard on the areas where you seem to be behind.\n\nGood luck.",
