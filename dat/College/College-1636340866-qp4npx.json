It was difficult at my college because most people either came with a preexisting group of friends from high school, or they formed cliques in their own dorm, rarely hanging out with anyone outside their own clique. I was extremely bored for most of my first semester. I made my first group of friends a few months in when I ran into some people playing mafia. They were happy to let me join, and that\u2019s how it started.",

To me, the point of college is to branch out from your existing group where you came from, but too many people tend to miss the point of it. \n\nIt generally gets better after freshman year. Freshman year is when people are at their most insecure, causing them to default to hanging out with who they are most familiar with. I didn\u2019t have this problem because I grew up going to travel camps as a teenager, so being away from home wasn\u2019t really that new for me. But most people have never done anything like that in their lives, and this is all new and scary to them. \n\nI think that transferring can be a good idea if the academics and social scene aren\u2019t doing it for you (they certainly didn\u2019t do it for me where I went), but I\u2019m not sure if transferring to be closer to people you already know is the best idea. \n\nTake it from someone who has already graduated.",

Roommate #1 is super chill and we occasionally chat, but mostly we just let each other be. Roommate #2 is low-key rude to me, ie if my other roommate is in the room she asks if it's ok to turn off the overhead lights, but if I am alone she just turns them off no matter what time of day it is or what I am doing. Both of my roommates have friends and frequently spend time out of the room, and I spend 99% of my time in the room alone. I'd say that as long as the not talking to your roommate isn't causing problems (ie my experience with Roommate #1), that is perfectly ok. Everyone has their own experiences, and there is no right way to experience college. But if it is an angry silence, or if your roommate is making you uncomfortable in the way they share your room (ie my experience with Roommate #2), I would talk to your RA or whatever your school has and try to resolve your issues.",
