  "text": "My (20f) roommate \u201cTammy\u201d (24f, fake name) and I have been living together in a college dorm room since September. We actually got along pretty well which is why this situation is so shocking to me. We spent a lot of time together in and out of our room until a week ago.\n\nFor some context, Tammy is a very assertive person and I am not, at all. She is definitely used to getting her way because most of the time stuff doesn\u2019t bother me and I prefer to keep the peace because of health issues that stress aggravates.\n\nOur good roomie relationship suddenly ended a week ago. What set Tammy off was me firmly saying no to her putting a shelf on my side of our sink counter because I have a much smaller section than she does, and she has some borderline hoarder tendencies with a ton of stuff all over the counter. She had already asked twice before so I said the area is already cluttered and it would really bother me if there was any more, so no.\n\nTammy then left the room without a word. I immediately noticed this because we always say something before we leave as a curtesy, and we both are morning people who always stay in the room in the evenings.\n\nThis became a recurring thing, her leaving the room when I\u2019d enter it, and not coming back until an hour well past when I usually go to bed. She also stopped speaking to me pretty much at all. Then she would purposefully walk right past me while ignoring me when we saw each other around campus.\n\nI sat down with Tammy and asked what was wrong. She said that she was really mad that I had turned our overhead light off too early one night (she never said anything about this at whatever time it happened) and that I had said no to her shelf. I told her that it upset me that she would treat me this way over a light and a shelf. Tammy said sorry and asked if we were ok, and I said yes but that I was still hurt. Then she curled up on the floor and cried. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was manipulative so I didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nNothing ended up changing. For the next several days Tammy went right back to acting how she had before. I asked her again why she was still treating me this way, and she said she didn\u2019t know and have a half-assed sorry.\n\nToday I talked to my RA about this and she said that I didn\u2019t have to worry considering Tammy was looking for another roommate and leaves for winter break tomorrow night. I was shocked because I wanted to fix this situation and had no clue Tammy had any intention of moving out. Just days before this all started we both expressed we wanted to continue living together for the rest of the academic year.\n\nI am just floored right now and really hurt. It seems she had no intention of telling me she was leaving, and single rooms are more expensive. She comes back this evening from some event and I have no idea what to say or do.\n\n(I have decided to live alone next semester and I can afford it, and as we live in a dorm there is no lease situation to deal with.)",

      "text": "Losing a friend or even close acquaintance really sucks. Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t sound like there was much this girl offered you other than gracing you with her time. I know it still feels shitty, but try to remember that you deserve friends who won\u2019t act this way. She clearly doesn\u2019t value the friendship as much as you do, and that isn\u2019t fair to you. Try not to give this girl anymore of your time or emotion; she isn\u2019t deserving of it.",
