  "title:": "Advice needed for liberal tech theater college for hs non-binary niece",
  "text": "She asked me to help find a school in or very near a big city where it\u2019s cool or cold. Cities she prefers are NYC, Boston, Chicago, Indy, and areas near MD and northern Va.\n\nShe\u2019s a high school junior now in GA , very involved in her school tech theater. Makes A-B grades, some AP classes. Has mild disabilities like dyscalculia that aren\u2019t always apparent but basically it means she\u2019s very bad at math and writes messy. The content of her writing is excellent, though. \n\nShe\u2019s in regular hs math classes and able to get by, but prefers not to take math much after high school.\n\nWants the options to major in history, poly sci and theater tech.\n\nWants to go to grad school after college. Not sure on what she wants to do later, but maybe theater teaching or something with backstage theater.\n\nMoney is not an issue as family will pay for her education.\nShe wants to live on Campus. \nIt must be trans, gay, lesbian friendly and liberal.\n\nMust be small to medium sized where most students are ages 18-22. Must have a high rate of graduation because she is very influenced by seeing that. If her friends are in school she wants to be in school too. If they drop out she likely will.\n\nAlso wants an option to study abroad a semester in China or the UK through her college program. \nShe\u2019s motivated now. Is overwhelmed with the college search. I found her current school which she likes.\n\nThat\u2019s why she (and her mother) asked me to research school ideas.",
