  "text": "There\u2019s a 50-50 chance that I don\u2019t get the C required to move on to Calculus 3, so I may have to retake it next semester. The professor I have now is teaching a section and another professor I haven\u2019t had before also. I was thinking to go with the one I didn\u2019t have because my current professor isn\u2019t making any sense, but on the other hand, he allows people to retake an exam once a semester and I don\u2019t know how the other one does it. Any suggestions",

              "text": "Then I\u2019d stick with the same professor. The class average is only partly due to the professor, and very well could be due to the students. I know you said that this is a prerequisite for Calculus, so I\u2019d try going online and finding someone who can essentially tutor you. Alternatively, you could get with a TA to seek additional help in the class. Just my 2 cents though.",

Just take the same prof its like the old expression \"better the bastard you know than the one you dont\" you know what to expect for the tests and the class as a whole \n\nGot a D+ and earned it frankly so had to retake and got A- \n\nIf I were you I'd just take the same prof if you don't pass this semester",
