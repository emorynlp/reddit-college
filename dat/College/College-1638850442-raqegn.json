  "text": "TW: loss of a family member\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI typed out this message to send to my professors after hearing that my Aunt passed away this morning.\n\nI am not sure what to put in the subject line:\n\n*Dear Professor,*\n\n*Without going into too much detail, I have received word that there has been a death in my family today. I will be attempting to keep up with assignments to the best of my ability, though I am unaware of the level of productivity I will be able to maintain over the next couple of days.*\n\n*I wish not to be of any inconvenience, however, if there is any possibility I could be granted a small extension on assignments due before the end of the week, it would be appreciated more than words can express.*\n\n*Additionally, I understand this email may not be composed in the best way, so feel free to ask for any clarification.*\n\n*Thank you,*\n\n*(my name)*",
