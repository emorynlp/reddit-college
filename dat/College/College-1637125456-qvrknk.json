  "text": "I was reviewing for a midterm and found the solutions provided by the professor/TA are very similar to my HW. Not only the code but also the explanations for the code are almost just the same as my answers. I checked a few more (I seldom read solutions unless before an exam) and around half of the solutions looked like a copy of my HW except minor changes. Tbh it's creepy when I read solutions and could not even distinguish them from my own assignments. I want to email professor regarding this but I am at a loss. I have no idea who is responsible for writing solutions, may be the TA or the professor, and I do not know if it is \"normal\" to directly copy a student's solution as the \"official\" solution...? I think it'll be much better if they asked me before directly using my answers, but is it a justifiable reason?",

      "text": "Faculty here.  In general, I think most faculty *do* tend to ask a student before sharing that student's work, even if it's for something positive like holding up the work as exemplary test/assignment responses, and even if the student is kept anonymous.  So what your professor did does seem a little unusual to me.\n\nBut is there any law or policy that requires faculty to do so?  No, not that I've ever heard of at any of the universities where I've worked, other than the requirement that student grades should not be shared publicly.  So as far as I know, the professor didn't break any official rule as long as you were not directly identified as the author of the material.  It's possible that some schools might have stricter policies.\n\n>I want to email professor regarding this but I am at a loss.\n\nIf you want to bring this up with the professor, all that's required is a short and simple email.  Just write \"Dear Prof. So-and-So, I noticed that the answers you shared for the last homework/test/whatever are nearly identical to my submitted answers.  I appreciate that my work was thought good enough to serve as model answers, but in the future, I would prefer that my submitted work not be shared with the rest of the class.  Thank you.\"\n\nThat's it, nothing more complicated than that is necessary.\n\nGood luck.",
