First off, Trump thinks he\u2019s doing a great favor to the US by restricting H1-B visas but it\u2019s not really working that way( especially for tech). Now this decision by ICE simple shows how stupid the administration is. I really don\u2019t understand why they want to strip access to quality education from talented people ( who are foreign nationals ) studying in the US. It\u2019s not like y\u2019all aren\u2019t making money off of us! Additionally, it is such a HORRIBLE act to force students to travel during this pandemic, shell out even more money in this difficult time and risk not being able to come back. Even forcing universities to have in-person classes. Seems to me like this is the message they are sending:\u201d Hi! We  would love for you to contract the virus and make your life even more difficult, especially you foreign nationals. We would like you to not be educated in our homeland. Don\u2019t come work here either, so more US citizens can be successful.\u201d\n\nMoreover, half of the most talented researchers in tech are foreign nationals. It seems like the US being a tech hub is literally doing everything in its power to lose that status. Having a president who thinks consuming disinfectants can cure COVID and is against foreign nationals entering the country only makes out situation worse.  I really don\u2019t see why they have to take such harsh and stupid decisions like these. Jobs fine, you think we\u2019re taking away something from US citizens. But an education, seriously ? We international students first of all have a lot of restrictions while studying and working. We pay a helllll of a lot more money than citizens, we have no access to scholarships / financial aid. Why in the world can\u2019t we just study in peace despite having so many things that already make an education in the US so tough for us ? Really wish we had better individuals making such important decisions. Sorry for lashing out but this is just total blasphemy and I understand some of you may not agree with my opinions and that\u2019s your choice but these are my opinions and I stand by them.\n\nTLDR: They are stripping talented international students from quality education and are making their life hell by forcing them to travel. Just shattering their dreams and making all their sacrifice worthless.",

But that's negated by the fact that schools might have to raise tuition to offset the loss in revenue from int'ls who mostly pay full tuition, or from domestics who are on leave due to the pandemic... So education access won't even be a thing.",

I'm sure you don't need me to elaborate more. I'd be totally fine with the F1 decision if it could help fix that.

I hope TRUMP just serves his last year and GET oUT!!! I bet when the schools start getting COVID, they\u2019re going to have to shut them down but the incompetent government probably will just let it go and let the death toll continue to rise! They\u2019re going to spread this even more because they\u2019re incompetent stuppppiidityy!! I hope that sick bastard Trump gets sentenced to jail for his crimes here !! So gross, he said nasty things about his own daughter!!! He is sick and bloated, ugly, cherry red looking face!!!",

They can't do that now because it would force a lot of international students currently in the US to have to leave, amidst closed borders, travel bans, limited flights etc. So they will go hybrid, i.e. a mix of online and in-person classes.\n\nThe current wording suggests that students cannot do a fully-online course load no matter where they are:\n\n>Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools adopting a hybrid model\u2014that is, a mixture of online and in person classes\u2014will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,\u201d certifying that the program is not entirely online, **that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester**, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students pursing vocational degrees, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses.\n\nBut I don't even know if they have that power, i.e. if visas can be revoked or entries cut off while you're outside of the US.",

Have it be an actual class, but have the grading be flexible. There are some university classes that are mandated to be Pass/Fail. Professors can choose to pass on the most minimal of circumstances. I have seen classes where a class grade of 20 translated into an A-.\n\nThere's nothing fraudulent about having international students take a Pass/Fail class where they are taught pop culture/american values in order to let them have more appropriate relationships with the rest of the students, that is taught on a regular basis, with simple material that is tested on. Of course, then, such a course would have to continue for at least a few more semesters in order to build up the claim it isn't a fraudulent class, and then claim they're cutting it due to ineffectiveness and that such will instead be done via an extensive orientation/exam to place out of it and then \"reduce\" the workload and credit hours.\n\nThis kind of thing happens all the time, just usually not for the sake of having international students be able to meet legal requirements. Yes it sucks that they'll have to mingle in person but it will limit the amount of spread that exists, and allow these students to still take their normal classes without issue, online.\n\nEdit: the example I gave about those international student only classes being online was to show that these classes already exist in a \"tokenistic\" manner without issue from the perspective of being in person doesn't actually matter to the course.",

And international students print money into the US economy since they're consumers not eligible for basically any government programs. It doesn't even create much job opportunity cause F1 students don't tend to be in the workforce for very long. Most leave within a few years after graduating and many end up in US grad schools. The ones that stay long tend to be high skilled workers which are always in demand by every country.\n\nI don't think the US is concerned about stopping the import of COVID considering how badly it's doing with the virus right now. At best it just helps domestic students get into a slightly better college, and housing to become a little more affordable in college towns... But those college towns will already be struggling due to how many domestic students are just taking classes from home. I don't think an affordable housing crisis is what's hitting a Berkeley or an Ann Arbor the most. Rent prices are already dropping. Due to the pandemic, many of their small businesses' customers are gone. This makes that problem even worse.\n\nSuch a horrible, shortsighted decision omg I'm so mad for the people that are screwed over by this. Seems like an election year move that actively hurts everyone. At least suspending work visas can be argued as nationalistically beneficial, but this makes 0 sense to me. Maybe it makes sense if Putin or Jinping came up with it. This is going to really hurt the American education system and economy as a whole.",
