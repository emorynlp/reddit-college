  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nThis is my first semester at a four-year university. When I originally applied for early acceptance over a year ago, I really wanted to be a bio major but since then my priorities have shifted and I have now decided to apply for nursing school with my first-year grades. The nursing schools I\u2019m interested in weigh GPA very heavily and are quite competitive, only allowing in 3.5+ for transfer students. \n\nRight now, I\u2019m in five classes. The two I\u2019m struggling with a little are Intro to Calculus and Intro to Chemistry. I\u2019m doing okay in both of them, but I feel like I\u2019m only able to give half my effort in each one and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to pull a great grade out of both of them. My add drop deadline was a few weeks ago, but I\u2019ve been considering withdrawing from Chemistry so I can focus on the other four more heavily. My thought process is that four A\u2019s that I put all of my effort into would be better than, say three A- and two B\u2019s or C\u2019s that I was stretched thin for. \n\nIt\u2019s just difficult because I\u2019m actually doing okay in these classes (my guess is I\u2019m sitting around a B, maybe B- in both Chem and Calc right now, but this is me pretty much working nonstop). Is it worth it to take a W on one of these to boost my grade in the other four, or potentially have a lower GPA at the end but have completed all the classes? Is there anything I might not be aware of that I should consider?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Program needs a high GPA more than anything. Worth it to get a high GPA by withdrawing from the hardest class to lighten my workload, even if I'm not doing THAT bad in it?",
