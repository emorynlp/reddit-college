If you're going to classes, then going right back home.... yeah, you're not going to make any friends. You should still be doing things on campus like study groups, playing intramural sports, joining clubs, etc.\n* People \"happy in the circle they're in\" can still be sources of new friends. Even if they don't have the desire to make new friends, you could still find out about things from them- Party tonight at X's house, Y is looking for 2 players on their intramural soccer team, Z still needs a lab partner.",

I had a few experiences where some \u201cfriends\u201d felt a bit awkward to meet up and greet because I was 3 years older. I know I haven\u2019t mentioned this on the earlier post but I definitely feel like it\u2019s a contributing factor.\n\nBut this weekend I made time to go to my first hackathon so I\u2019m a bit excited about that!",

Keep your living space clean and at least somewhat decorated\n\n3. Begin the day by listing 3 positive experiences you had the day before\n\n4. Go outside and walk as much as you can\n\n5. Take 5 to 10 minutes to do nothing. I literally mean nothing. Clear your mind of all thought and sit in a comfortable area. \n\n\nThese are all things that I've noticed make me function as a human being better. Good luck!",

I myself haven't gone to class in pajamas, but I have gone to the student center and hung out in the dorm common room in a flannel nightgowns.\n\nETA: a frequently referenced joke is that we look like the \"gays going to brunch\" meme.

Obviously if it\u2019s a class of like 200 or more people and everything is posted online then it\u2019s not important. But in smaller classes having your professor at least know who you are can be useful for a few reasons. First of all, they\u2019re going to be a lot more willing to help you out in office hours if you\u2019re someone who attends class and actively participates than they\u2019ll care much about someone who never attends. It depends on the professor, but you also might be more likely to get an extension on an assignment if you really need it and the professor actually knows you because you go to class. You also want professors to be familiar with you if you\u2019re seeking letters of recommendation or research opportunities or anything like that.",

Not to mention, there are many benefits to going to college. I would recommended it if your ideal career requires it and you can do it without debt.\n\n>Degrees aren't required to be successful in life.\n\nOf course not, you only need them if you want a career that requires it for the job or the licensure to get said job.  Fortunately, many people are realizing this. Hopefully, those whose careers require it/ will benefit from it will come. I think less people should be going to college (uni) in general. I never really came from a high school that emphasized college as the end-all-be-all and was open-minded to going to learn dental hygiene or HVAC repair at the local community college or trade school, or the military. Because of my HS, I never really understood the supposed stigma, everyone I know respects their local tradesmen and education isn't really emphasized here where I live.\n\nJust my $0.02",

We shouldn't be demonizing other post-high school paths just because college is the norm. This just gets me very upset as someone who didn't have the ideal college experience (I'm only just graduating in December after 5.5 years of college). No one who didn't that \"cookie cutter\" college experience should have to justify the decisions they made. I've said this once and I'll say it again: there is no \"right\" way to do college or to do life. Whatever makes the most sense for you, do (as long as it doesn't hurt you or anyone else).",

Go to (rate my professor) there's a possibility the other students before you has taken them and gave them a review.\n\nBut that doesn't mean to take advantage of it of course since its your responsibility to do it by given deadline.\n\nBig advice I got from my dad is to not get a dorm or apartment. It will be a big mistake and would be better to get a house and also start investing your money. If you have the choice in staying with your parent or guardian will be even better since it isnt nessasery in moving if your go to college is close to where you live especially.",

But the price I pay is I can only meet up with a chick or guy friends once every other week at most, along with reddit being the only social media I have and still use. Also GPA very much matters, I've talked to employers who I've worked for during internships. Don't have people who clearly havent worked in a professional field tell you otherwise.

Two very different worlds, but I had a similar result socially. In both cases, I have barely communicated with anyone else in my area of study outside academic classwork and almost my whole social life revolves around the marching band and symphony which I consider my side hobbies.
