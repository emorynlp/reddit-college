  "title:": "College forcing me to take Calc 2 before Calc 1",
  "text": "So I literally bombed my freshman year (online classes and me being a dumbass). I passed classes with very very low grades in my first semester, secend semester, failed 4/5 classes. I wanted to repeat all of the classes again but the college doesn't allow me to do that. It says to repeat F grades before the ones that I barely passed with. How the hell am I supposed to pass Calc 2 without knowing shit about Calc 1? I really want to fix my fuck up and start over but I can't. Courses are starting tomorrow and idk what the fuck to do. I even told my advisor that dude I will fail if I do not know anything about Calc 1. He said I need to repeat my F grades before I can repeat my DD and DC grades (barely passing grades in my college). Makes no sense. Why the fuck? This is so stressful, its 4 am and I want to just cry from all the stress.\n\nI wish I could just drop out and start fresh a few years later but I have strict parents and tbh i do not want to let them down again and I wanted to try my hardest to fix my mistakes but now it seems impossible.",

          "text": "I did speak to my advisor, when choosing the courses I chose Math101 course but he denied it and told me i passed it so take Math 102 instead which I got an F with. I told him i passed with a very low grade and I will fail math 102 without knowing math 101. He said it isn't possible to take it this semester and you are required to take Math 102.\n\nGood point on talking to the chair person of math, since my advisor seems to be no help.\n\nThanks, I'll reach out to other people.",
