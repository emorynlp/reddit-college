  "title:": "Should I report my professor?",
  "text": "So in one of my classes the other day our teacher randomly brought up something that had nothing to do with literally anything. It had nothing to do with the class, it had nothing to do with our books, it didn't even have to do with the conversation we were having at the time. Randomly the professor says \"I need to tell you guys about my sister by the way, she is crazy\". She then continues to explain that her sister who did a lot of drugs in her early years randomly started to act crazy a month prior to when we were in class.\n\nShe then randomly brings the conversation over to Donald Trump. Saying that her sister voted for her and she then asks \"Did anyone here in this class vote for Trump?\" \"I just wanted to know\". Then a student says \"Yeah I want to know too, so we can all see ahead of time\". As I look around the classroom I can see a lot of people get uncomfortable. Black, whites, asians, hispanics, etc, literally everyone is uncomfortable. I did not vote for Trump, matter of fact I did not vote for anyone.\n\nBut this comment made me extremely uncomfortable because it was an attempt to divide the classroom, even if that wasn't her \"intent\". It made me uncomfortable also due to the fact that if anyone did raise their hand, they most definitely would have been shunned as the professor was steering the conversation towards that. Which obviously showed because another student brought up the same thing in a aggressive manner. IDK if I should report her or not but I feel like I should because it is unacceptable in a college classroom. I posted this some where else on Reddit but felt like I should post it here, so other college kids can give me a perspective.",

They do have free speech, but forcing their students to believe the same and using discriminatory practices is where the line is, normally,  drawn. Personally, I think asking if anyone voted for Trump is unprofessional. But, you need to try to resolve this matter with your professor first before going up the chain of command. In fact, the school will, probably, tell you to go back and try talking this issue first.",

OP seems legitimately concerned, and as misguided as it may sound to some of you, you guys need to cool it down and stop forming assumptions based on the few words OP said to us. They\u2019re young. They\u2019re learning.\n\nOP, professors are usually recommended to steer clear of voicing their political opinions in classes (unless the class revolves around it, or they\u2019re trying to steer a class discussion into something productive), but there are no official rules against it so you likely have no ground to stand on for reporting your professor. With the way you\u2019ve explained it, I don\u2019t think your professor had any malicious intent. It seriously just sounded like they were telling a story. Before you jump to conclusions, maybe have a private, respectful discussion with your professor. You can explain why it made you uncomfortable. They\u2019re not likely to do anything about it because just like you, your professor is allowed to express their opinions. But remember, you don\u2019t by any means need to disclose your political leaning in a classroom setting.\n\nAnd before the rest of you guys turn on me, I\u2019m progressive as fuck and vote liberal in every single election.",

      "text": "*to the naysayers: if the Professor had gone on a rant about their nutty liberal relative and made it clear that they disparaged such people, and THEN asked \u201csay, are any of you liberals??\u201d You\u2019d be livid. You\u2019d call it what it is: thought suppression by someone in authority. \nTrump supporters will no longer feel free to discuss in that class without fear of ramifications from that Professor, such as tougher grading or an overall less positive environment. \nAnd I don\u2019t say this simply out of some rosy-eyed ideal. No, it\u2019s strategy. If people \u201cclam up\u201d with their ideas, it becomes ever more challenging to extricate those ideas and help the student examine them and find fallacies. In other words: you\u2019ll never be able to help those students because they\u2019ll never open up to you. Which means they\u2019re more likely to hold onto their beliefs and remain unexamined. They\u2019re more likely to feel victimized, which is a recipe for extremism (seriously, google it). Plus, it\u2019s basic psych: the more practice someone has saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to something, the more likely they are to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in the future. So if they continuously say no to their ideas/beliefs being examined because they\u2019re practiced in saying no and are practiced in having a sense of \u201cvictimization,\u201d and if there\u2019s external evidence supporting their sense of victimization \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f stg this is college, at least act like you know how to use the information you supposedly learned. Though, based on the Professor side of Reddit and their complaints, it\u2019s pretty clear a huge number of y\u2019all are just getting rubber stamped through school. \n\n100% report that Professor, WITH the other students in the class. If you tell this story to people who\u2019ve had this Professor and they report a similar encounter, ask them to sign a letter or something (groups of students are much more difficult to deal with than 1 or 2 pesky little buggers lol). \n\nNo one\u2019s  freedom of thought and conscience should be pressured like that by those in authority/with power over them. That Professor is in a position of authority and is clearly engaging in a breach of ethics. Unacceptable. \n\nHowever, you won\u2019t get much more than a class-level apology, if that. And that\u2019s if the Professor wishes to be polite. UNLESS you\u2019re in Trump land/the admin are trump friendly, in which case things are different.",

Beginning in June 2020, Negy was placed under investigation for misconduct. On January 13, 2021, UCF announced that it intends to fire him for creating a hostile classroom environment, failing to report a sexual assault, deterring students from filing complaints, and providing false information during his investigation.\n\nSounds like perfectly justified \"tone-polic\\[ing\\]\" to me",

OP can tell his professor not to talk about politics and other off-topic subjects, and in this situation, the professor can say \"I will do what I want in my classroom, and you may either stay or leave, your choice\" while the other students laugh their asses off.",

There\u2019s this larger narrative being pushed by right-wing media that colleges indoctrinate or even coerce young people into becoming liberal or leftist which I think is most to blame for this widespread victim complex coming from right-wing college students. \n\nIn almost all cases I\u2019ve ever gotten enough of the facts for though the problem isn\u2019t that the professor has a left-wing bias, but that the student has a right-wing bias. They either don\u2019t or can\u2019t recognize the innocence, sincerity, or goodwill of the professor\u2019s intentions and actions, and they create mountains out of molehills over it.\n\nVirtually all professors (especially those at any school worthy of being called a place of higher ed) are not indoctrinating the youth to become leftists.

If this only happens on occasion, there is no problem.  If its a regular event, there is.\n\nIf this becomes so common that class material is not being taught, you have several options.

I doubled up on gen eds to earn both an AA and an AS at community college, which means I took the same number of math and science courses as humanities. I majored in English with a \\*concentration\\* in creative writing, which means my major classes were comprised of both literature and writing classes. English is one of the most comprehensive majors for understanding how the world works, as it requires us to read widely across multiple genres, tackling every subject from history to psychology. I'm also a year away from finishing my second bachelor's degree, a BS in CS. Yeah, I feel pretty confident that I understand how the world works.  \nETA - Sorry, just to be clear, a BS in CS is a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I'm clarifying because I think you need it spelled out for you.",
