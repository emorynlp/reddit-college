I hear a lot from my friends \"ill work on that later\" \"ill work on that when im in the mood\" you have to learn how to do things even when you dont want to. Last night the last thing I wanted to do was work on a paper, but since its due Tuesday and I work Sunday and have family things going on today, I wrote 5 pages of it. I only relax and watch tv when I feel I've done enough for the day, usually at 11pm or midnight. Every hour I take a 5 min or so break to scroll on my phone but its important to not get sidetracked for hours. You just have to do it, even, *especially* when you dont want to",

I have a friend who studied everyday, for long blocks of time, and still received subpar test scores. Another friend studied half that time and always scored As. My second friend knew what the professor was looking for and what studying styles worked for her whereas my first friend was grinding miserably to memorize everything.\n\nAlso, if one reviews their subject matter on a weekly basis, then they shouldn\u2019t need to cram before a test. Consistent review helps people understand and remember concepts. \n\nThese two tips seem to help my STEM major friends and I found them useful for when I was taking the calculus/chemistry/physics series. Also, time management with a scheduler and timer helps break up and track progress. I would have been so lost without my planner and no timer app to help me keep track of what needed to be done when I juggled my jobs, volunteering, internship, and classes.",

For me it\u2019s about majoring in something you\u2019re passionate about\n\nAnother important point is that it\u2019s okay to major in something that\u2019s not STEM (or something else that\u2019s difficult), or not to have a part time job, or not to have a ton of extra curriculars, or not to have the highest GPA. What\u2019s important is that you\u2019re doing your best, and as long as you\u2019ve got at least a couple of the aforementioned characteristics, you\u2019ll do just fine",
