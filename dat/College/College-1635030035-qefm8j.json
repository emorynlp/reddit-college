  "text": "Hello. I am interested in Pre-Dental. I have decent grades. I want to drop some courses but I will only end up getting 6 credits for the semester. My mental state has been greatly affected by a drug called \"finasteride\" in which affects your testosterone levels and it makes hard to focus and study. I really do not want to suffer from this but I do not want my gpa to be affected.",

      "text": "I know this is a bit off topic but I suffer with PMDD r/pmdd. It's a hormonal fluctuation issue. It definitely affects my productivity and mental state. Hormones really affect so much more than on paper. I would seek treatment asap and the only advice I have for now while you're waiting is good sleep and a good diet and exercise to temporarily make the side effects less awful. This is what I do to make my hormonal fluctuation less horrible. \n\nDespite the different causes (medication side effects/ hormonal imbalances caused by menstruation)  I believe these still help and in the meantime I've found my university's mental health center very helpful. I know I am a ciswoman and my issues are caused by my hormones from menstruation but I still believe whether it's a medication side effect or in my case menstruation, I feel the same pain and advice applies. OP make sure to not be too hard on yourself and take care of your mental health in between now and when you get that appointment for your doctor. I hope all goes well and you are able to find a treatment that works for your medication side effect \u2665\ufe0f",

              "text": "Aww no probs. In the end, I stuck through it all. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder by a school psychiatrist and participated in a DBT therapy group for free at my university with other students in my junior year. It really helped me in terms of not feeling so alone and feeling like my feelings were validated. Then the pandemic happened but I was able to manage better through it. Then in my senior year I got covid and was hospitalized from covid during winter break. The medical treatments (steroids) gave me reactions and long haul covid wasn't pretty. But I eventually made it through and graduated on time and got a job with nice health insurance, a nice paycheck and wonderful coworkers and work environment. \n\nIf someone told me it gets better after college I would have laughed and be like lololol not really. But wow, eating salads, a protein that's not ramen chicken powder and getting 8 hours of sleep. It really made such a difference for me physically and mentally. I know this stuff sounds like \"well duhhh\" but it's impossible to do in college. And hormones don't help. \n\n something that helped me a lot and still helps me is realizing that you will get there. But it's okay to have bad days where you feel intense anxiety, sadness or even weeks or months that are off.\n\n It's okay to be not okay. You feel tired after 8 hours of zoom? It's okay to sleep and wake up and do homework when *you* feel ready. Need space to feel sad? It's okay. I used to cry every 8pm and then sleep, wake up super early 4am  in the morning after a nice sleep and feel a bit better mentally. I would even go down to my school's study areas just for a change of scene to do my work as long as there were other people there.(my college was in a city and as a female I felt safe as long as I wasn't alone in a room). \n It's okay to do things at your pace and when you're ready.",

There honestly is so much shit on my mind and it\u2019s absolutely sucks that it hit me during my sophomore and senior year. Hopefully it\u2019s nothing but up from here and I\u2019m changing myself.

So if it helps, its probably a very stressful field in general *ontop* of the medication side effects that you are battling against. It's not just you. It is a hard major. \n\n Op, I never met you or know you but just want to send you a virtual hug and say i feel so proud of you for how far you've come and how much you are battling. You are being hard on yourself when in fact you are actually up against a mountain.\n\nIf you want to drop out, it's okay. If you want to keep fighting, I'm rooting for you and sending good vibes through Reddit to you.",
