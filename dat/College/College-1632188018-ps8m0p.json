  "text": "So I\u2019m 32 and a first year college student and currently in my 2nd semester. So my first semester my gpa was 3.3 because I had missed a psychology final for a family emergency. I wasn\u2019t allowed to retake. So my question is if I want a goal of at least 3.5\nNext semester do I have to get all A\u2019s at this point ?? Sorry if it\u2019s a dumb question. New to the college thing.",

There\u2019s a plethora of gpa calculators online you can find where you put in the credit hours and final grade and you could play with that to find out what you need to get\n\nEdit: also not a dumb question people half your age struggle with less. Good on you for trying to figure this whole thing out and I wish you the best of luck",
