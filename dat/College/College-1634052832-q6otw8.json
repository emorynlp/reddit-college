  "title:": "I really struggle with using jargon not only in my essays but when I am answering questions or simply studying myself",
  "text": "My majors are Econ and Political Science but I am mostly worried about Economics. I have been an economics student since 9th grade so I'm ashamed to make this post. \n\nI just started my first year and I realized this. I'm not talking about jaw-breaking words that I will have to google. I'm talking about economic terms you get familiar with the more you study. I simply cannot write/speak like that. I assume this will become a problem as I further get into Political Sc as well. \n\nI will say something like: Everything I do is affected by demand and supply. It's all around us (layman words) but my prof/classmates will turn it into a beautiful sentence. I also have a hard time remembering adjectives which will strengthen my answers. \n\nPlease help!!",

      "text": "TA here - **trust me** \\- I'd rather have you spitting facts in common-sense English than an attempt to pretentiously answer a simple question and playing bingo with jargon. \n\nThe language will come with time and essays, it comes more naturally the more often you are confronted with it. Especially with essays, I would recommend planning a day or two extra to really polish the language since you mentioned that it was an issue!",

      "text": "it could be because you don't read enough books and articles where they use formal/academic writing. you will never learn to think of writing or saying things in a more formal or academic way if you do not routinely expose yourself to it.\n\nthe stuff you read doesn't have to be from the same subject, anything will do. Biographies, textbooks, historical books. Anything interesting.\n\ni had a classmate in intro college writing class for community college, he didn't know what \"freight\" was and couldn't an academic essay to save his life (sexism is NOT just about genitalia, folks). He did not read books in high school. Or college.  Possibly never read anything unless he was forced to. Another guy in the 2nd semester honors writing class also didn't read books or news for fun (i suspect he at least read for school), but his writing was at least comprehensible and had a logical flow of information.",
