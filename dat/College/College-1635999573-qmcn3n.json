  "text": "As above, I am a psychology major and I love it yet I still feel as if I\u2019m missing something. I go to a small private college but there isn\u2019t much emphasis on the social behavior and sciences department\u2026. Well people are more interested in sociology but I\u2019m not as much. I would just like to hear other experiences and hopefully I\u2019m doing okay where I\u2019m at or if I should go elsewhere.",
