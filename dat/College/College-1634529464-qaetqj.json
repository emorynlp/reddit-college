  "text": "I'm finally graduating this december after having dropped out for two years, joining the military and finally coming back. I started back up in January at the same school just online. And I've been killing with straight As. Even my advisor was shocked at my complete 180. And now I'm almost done. But I keep finding myself slipping. Waiting until the last minute to turn in assignments and stuff like that. I don't feel that huge rush of motivation I felt in the beginning of the year. I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with my degree, but I have a space on my wall where I'm going to hang it up when it's framed. And when I look at the empty space it helps motivate me a bit. But damn, it's definitely harder. Anyone else ever feel the same?",

      "text": "Yeah school sucks, I\u2019m only on my second year lol lucky you. I lose motivation a lot too. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m here or what I\u2019m gonna do with this damn degree. What keeps me motivated though is looking at my financial statements, I spent a lot already so I gotta keep going and see it through that my money doesn\u2019t go to waste, I think that would work for you since you\u2019ve paid for all those years already, or currently paying them. This is corny but I also think about future me. If I don\u2019t get this degree what the hell is he gonna do with his life? Probably sitting on his parents couch eating chips all day, so I\u2019m trying to do this for him even though it makes me unhappy now, he\u2019ll look back and thank me one day for making his life easier. Good luck!",
