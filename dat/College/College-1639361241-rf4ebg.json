  "text": "Hey, making this for myself and anyone else who experienced this. At my uni grades are basically finalized, I\u2019m probably ending with 4 a-\u2018s and a c. In all honesty, adjusting to uni from COVID online high school was a really big change that took me a while to process. I definitely should\u2019ve spent more time studying throughout the semester. At the end of the day, all you can do is realize your mistakes and improve. I still want to attend a good law school, so this experience reinforces the reality that I need to get as good grades as possible from here on out. Good luck and God bless.",
