I do my studying through podcasts and book readings  that I listen to while I'm at work. I think it's the most efficient way to go back to school especially if you're working or have kids.",

I think in a fully online environment it can be very easy to procrastinate, but if you can avoid that the flexibility is awesome. I can study and finish my work in the ways that best suit me. I've actually found I learn better and do better academically fully online.",
