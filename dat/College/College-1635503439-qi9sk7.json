  "text": "I\u2019m working full time as night shift warehousing and so fucking burnt out. Some days I take 3 hr mental health breaks in the breakroom. I swear I\u2019m not lazy it\u2019s just I want to do a good job but I don\u2019t get any reward for actually trying so here I am in the breakroom right now. My bills are 1200 a month for everything im strongly considering just taking out loans and quitting my job. Planning on going to med school so I\u2019m going to be in debt anyways so fuck it right? There\u2019s no one I can talk to about this by mom doesn\u2019t get it bc she sees my checks at the end of the week and what do I have to complain about? My girlfriend doesn\u2019t have any bills so she doesn\u2019t get it either.\n\nI think it\u2019s the night shift job so I\u2019m going to try to switch to the day shift as well as apply to different jobs at the moment that\u2019s all I can do.",

      "text": "It really depends on your priorities. If you care more about the job drop down to part time status to keep your grades up. If you care more about school work part time or not at all (can get a desk job where you aren't doing physical labor and can do homework). \n\n\n\nMy first year I worked 10pm-7am 5 days a week and had good grades but did nothing but school or work. Now I work 15 hours a week on the weekend.",
