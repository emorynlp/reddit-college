  "text": "Hello Everyone!\n\nSo I am graduating tomorrow and I was just informed by the registrars office that I won\u2019t be able to attend my graduation because I am missing one of my grades. I contacted the Professor and what he told me was \u201cI will enter it when I enter them\u201d basically saying I will enter them whenever I want. I don\u2019t know what to do!!! My entire family is here and it will be a disaster telling them I won\u2019t graduate. I asked the registrars office if I could just attend without that grade posting and they told me, you could\u2019ve applied for a \u201cexemption to walk\u201d back in October. WTF!!!",

The places I\u2019ve been allow participation in commencement (the ceremony) regardless of final grades, but graduation itself (completion of the degree requirements and conferral of the degree) usually gets processed some weeks after and could be delayed based on final grade issues. Either way, the professor should be getting grades in on time if it affects your ability to walk.",

They're the one whose job it is to make profs miserable until they do what they're obliged to do about students. It sounds like this prof is unaware that there is a deadline where you can't walk without the grade entered, and they need someone besides a student to be unforgiving about telling them.",

Hold yourself to the same standards that you hold your students to. OP- I\u2019m so sorry, this really sucks and is pretty shitty of the professor imo. I get it if they have something serious going on, etc but if you were nice, polite, & respectful about asking and explaining the situation then I don\u2019t see the problem. This is why if I don\u2019t have ANY grades by mid-semester (which has only happened a couple of times) I politely email my professor asking about it. At my university there are deadlines for final grades to be entered & they can be altered afterwards, but I find it odd that he\u2019s exempt from this requirement or maybe your uni doesn\u2019t have this policy?",
