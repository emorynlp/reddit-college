  "text": "I am beginning college in Sept. '22, and my goal is to make it to law school. Now, as I assume most students do, I would like to do really well in school. I slacked off big time in high school because I found most of it really easy, so I have no idea how to study, take notes or really any kind of \"school skills\". I'm fully prepared to buckle down and commit 100% focus on school, I just don't know how to do well.",

You can build study by reading the conclusion of the chapter and focusing on was mentioned in the conclusion. When it comes to taking notes, pay attention to when professors emphasize certain things. When professors say \u201cthis will be on the test\u201d write it all down. These are just a few things, college is trail and error. Some things may work for you or may not and it\u2019s okay. Good luck",

      "text": "I was the exact same way going in to college. I managed to get a good GPA in HS by doing nothing and I got a reality check my first year in college.\n\nThe #1 skill you need to start developing (like today, right now) is time management. It will be so easy to be like \"oh this assignment isn't due for another week, i can wait to work on it\". Next thing you know you are scrambling to write 4 pages at 10:30 pm for an assignment due at 11:59.\n\n  \n2. I don't care if it's the first week of class or the weekend after midterms, please never make the mistake of thinking \"I don't have any homework to do\". There's ALWAYS something to do, use time to finish assignments early. Doing a little work/studying a subject every day pays off big time as well, you won't even realize how much you've completed.\n\nAs for your study habits, ask the professor in each of your classes how THEY feel is the best way to study for the class. Going to your professors office hours + showing interest in your own learning is always beneficial.",
