You are getting very narrow and specific when you are talking about one grade. I don't think any school is going to pick another student over you due to a C as long as the rest of your application is better than theirs. As a tie breaker maybe. But there are too many very gifted students with a bad grade somewhere on their transcript to automatically make decisions based on an individual grade unless they are fine having lots of false negatives.",
