  "text": "sorry, if this is obvious, i\u2019m asking for someone that doesn\u2019t have reddit and i\u2019m mostly into STEM things\n\nhey everyone,\n\nwhat is the difference between a theatre and film major? for example [this school](https://corcoran.gwu.edu/theatre-undergraduate) doesn\u2019t have a film major but only theatre while [this school](https://tisch.nyu.edu/film-tv) has a film major. is it just semantics/they practically teach the same things or are they different with different expected career paths?",

      "text": "Theatre and film are two separate fields because film and theatre are different things. You wouldn\u2019t, for example, refer to a Broadway production of Wicked as a \u201cfilm\u201d and you wouldn\u2019t refer to The Shining as a \u201ctheatrical production\u201d. They\u2019re related, but both are nuanced and technical enough to require specialization",
