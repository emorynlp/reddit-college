  "text": "So a week before I moved into College my girlfriend broke up with me. We had only dated for 3 months but It still really hurt and still hurts now. Now I have been in college for a few months and I still see her a ton in the dining hall even tho 20K people go to my college. I see her with all of her friends and I\u2019m usually alone in the dining hall. I feel like like I should be there with them. I just can\u2019t figure out to deal with going to the same college as my ex while accidentally seeing her all the time. I have also struggled to make friends which doesn\u2019t help out, so I anyone has any suggestions let me know.",

      "text": "Find things to distract yourself with. Pick up a hobby, join some student orgs, focus on school. Those things will all help you focus less on her and in time you\u2019ll start to forget about her. Yes, you will still run into her but that is life (while you\u2019re in college) and the more you let other things occupy your mind, the faster you will move on and soon, seeing her in the dining hall won\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve got this.",
