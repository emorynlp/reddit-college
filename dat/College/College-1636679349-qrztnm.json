  "text": "Ever since the beginning of high school I\u2019ve been planning on not going to college. Now (Junior still in high school) I\u2019ve been leaning towards going to college more. My community service was pretty good till 9th grade when I just stopped doing it. I\u2019ve taken no college courses and have none scheduled into my Junior year. I did no sports my sophomore year due to college, however this year I am doing basketball and golf. I\u2019ve also never participated in clubs or anything of that nature. My GPA has always been a 4.0 till last years second semester when I kinda just gave up due to covid. Now I\u2019m an A and B student sitting at a 3.94 GPA. I don\u2019t do any college classes, but I also don\u2019t do easy stuff. The classes I take are a mix between. I want to go to college for finance, and don\u2019t know how to save my resume. Help!",

      "text": "It really depends on what school you want to go to but for most schools you will be just fine! Just keep your GPA and stay in those extracurriculars/join more if you\u2019re interested. Try to get a good score on the ACT/SAT. Have an experience worth writing about (this really helps with college admissions essays). Talk to your counselor about trying to take AP next year",

      "text": "You sound totally fine. If you go to a top-tier college, they don't always take credits that are earned during college, including AP. What they care about is if you are taking challenging courses, getting good grades, and doing extra activities outside of your courses that show leadership, drive, and creativity. Otherwise-- your path would likely set you up for many really good colleges, but maybe not ivy.",

          "text": "To add on to that - If you have your heart set on an Ivy League school, your best bet is to get accepted and start at a decent school, do well, and then apply to transfer in. They are more likely to take you as a transfer than an incoming freshman, since there\u2019s a smaller pool of applicants.",
