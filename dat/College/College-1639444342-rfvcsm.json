  "title:": "ended algebra on a high note and never have to take math again!",
  "text": "i\u2019ve always been terrible at math. i can\u2019t remember the last time i finished any math class with an A. one time in fourth grade, i failed a math test and my teacher pulled me out of the classroom and told me i would never make it in life - something that stuck with me in all my math classes over the years. i had to take college algebra this semester and if i got a C or higher it would be the last math class i ever had to take. i was doing terribly the first half of the semester and got Cs, Ds, or worse on everything. but then i really buckled down and spent several hours a day going over the material, redoing old homework, making study sheets, etc and started getting As on the homework and Bs on the tests. i took my final last week and felt like it was pretty easy so i have been anxiously waiting to see what grade i got. i finally got my grade back earlier today and it was an A!!! and it brought my overall final grade up to an A as well!!! it feels so satisfying to finish my last ever math class with an A, a grade i haven\u2019t gotten in any math class probably since elementary school. also feels like a big middle finger to that fourth grade teacher who told me i\u2019d never make it in life because of my grades in math! let this be motivation for you to try extra hard in your least favorite classes next semester, because if you dedicate enough time to it (as much as it sucks) you\u2019ll feel extra satisfied when you pass and never have to take that class again!\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nTDLR: i\u2019m usually really bad at math but i got an A on my algebra final and an A overall in the class and that was the very last math class i ever had to take so now i\u2019m free from math classes forever!",
