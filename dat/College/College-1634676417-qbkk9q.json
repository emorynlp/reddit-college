  "text": "The rumor was the midterm average was 40%; I got a 65% but my grade was so low, with so many failed lab quizzes my total grade was still 62%. There is a lab practical tomorrow, I went to review today- I did not do well in it. It's plant identification and evolutionary history 400 something. I wish I could blame it on my bad eyesight but more than visual ability, I just can't memorize so many species, their identifying features, and their latin. \n\n I've spent more time on this course than any course in my life... I stopped working, stopped cooking meals or going to the gym... The course itself is not required  but I did need 4 more upper division credits, in any subject. \n\nI am mortified but I would be more mortified if I had to take four credits when I should've been a graduate. \n\nThere was only one option for a course to swap into at this point, and it does not sound exciting at all, but by this point I just want time to go to the gym, see my friends, or even work part-time again.",

      "text": "honestly i understand that it would feel embarrassing, but from what you said i think it\u2019s 100% worth it to drop it. if all this course is doing is giving you unbearable stress and getting in the way of your routines, then i don\u2019t see the point in continuing putting yourself through that. also i\u2019m not sure if i read this right but if you\u2019re worried about graduating late, i hope you know that it really doesn\u2019t matter as much as it might seem. i used to worry and freak out that everyone i know would be graduating on time and i would need an extra semester, but now i\u2019ve realized it literally doesn\u2019t matter, i\u2019ll graduate when i graduate and that\u2019s all that matters. best of luck to you.",

          "text": "It's good to hear from another professor! And yeah... more people dropping out of failing classes would definitely be a hell of a change. Prof ratings might be very diff as a result. Like my college is cutting programs due to budget issues, and this class is normally exclusive to program majors while it's only my minor- I did not want the Prof to pay for my \"girlbossing too close to the sun\". \n\nLike it's a very difficult class, but the profs good, gave me accomodations. So like ego makes me wish I could say she's a bad prof or my retina disorder screwed me up, but like on eight lab quizzes, I got each species correct just not the Latin.",
