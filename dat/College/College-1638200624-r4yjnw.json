However, it is expensive and it can be years before you actually see the benefits of college because student loans are using any extra money you make.\n\nHowever, there is the aspect that a college education makes you more likely to have cushy office jobs, instead of customer service or manual labor jobs. More regular hours, being around other college educated professionals, and possibly more able to follow your passion. I sent you a DM with some longer info you might want to check out.",

I agree with the other user in saying that just taking and working jobs will show you what you don\u2019t want to do, but will also help determine what you do want to. I took a giant leap of faith when I decided senior year of high school to change my major and what I wanted to be in life (from med school with the goal of being a neurologist to environmental science with the goal of doing environmental toxicology). And it happened when I noticed that I liked watching nature shows/documentaries, and that I found my \u201cinner peace\u201d while in nature. I haven\u2019t regretted it. From hiking and cataloguing native plants, to wading in rivers and identifying fish, to mapping and doing statistical analysis through programming and coding; every second has been fun *for me*. But that might not be fun to you. There\u2019s a guy Im friends with that took his time before landing on the same major as me. He spent his time doing odd jobs around, but eventually came to work with a river service doing clean up and restoration. He discovered his passion and is now pursuing his degree with a goal of doing outdoor programs and expeditions so he can also help others discover their passion for the great outdoors. It\u2019s okay to take your time deciding what you want to do in life. One tip though: See if you find yourself drawn to something, and try to find an entry job that will let you get even the slightest taste of a job you might like to have one day. If you like building things, try to see if you can do something in construction or some form of woodworking or carpentry. If you like nature try to get a job with a park. If you like graphic design try to get a job with an internship or job in that field. Explore. See what you like. See where it takes you. If it leads you to a job that needs a degree then go back and get one, but take your time and feel it out.",

Liberal arts degrees are next to useless in this economy, I believe high schools are still pushing the myth that any uni degree will make you \u201chireable\u201d, presumably to get kids to take out interest generating student loans. If you have a career in mind you can fathom doing for 30+ years, college or uni may be worth it to specialize in that. If not, take some time to work and figure out what it is you want to do. Even if you have to take some dumb jobs, they may help you figure out what success DOESN\u2019T look like, which can be equally valuable, and then with any luck you\u2019ll end up with a savings pool to put toward your education rather than relying wholly on loans (the worst).

Employers require college degrees for multiple reasons.\n\nRight now in U.S. history, we're in an economic blip where employees get to be a bit choosey with jobs and employers are lowering requirements for job applicants while upping pay.
