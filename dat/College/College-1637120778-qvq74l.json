  "text": "Feel free to ignore, this is my therapy. \n\nFor the last two weeks my roommate has been coughing non stop throughout the day and throughout and night. I think he\u2019s taking cough drops but they\u2019re obviously not helping. It\u2019s annoyed me to the point where I started wearing my noise cancelling headphones (Sony) to bed each night. \n\nHe\u2019s also that guy who will put on his headphones while playing a game on his PC, but he still plays music out loud on his phone for some fucked up reason. I don\u2019t want to listen to some random rapper I\u2019ve never heard of when I\u2019m trying to sleep. The most frustrating part is that he\u2019ll put on the music right when I get into bed, it\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to piss me off. \n\nThe coughing is getting to the point where I want to punch him every time I hear it, so I\u2019ve been wearing noise cancelling headphones basically all the time when I\u2019m in there with him. \n\nI luckily haven\u2019t gotten sick even with the extremely close proximity. I feel like I\u2019m going mad.",
