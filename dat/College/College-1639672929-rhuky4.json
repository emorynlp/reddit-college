  "text": "I serve on a hearing panel at the university I work for/study at, mainly dealing with students who have cheated or plagiarized. I\u2019m really curious about how universities work in other countries because I feel really bad when the student being accused of plagiarism or cheating is not from America as it seems like in other countries it is normal to work on assignments with other students? Is this accurate? Just wondering I guess what it\u2019s like to study in America vs other countries! Thank you!!",

      "text": "In Northamerica, often already in middle school, you're asked to  write by yourself (e.g. essays). There is  culture of writing and that cutting and pasting is wrong. In other countries there is not so much of \"free\" writing. When foreign students are asked to write something, almost for the first time in America, they get stuck. It's also hard to write in a second language! Or they have not properly learned how to quote or paraphrase (as some Americans do - they know the game). American universities academic  and administration should know that, and CLEARLY explain foreign students how to properly cite, etc. and potential consequences.",

          "text": "Okay, duh, writing in another language OF COURSE would be difficult, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t immediately consider and mention that in my original post. I also wish there were clearer expectations outlined. Most universities have writing centers to help people write but I feel like all of this information is glossed over while professors review the syllabus before diving into the curriculum. And there is also a statement about cheating/plagiarizing but it always says the same thing, which is basically just don\u2019t do it and if you do you will be punished. Very vague.",
