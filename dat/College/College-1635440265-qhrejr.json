  "text": "For my whole life I went to a small private hs so there wasn\u2019t much variety for friends. Back then too I was fairly quiet and reserved and a lot of people had their own cliques and friend groups. During most of hs I kind of stuck around this one same friend group, they all lived near eachother and hung out all the time so sometimes to them I was kind of the \u2018side friend\u2019 but I had no choice there weren\u2019t any other people I could really hang with. I would always try to be there for them and was super nice and considerate, but unfortunately they weren\u2019t really like that for me and deep down I always knew they weren\u2019t my \u2018real friends\u2019 and I kind of hung out with them just bc, I mean we did have some fun times here and there but I always knew we just didn\u2019t vibe well together. Right now I\u2019m a freshman in college and I can\u2019t believe how nice people are to me and I feel like for once in a very long time I have true, genuine and caring friends. They actually wait for me after class, get food and study with me and invite me to do things with them all the time. I can\u2019t even begin to describe how much I appreciate them. When I was in hs my \u2018friends\u2019 would never wait for me as I would for them and while they did invite me to hang sometimes, I was mostly on the side of their convos. It\u2019s just a very mixed feeling bc on one end it makes me sad to realize that my hs friends were shitty and fake while I\u2019m trying to move past that and make new friends. Also I even snapped one of those friends twice, the 2nd time stating that I missed them and they straight up left me on open both times :/ has anyone had any similar experiences?",
