  "text": "Hey everyone, I'm a freshman at a four year about to complete my first semester. Basically, I want to know if anyone had gone through the process of dropping from a 4 year to attend a 2 year. The workload is to much for me at the moment and I figure that, financially, I would be taking less risk if I were to do poorly at a community college as opposed to a 4 year.\n\nAny thoughts?",

Best decision I could have made. I did very well in the more relaxed atmosphere, and the work really did prepare me to jump in to my major when I transferred back. \n\nFor \u2018most\u2019 people, doing a few years at a community college before a university is hands down the best option.",
