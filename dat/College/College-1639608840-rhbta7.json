  "text": "(Will remove if needed and if this would go better at a different subreddit let me know!)\n\nHello! I have to do an application letter for a scholarship to study abroad and need help! One of the questions is like \" Why, in your opinion, do you deserve this scholarship?\" how do I answer that without sounding like an ass? Same with \" What, if any, is your financial need?\" I tried to look up some kind of example to help me get into the groove of writing it but haven't found any and since I don't really like talking about myself it is proving to be difficult!!\n\nThanks in advance!!",
