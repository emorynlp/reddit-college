I love psychology so maybe I would still study it but I would also maybe major in film production and minor in history (film is a good major but I don\u2019t want to do it as a career). Honestly a history major itself sounds fun too as ive always really enjoyed history classes.",

Feels like I always have something going on or something itching the back of my mind whether its an assignment or a piece of homework.\n\nBut if it was something intrinsic long in the future, I would probably choose to be an English major. Writing is a very fun hobby. (My current major is Computer Science.)",
