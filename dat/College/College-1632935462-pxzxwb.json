  "text": "I have to do an internship with my current class for my degree. The problem is my start date keeps getting pushed back. I have to meet with at least one client within the next two weeks and have documentation to turn in to my professor. I already got a drug test, but it\u2019s been two weeks and I haven\u2019t gotten my results back. Plus I need two references. The internship isn\u2019t paid of course. I was supposed to start two weeks ago, but my start date keeps getting pushed back. My professor isn\u2019t happy about me not starting while everyone else has. I already have another class I take and I have a part time job. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to handle everything and get all my work done on time.",
