Like, actual physical textbooks that you can get on Amazon and teach with. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a professor have that. \n\nAnyone else ever take a course with someone \u201cfamous\u201d/well-known in their field?",

I guess it's unsurprising, but he fostered a pretty cutthroat unhealthy environment in his class with the way group projects were set up. Super pretentious.

I'm not sure if he ever did get blocked, probably did he hates trump, but someone posted a picture of the email he sent his students that told about the assignment and it blew up.

And a bunch of other wacky theories that I don't understand.\n\nThis guy emailed us one day like 30 minutes before class started to tell us that class was cancelled because he decided to go to South Korea.\n\nEdit: I just remembered this man cancelled class because the lecturer before him hadn't erased the chalkboard and he reported that professor to the dean.",
