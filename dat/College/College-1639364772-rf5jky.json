  "text": "Hey.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a non-traditional student. I worked two jobs my first 2 years and obtained my associates degree.\n\nBut I now have transferred to a traditional 4 year university. Classes I feel are a bit more challenging and I work an early bird shift (515-1115) and drive around 45 minutes to go to school every day.\n\nHow do you stay on top of classes and nearly a full time job? I\u2019m beginning to want to just live at the college (or at least near it) but don\u2019t have the best guidance or financial situation for that.",

      "text": "I\u2019m 54, returning to school for my first degree. I work part-time, mornings, then drive 45 minutes to campus. \n\nAfter class, it\u2019s an hour\u2019s drive home, then a few errands, making dinner, household chores.... and finally homework about 9pm.\n\nBut, everyone else is usually settled for the night, or gone to work (2 night shifters in the family) \u2014- so, I have peace and quiet and actually accomplish a lot even though it\u2019s late.\n\nSo for me, studying at the end of the day is working so far.  I really have to be protective of that timeframe though, and some days it\u2019s easier than others!!",
