  "text": "i felt sick so i took a covid test and waited outside on my building\u2019s balcony all day while waiting for my results bc i don\u2019t wanna get my roommate sick. results came back negative so today i feel like i should stay at home and get some rest but i REALLY do not want to get my roommate sick. i would feel horrible. i wear a mask in the room and don\u2019t directly touch door handles. i can\u2019t chill outside anymore because it\u2019s super super cold. am i a bad roommate if i stay in the dorm? idk where else to go. the chances of her getting sick are high because we don\u2019t have the greatest ventilation",
