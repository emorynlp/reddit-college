  "text": "Hello USA, I\u2019m a writer for a small Croatian publication that is mainly eduction related. We are releasing our first US t100 college rankings. We did not include any liberal arts colleges not because they aren\u2019t worthy of praise but because we believe they have clear differences with traditional universities. Our rankings were based off a combination of under grad and graduate quality. We stayed away from the traditional US model of focusing on small class sizes and falling in love with big private school names. We felt the American approach was not in agreement with academic standards. \nPlease give us your feed back, we want to hear what America thinks.\nThe article will be posted in the next few days here is a sneak peak!!!\n1.

UMICH is one that often surprises Americans but when you look at the institution in totality not just under grad you have a school that is an easy top 20 and can often break the top 15. Good undergrad but more importantly UMICH has an immense impact on academia as well as having extremely high ranked graduate schools. The other schools below UMICH like Duke may have a better under grad but lack in almost every other department. School like Norte Dame on the other hand just don\u2019t come close they have a lower under grad environment and substantially weaker contribution in academia in addition to weaker graduate programs. All are great school from the 20-15 spots no mistaking that one.",
