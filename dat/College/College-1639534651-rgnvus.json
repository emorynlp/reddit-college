      "text": "If everything you stated is accurate (including the final being worth 4 quizzes even though categories are weighted percents), then yes. If you've taken 21 quizzes and the final is included in that same category just worth slightly more, it's still weighted much, much less than that 30% overall category weight. And with a solid A in the course already, I've had students in similar situations who could make a non-zero F on the final and still end up with an A in the course (we don't do +/-).\n\nThat said, not sure I'd risk it unless you've run it by your prof.",
