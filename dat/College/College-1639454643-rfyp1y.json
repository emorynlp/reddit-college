  "text": "Gotta be full time (12 s.h.) to keep my scholarship.\n\nShould I have 2 of those classes be the last 2 Spanish classes I need for a minor? Or, should I drop the Spanish minor and take a cool Latinx law/political science class and a yoga class and a random 1 s.h. class to lighten my load my last semester?\n\nI got into a clinic at my university's law school next semester which will take up a lot of my time, and I travel a lot of weekends for my student org, so I'm worried two upper-level Spanish classes (one of them at 8:30 AM!!!) will destroy me for a minor that might not even really matter. :/",

I was sad about it for a bit then realized the extra time was definitely needed and I could take some spanish classes here and there without needing to take all the ones required for a minor. I think if you think you need to, that means you should",
