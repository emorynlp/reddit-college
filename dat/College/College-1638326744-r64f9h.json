  "text": "I have to take some time off of school. Around a year and a half. So about five semesters which is including the summers. I\u2019m not taking time off because I\u2019m doing bad in school. I\u2019m actually doing decent. But something has come up where there is some time conflict with work and moving out of the country for some time. I could take classes overseas but I\u2019m not sure how that will work yet. Best case is probably to just take the time off school so I can focus on work. Reapplying back to school shouldn\u2019t be an issue. The only thing I\u2019m actually worried about is with so much time away from school I\u2019m afraid it will make me not want to go back but I\u2019m still determined to finish. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s a long time and my friends will be ahead and graduating without me. Plus I feel like it would be hard to adjust with classes again. Anyone who took some time off school what motivated you to go back? And how do you stay on track? Thanks",

      "text": "Just never think about the option of not going back. I took 2 years off, but the entire time I knew I was going back, I was thinking about it, I was excited about it, I knew what classes I was going to take, etc.\n\nAlso, if you can finish all your prereq sequences (like Chem 1 and Chem 2, or Calc I, II, and III), it's easier because you don't have to pick up back in the middle of those, just take some generals and get back into your major courses.",

I would have to take physics 2 when I come back so that will be bad unless I review a semester beforehand. I don\u2019t need to take calc 3 tho",
