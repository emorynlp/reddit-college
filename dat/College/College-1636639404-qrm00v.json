  "text": "Hey all, I\u2019m a junior and my roommate is a sophomore. My classes are late in the day (start at 12:45, some go until 7:40pm) and I typically wake up around 9 or 9:30am. Every Thursday my roommate wake up at 4am for work. I try to be understanding, but some days she is just obnoxious. Slamming her hydro flask down on her desk, slamming the door closed, forgetting her key to swipe back in, loudly stomping, etc. We live in a suite with 4 other people, so 6 total. There\u2019s three individual rooms. My roommate knows i\u2019m a semi-light sleeper, but continues to lock herself out almost everyday. Without a doubt, she wakes me up at 4am on Thursdays and 7am all other days. Our blinds are LOUD to open and the windows take up the entire wall. She will open these at whatever time she desires. Respectfully, the sun doesn\u2019t shine in her face so I have asked her to keep them closed until at least 9am, which we both agreed was fair, but recently that has not been happening. \n\nAdvice?",
