  "text": "Background information: I\u2019m a 20F in my second year of college. I\u2019m majoring in Elementary Education and getting a minor in Special Education. I\u2019m taking 18 credits while spending 10 hours a week in an elementary school. I work part time and I\u2019m also play an important role in two organizations on campus. \n\nI need help staying healthy. In high school, I had no problem staying healthy. I was fit and had a good looking body. Now in college, I\u2019ve gained some weight and I do not feel good inside. I\u2019m very self conscious and gaining weight makes me feel even worse mentally. I walk everywhere and I use the stairs and in every building. I eat as healthy as I can in a college budget. I have access to a gym, but I just have zero time to go. I barely have time to shower every day. Any tips or advice y\u2019all could give me on how I can stay healthy would be much appreciated!",

      "text": "Well walking everywhere and taking the steps instead of the elevator or driving is great. Try eating more whole foods if at all possible. And try to make sure you\u2019re getting in a good balance of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. But it seems like you generally are doing the best you can to stay healthy.\n\nIf weight loss is what you really mean, you\u2019d need to be in a calorie deficit for that.",

      "text": "To \u201close weight\u201d isn\u2019t always the same as staying in shape! But small things you can do is to set a timer for when you study for every hour and when you take a break when the timer goes off, do 10 reps of 2 sets of crunches, jumping jacks, push ups. If you\u2019re studying for 6 hours, that\u2019s 120 crunches. Obviously adapt it to the environment if you\u2019re in between classes try to sit and do a wall sit somewhere or do lunges while walking to the bathroom. Small things add up! This gets pretty \u201cprison workout\u201d ish but you can use your backpack as a weight to squat and lift. \n\nFor shaping (like in your lower abs if you\u2019re growing a lil belly) it\u2019s all about the foods you\u2019re eating. You want a balanced diet. Try to cut sugars like soda and desserts and choose grilled over fried, white meat over red meat (white fish is good such as cod) etc. There are a lot of filling meals that are healthy and on the cheaper side. Dr Mike has some healthy snack foods in a video on youtube. If you snack a lot or just often, it can really impact your weight gain and portion sizes can get out of hand too at times. Try to \u201cmeal prep\u201d by sorting out portion sizes before hand if possible. There might be a nutritionist at your campus too.",
