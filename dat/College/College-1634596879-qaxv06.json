  "text": "please help. i'm a psychology junior in her fall semester. it's week 8 out of 16 and i'm in such a terrible slump. i've been struggling with mental health for a long time (the past 2 years), and it reflected really badly on my academics cuz i have literally done nothing this semester except for week 1. last sem was pretty crap too but i was hoping i'll get out of depression and do better when fall comes but here i am. will i be able to at least some B's and C's if i work the remaining weeks? i wish i could drop out or take a gap year to focus on myself but even mentioning it would get me thrown out by my mom. i've been having a terrible time ever since quarantine happened last year and personal family problems piled up. i feel like nothing is going to end well this semester either.\n\ni tried contacting counselors in school but they either never pick up or are overbooked. i had to go to (really expensive) online therapy for a couple weeks to not feel like an utter failure but looking at the mountain of schoolwork i've pushed away is so freaking scary. will i be even able to succeed?\n\n(if you're seeing this the second time it's because reddit took it down cuz i didnt know caps were a problem in titles. i'm a complete noob when it comes to this site but im desperate enough to come here anyway)",

They can also help guide you and recommend lightening your load next semester.\n\nTalk to your professors as well about whether turning in late work is worth it or if you should focus on the content from here on out. Everyone wants you to succeed, please keep reaching out and don\u2019t let your mental health define you!",
