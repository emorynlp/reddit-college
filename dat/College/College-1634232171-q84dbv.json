  "text": "I'm applying for college soon and can't decide what degree I should take. I have decided on the degrees I want to take months ago but it really gets hard when you're now applying for college. I have seen some mixed opinions on these two degrees. Some say it is useful but I have seen some posts where they say it is downright useless. What do you guys think? Specially guys who have finished with these degrees. Which one should I choose? As with almost everybody else, I  would make job stability and salary major factors when choosing.",
