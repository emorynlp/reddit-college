  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a college freshman at a mid-sized university in the South. First semester has been a rough uphill battle with lots of very high highs and low lows. It\u2019s getting so much better though! And the semester is almost over (thank goodness) However, despite the toughness of this semester, I\u2019ve had great professors who have reached out to me in a genuinely compassionate way. They have proven to care about me not just as a student, but as an individual and the relationships I\u2019ve formed are ones that I was not expecting. I\u2019m big on expressing gratitude when I feel it, and I love hand written notes. I wanted to write a few of my professors notes at the end of the semester just expressing gratitude for all their work and helpfulness, but I can\u2019t decide if this is weird or not. I\u2019ve gotten mixed opinions from people. Some say it would be a nice gesture while others say it\u2019s strangely too personal. Obviously, the last thing I want to do is make people uncomfortable. So what do y\u2019all think?",

      "text": "I think this is a wonderful idea and very sweet. \nI don\u2019t think its weird. No one will be weirded out by you expressing gratitude and appreciation. A hand written card is very meaningful and they will always have that. And IF they think its weird they\u2019re not going to say that to you. They accept and say thank you and then say something to their friends if anything. But still that wouldn\u2019t even affect you and you wouldn\u2019t know. Maintaining a positive relationship with your profs can lead to something in the future. Go ahead and express gratitude how you see fit. :)",

      "text": "nope not weird at all just do it and it will strengthen your relationships in the end which is beneficial to both your college career and what you do after. I've done it and it wasn't weird, its not too \"personal\"\n\nin college I made a card at the end of the year for my history professor and the front of it had the heads of everyone in the class (total of like 8) and my professor in emoji form that I made using an app and we were all inside the country of Algeria (subject of the class) and everyone signed it and my professor loved in and hung it up on her wall. sure, that might sound weird if you weren't there but it was not in the end!!",
