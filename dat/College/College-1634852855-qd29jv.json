  "text": "Hey everyone, so in 2013fall and 2014fall I was irresponsible and dropped put of classes. I did not have fafsa, this year is my first time ever applying for it. But since I dropped out of some classes, they won't give me the fafsa because I dropped out of too many classes. My advisor said I can appeal if I had a illness or if a family member did or if they died. My grandpa who I lived with then, had numerous health issues. He's been on disability then, and even had bypass surgery and a couple heart attacks(although I'm not sure If those incidents occurred in fall of 2013 and 2014, which is when I dropped out of classes)\nSo my question is, will I have a chance to appeal and get fafsa to attend classes? I'm older more mature and goal oriented now and wouldn't drop out of a class. Fafsa would help me a lot. Say in fall of 13/14 those incidents didn't occur and they haopend in spring or summer, am I just screwed? Will disability be enough? Keep in mind I did not have fafsa then but they said it doesn't matter. Any guidance would be appreciated. I'm just trying to better my career and attend college but this hurdle is preventing me.\n\nThe appeal is called SAP\nComplete and pass a minimum percentage of the credit hours attempted \u2013 as determined by the school.\n\nMy GPA is Good enough, but since I dropped out, I don't qualify unless I can properly appeal.",

          "text": "I never even had fafsa to restore funding though, this is my first time applying for it. I just withdrew classes that I didn't want to do, but did well and had over a 3.0 GPA for the few classes I did finish. That's why I'm hoping I can get a chance to even have fafsa for the first time ever, to go to school. I paid out of pocket on all the classes I withdrew from and finished from.",
