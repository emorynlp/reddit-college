  "text": "I'm freaking the heck out \nI just took my pre calculus final, which I studied relatively hard for. I have adhd, and math is NOT my strong suit, so studying is very difficult for me in this subject. I went through and reviewed everything I could possibly think of....took notes and even broke everything down to get the \u201cwhy\u2019s\u201d and the step by steps\u2026\u2026.and I just got a 36%........... and it's 20% of my overall grade. I had a 72 average before the final!!!!! As I said, math isn\u2019t my strong suit, but I\u2019ve got to get past it (and calculus) to get my biology degree. \n\nThe teacher gives partial credit, but for me to pass this class she'd have to give me at least 29 more points to the final to give me a 70% overall average....... the most I've gotten extra is 15-18 more points on an exam \n\n To help with my mental health, I've been doing school this semester with the mentality of \"stop once I've worked to the point where my mental/physical health is affected\". Which seems to me a  healthy boundary, and is something I NEED, because I\u2019ve got adhd, anxiety, depression, and cPTSD.......All of these are being treated to the best of everyone\u2019s ability, but obviously there\u2019s still issues, especially because college is STRESSFUL. \nHowever, this of course affects my grades.....and my family is already on my case with school because they only see me when I'm taking a break or doing my own chores (laundry, cleaning my room, taking care of my animals/plants) to get the momentum going (because motivation for exist for me)....so they think I've done nothing, and that I\u2019ve been lazy, slacking off, and not taking school seriously.....and my grades are going to \"prove\" they're side of reality. \nFor reference they\u2019re the kind of parents that will say \u201cwe don\u2019t care what grades you get as long as you do your best\u201d, but then flat out bully you for \u201cnot doing your best\u201d if you get below a B\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026and I\u2019ve almost always been an A/B except this past semester, which has been mostly decent grades, but also a lot of quizzes and homework assignments that were in the 70\u2019s or just flat out forgotten in the mass of it all. This is my first semester in a biology degree program (been in college since I was 16 as a dual enrollment student). \n\n\nI just want to die in a hole. I know one failed class overall isn\u2019t going to massively change the course of my future\u2026.but I just feel awful about, and definitely don\u2019t want to deal with the berating and lectures I\u2019m going to get from mg family.",

Many professors will curve the final exam or final grades, so you might pass the course. If not, you could retake the class or perhaps take a stats class, which would likely be more useful for a bio program. Source - am bio prof",

      "text": "Just crunching the numbers, 72% \\* 0.80 + 36% \\* 0.20 = 64.8% you'll now have in the class. What that translates to as a letter grade depends on the cutoffs for that class and potential curve (if there is one). Regardless, it's at worst a D. Depending on the rules of your school and major, it's possible that a D will count as passing (but be careful with pre-requisites, many require C or higher). My advice is to wait for the final grades to be released before getting too stressed out about this (and even then, there's not much you can do but look forward and learn from the experience)",

      "text": "As someone who has experienced this with a psychological stats course. I struggled because like you I have adhd and math is my biggest weakness. You know what though. I finally got it this semester with help of a tutor.  1 class is not going to kill your gpa.   My average in the stats classes I have taken was a C but often would fall cause I was stubborn and didn't get help.  Get help if you need it honestly the tutor I got was the difference between me passing and failing. What matters most isn't your families opinions but your health and ability to improve.   Understand where you made errors and learn it's the only way to get better.",

I couldnt understand a lot of math, ended up with a B in pre-calc II in the spring, and a C in calc I in the summer. He usually gave me like 30 more points on my exams, but I always aced the homework and quizzes. Ig his exams were just hard. Just glad I dont have to do anymore math after physics II and chem II next semester",
