  "text": "personally i have never missed a class, until now. my class is at 8:30 and i woke up at 8:21. my alarm was set 50 mins before class started but i must have rolled on top of my phone and turned it off. i have never missed a class since starting college two years ago. i feel scared!! like i\u2019m going to miss something very important. i struggled with the hw material last night and we have an exam in 2 weeks. attendance isn\u2019t required & it is a flipped classroom. what do you guys do if you miss a class?",

      "text": "yea..I missed class about two times, and honestly it was nothing. I'm a perfectionist and I literally do my best to get the best grades and never be absent in classes, but missing a few classes did not give a huge impact on the results. I still received As and got on the dean's list. just ask some classmates to share their notes and if you're really concerned then go reach out to the professor. They would generally try to help u. it's totally fine to miss a few classes, you're not a robot. just do better with the remaining quizzes and hws. Good luck with your exam :) You'll do great.",

I also had chronic fatigue so I slept through pretty much every single class. Still got A's in all of them. Obviously this very much depends on the class, your professor, and how well you're able to teach yourself. I rarely learned anything when I was in class anyways because I got too distracted, so I honestly did better just teaching myself. \n\nDon't beat yourself up about it. You would be incredibly hard pressed to meet a junior/senior who hasn't skipped a class ever. Shit happens. Life happens. You'll be fine. You can try to go to your professors office hours if they're available if you have questions.",
