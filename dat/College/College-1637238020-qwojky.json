      "text": "Hey there, I don't have depression myself but it's been a rough couple of weeks ya know. Finals are around the corner for me too and something that helps is asking my friends for their notes, that way I can skip a couple of lectures and focus on making my notes better with theirs. It's all about time too. I know that me being sad is going to make me take longer to do things so I start \"studying\" more than a week beforehand. I don't get much done but little by little I'm making the habit of sitting there and doing something, as small as it is. Eventually, the little things will pile up. I hope this helps regarding the studying part, I wish I had some words of wisdom for your depression but I'm no therapist and I wouldn't wanna say the wrong thing. I do hope you get better tho, hang in there and best of lucks!",

      "text": "Hey.... Please know you're not alone in this. I AM going through the same. I too made mistakes  and they have been a huge burden on my spirit throughout the pandemic. I thought i was getting better, but I noticed ive been feeling worse. Reading webtoons, Listening to rock/christian music has helped me get by. The thing is....all I can tell u is that you're loved by many. I don't know u personally, but i love you because you're human. No matter what u may hear in the media or what ppl say, you're a walking testimony worthy of forgiveness and love. My depression has got bad when i started to hear the opinions of the public on how ppl who make similar mistakes as me are irredeemable. Academic wise, I am currently failing 2 classes in my first year of college. (many are btw too lol) because i've been losing my motivation  for life and my major. I've changed my major now, so i think ill be a little more motivated and successful in my studies. Just know the aching feeling in  your heart is very universal and that you can be a better person. The fact that you're even aware of your problems and want to better for yourself is a sign of who you are. You are going in the right direction even the process is extremely tedious and heartbreaking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you read this in the next hours to come\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Girl from New York",

If you need to do a medical leave there's no shame in it. You deserve to get support",
