  "text": "So I\u2019m in my first semester of college and I\u2019m currently enrolled in a transfer program (2 years at a community college and 2 years at a state university) which is for marketing. However I\u2019m also interested in doing software development so I\u2019m wondering if I can do both or if I\u2019d have to switch my major to be able to get a software dev job straight out of college?",
