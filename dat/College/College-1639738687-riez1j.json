  "text": "Currently at UMD studying public policy in the process of transferring back home to UIC. As I\u2019m getting ready to pack up I\u2019m regretting my decision. It was definitely hard socially at the beginning here and I still don\u2019t really have friends but many acquaintances which has been nice. Definitely felt less anxious as the semester went on but that could have been because I was planning on transferring and didn\u2019t have to worry about being invited out places. But now I dread having to start all over again socially and being closer to home may be too toxic. On the other hand UIC is practically free for me while UMD is around $30k a year. Both have good programs for my major I just dread feeling lonely again with no option of just transferring again. Deep down I know it makes more sense to transfer but I\u2019m having a very hard time leaving. Should I stay?",

      "text": "You\u2019re in a position that many people would like to be in: you have a number of options and you can probably choose any of them.  \nThe only real problem is that you\u2019re making the decision based on your emotions: the anxiety of starting over, the fear of being lonely again. All of these factors are completely irrelevant. They don\u2019t have any impact on the decision you should make. All they do is make you feel like you want to stay where you are.  \nThe only thing that matters is the financial impact. The cost of UMD is $30k a year. The cost of UIC is practically free right? That\u2019s a big difference.",
