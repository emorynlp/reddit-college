  "text": "on thursday, my family found out that my dog had cancer and that she didn't have much time left. \n\ni left my college campus to go home and be with her. i emailed my professors to let them know i would be missing their classes, and i asked for an extension on assignments that were due that weekend.\n\nmy economics professor, super relaxed teacher with no attendance policy, denied my request for an extension.\n\nmy history professor, super strict guy with a no phones policy and strict attendance policy, gave me an extra week and told me to reach out if i needed anything.\n\ni figured this was a prime example that it never hurts to ask.",
