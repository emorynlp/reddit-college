  "text": "My CIS101 class is doing an assignment where we have to gather five stocks and input the correct data onto Google Spreadsheet, that's easy enough, but they want us to use formulas to calculate Total Cost at Purchase, Current Total Value, Change in Dollar Value, and Percentage of Change in Value. \n\nThen we have to create graphs and showcase our findings, again, relatively easy right? \n\nI absolutely SUCK at math and anything to do with it, it just doesn't click with me no matter what I do... \n\nDoes anyone mind helping me with this?",

What am I doing wrong?\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nThe Formula for Total Cost as Purchase is =SUM(5\\*3,144.88) which equals $31,448.80 by the calculations of the computer. But on a basic calculator, it comes out to $15,724.04\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?",
