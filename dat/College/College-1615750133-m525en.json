      "text": "Kind of. I used to think that my finals were remarkably easy due to online, but having looked at past papers, they actually aren't really any easier than previous years. In fact, the grading scale was actually a lot more lenient a decade ago or so. The open book nature has definitely made lower-level stuff easier, but honestly, it doesn't make that much of a difference in my degree, though it has more of an effect on lower-level classes. And the exams were modified to account for that anyway.\n\nI think it's much harder to motivate yourself and learn higher-level stuff online though. Assignments and projects are typically harder online while exams are a little bit easier. So overall, I'd say it's harder if you take external factors into account.\n\nAre you a freshman? I am too and maybe it's just that first year is generally easy compared to later years, especially in STEM majors.",

      "text": "I have a 4.0 and I am a junior and my major is computer science. All of the classes that I have taken haven't been too difficult. The hardest class I took was anatomy because I actually had to know the material and it was somewhat difficult to learn. Python was another kind of hard class I took because I had to write programs and do multiple choice questions on tests in a limited amount of time in person without any resources. So basically I had to have strong knowledge of the language to write the programs. But still, it wasn't that bad. Currently, I am in Calculus and that class is somewhat difficult and I am unsure if I will be able to get an A. A lot of the classes I have taken were very easy and required no learning because the teacher allowed you to google all the answers. Most of the classes I have taken were in person with online tests. I think the internet is affecting learning a lot. People aren't actually learning the content like how they were back before the internet. If tests are online and you can google all the answers, it doesn't really showcase what someone learned. It makes it very easy to get a high GPA but it doesn't mean you learned anything. I feel like many people will get their degrees and know nothing.",

I struggle to wake up for class, mostly because I feel like my book teaches me better than my teachers do. I'm anticipating many early mornings taking the bus to school, and I need to be prepared for that. I also like studying right when I wake up/getting over sleep inertia. I've realized that I learn better with videos, and in person lectures suck, so YouTube it is. \n\nI'm so not excited to go back though. \n\nI have grown very adverse to people in general, but more than that, I hate going the pace of other people. Determining my own pace, going over what I need to, getting my readings done when I'm comfortable, studying 7am-4pm straight, and not having my workflow interrupted by others. \n\nI know I sound like a cranky old man, but I feel like in-person school is so inefficient. It hurts non-trads by wasting their time, and decides to do things the hard way when it doesn't need to be. Ex. Not posting the slides, not posting practice exams, no practice problems, no recorded lectures, exams at 9am (biased towards people who are functional by 9am), infrequent breaks, and an uncomfortable environment. Seriously, I learn better in sweatpants sipping coffee, I despise sitting in a chair cuddled up with other students while constantly wishing I had something to eat.",

It's good you feel like you don't deserve the grade because it means you're grasping onto your bad behavior. A person who cheats doesn't deserve a good grade compared to someone who has a lower grade and didn't cheat. I get a lower grade in my CS class because I didn't cheat and I see some guy in the chat cheating and then he brags about getting a higher grade. Stop cheating. Why is everyone condoning this behavior? It's obvious. You cheated and you don't deserve that high grade.",

The only part I like is quizzes and tests because I tend to choke on in-person tests. The online tests I have taken would be impossible to cheat on because they are open book, but the questions are super-specific So you wouldn't be able to Google or consult someone who didn't take the class.",

She also has one final question that she wants a legit essay on (intro, body, conclusion) that is worth 30% of your exam grade. This is along with multiple choice questions that are very specific. Time limit of 60 minutes. I read the chapters and even if I were to use my book during the exams you just don't have enough time to look everything up. I like the class but it's ridiculous. I use Google to look stuff up and even doing that I barely manage to finish on time. It's insane. And this is for a freaking gen ed religion class.
