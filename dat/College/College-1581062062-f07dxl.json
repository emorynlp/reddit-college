  "title:": "Is it weird to run everywhere on campus?",
  "text": "I often find myself running with my backpack on to various places in college. I run to my classes, I run to the bus stops, I run to the library, I run to my dorm, I run everywhere. I am not even an athlete or a runner, I just run. Why you may ask?\n\n- I am saving so much time by getting to places faster.\n- I am often running late.\n- I get some cardio in my day.\n- When it's cold out, running makes me less cold and I get to my warm destination faster.\n- Sometimes, listening to the Mission Impossible Theme while pretending to chase some enemy to save the world makes me feel badass.\n\nHowever, pretty much everyone on campus seems to walk. Why doesn't anyone ever run? I am wondering what others think when they see someone randomly zip past them. Is it weird to run on campus?",

I don\u2019t personally do it because A) I\u2019m self conscious and B) I\u2019m afraid something will fall out of my bag. However, if and when I do see someone running on campus, I don\u2019t give it a second thought. Anyone will understand why a person is running on a college campus and won\u2019t judge at all.",

I ended up getting a bike so no need to run anymore. In my opinion it\u2019s weird to run just because it\u2019s faster. If you want your actions to not be socially questionable, you need to only run out of necessity.",

      "text": "Quite frankly, adults don't usually run everywhere. Sometimes they run for fun, and rarely they run because they're late, but in my experience, even that second option is rare. This isn't to say you're not acting like an adult, but rather that most adults just don't run.\n\nThe biggest reason for this imo is that adult bodies don't recover as quickly as a kid's. We feel the *pain* part of running a lot more the older we get, and we also learn just how much damage a fall can do to a person. On top of that, most of us have come to the conclusion that being late isn't the end of the world, so we don't have as much stress in that department either. The things gained by running aren't worth the cost, in other words.\n\nWith that said, if you want to run, have the space to do so without hitting other people, and have a body that can handle the strain of running, I say feel free to continue.",

Don\u2019t worry about people\u2019s judgement in college. A lot of them are preoccupied with their own things and they\u2019re all weird in their own ways anyways - everyone is. It\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. It\u2019s something our culture has just engrained in us. Be free,l and be true to yourself and your pursuits. I worked hospice and everyone\u2019s worst regret was not doing something because they were afraid of how others would react. It was awful to hear that from so many people,It\u2019s tragic!",

And if you took the bus, drove, or carpooled in the winter time or if it's raining you would further minimize your exposure to the elements in transit. In addition, the amount of time your saving while running is probably negligible compared to walking. If your really always that late I would recommend learning to manage your time better, if not for this then for the future. It's a skill adults must learn and utilize to be successful in basically anything. Finally, just go to the school gym or track before or after class if you wanna get cardio in. It's really as easy as that and instead of looking weird, you look disciplined and at least somewhat athletic lol\n\nIf you like it then keep doing you. As long as you keep your hygiene straight it literally affects noone. But, you asked our opinion so I gave you mine lol \ud83d\ude4f",
