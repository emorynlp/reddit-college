  "text": "I am a second-year CS major, and I always try new things during the semester to see what works best for me. For this whole month, I've been getting all my work done during the week by heading straight to the library between/after classes; now, I don't do any work on the weekends unless absolutely necessary, and instead, I do light reviewing of the previous week's material. Has worked extremely well as I'm able to chill out during the weekend.  Hope your semesters are going well everyone!",
