      "text": "Not entirely too sure how they look at applications regarding ap in senior year. Although think about it. By May once you take the test you will already know what college you are going to attend. The only benefit I see in AP in senior year is too get early college credit, which you already know. Secondly if you have never taken them before and take them senior year it could show that you have matured but thats about it, and that might not even be heavy factor. If you are doing it solely to look good, I wouldn\u2019t stress too much about taking them. It just shows that you matured if you haven\u2019t taken much in your 9-11 grades.",
