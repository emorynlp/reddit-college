  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore and I\u2019m living with people I sorta get along with but sorta don\u2019t. On the one hand we\u2019ll have a laugh or throw a party, and the same week I\u2019ll hear the guy I\u2019m least close with talk about me behind my back. If we didn\u2019t have fun times, these guys wouldn\u2019t be my friends. I get along with most of them, but am in dire need of some real friends and feel lonely. I guess I can live with them for rest of the year but not for long.\n\nSo my question for those of you who have real friends you enjoy being with: how did you meet them? Any suggestions or advice in general? Could use some motivation too, I\u2019m feeling very down about my college life in general.",

Dorm friends brother had a roommate that ended up being my roommate sophomore year and ended being someone I still talk to 6 years later.",
