  "text": "Idk why I\u2019m even posting this story, maybe in case any of y\u2019all encounter this situation.\n\nThis semester I took a lab and lecture for anatomy with the same professor. She was new to the school so nobody really knew much about her. From the get go I could tell she was odd. Often dressed unprofessionally, think legging and t-shirts, and had greasy hair and very strong body odor, smelled like cat urine. It was honestly a distraction and probably a health hazard, I took to wearing scented lip balm to help cover it. She stated that she was aware of her odor and blamed it on her menopause and owning cats. \nAll of this is annoying but her behavior is a whole other story. She has a quick temper and screams at students for pretty much anything(asking questions), although she had her favorite students that she was super nice to. I cried in front of her once due to stress(I have a severe anxiety disorder) and she got mad at me and said I was \u201cabove her pay grade.\u201d Her treatment of me seemed to worsen when I told her I was autistic. I felt like I couldn\u2019t say a word to her or ask questions or anything, which sucked because it was a really difficult class and I have crappy hearing so I was constantly having to ask her to repeat herself which would make her scream. She often refused to answer my questions and told me to just look things up. At one point we were discussing vessels in the arm and she starting miming the motion of how someone would slit their wrists and screamed at me when I asked her to stop. \nOften when I would answer a question in class she\u2019d automatically say it was wro\n\nI became so anxious and stressed. She made my life a living hell. I studied my butt off for her class, even showing up to the optional review sessions. I really just wanted to get through the class but it was killing me. I lost 5 pounds due to the stress and was constantly nauseous and having panic attacks. Finally I went to the department head and reported her. I was scared to do so earlier because I didn\u2019t want her to retaliate but I couldn\u2019t take it any more. Between the lab and the lecture I saw her pretty much everyday and it was seriously impacting my mental health. While I was waiting for the head to meet with her she starting acting worse, making snarky comment in class towards me about the upcoming meeting. \nI wasn\u2019t there for the meeting but apparently she was pretty argumentative and pushed back quite a bit. I\u2019m surprised she kept her job given she\u2019s so new. \nI was switched to a different class and since then my performance has improved so much and my stress has decreased. \nAs for my feelings about the ordeal, I honestly feel a bit sorry for her. I learned from the department head that she has a long history of several jobs, never being able to hold down one. She seems autistic and has mentioned a few times that her parents thought she was as a kid but was never diagnosed. Her poor hygiene and the fact that she has gotten emotional in class before as well as telling us a bunch of personal stuff about her difficult childhood tells me she is probably hurting. I also get the impression that she lives alone with her cats and doesn\u2019t really have friends.\nIt\u2019s honestly a shame and makes me grateful that I got my autism diagnosis and the services I needed, even if it wasn\u2019t until my teens.\nGuess the moral of the story is to stand up for yourself? Idk I just felt like I needed to write this down",
