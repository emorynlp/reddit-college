  "text": "I got into a Biology program at a nice university. I got in because at that time I had no idea what I wanted to do. From a young age I\u2019ve had problems choosing what to be. From law, to being a chef, to being in the medical field and now to being in pharmacy.\nI\u2019ve always doubted what interests me. \n\nNow I\u2019m in Biology. Doing a degree that I can\u2019t see myself having a career in. \nMy parents are pleased with my choice, but i don\u2019t want to do it. I want to do something else. I\u2019m interested in aviation and want to be a pilot. But I know my parents will say that I\u2019m confused and they\u2019ll be disappointed in my inability to stick with a career choice. \n\nMy gut feeling is that I should change my major and join an aviation school. It\u2019s exciting and flying has always been an interest of mine. I don\u2019t want to do science as a career. I don\u2019t want a career in medicine or pharmacy. But I\u2019m afraid to tell my parents. What should I should I do?",

The schooling may be hard but the work can be rewarding in any of these fields and the best way to figure out what you like is to see what a day to day schedule is like. I had a lot of trouble finding what I liked too and changed my mind a lot. There are so many things to do, how does one choose just one area? Well, a lot of people go back to school for a second career. It\u2019s never too late to learn a different skill if you don\u2019t end up liking what you chose. \n\nI think the only thing your parents are really worried about is that if you keep changing, you may never have something to *show* for everything that you\u2019ve learned and that\u2019s what jobs care about: the piece of paper. That means, whatever you choose, finish it! To help ease their minds that you have properly eliminated some of these fields, shadow the workers. Then tell your parents that you just didn\u2019t like it. And go chase your dreams.\n\nWell, that\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it.",
