      "text": "Thats going to depend on the college youre at and the one you try to go to. I think a bigger issue will be finding a school that will accept you, theres no way to get around them knowing since your expulsion will be on your transcript which you will need to send to transfer credits and someone at admissions will undoubtedly ask you why you were expelled if its not given why. I was academically dismissed, not the same thing but the only reason I got accepted back to that school was because I completed an associates at a community college and had a great GPA. That might be your only path, but if youre past your second year I'm not sure how much sense that would make. Plan on sending a lot of applications",

Sometimes depending how severe your offense is, your transcript can say why you were dismissed. Sometimes it won\u2019t say anything but any school you apply to trying to transfer grades will most likely reach out to the previous school for the full story and might lower your chances severely. IMHO, start over with a clean slate at another school and for the love of whatever god you pray to do not cheat. It gets you no where and maybe 1 out of 10000000000 who cheated actually do succeed in life but you really wanna gamble on those odds? Pick an easier major or git good at studying.",
