  "text": "Just wanted to share that last week I broke my sternum and couldn't move for days. Let my professors know immediately and was able to get some extensions. All-in-all, I missed 16 assignments! One of them is an exam. But, yesterday I finally started them and now I have 10 to go. Going to really be adamant about completing more and more each day until they're gone! Stupid, I know, but I wanted to share.",
