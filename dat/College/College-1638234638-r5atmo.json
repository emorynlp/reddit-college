      "text": "I had a different major where I had the choice between claiming a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science when graduating.\n\nI can assure you it made absolutely no difference whatsoever. Employers and graduate schools will care that you have a Bachelor's degree in a field relevant to what you're applying to do, not whether it says \"Bachelor of Arts\" or \"Bachelor of Science.\" There may be some minimally different graduation requirements, but the difference between degree titles here is mostly cosmetic.",

      "text": "The difference between a BA and a BSc in Economics is that in the BSc you would need to take, well... science classes. You would have courses such as Chemistry and Biology as a requirements.\n\nI do a BA in Econ and I can assure you that no one cares whether it is a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science, to be honest. Choose what suits you better.",
