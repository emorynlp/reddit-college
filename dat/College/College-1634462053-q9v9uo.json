I have already spent 2 years here and am likely going to have to spend another 2 years finishing up all my prereqs (considering I don't fail a couple classes...) and I actually have a somewhat low gpa right now (2.5). \n\nI kind of wonder how normal it is for people to spend upwards of 4 years at a community college before transferring? Its so demoralizing because I feel so behind of where I think I should be and it honestly makes me feel dumb. \n\nEngineering major btw.",
