  "text": "I\u2019m trying to transfer to NC State next year, but I\u2019m in a zero credit seminar class that still shows up as pass or fail on my transcript. It\u2019s not a hard class to pass by any means, but we get graded on attendance and it\u2019s just a time waste in my opinion. Will this affect my chances of transfer? For context, I am a freshman who will have over the 30 required credits by the end of next semester.",
