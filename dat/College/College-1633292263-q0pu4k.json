      "text": "I personally use iStudiez Pro, along with GCal and a paper planner. In iStudiez, I use the syllabi to input all of my exams, assignments, and due dates by class at the beginning of the semester. You can play around with the settings, but it will alert you when you have upcoming assignments due. I feel like it gives me a good sense of what I need to be doing when. It integrates with GCal and Apple Calendar as well, so you can see your schedule outside of classes. From there, I also use a paper daily planner (you can do this in GCal or Apple calendar too, I just like having a separate one) and block out specific times each day to work on the assignments I have coming up. I also make sure to set aside time throughout the week to do readings, review notes, and make quizlets. I think the overall thing that helps is knowing how much time everything is going to take and how much you have to do and then using that information to schedule when you are going to do them.",

      "text": "I set myself specific study days throughout the week, but most of my studying I do on campus, I'll generally stay 4 hours after classes doing small assignments and studying, and a little bit of my projects. 24 hrs is definitely not enough time. To answer a question you may or may not be asking, yes you will have to far cut back 'chilling' or gaming time.",
