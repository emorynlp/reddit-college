  "text": "I\u2019m a 22 male in college and pleasuring myself sometimes seems to help ease the stress of college and the semester.\n\nI\u2019m single and don\u2019t want to hook up, but would rather have a lasting relationship. Until then, I still like being with myself and feeling better by pleasuring.\n\nAny other single college girls or guys do this too? I\u2019d love to know your thoughts on this. I\u2019m just confused and feel weird about it.\n\nAny advice helps! DM is open too. Thanks!",

Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures.
