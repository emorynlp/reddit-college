  "text": "I feel like this is so petty and dumb to feel bad about, but I haven't had the \"college experience\" at all. No crazy nights out, no real dating, no new interesting friends. I live at home and commute to school, but it's mostly online now anyway. My college also generally doesn't have a fun, social atmosphere anyway. The fact I haven't had any fun experiences also makes me feel bad about myself as a person too.\n\nMy time in college has been mostly doing HW and trying to improve myself. I'm not having any fun and it bums me out because college is usually the last time you get to be young, reckless, and just wildly enjoy life. I'm sad I probably won't get to have that. \n\nI just turned 21 and have a year left in college. Grad school is ahead of me. Just want to know if others are going through the same thing.",

Hollywood does oversell the college experience which I think is what\u2019s upsetting the OP, but there will be some schools like the legendary northern FL schools UF FSU FAMU where it\u2019s easier to turn up like that. The schools I went to were kind of in the middle. You can just be a student if you want to, but if you want to live an exciting college experience you have to go out of your way to see what\u2019s happening on campus (social media is your bestfriend for this) to participate. Once you get there, it\u2019s just a matter of being friendly and from there on you\u2019ll find more places with other ppl. It\u2019s sounds simple but it\u2019s not bc there\u2019s also a lot of inner work we all have to do for ourselves to overcome a lot of the problems we face. Like maybe being too shy, nervous, overthinking, confidence etc. While you\u2019re looking for the college experience, I recommend to also consider working on any personal traits you want to work on in order to feel more at peace. This could mean going to the extreme of being super out there or the extreme of not giving a F that you\u2019re not living *that* life to everything in between. Try it out",

To be honest, I also have an year left and kinda in the same boat but I don't feel bad about it. All you need to know is that it's going be an year long grind and after that you have a great future. Infact, 18-22 aren't that fun, as compared to 24 and beyond, you'll be young and smarter. Life is what you make of and to be Frank, I'm just waiting for this 1 year to pass by.",

I really hated my decision of going to community college because the social life was so bad for me. \n\nHowever, CC is good for people who want to save money, and for people who don\u2019t know what they want to major in yet. It also gives you a better shot into getting into any schools compared to applying as a HS applicant (excluding Ivy League).\n\nSummary: CC social life is bad, everything else is ok/good.",

I decide to try to make new friends. There was one kid in my group in business law and I was gonna try to form a friendship. I started to and then I would hear him talking to another kid about what clubs were gonna be the ones to go to this weekend. It was at that moment my mindset changed. You gotta think about this man, we pay to go here. To learn mainly. If you spend all 4 years worrying about the experience, personally for me it\u2019s a waste. I want to have a great job out of the gate. I know to do that I have to apply myself. Can\u2019t be going out every Friday and Saturday getting shitfaced and definitely can\u2019t be thinking about it at the start of the week. I see it this way, if you go to college mainly for the experience, and you truly apply yourself, you just wasted 4 years that you could have solidified knowledge of what you wanted to do enabling you to become successful earlier and retire earlier if you play your cards right. That\u2019s how I view it. Fuck the college experience bullshit. Room full of people I don\u2019t know screaming, yea no thanks I\u2019m set with me, my few friends, and my joint I smoke at night. The rest of the time I\u2019m putting my mind towards my goal, towards my success. Like you\u2019re paying tens of thousands of dollars to party, or you\u2019re making your parents? Like not you, but there are definitely kids who do this and it\u2019s like what sense does that make? It\u2019s really not worth it",

I can tell you that the highlight of my day when I was in CC; since graduating, was going to early morning classes for 1/3 hours (depending on classes) and then having the rest of the day to myself to do whatever I wanted. Go to bookstore, game store, coffee shop, mall, etc.\n\nWas never the type to \"fit in\" in school growing up really. The older I got the more I realized how I liked relaxing and chilling by myself (middle of the whole \"extrovert/introvert thing); not to say I don't like mingling with people as I love it, but nothing beats wondering around on your own, even if it's just taking a bus somewhere.",

      "text": "I can completely relate. My parents had a great college experience and idealize the past, so much so that I feel like a disappointment that I am tethered to my work. It isn't so much an alteration from my high school experience, yet with slightly more socialization. A lot of people are feeling alienated. One slight positive may be that, since we are in a global pandemic, you have less pressure to be partying. You only see those who are out not doing their work, I know so many people (employed) who were studious during college. The people out at bars may have one night of festivities, but that is the night they are seen. The rest of the time, they may be quietly chugging away at a desk or nook of the university, addressing the great amount of work.\r  \n\r  \nIn the past, university work did not extend so far; we are so digitalized now that those who are disciplined are never off the hook from their responsibilities. My advice would be to do something that is not within your character at all. Try an acting class; a painting class; a new form of exercise. Get involved with school clubs, as this can be a great place to meet people. I have expanded my social horizons significantly by attending my school's musical concerts, going to Poetry club, running club, calisthenics, a religious group, mountaineering, and a club for my major. When you talk about being reckless, you probably wouldn't appreciate your reckless times when you are this age. There are so many of my peers who are jaded by the experiences they have had and hence have to seek new highs, which have a net detrimental effect on them.\r  \n\r  \nYour set point for what is reckless, wild, and fun, has been sensitized, leaving you a broad range of potentialities for expansion. Life is short, but it is also a long winding journey, and there is no such thing as normal. You will appreciate the \"virgin\" aspects of life so much more if you save them. My friends have often expressed regret that they have done all the stereotypical college things (getting drunk at frat parties, drugs, sex, random nighttime spontaneous activities) and now are bored of them. Others never do those things and still have a lot of fun and grow as people.\r  \n\r  \nI suppose it depends on what you think is fun, and that personal criterion is always under flux. What someone who is a grad student thinks is fun varies greatly from what a freshman in college would consider an ideal night.\r  \n\r  \nFor the sake of curiosity, what do you consider fun? How can you work on incorporating those moments of levity, reprieve, or enlivening activities into the fabric of this stage of life?",
