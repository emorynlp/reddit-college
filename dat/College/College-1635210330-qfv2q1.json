We know the website says an amount that includes things like on campus board, meal plans, etc. I want to know if I should accept this offer based off of finances alone. It is a pricy school. What\u2019s the actual cost of attendance or thereabouts? Help me out?",

Rent will be around $1000-1300/mo for a 1br and you can probably almost cut that in half with a roommate in a 2br.\n\nProbably around $1000-1150/mo all in for living expenses if you rent with a roommate and live pretty minimally.",

      "text": "So I live in Philly and go to Temple, but both my parents went to Saint Joe's and I applied there back in high school, so I can try and help a little bit here.  It's definitely pricier and it would have cost me about double what I pay in the city for Temple if I went there.  Since it's a private school your financial aid offer is gonna make a huge impact on things, but you wouldn't be making a bad decision if you chose to go there.",
