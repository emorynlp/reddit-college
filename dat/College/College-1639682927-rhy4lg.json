Though, what\u2019s the point of attending college if you cheat your way through, and don\u2019t learn anything valuable?",

Each class is $500+ not including text books before taxes and fees. If you're making an effort to learn and just cheating to pass the class i dont see anything wrong with this. Some people might only have the funds to get through college once and thats it. Everyone's situation is different. At the end of the day we are all just here for that damn fancy sheet of paper. \n\nIf you cheat through college and cant do your job. It'll show. Not everyone gets the consequences they deserve but thats a different topic.",
