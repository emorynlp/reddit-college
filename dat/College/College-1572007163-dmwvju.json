  "title:": "Teacher is making us sit on seats with our numbers. Mine is 4th to last, what should I do?",
  "text": "Sorry for my bad English. \n\nSo our teacher got our names on a sheet and they're numbered from 1-86. \n\nMy number is 82 so I'll be sitting on the seat with 82 written on it. \n\nNow I wouldn't mind that on any other class but this one is REALLY important (Biology) & our teacher's voice is really low & by low I mean that the 6th row & behind won't hear a thing he says. \nI am on the 11th row. \n\nI talked to him about it and he pretty much told me to deal with it. \n\nAt the beggining of the semester he told us that if anyone is coming to class just so that they won't be marked as absent they could tell him privately and he won't take them as absent at all. \n\nI plan on doing just that & see if any other teacher wouldn't mind me being in their class. \n\nIs this a good plan? Or should I just deal with it?\n\nEdit : Thank you all for your suggestions. I'll see what I can do and hopefully give a happy update about it. \n\nI appreciate your help a lot.",

Don't waste you money, you're there for YOU. \n\nDo whatever you have to by talking to higher ups, if that doesn't work, even pushing it back a semester if you can and sign up for a different professor as soon as registration opens. You can email them as well and ask their policies. Whether they answer, IDK but mine always sent an email back. But I think the best bet is to see if you can get another class this semester if moving closer is not an option. Good luck!",

Attendance in class for most students will boost grades which is both better for the student and the college, but some students are better self-taught learners and these are the students who are impacted in the worst way. Or in your particular instance where attendance does not help you in anyway. Attendance grades should be a maximum of maybe 2-5% which gives the majority of students incentive to come to class, and the other students a choice that does not impact them so heavily.",

I am a grown person & if I don't know what's best for me (Not attending,in this case) then I am a dumbass and I deserve the consequences (Failing a class for example) but if I feel like being absent from a class is the better option for me then I shouldn't be punished for it either. \n\n>This should be immediately brought to your deans attention. If there is another teacher for this class see if you can transfer or at least attend those lectures\n\nThey normally do NOT allow transferring after the first 2 weeks of the semester, I'll see what I can do about that.\nBut I can attend the other class if I get a permission from the teacher. I don't need a permission from the dean. \n\nThere are about 15-ish other classes with maybe 5-7 teachers. So I'll see my options. There are 2 teachers that everyone thinks they're great so I'll see if I can attend one of their classes.\n\nThank you",
