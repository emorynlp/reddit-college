  "title:": "Thinking about dropping out\u2026again.",
  "text": "So, I dropped out of college back in 2001. Never even got an associates degree. \n\nI taught myself graphic design and web development and built a pretty good career in marketing out of those skills over the last 16 years. \n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ve gotten married, had two children, and purchased a home. \n\nA year ago, I realized that I could afford to pay out of pocket for school and decided to go back to finish my degree now that online courses were so prevalent. \n\nWell, last week, a weird thing happened. I got a huge raise at work. I\u2019m now making $120k/year. I\u2019m in shock. The problem is that with this raise comes added responsibilities. I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m going to be able to do school AND this job at the same time. I\u2019m already having trouble enough keeping up with only one class this semester. \n\nI don\u2019t want to give up on college again. But I also don\u2019t want to screw up this job that I\u2019m proud of and really enjoy. Should I just take a break and enjoy the gravy train while it lasts?",

      "text": "I think you gotta ask yourself why you want to go to college again. Is it because you want a better paying job? Is it because you like school and want to learn something new? Is it because of the popular stigma that those who didn't finish college are a failure?\n\nIf you're content with the new salary you're getting, I wouldn't go. If you just want to go back just to learn, that would be great, but what other benefit could you get from all of the hard work? That's something only you could know. And finally, if you're doing it just to get a degree, I would say it's not worth it. Your life story is a great example of how to succeed without a college diploma",

          "text": "Yeah those are all good points. The goal of going back was to get a better paying job. I was wanting to get into a VP or CMO position eventually and realized that it was going to be very difficult without a bachelor\u2019s, much less an Associates. In my mind, VP or CMO for the size of company I want to work for in that position would\u2019ve paid around what I\u2019m now making. \n\nI also enjoy learning new things and have immensely enjoyed the last year of school. \n\nAs to your last point about the stigma, that is part of my motivation as well, but not the sole reason I went back. \n\nI also feel like dropping out would be yet another indication that I have an issue with finishing hard things I start. I would see myself as a failure even if most people wouldn\u2019t see it that way.",

              "text": "Why not just drop down to part time? Take one or two classes a semester if you can manage that ? That way you\u2019re still working on finishing what you started and learning new things. Honestly i\u2019m currently in grad school and if I was making 120k without the doctorate i\u2019m getting, id drop out immediately lol. But I already have a BS and understand why you\u2019d feel like you NEED to finish that. Best of luck! :)",

You are already successful. I'd take a chance to enjoy what you have accomplished and not worry too much about a degree.",

              "text": "I don't think there's anything wrong with finishing your college degree just for the satisfaction of it, basically as a side hobby. But keep in mind that that's what it is: a side hobby. You have a great job already, so that's understandably your priority. If you can manage to take one course per semester, go for it. But if it seems like it's jeopardizing your real job, put it on hold again. There's nothing wrong with taking a break; there will come a point when you have more time again, either because you've settled into your new job responsibilities, or your children are older, or whatever. Pausing to focus on what's more important isn't a sign of failure at all.",
