  "text": "So this is my third or fourth try at college. I failed miserably the first times but have been successful in passing all of my classes this go around. My cumulative gpa was a 2.25 and my evaluated gpa for my aa in English was a 1.91. Can anyone explain how they got the evaluated gpa and if my cumulative went up to a 2.38 this semester will my evaluated go up past a 2.0?",
