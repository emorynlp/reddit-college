  "text": "I\u2019m a 21F who is in Community College. Most of everyone\u2019s classes are online, due to CoVid19, & the main building for my school that is used for tutoring is closed. My school does offer 24/7 tutoring online, but it is definitely not the same as seeing someone in person. \n\n What are some tips or advice beyond the usual \u2018seek tutoring\u2019 that you could give to a struggling college student ?",
