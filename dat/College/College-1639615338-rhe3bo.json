  "text": "I am currently in the middle of my Physics final, and reflecting upon my science classes in both high school and college, I feel like Physics isn't the right class for me.\n\nFor context, I am a Computer Science major, and I am just infinitely more invested in the humanities than in the sciences. The sciences I find very boring and difficult and its hard for me to barely survive a science class. I picked physics b/c of the reasoning that it will teach you the most useful things for CS and Engineering out of the 3 big sciences (bio, chem, physics) but now that I am close to failing the Physics final, I have to reconsider.\n\nFrom my experience, out of the three major sciences: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics, I have had a much easier time with Chemistry. I had to take all three of these as an AP in High School: I struggled with Physics, flunked out of Biology within a year, and actually somewhat enjoyed Chemistry, although the pandemic coming in last minute kind of hampered my potential Chemistry score a little bit. I have had a wide variety of teachers for all three of those subjects throughout HS and College so I think it is safe to say that if I have to take a science class for graduation, I might be better off taking Chemistry.\n\nIt's not as much of a no-brainer however. After all, I know for certain am going to get a C on this Physics class no matter how badly I do on the final. I have 2 semesters left but might be open to taking at least one more considering that my community college is currently looking into offering bachelor's degree program a year or 2 from now, but its curriculum is unknown meaning I can't prepare for it. I've already taken an extra semester to not have too many classes in any of my semesters. So the decision is switch to Chemistry now and risk getting overloaded in one of my future semesters (with an advanced Computer Science class and a Discrete Math class), or stay in Physics and trudge through a higher-level class of the same mediocre-at-best professor on the same subject that I have shown disinterest in for the sake of not risking an overloading or second extra semester.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not an absolute truth that physics will give you better reasoning skills than the other two. I would honestly argue that, at an introductory level, it\u2019s pretty poor at serving that purpose.\n\nIf chem comes easier to you, I don\u2019t think that the \u201coverloading\u201d risk is too relevant",
