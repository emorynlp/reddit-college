They're often used by deans and other administrators for faculty performance reviews and tenure applications in addition to curriculum review. They're also a necessary component of accreditation. While one bad or good course evaluation won't make a difference, if there are common themes and patterns in them it certainly can be a cause for additional attention or even action. \n\nAdministrators will never care about RateMyProfessor in my experience, they know it's biased towards the negative reviews and it still has an air of illegitimacy since it used to grade instructors on \"hotness\". I do think it's probably the only place where the students are actually honest with their feedback, even if negative.\n\nWe recently surveyed our students about course evaluations and the results were unsurprising that not many students trust them. A common response was that students either alter their handwriting or just flat out lie and say positive things since they don't trust instructors wouldn't be able to identify them even though there were processes in place to make that impossible.",

However if they've had multiple writing assignments, i imagine the profs can tell who the comments are coming from.",

                  "text": "That will likely vary from university to university depending on the faculty contract. Tenured faculty can certainly be fired with cause, it happens, but typically for malfeasance or some sort of criminal activity. While course evaluations have a lot less weight for tenured faculty, there can be financial consequences to poor evaluations and I've seen raises withheld until there is an improvement. \n\nIf your professor is cancelling that many courses I would take it to your dean. You're paying tuition for a certain number of instructional hours the university is failing to deliver. Mention that and express concern about learning outcomes being met with so many cancellations. That's an accreditation standard. Also if your syllabus mentions a certain number of lectures bring that up as well. While syllabi are not legal documents (despite common belief), they are good faith agreements, so any changes to it should not disadvantage you. **Do not** mention lawyers or any legal action however even if you just mean it casually. This is a common mistake and it halts any potential solution on the spot as the university must bring in its legal counsel at that point.\n\nAs for my mention of curriculum review, that was more related to the periodic review of curriculum that departments do. If there is a certain course where students across many sections are saying there was too much material and not enough time to cover it that could be used as a justification for changing some of the course content or possibly credit load. Typically faculty have a lot of freedom in how they teach and assess learning in their courses which is why mileage can vary depending on what section of a course you get.",
