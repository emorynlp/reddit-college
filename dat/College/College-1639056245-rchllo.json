  "text": "This is a bit of a read, but It\u2019s an earnest question.\n\nI\u2019m an art student so my final wasn\u2019t like a test but just the last critique and it\u2019s a 100 lvl course. I had an A- in the class, participated in all the critiques prior and had perfect attendance the entire semester aside from when we had a work day and I\u2019d been pardoned by the teacher from coming in because I\u2019d finished my project. Here we are at finals and the last critique was at Wednesday at 10am, but on Sunday it was changed to 8am and thanks to my blackboard app for not giving me the notif for the announcement, I was half an hour late.\nI got the grade back and simply due to being late I was brought to a B in the class. And I don\u2019t super care about that part, but I asked my mother who used to be a college level music theory teacher and she said that they aren\u2019t supposed to change finals times bc a student could have another at the same time, and i was wondering if that\u2019s accurate before I email someone about it.",

      "text": "This is really weird. Your university should have a posted final exam schedule that gives the exam window for courses that regularly meet on certain days/times. At my university, we aren't allowed to change this time without getting approval from the dean's office because it can cause confusion or exam conflicts for students.",
