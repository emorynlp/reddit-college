I have 2 days to turn it in and i cant stop thinking of it. I have to get scholarly sources and cant find much on my topic, let alone anything to make an argument on it. What if my argument is stupid with no basis, what if i cant find anything on the databases of scholarly sources. I feel backed into a corner and im so scared.",
