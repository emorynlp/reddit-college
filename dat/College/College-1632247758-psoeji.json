  "text": "Hi folks, hope you don't find it bothering that I'm a professor who lurks.   But since Covid, I've joined this subreddit because I want to know what's going on with students' mental health, but don't want my students to feel weirded out if I ask.\n\nWhat I've learned is that a lot of you are Not Doing Okay.   And that Covid-19 and online learning is really, really stressing you out.   And I'm sorry that I don't have any good answers for that.\n\nBut the other thing I see is people struggling on how to study in college, which is so different from studying in High School.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of students are missing out on the very thing that would help you out.  **I'm NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I THINK, I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE F\\*\\*KING SCIENCE.**\n\nThere have been SOOOO many epistemological studies about easy things you can change regarding note-taking that will literally improve your grades, your exams, and your general understanding.\n\nSome of you will know all of this already.  But note-taking isn't just something we're born knowing how to do and bugs the hell out of me that no one bothers to ever teach it.\n\nSo for those who don't know what are essentially \"study hacks\", here's the science:\n\n# #1) TAKING NOTES BY HAND AUTOMATICALLY STICKS INSIDE YOUR MEMORY MORE THAN TAKING NOTES ON A LAPTOP DOES, EVEN IF YOU NEVER LOOK AT YOUR NOTES AGAIN.\n\n(Link to the study: [https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf) )\n\nWhen it comes to remembering facts, like \"When did the civil war start?\" there wasn't much of a difference.  \n\nHowever, when it comes down to understanding the CONCEPTS, students who wrote longhand did unbelievably better.  As in three times better.   If you want to know why they did so much better, go to hack #2.\n\n# #2) USING YOUR OWN WORDS TO WRITE DOWN NOTES IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WRITING DOWN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROFESSOR SAYS IN THE LECTURE.\n\nDirectly from the study: \"Overall, p**articipants who took more notes performed better whether or notebook or laptop,** \u03b2 = 0.34, p = .023, partial R2 = .08. ***However, those whose notes had less verbatim overlap with the lecture performed \\[even\\] better,*** \u03b2 = \u22120.43, p = .005, partial R2 = .12  \n\n\nFor instance, if the prof's slide says: \n\n`\"Psychologists have investigated a phenomenon known as \u201cattitude inoculation,\u201d which works on the same principle as vaccination, and involves exposing people to weak arguments against a viewpoint they hold.\"`  \n\n\nDon't write that down verbatim.  Write down what it \\*means\\* and in your own words.  Something like:\n\n`If you challenge someone's opinion with weak arguments, but a lot of them, they'll actually double-down on their opinion`\n\nOr, for real shorthand, fast\n\n`Lots of weak arguments = they'll double down`\n\nSo long as you can tell what that means.\n\n# #3) VISUALS HELP\n\nDraw whatever helps you understand the concept, be it graphs or maps or whatever.   Such as:  \n\n\nWATCH THIS VIDEO:  \n\nIt's from a guy that scored 99.9th percentile in his med school classes, and he attributes it to his note-taking skills:\n\nLINK:[https://medschoolinsiders.com/pre-med/study-less-study-smart-what-i-wish-i-knew-in-college/](https://medschoolinsiders.com/pre-med/study-less-study-smart-what-i-wish-i-knew-in-college/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# #4) HERE'S THE BIG BIG BIG BIG HACK THAT WILL SAVE YOU THE MOST TIME:\n\nReview your notes within twenty-four hours.  This can save you hours of extra studying in the long run.\n\nMake sure it's within 24 hours though!   Science isn't 100% sure why it has to be done within that time frame, but it could be because of (theoretical but certainly not debunked) \"neural dumping.\"  Basically, this means as you sleep at night your brain shits out all the information that is non-essential.\n\nGuess what's non-essential:  calculus.  history.  English lit.     Sure, not to you, but to your brain?  It says, \"F\\*\\*k it, we need the space.  Get rid of this crap.\"\n\nLet me know if any of this is helpful, or if it's just mostly annoying stuff that you already know.\n\nTake care guys.  It's only 4 years of hell, I promise.  After that, it's only 40 more years of hell in the workforce, but at least it's a different kind of hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:  You can save time with some easy changes.",

      "text": "Think I have ptsd or rsd from number 1. Before my bp2/adhd diagnosis I had teachers yell at me for having a laptop. Being in my 30s and working in offices ment I can't write well. Very messy serial killer handwriting. The study you linked didn't load but the example my professors made came from a study done on teens. Yeah, in the 90s I could take notes and was an A student. As an adult I thought I was dyslexic but got diagnosed with other things. I also still write out my laptop notes. I'm an artist so drawing helps the most. That study didn't account for students writing things out after lecture. Which takes me hours. And the ODA office accommodations are trying to hold us to neurotypical standards. I failed a drawing class for instance but have sold thousands of pieces of art along with drawings and diagrams being published in books. I took biology 2 twice. Aced it at school 1. Transferred and had to take it again. Failed. Why? Couldnt use my laptop the second time. I spelled everything wrong or  couldn't read what I wrote or understand tricky wording. I know I misread things because I answered the same things correctly in other classes.",

These students are top of the class and they clearly do well in school. The topic of the discussion was the anxiety and very real problem of finding a job and having to acquire skills we don't have. We didn't need to use these type of skills to perform well in school.",

      "text": "It\u2019s cool to see a prof sharing these tips, bless you.\n\nAs someone who recently finished my degree, I wanna second that tip about reviewing notes within 24 hours after. There were some classes where I had to record a lot of things verbatim because the profs talked so quickly, there wasn\u2019t a chance to process a detail long enough to rewrite it in my own words. So I\u2019d go back to my notes after class and rewrite them in a way that was more organized and personal, so it was easier to understand them when I needed to study.\n\nAlso if you have recorded classes, take advantage of that. Still go to your class, but if there\u2019s a part of the lecture where your exhaustion is hitting you hard or you aren\u2019t quite grasping something your prof is saying, write the time down on your notes. That way, you know what part of the recording you need to review later on.\n\nI will say I think \u00ab\u00a0always write notes by hand\u00a0\u00bb is one of those tips that everyone should try but some may not find it as helpful as others. I know the study it came from, but wow it just didn\u2019t work for me. Remember most statistics have outliers. I always miss things when writing by hand, end up not even being able to read what I wrote later on, and get about 1/3 of the info down compared to when I type. It just made class stressful and I got hand cramps.\n\nWhat *did* work for me though was, if I needed to memorize information, going to my typed notes later and making flash cards of important details (or a hand written study guide) by hand. You still get the memorization benefit of writing things out but can do it on your own time.",

          "text": "Of course!  And if you have more questions, just message me.\n\nSo question #1...  I am in the same situation you are.  I write slow.   When I try to write fast, it looks like ... squiggles.  So there's two things you can do:\n\n1. write in the squiggles and immediately after class, go re-write the notes in normal handwriting.   (However, it sounds like you don't have much time after class, so....)\n2. Write as fast as you can, don't even finish sentences if you can't.  Literally, if all you can write before the prof moves on is \"17th Century marriage thing is....\"  \nNow, I know that doesn't make sense, which is why you need to be doing the second part:  record the lecture.  Even if your school has a policy against it, they really can't tell if you just turn your phone on record.   Then, when you have time, you can FF to whereabouts the prof starts talking about 17th Century marriages, and figure out what \"thing\" was being talked about.   Even better, You can write \"17th Century marriage...\"  then glance at your phone to see where the recording is (it should show you how long the recording has been going...) and then write down that time.   So, if it might look like \"17th Century marriage - 20:31\" That means that you can just FF to 20 minutes 31 seconds in, and that way you don't have to search all over for the place where the prof was talking about it.\n\nThe thing is, you'll have to do one or the other, and that takes time.   Now, if you can keep up with the note if you type on a laptop -- DO THAT!   Because looking at the study, the main problem with typing on the laptop is that students were just transcribing what the prof said.  The big thing is that you put everything in your own words.  That made the difference.\n\nThe most important is you set up a system you can actually do.  If it's going to take too much time to do the recording / re-writing then you're probably going to wind up not doing it, or putting it off.   \n\nQuestion #2 - I don't think it matters.  In fact, I think if you have a morning habit (like drinking coffee, or eating breakfast) you can just make a habit of reviewing your notes first thing in the AM.  And I'm sure it's better to do it at a time where you're not exhausted, and you can concentrate.",

If you\u2019re worried someone will see your phone recording, put it face down, or record on a laptop window you can minimize/put behind another window.\n\nThey tell you not to record mostly because that opens the door for you to share it with others. So, don\u2019t do that. Keep the recording for yourself to study and nobody will know.",

That way when your time off comes its actually restful and refreshing rather than stressful about all the stuff you havent done. \n\n\\-Do active reading rather than passive. When you read, take notes and \"play professor.\" Each section think to yourself \"if I was the proff and I was writing the exam is there anything in here that I would put on an exam or in a review session?\" It serves a dual purpose, it makes sure you are actually thinking about what you are reading rather than just passivly taking info in. It also creates notes for you so that when its time to review for exams you wont have to read the whole book again. It also allows you to tease out any questions you may have so that if you go to office hours you know what you need. \n\n\\-Break up study sessions to about 45 min of any one activity. Doesnt mean only study for 45 min, but dont do much more than that of any one thing. Switch it up, strech, do a quick chore. After about 45 min learning fatigue checks in and often the brain checks out so while you may be putting in time you probably are not actually taking in the information. \n\nStudy smarter, not harder or longer.",

I'd add to it that you should try to write questions that you don't immediately know the answer to and study the hardest parts/the stuff that gives you the most trouble. If you finish a study session feeling like you know everything, you probably studied for your ego and not for your brain. \n\nA good analogy for sports people out there: studying should feel like practice or hitting the gym. You shouldn't be finishing feeling like you nailed it, you should be exhausted because you pushed yourself super hard. The test is like game day, it should feel easier than the practice because you prepped so hard that the actual event feels easy and natural.",

Overall, it's made taking notes a hell of a lot easier and honestly kind of fun.

              "text": "I have the same problem too! With ADHD, you can do it, but it's that you \"just\" can't do it. My youngest brother has impulsive ADHD, and I don't. So, I didn't know I had ADHD because I based the ADHD my brother had on the overall symptom of what ADHD was. \r\n\nWent through years and even till now have crazy eating disorders and mental problems. Failed a year in college and got put on suspension, but I didn't even realize I was failing my classes because my brain was somewhere else. I didn't even know I got put on suspension! Failed my relationships and friendships because I was a \"slow\" person. So, I came off as someone who was not very caring because I wasn't attentive. Got into car accidents. Would \"see\" people get aggressive with each other, but while I was watching, I was spaced out and didn't read the room.\r\n\nThe very generic of everyday life or task was something I couldn't pay close attention to because I just had a hard time focusing. My attention span just felt so limited, and when I felt overwhelmed, my brain shuts down everything and I would forget what I was supposed to do. When it's boring, I'm looking at lightbulbs. When I enjoy it, I start having panic attacks because I just spent a whole day doing something I didn't plan to do.\r\n\nHaving ADHD, your mind is less likely to recall where things are located, where you are, or what you're doing in a situation or conversation. This also includes having a hard time keeping track of time.\r I always thought it was simply me being an overthinker, or a deep dreamer of life, but it was just my brain wanting to shut some \"problems\" out because it was \"less\" rewarding.",

And back when I started, laptops and tablets were not the norm and we all had 500 sheet notebooks and actually used the print textbook lol. Now let me clarify, taking notes on your laptop or tablet can be beneficial depending on the course. Don\u2019t write math notes on a keyboard (although I do \u201cre-type\u201d my notes in Word using the equation function to make them pretty when I print them) and for the love of whatever god you pray to at night DO NOT get tempted to browse social media or YouTube or other distractions. I feel that\u2019s the BIGGEST pet peeve for professors when students bring technology to class. I love writing notes on my Surface pro in one note. For programming, typing in Notepad++ was beneficial. For other gen Ed courses it was helpful. Heck, I\u2019ve even recorded my lectures live on my webcam (audio only though with the webcam off) so I can finalize my notes at a later time. But if you start getting distracted then all the pros of using tech for note taking goes down the toilet (and you potentially ruin it for others who actually use tech in the correct way in a classroom setting).",

          "text": "The biggest difference between high school and college is the rate at which material is covered. You cover in a semester or quarter in college what you would normally have a full year to learn in high school. So they take 2-3 class sessions to cover what will get covered in one session (potentially at warp speed) in college. They expect you to do at least 50% of your learning outside class in college, whereas the vast majority of learning in high school occurs during class.\n\nThe people who were less efficient learners in high school (needed to review outside class, couldn't finish homework during class, etc) often do better in college because they are already used to taking notes and studying. I had a really rough time learning to study in college. Once I got in my groove I FLEW, but I definitely blew off and wasted about 2 years of college before I got my shit together. \n\nNow I'm in a PhD program and teaching college, so there's that. :) \n\nDuring my PhD program I'm re-discovering the \"joys\" of extensive note-taking. I have an iPad with a stylus and notepad where I can cut and paste notes and write notes or type them. I definitely remember many more fine details when I handwrite my notes rather than cutting/pasting or typing. Alas, it takes me twice as long to hand write them. \\*SIGH\\* So we end up having to make choices and prioritize. \n\nYou'll find what works for you, as long as you put in the time. But you have to devote more time outside of class in college, FOR SURE.",
