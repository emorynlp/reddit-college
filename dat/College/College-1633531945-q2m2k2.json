  "text": "I'm a sophomore in college right now, planning on majoring in Business Admin with a concentration in either Marketing or Accounting. I have always had a deep interest in history, though. I'm 2 classes away from a minor and 6 from a major. Is this a stupid reason to double major?\n\nedit: typo",

If you're not getting a job that needs history, it's silly as shit to add another few grand to pay back on the basis that you love history. \n\nCollege is selling you courses. They cost a lot of money. It's crazy to be working on anything other than what nets you income later on. \n\nWhat's the cost of those 6 courses? Will the history major allow you to earn that money plus some over the course of your career or will it just be another badge on your boy scout sash?",
