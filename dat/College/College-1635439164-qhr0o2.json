  "text": "I (18F) just graduated this past may (2021). I decided to do college at Bevill just to get my basics out of the way, and I got full pell grant. I lived 30 minutes away from my college, and I stupidly chose morning classes.\n\nI moved closer, but we didn\u2019t have internet for over a week so I got behind on my work and missed tests. I wanna withdrawal and try again next semester or maybe next fall semester. However, I used the rest of my pell grant money to trade in my Jeep for a new vehicle (it was worth it. The Jeep would barely crank). \n\nI decided I wouldn\u2019t say anything to the college, but in the meantime, I would use OnlyFans to get extra money to pay the pell grant back. I made the account but I haven\u2019t posted yet.\n\nI have 2 jobs and I try to keep a decent social life (I have no friends btw, I only spend time with my bf). One of my coworkers has 3 jobs, is keeping up her social life, and is still going to school. I don\u2019t understand how she does it. I can barely function because going to school will give me literally ZERO off days. \n\nPeople who are going through the same thing as me, and are still functioning enough to do school without failing, how do you do it?",

It could be she\u2019s spending late nights doing work, or that her grades are actually suffering because she putting more effort towards work and her social life.",

          "text": "That\u2019s true. I work 12 hours shifts on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. That means that on the weekends, I can\u2019t go out and do things but I\u2019m being invited to a lot of things. I feel horrible when I have to turn people down. I have another job and I work every Thursday night pretty much guaranteed but Monday and Tuesday is kinda iffy. I might work those days, I might not. Just with work by itself, I have no time to even sit down and eat something. I really wanna go to school but at this point I\u2019m scared to bc I\u2019m sooo far behind and I just don\u2019t know what to do bc I don\u2019t wanna fail.",

I also did 60 college credits in high school, so I\u2019m kind of more used to university than most of my peers. I also made the unfortunate mistake of taking morning classes because my roommates are super inconsiderate and stay up super late.",
