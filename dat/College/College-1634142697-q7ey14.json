  "text": "Hi all,\n\nSo a prof of mine likes to give us a lot of work for some reason and all of it is through Cengage. Now gladly I can redo this class next semester as I have the room in my schedule :)\n\nI know this isn't 100% the place to ask but MindTap can actually track which start files you have for particular assignments and notify your teacher (Didn't know until yesterday) and she sent me a message about it.\n\nI already told her I didn't cheat and that I can gladly redo these assignments. What do I do from here?",
