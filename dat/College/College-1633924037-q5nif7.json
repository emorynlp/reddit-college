  "text": "Hey, so I\u2019m going back to college in January and ill be late 2 semesters because I couldn\u2019t transfer my credits. I don\u2019t want to start from the beginning so I\u2019m wondering if i should do a diploma in marketing, like is the diploma worth it being only 2 years or should i accept starting again going for a 4 years degree?",

      "text": "First, look at why you couldn't transfer the credits. Were the national accredited and you are going somewhere that is regionally accredited, which is a higher level? Does your new college accept any CLEP tests or DANTES exams? How about credit for previous experiential learning (jobs, licences, certificates? I would absolutely go for the bachelor's degree.",

      "text": "I don't think just a diploma will cut it so I'd pursue a degree, but make it cheap by transferring in cheap credits like CLEP (modernatates.org has review classes and vouchers for the exams free- you might pick up credit for the classes you've taken elsewhere that way). ASU.edu has transfer agreements with a couple of universities in Mexico - could your foreign university have any possible transfer partners here?  Ea.asu.edu has an earned Admissions path. You take a certain number of hours according to your age for $425 per class, no fin aid, and you can drop classes without penalty. Starbucks has a deal where you work for them and they'll pay your online tuition at ASU and a lot of people do that.",
