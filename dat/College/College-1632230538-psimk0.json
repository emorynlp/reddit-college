  "text": "(tagged nsfw for tw: suicide at the end)\n\nWell, first of all I feel very sick. I know it\u2019s very likely just a normal virus, but I failed my daily \u201cvital check\u201d form which allows me to go and like, do anything basically. It actually said I need to \"go home\" but I still literally live here and home is very far away. Also I didn\u2019t want to lie and say I haven\u2019t been sick otherwise there\u2019s no point in taking it lol (it is required though). And I really do feel very sick, it's hard for me to fall asleep at night or rest comfortably. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been absent, and I\u2019m incredibly overwhelmed.\n\nI REALLY, REALLY hate myself. I feel like I\u2019m running away. While on one hand it is nice to not have to go to class, I definitely have an overwhelming amount of work to make up for, yet it doesn\u2019t feel quite \\*real\\* but I know it will soon. (Well being sick feels awful too, but not as awful as going to class, it's always been this way for me). But on the other hand, I could actually be endangering everyone else in the class if I go (even if it's not actually covid either). I\u2019m hopefully getting cleared today to be able to go to class tomorrow, but I uh\u2026. I\u2019m not sure if I need to take a covid test. Some of my professors I emailed the other day (to let them know I wouldn\u2019t be there) suggested I do, and it might be required for me to get worksite cleared. But the thing is, I won\u2019t be able to come back onto campus if I\u2019m not worksite cleared yet \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nThere\u2019s SO MANY assignments I missed that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to make up. At this point I, I don\u2019t know what to do at all. I feel really hopeless. I'm kind of really scared to approach my professors about it, too. I had a hard time keeping track of things normally, but now it's even more difficult. I took most people's advice to rest so I could get better as soon as possible, but I'm still sick and now I haven't done anything to make up. And to be honest, I don't think the mental stress is helping me either, even the physical act of crying is making me feel even worse. \n\nI really want to transfer somewhere else that\u2019s better for my major. But at this rate I won\u2019t be able to. I\u2019m so lost and I don\u2019t know what to do at all. I seriously don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m lost and overwhelmed, it\u2019s just like junior year of high school all over again. I was suicidal, and I effectively ruined a lot of my (admittedly shallow) dreams and all the hard work I had put in during high school before that. It took a long time to recover from that but in the end I luckily managed to get into a university, though. But I don't know if I'll be able to go through that time again, even just a little bit of it. Being sick is making me go even more insane than I already was just being here. \n\nWell, anyways, if anyone has any advice for what I should do I would really appreciate that. Thanks.",

      "text": "I've been in this frustrating situation before, so here's my advice!\n\n1. Things to do right now:\n\n\\- Contact your professors ASAP. Let them know the whole story. Your worries and concerns, everything. Professors are human beings too and they'll be able to understand and empathize what you're going through. \n\n\\- In addition, ask them if there's anyway you can move the weight from your present assignments onto future assignments. Tell them that you don't want to fall behind on the future assignments because you would still have to do the past assignments when you're healthy again. It would just be too much work. \n\n\\- Once you've emailed your professors. And that's completely done. \n\n\\- Take a break. I don't know what your living situation is. But take a break. Go take a shower. Get comfortable. And watch your favorite movie  and/or tv show with your favorite drink and/or favorite food. Play a video game. Do whatever makes you happy. That's it. Just relax. Maybe even go sleep. \n\n\\- It's not your fault that you're sick. You shouldn't beat yourself down. You need to rest. And it really seems to me that you need to provide yourself with some self-love. \n\n\\-You're doing an awesome job and you clearly care a lot about school. You're trying your best and that's all that really matters. \n\n  \n\\-So go easy on yourself. It's all good. I promise. \n\n2. Things to do in the future:\n\n\\- Find out if you have accessibility at your school. I had to register with accessibility due to my mental illness. It might help you in the long run. Accessibility had some really helpful resources that really kept me sane and on track. \n\n3. Final Takeaway\n\nLastly, I hope you feel better.And I hope you know that your health is always the number 1 priority. \n\nYou staying alive is the number 1 priority. All the other crap in the world doesn't matter. \n\nSo take care of yourself and make sure to prioritize your happiness, your health and your life today. \ud83d\udc96",
