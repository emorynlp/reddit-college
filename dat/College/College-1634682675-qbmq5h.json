  "text": "My college is just now holding the first classes (I know it's quite late) and all the professors mention 2-3 or more books as literature to study for the class. In the IT class I'm taking for example, the professor told us to get 2 books of 700 pages each, and another one that I can't find and have to look for physically on campus. Thankfully, the professors give us links to free pdf's so they don't cost 100+ each, but isn't this too much information to study?",
