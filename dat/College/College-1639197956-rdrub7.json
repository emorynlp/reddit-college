  "text": "So I go to CC and paid $3.1k for the fall semester, taking 4 regular classes and 1 remedial. Friends of mine that go to a big, good university are paying exactly the same. That's when I started to think... what the f? Like, I didn't apply to any big uni because I thought my financial aid was not going to cover all expenses, but then I find out that my friends are paying exactly the same as me. \n\nI don't know, I feel robbed. Is this even normal? Should I try to transfer? My experience in CC has not been good at all.",
