  "title:": "Going to have to change my major because of calculus",
  "text": "genuinely, who decided calculus could be taught as an async online course. The homework is easier than the tests by a solid margin and even when I think I\u2019ve got it, my profs insanely harsh grading will never let me get above an 80. He also decided to throw in polar curves (calc 1C material) for fun when we\u2019re already rushing so much. I was a business major, but looks like I\u2019ll have to major in something that doesn\u2019t need calculus. Just another thing to add to the list of COVID related disasters. Fucking love college.",
