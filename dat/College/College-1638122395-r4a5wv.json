  "text": "i don\u2019t hate it, but i don\u2019t like it and it\u2019s really making it hard to want to put the effort in to meet anyone or do anything. my college is a huge party school in the middle of nowhere and it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just not my scene. and other than that there\u2019s absolutely nothing to do. like genuinely. i\u2019ve joined clubs and i have a handful of friends i really love, i just feel out of place. i\u2019m much more of a humanities kind of person, so the huge sports/greek life/partying focus the school has just makes me feel like there\u2019s no place for me here. i would love to transfer to a bigger city, however this is the only college in the whole country that offers my major. so i\u2019m stuck. \n\nhas anyone struggled with this and do you have any ideas for how to make the most of it? i absolutely love my major and classes, but the whole not belonging feeling weighs on me whenever i\u2019m there. i\u2019ve started going home every weekend because i just feel so uncomfortable spending time there. being visibly lgbt+ doesn\u2019t help either since there aren\u2019t many of us here. on top of that we have a shit response to safety/diversity issues but that\u2019s a whole other can of worms. i\u2019d really like my college experience to not be a miserable one, any ideas? thanks pals",

      "text": "same boat as you, and i actually did try to transfer in my first year - before covid blew it out of the water. what helped for me is realizing that college isn't the \"best\" period of your life despite what everyone wants to believe. there's plenty to do after you graduate, and once you finish your degree you'll be that much closer to achieving a life you want.\n\ni'm also applying for a study abroad for my next academic year in a city i love considerably more. if off-campus programs are an option, i'd look into those! doesn't have to be study abroad either, your school might offer a co-op year if you score a nice internship.\n\nanother new development is that i now live off campus in a student apartment. it's been great to have a space to kinda distance myself and have a clearer designation between \"home\" and \"work.\"\n\nanother recommendation is to find a part time job. nothing too soul crushing, preferably on campus for ease, but having a good workplace has done wonders for my overall happiness. i'm employed at my department's woodshop and my co-workers are exactly the kind of people i vibe with and i have lots of flexibility to pursue projects.\n\nnot transferring schools has unironically been the best decision i've made the past few years - i'm saving so much money and getting a top-tier education in my field. sucks that i don't jive with my school that much (same case as yours, sporty/fratty party school with racial incidents every year), but that's gonna be inconsequential after the next few years, ha!\n\nTLDR; if you don't vibe with your school, look for ways to distance yourself physically and socially - and realize college isn't the end all of your life.",

I made a handful of friends my freshman year but sadly they transferred shortly after (can\u2019t say I blame them) and after that I never made more. I was also a commuter which made it super hard to meet people, and the people I did come across were just not my crowd. I was even the president of a club related to my major but I still didn\u2019t vibe with anybody (except for my professors who were absolutely amazing and so kind). \n\nI didn\u2019t come out of this with lifelong friends, I didn\u2019t get to party or live in a tiny dorm room or have all of the other typical \u201ccollege experiences,\u201d but I got the degree that I truly wanted and I now have the tools to help me become successful in my dream career field, and for that I find those four years of semi misery completely worth it, because I know that the years to come will be so, so much better. \n\nIf I can offer any advice: find new hobbies to do specifically outside of school. I picked up fishing which I NEVER once thought I\u2019d do, and it ended up being a super relaxing hobby for me that I could look forward to after class. Just an example and it might not be the sort of answer you hoped for, but for me hobbies became really important and I discovered a lot about myself by trying new things on my own.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps!!",

I transferred here, kinda not enjoying it so far, struggling to make any connections, all attempts get shot down or just dont work somehow. Tried joining a club for the sport i have played for 7 years just to be told to try again next semester, basically the reason I left my last school is the same here. There's nothing to do on campus except, party, go to the gym (to small for size of campus) or pool (I swear in the only person that uses the 2 pools on campus), and there's nothing to do off campus. \n\nSince it sounds like you cant transfer due to your degree, just really try to make the best of it. In my opinion, if you can still get to where you want to be after college through different majors and actually be happy socially with your school, id transfer. Im thinking of doing that, id have to switch degrees again but in the end i may be somewhere better for me socially and id still work the job i want in the future. Good Luck!",

      "text": "Yes! So much! I hate my college because the advisors are no help at all and I'm someone who needs that extra help to make sure I'm staying on track to finish my degree. I've also heard many stories from students that the advisors they talked to would put them completely off track of finishing their actual degree, and I can vouch for them because this also happened to me. The support my college gives students is non-existent and that just makes me so mad and the amount of time it takes for staff to respond to your emails is ridiculously long! I started college during covid so I haven't had the chance to go in person and make friends yet, so I don't know if I can say I feel out of place, but I definitely hate the place. I'll be transferring to a different college soon though and I'm so excited!",

              "text": "Thank you! The college I want to transfer to is so supportive already and I haven't even been accepted yet! They also require all students to meet with an academic advisor before each semester as well! Very excited to transfer to this school so fingers crossed that I get in!\n\nI hope you find your place in your college. No matter where you are in life there's always a place for you! Keep those friends you feel a genuine connection with close to you and if any of you share hobbies start doing them together, if you don't already! Meet up once a week, if possible, to enjoy that thing you love. I've been pretty lonely due to covid and the one thing that has me still going right now is being a part of a band that meets once a week and going to dnd campaigns. Even though I'm not close to any of these people and feel no strong bond to them it still makes it all worth it. I know my advice probably isn't the best, but I hope it helps!",

What I think works best for me is that I make my own fun events with the people i like. For example plan a movie day, pick up some hobbies and incorporate my friends or study with a cozy drink, it\u2019s all about the small things :D",
