  "text": "So I\u2019m a freshman at community college and finished my first semester with a 3.5 GPA. \n\nMy goal is to transfer into either one of the top public business schools in Texas (UT, A&M, Texas Tech, or UH). Having this goal in mind, my current GPA is decent but I need to raise it to be more competitive.\n\nI set a goal for myself for the rest of my time at community college to earn a 4.0 every other semester. I know it\u2019s difficult but I believe I\u2019m capable.\n\nI started off the semester strong for the first half then slacked in the middle of the sense then at the end picked it back up and did well on finals.\n\nWhat can I do to make sure I get 4.0\u2019s in the future?",

      "text": "Scan the syllabus for each class. Make sure you know what it takes to get an A. Study hard early in each class. Do as best as you possibly can. Then at the end of the course, decide what you will / won\u2019t do, once you have the grade you want. \n\nI went to a cc as well before xferring, I\u2019m also in Texas but doing something else (not business major). My cc was graded on a scale where a 90 was considered a 4.0. So, I would try really hard in the beginning / middle and do as well as I can on tests / assignments. Then usually by the end, it was a situation where I had to get like a 50 on the last test to get an A in the class. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to do well in a class grade wise, if you do really good in the beginning of it. If you don\u2019t nail that first test / assignments / project, then you have a cap hanging over your head where you gotta try twice as hard to redeem your grade. So, make sure to prioritize the first big grades in any class always over the others.",

      "text": "You'll have to study a lot to earn a 4.0. More importantly, you'll have to sustain that for every class for the duration of the semester. Rather than aim for a 4.0, I'd suggest focusing on the courses that are most important for business school. Get A's in those courses and then do the best you can in the others.",
