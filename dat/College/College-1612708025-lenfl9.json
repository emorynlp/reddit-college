  "text": "Basically I feel like I'm not getting any knowledge into my head and studying solely for the sake of improving my GPA or getting good grades. First year college student here, I know I wasn't the same in high school. In highschool I was genuinely interested in learning, for example I would actively try to apply scientific concepts learnt in school to daily life and marvel at how interesting everything was. But now I feel like am just vomitting all content I've learnt through the semester into my exams and forgetting afterwards. My profs are doing a good job at teaching too, I just feel a shift in my own mindset. This is obviously not good, I know, but are any of you experiencing similar things? If so, how do you get over it?",

You just need to expose yourself to the material you\u2019ve learned over time. Try going over your lecture notes, lecture slides (ppt), and books. And don\u2019t make this an \u201cassignment\u201d type of activity. Do it because you want to and enjoy it. \n\nBetter days are ahead of you, don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself. College is a trial and error process. Learn from your experiences\n\nOne last thing, carry yourself with a Growth Mindset.",

If you want to start your own business one day, treat class as if you are learning about how to run your own business.

For example, someone going into computer sciences may never use a good chunk of what they learn when going into an IT job.\n\nOverall, going to college and getting a degree is meant to be something that shows people \"hey, I did this.

However, if you do not apply it or think upon it regularly (or, more often, at all), then how can you expect to learn anything?\n\nCarl Rogers was quoted as to have said, \u201cThe only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn.\u201d\n\nDo not take this as an attack but as a lesson.

I know I'm not maintaining all that information ESPECIALLY not in the middle of a panoramic when a majority of the \"after college adult life\" is hitting me during college.  \n\nI survive by reminding myself that if I stop now, I lose my scholarship and 9 times outta 10 am not going to try college ever again in life.",

Sometimes it might feel like you're not learning, but you more than likely are.

High school was more fun than college in my opinion. I don\u2019t know if that has to do with us doing college during the pandemic or the times we\u2019re living in or if that\u2019s just something that also happens to a lot of other people transitioning from high school to college.\n\nWhat I feel is just tiredness. I can get all the sleep in the world and still be tired, unmotivated to do schoolwork. In the beginning of a semester, everything I learn goes in my head and out by the end. It just feels like I\u2019m using my head to store all this information and then prove its worth on exams. I totally get you.\n\nAnd there wasn\u2019t just a shift in my academic mindset. There was also a shift in just my general mindset. I became really depressed after leaving high school and starting college. This may be really common though. I don\u2019t know. As for getting over this, I just disciplined myself. Force yourself to get assignments done. You\u2019re tired? Grab a Red Bull. You\u2019re unmotivated? Think of why you\u2019re doing this. Try and trick yourself into liking doing schoolwork. You have try a bunch of different approaches to this and see what works for you.",

As someone who struggles with clinical depression, it doesn't matter what I do (therapy, antidepressants, etc.), I feel like crap if I don't take care of my sleep, diet, and exercise. Seriously:\n\n* Sleep. Go to bed and get up at the same times every day, even on weekends. Everyone requires a different amount of sleep; eight hours is just an average (I need 10). If you struggle with insomnia, the problem could be blue light. Try to stay off electronics for at least the hour before bedtime. Blue light glasses were also a lifesaver for me.\n* Diet. Eat whole foods; nothing processed; no sugar, salt, or preservatives (things like vitamin C are an obvious exception). This can be difficult as a college student, but the difference between the standard American diet and actual food is just incredible. Check out some testimonials on whole foods subreddits. Don't confuse whole foods with vegan, though. Personally, I am my best on a high-protein diet, including animal products.\n* Exercise. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, you must find a physical activity that you enjoy; otherwise, you'll constantly dread it (and what college student needs something else to dread?). I enjoy walking on a treadmill while watching or listening to YouTube. Pay attention to your activity level while you're not deliberately exercising, too. Standing up and walking around for two minutes every 20 minutes works wonders for your mood. I use the Stand Up! app for this. Another app I love is StepBet, which literally pays you for meeting your custom step goals.",

              "text": "I'm struggling with college right now. I'm in my second year and semester. I thought I would talk about it if anybody relates.\n\n**Struggle #1** is I'm not certain what major would make me happy. I love video games but I don't feel capable to make them, so I chose CS major.\n\nSince I'm not certain about my CS major, I finally asked my advisor for help about it. I will take this survey called MyPlan that will generate a list of jobs I could be interested in for me to discuss with my advisor. Then I could choose a major!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Struggle #2** is I'm not good at time management. In high school I had classes from 7am - 2pm. As long as I did homework and studied in the afternoon, I was okay. I would often cram studying and procrastinate on projects but do okay, if not feel scared for the day before the test/due date.\n\nIn college my classes aren't in a row, more book readings, I must do adult stuff sometimes like FAFSA and grocery shopping, doctor visits, homework can be bigger, I need to really study, etc.\n\nIt's hard for me to plan my time to finish everything. I'm getting better, though. It helps me to make a realistic list of goals for the day. I can learn time management/study tips by asking my advisor and tutors.  There's a lot of nice people in the college who want to help.\n\nCollege gets tiring if I have to catch up on homework on the weekend or end up with little time in the day for relaxing. Some days I feel depressed and wake up late, so there is less time in the day. My concentration can go down, so I'll take breaks by listening to music or walking outside, to regain concentration.\n\nIt can help to take short breaks every 25 minutes (Pomodoro timer app) & give little rewards after finishing goals, and a big reward once you're done with school.\n\nI'm thankful I can stay with my parents & siblings because my college is nearby, so they help by buying food, cooking, utility bills, being there for me, and having a house to stay in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Struggle #3** is making friends. I miss my good high school friends and familiar people. In college everybody's new and I don't know them. There's nice people, but it seems I haven't connected strongly to a friends maybe because of my social anxiety.\n\nI learned for anxiety, staying in a situation that makes you anxious can help you overcome your anxiety. It's like saying \"Hi Anxiety, I'm not gonna listen to you. I'm going to say Hi to that person even if I feel scared.\"\n\nIf you're anxious you can't write that essay and you're avoiding it, remember all the essays you've written before and that you *can* do it, you've done it before, and you'll do great! Plus the tutors/teacher are there to help you.\n\nOur school had board game nights where we play fun games and I was nervous, but I went there and felt safer/calmer around strangers after a bit. If I keep going there, it's like practicing where hopefully my social anxiety goes down over time.\n\nThere's some super nice people at the school. I love the librarians and tutors, and nice classmates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nCollege feels really hard. I wish it was a little easier! I wasn't sure if struggling a lot is common, but I can see I'm not alone. We can get through this together!\n\nI'm sure college will get easier for you as you gain experience. When you need help, don't be afraid to reach out to your school advisor, tutor, school counselor, etc. They really love to help. :)\n\nI like to stop by the tutoring center just to do homework and ask for help if needed, because we can just go there to do homework. I hope some of the random tips I said can help, and don't feel overwhelmed by trying too many tips at once. You can just try one tip at a time and see if it helps you or not.",
