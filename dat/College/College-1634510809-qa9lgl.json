  "text": "Im a 21 year old junior transfer from community college and I was so excited to move away from home and get into college I was working 50 hours a week in a body shop full of old dudes. Barely had any interaction with people my age and was so excited to come to college. Now that I'm here I feel even more alone than before. Around thousands of people my own age. \n\nI participate in my classes and have a job i haven't done any clubs yet but i haven't found one that interests me and lines up with my schedule. \n\nI don't know how to introduce myself to people in a way to become friends only just nice little chats before after or during class. \n\nI just want to know I'm not alone in feeling alone.",

Not like I'm really close with any of them, but it's something.\n\nJoin clubs, attend events, find like-minded people. If you're in the dorms, network and set up a hangout event. For example, someone in a dorm set up a movie watch party in the basement and invited anyone in the building.\n\nYou are bound to find socially starved people, especially after 2020's isolation.",

I also don\u2019t have a car and have to take the bus or Uber. I find it hard to fit in and I have a resting bitch face plus an aggressive tone when speaking. I\u2019m trying to work on that but sometimes it kinda hurts seeing others hang out and have fun and I\u2019m just there walking around campus alone doing nothing and staying in my room throughout my fall break and soon thanksgiving break.",

I transferred from 2nd year to 3rd year and found that a lot of my classmates already has their own friends since they started at that university since 1st year. What I did was just talk to people who sat next to me in class and after getting to know them better then ask them out for coffee/lunch. Also make study groups to study during midterms and finals. Those tend to help if you have good connections with them. Also get their social media or phone number so you can talk to them after class as well. Simply just ask class questions then gradually ask to meet up and study together. I hope this helps.",
