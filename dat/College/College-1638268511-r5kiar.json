  "text": "\ud83d\udca5 college is not like highschool.\n\n It's hard everyone has higher standards. Your expected to have your own deadlines and take responsibility. Partying every night is fun but the people who reach accidemic excellence don't party hard and expect to pass.\n\n\n\ud83d\udca5 In college there are alot of assessments.\n\nYou will literally have to organize your life around them.  Want to go to the college dance?\nNo your not you have that 50% assignment due tomorrow. The assessments seem never ending, and they are. Until one day they are all but a dream.\n\n \ud83d\udca5Find a stimulant.\n\nNow some days you might be pulling your hair out over some crazy 50 page assignment for 40% of the mark. Then it dawn's on you, that you only have a week left before the due date.  Stimulant's like coffee are your friend here.  If you have to pull all nighters to get that assignment done do it. (It's not like have a life outside of college) just remember to take quick naps, breaks and lots of snacks to keep your energy up.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 If your school has a reliable organised online portal sometimes it's okay to skip a class especially if a deadline is coming up.\n\nSkipping a class or two may be essential to both your accidemic potential or your Mental health. If you need to skip class do it. Get your classmate to write some notes for you, or check out the study guide on your universities online portal in your own time. Your health is more important than school. (Note only skip non mandatory classes!)\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Your university has learning assistants, you pay for. Use the hell out of them.\n\nYou pay for a learning assistant. You can send them work to check spelling grammar and referencing. Some can even be specific to the subject and can act as a secondary tutor.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 University is fun\n\nHave fun at university and make friends. You may have to pull all nighters studying but try and keep a balance.\n\n \ud83d\udca5 Don't panic over one bad grade.\n\nYou can always try better next time. Try again or even just celebrate your mediocre grade if it was a hard subject for you.  You are not your grades. They do not define who you are or the effort you personally put in to achieve said grade. One year I put in an exceptional amount of effort and only ended up with a C in a hard subject. It was okay though as I know I tried my best.",

          "text": "In general, it doesn't matter whether you engage in \"hookup culture\" or not-- what matters is that you have healthy relationships. \n\n[Here's an overview of what a healthy relationship looks like](https://www.ny.gov/teen-dating-violence-awareness-and-prevention/what-does-healthy-relationship-look). While they're mostly talking about \"traditional\" relationships, it actually applies much more broadly. For example, I had a friendship where my friend violated my boundaries. I thought it would be okay because we were friends and it wasn't like we were dating or anything. Obviously, I was not a very smart person and I know better now.\n\nIf you hook up with people, make sure that anyone you hook up with follows all the \"rules\" of a healthy relationship and chances are you'll be good.",

          "text": "The \"format\" (long term, one night stand, friend with benefits, etc.) of the relationship doesn't really matter. Your own maturity and the other people in the relationships are what matters.\n\nEach type of relationship is very well suited to certain people. You might pick one over the other depending on where you are in life, what you want from the relationship, and what you are able to commit to while being a student.\n\nIt's also worth noting that break ups in college can screw with mental health much more than a one night stand. I'm not saying any type of relationship is better, but your question was loaded.",
