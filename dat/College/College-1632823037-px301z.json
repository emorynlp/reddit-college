  "text": "I\u2019ll be getting out of the military soon and going to college. I\u2019ll be about 24-25 and when I toured my school I felt so old. \nI didn\u2019t have the best run in the military friend wise and I\u2019d really like to make friends in college. Yet, I don\u2019t think I can or want to live in the dorms (they have an age limit of 25). \nI\u2019ll be moving to a new state and knowing almost no one. \nI hear stories on here about people not knowing how to make friends outside of dorms. This worries me too\ud83d\ude05. \nAlso, is there older people like me that don\u2019t just go home to their families after school? \nI\u2019m trying to make friends, get my degree, maybe date, and live my life I\u2019ve felt cheated out of a bit. \nAny advice?",

But my ass is out once classes are done, if I don't need to be there then I won't. I'm just here to get my degree and get the fuck out with hopefully a good paying job.",

I'll let you know when I figure that out\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, even when I was fresh outta high-school I couldn't figure out how to make friends in college. Joining clubs and doing stuff like that would probably help but who has time for that??\nThe closest I've gotten is getting people's snapchats \"in case one of us misses a day and needs the homework!\" So you could always try that!",
