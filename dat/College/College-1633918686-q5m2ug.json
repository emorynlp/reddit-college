  "text": "I just graduated from uni in May. I took every moment of those four years for granted. I had so many friends and I was involved in so much. I never felt alone. Now, I am in a city four hours from my college town. I have next to no friends. \n\nIt\u2019s so difficult relating to people and making friendships once college is over. I was so unprepared for how hard it would be. I work full time too, so by the time I am off from work, I just want to go home and sleep. I have no social time anymore. On the weekends, I am exhausted and I take that time to do for myself if I can. \n\nIt\u2019s just so lonely and I feel like this topic is not talked about enough before uni graduation. I miss my college friends everyday. My few closest friends are still in school. I miss the atmosphere and it\u2019s just difficult.",

      "text": "I feel this. It didn't help at all that COVID took away almost two years of our college experience too. I was socially off after being isolated for a year, and even then most of my friends moved back home cuz of the pandemic and I only saw them for graduation before everyone went and did their own thing. Shit, even my long distance relationship fell apart when I moved to a new city to be with them. But at the end of the day I feel it's really part of a process, it's what you can make of it. Making friends is something you have have to actively do or it won't work. Find events and go to them by yourself. I do the whole 9-5 thing too but everyweek after work I have something going on. I go to events, attend piano class, try a new restaurant, go to local concerts. I've made quite a few friends from those things.",

      "text": "This is why it was so easy for me to come back to college after a decade of terrible jobs. College is an absolute breeze. The real world is not. \n\nIt's crazy how much this feeling you're referencing parallels freshman coming from high school. There's so many posts on here about the loneliness of starting college.\n\nThe thing is, it'll get better and chill out. I really don't have friends either and never did through work. I've got some that I see every so many months because they live in my hometown 300 miles away. \n\nJust hang in there. It'll improve. Life is pretty strange. I still say 6 months to settle in and 12 months to feel like home. It's been about that for every place I've ever lived and I've lived quite a few places over the years.",
