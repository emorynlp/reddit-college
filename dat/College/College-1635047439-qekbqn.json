  "text": "some dining hall worker climbed up my ass earlier bc i was taking fruit out, something i do ALL the fucking time and ain't nobody having a problem with it until now. \n\nthey throw out all the food at the end of the day, so why not let students take it with them as a snack for later? less food wasted how's that a problem?",

      "text": "Because it's a university. One step short of a budget airline. Nothing is free.\n\nI always just brought a backpack and 1-gallon bags inside of that. I would make several trips to the food stations and bring back a few items to put in them each time. The trick is to figure out when the workers have their daily meeting and start bagging on the other side when they are all huddled up.",

      "text": "University dining halls are normally all-you-can-eat. However, this only makes sense as a business model when you're limiting patrons to all they can *personally* eat.\n\nOnce you allow people to take food from the dining hall, you're opening the door to them feeding others or using a single meal to cover multiple meals (in cases where the dining hall limits the number of meals a student can have).",
