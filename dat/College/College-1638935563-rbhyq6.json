  "text": "I'm in high school as a sophomore. I have no recollection of ever making a college board account, but it says I have. \"You already have a College Board account.\" I don't remember any of the information (password, user, email, security question, etc.).\n\nI tried making a new account with numerous different emails, but it still says I already have a College Board account. I don't think contacting College Board for \"forget password/email\" would work considering they'd just ask me the security question or something. I need to get in to get into AP classes. Help?",
