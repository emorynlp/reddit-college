  "text": "Woke up at 12 pm this morning (well... noon) and came to the realization that going to classes was my only motivation to get up in the morning this past month.\n\nFirst year in college, currently studying in cinema communication and it's almost the 7th week of the semester.\nAssignments are pilling up and because of that I rarely get to do any of the hobbies I used to enjoy.\n7th week and still no meaningful friendship , still don't get invited to go out, still read mangas alone to pass the time in between classes.\nI noticed it's harder and harder for me to get up on time which is kinda concerning because it miiiiiight be the start of a depression.\nAnd if I don't pass this semester I don't think I'll have enough motivation to retake my classes.\n\nMaybe I should talk to a guidance counselor \n\nMaybe I'm not fit for college \n\nKinda sad rn",

          "text": "Hey bro, definitely reach out to your schools mental health counselor people, or even the national suicide helpline. Or your family if you have a good relationship with them.\n\nThe way I think of it, suicidal thoughts are the way that the human body tells us that our current lifestyle isn't working, and that we need to take risks. Because if the alternative is death, lots of stuff isn't so scary anymore. Death is permanent. Before you go, at least do some scary/brave/stupid/cool things. Go to hot girls and ask them for their numbers and dont give a fuck, because your practically dead and their reactions and the people who watch don't matter. Lift some weights, don't give a fuck if anyone looks at you or judges you, besides gym bros are usually super helpful and really nice. Heck, maybe even try reading the bible and see if that makes you feel a little better.\n\nJust remember, in life, for everyone, there are good times and there are bad times, and suicide is the biggest commit anyone can possibly make in their entire lives, so it's usually a good idea to procrastinate the decision.\n\nI don't know if this makes much sense, but I felt I had to comment something instead of just scrolling by. Hope this helps.\nAlso feel free to message me.",
