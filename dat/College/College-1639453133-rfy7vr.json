  "text": "College feels so overwhelming, and it feels even worse now; I have withdrawn from two classes now and didn\u2019t take any courses in the fall term; however, I plan on taking some spring term. I always have a surge of motivation in the first month, then start dropping off in terms of ambition and determination to get things done. I feel like such a disappointment considering I'm wasting my parent\u2019s money.\n\nI'm behind by six classes when I'm supposed to finish in 1 year and a half to transfer to god knows what school. I feel so awful about everything in general; I have always considered myself an alright student, Procrastinated quite a bit, and ended with a 3.4 GPA in high school. I didn\u2019t even realize college/ university was right after high school, I didn\u2019t find out about any of this until my senior year, and I am aware of all the mistakes I have made.\n\nI even dreamed a little about getting into a prestigious school once I found about them until I found out I definitely wouldn\u2019t get in any. I went into community college to take some colleges and transfer and attempt to redeem myself, but I have already messed that up; I already have an average of a 3.0 GPA. I feel like such a failure, and I feel very sorry for my parents; I'm sorry",

      "text": "You\u2019re not a failure, you\u2019re just struggling with growing up. Just because it\u2019s harder for you, doesn\u2019t make you a failure.\n\nHave you considered talking to someone? Specifically, have you ever been tested for ADHD? A lot of smart people can compensate in high school, so their ADHD doesn\u2019t really impact them until college. \n\nSince you never really studied and procrastinated in high school, you never developed much discipline. That\u2019s why you flame out a month into the semester.\n\nStart building healthy habits, and sticking to them. Start with easy stuff like making your bed, cooking, exercising, being on-time to everything, etc.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve sorted that out, you\u2019ll feel like you have superpowers. Community college is a great place to learn those skills, even if it can feel like a failure destination. It\u2019s not. Everyone is there for different reasons, you\u2019re there to learn how to be a grown up version of you so you can make the most out of university.",

      "text": "I feel you bro, I\u2019m in a similar situation to you right now. Transferred from a local university to the college I\u2019m in right now, and have been struggling to find motivation. My situation is slightly different, in that, I never struggled much with motivation at my local college, and did great in all my classes there, and have only begun to struggle now. My best advice to you - find a place to transfer to that you really love and idealize the hell out of it. Make yourself think all your problems will be solved and you\u2019ll have the life you always wanted once you get to that school. It\u2019s what I did, and while I was pretty disappointed once I got to the new school partially because of that, it sure as hell motivated me while I was at my local Uni. Some people may reply to this saying that it\u2019s bad advice, and that may be right to an extent, but it\u2019s what worked for me when I was in your situation, and it\u2019s the best advice I can give.",
