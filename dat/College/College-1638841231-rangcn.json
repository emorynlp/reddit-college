  "text": "To all my students who have a wife, three children, a full time job and 12 credit hours online, how much time do you actually spend a day before/after work with school? It's been a decade since I have been in school and I start on January 12th. I feel like it's very possible for me to graduate college but it seems like an insane feat to even think I could make it through school and do well enough to actually get into med school afterwards. (Only online for first two years)",

      "text": "Even with a little help, I\u2019ve had to lower my expectations. I don\u2019t get time at home, I make time at school. Record lectures and study for other classes during class then relisten to the lecture later when I can. It\u2019s essentially a game of keep-up the entire semester. Getting A\u2019s on everything but the midterms. I graduate next semester and currently have a 3.3 GPA. Not Med school material but hopefully grad school. You can do this, but be kind to yourself and reasonable about what your limits are.",
