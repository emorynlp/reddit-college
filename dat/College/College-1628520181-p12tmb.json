  "title:": "Classes that are nothing but textbook reading are BS",
  "text": "I was in all online classes for this past summer semester, and 2 out of 5 of my classes were nothing but textbook reading, exams on the reading, and half-assed discussion boards that the professors did not participate in. To top it off, the reading in both classes was far from engaging. The professors of the classes never reached out, emailed, or made any attempt to connect with the students. I just find this method of \"teaching\" really lazy and I like to feel engaged when I'm learning something. I understand that Covid puts a monkey wrench in everything, but 3 out of 5 of my teachers made themselves available via weekly Zoom meetings - just that little amount of effort made a huge difference in how i both regarded and performed in the classes. \n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong, but I find this method of not teaching but essentially monitoring a class not only lazy but especially not worth the thousands of dollars I'm putting in to my schooling.",

      "text": "I agree with you. Last year in 2020 summer term, my college offered calculus which is worth 4 credits. As a student who is taking STEM for his future studies, I willingly took it. Notice here that I was very willing to learn. However, it was the first term for my college to organize an online based program, and they ridiculously only had inquiry sessions and no teaching sessions, meaning there are only Q&A meetings with the professor on zoom and they are not supposed to teach us! Our Biology and Human Geography professor noticed the terrible idea, so he taught us during the inquiry sessions anyways, like explaining the chapter and stuff which was helpful. However, we were stuck with the math professor who we only met in inquiry sessions and taught us almost nothing. He would talk about weather and COVID in his country and then sign off. We had to do our homeworks which was really tough with no explanations, experience and being taught nothing! All we had was YouTube links that he provided. We complained the school, and that made him upload more videos and find more sources only. Overall, though I do not wish to blame the professor, I feel like the effort was very poor. I dropped math and left it behind. I'll only take it when I tranfer to the US again.",

      "text": "Trust me, most professors also hate this style of teaching. But we have to do it because higher education is at a stage of self-destructive competition. If I'm to offer a summer class, one with face to face format will struggle to fill, and one that's online asynchronous will fill immediately. And at the university level, if my university doesn't offer online classes, then the students will simply enroll at other places. **In this sense, online classes are actually destroying higher education.**\n\nOn the other hand, it isn't really a case of professors being lazy. The half-assed discussions you mentioned? Those are the result of semester after semester of us trying to facilitate discussions to no avail. At some point, we gave up trying to make online asynchronous classes entertaining.",

My professor started with recorded lectures (about 45 minutes at most), which lasted the first two weeks (of an 8 week class). There was essentially no engagement after that, no feedback on discussion posts/journal entries, and what pissed me off most is absolutely no feedback on the research topic proposal and paper outline she required, she graded them after I turned in my final paper. I felt like I was in the dark the entire semester. She had two required textbooks on the syllabus, and neither were used at any point in the semester. It was extremely frustrating and I'm glad it was my final course so I don't have to do an online course through my school ever again.",

If I'm teaching the same class in the fall that I just taught in the spring, there are very few text changes in the materials I post. The material is the same (I teach math so the material doesn't change), the assignments are the same but the dates change. What does change is the students. I spent the majority of my time with the students going through material, answering questions, helping them prep for unit tests and grading assignments. This takes a large amount of time. In fact, I typically met with students 7 days a week over the summer.\n\nIf you've never taught a class or setup materials for a class or completely designed an entire college course, you really shouldn't spout off about how easy something is or how nobody is doing anything for their job. \n\nA lot of teachers don't pay as much attention to what they post as they should because we know many of our students don't read what we post. If I had a dollar for every time I received a question from a student when the answer was posted on the syllabus and was posted on the LMS and was talked about in class, I'd have retired by now.\n\nEdit: As to another point in this sub...your in person teachers did expect you to read too. We always want you to do the reading!",

It was an introductory level course in terms of the depth we went into but the exams were entirely based on our powerpoint + commentary lectures. The professor recommended a textbook if we wanted to learn more about the field but she also made it very clear that if we used any information outside of our lectures in the online writing prompts, we would be getting a zero for the points that question was worth.",

When I had in-person classes before the pandemic, never once did the professor expect us to read the text book and then do nothing during class time. Class time was used for discussion or lecture regarding the reading. So what bothers me is that now these classes are reduced to nothing more than reading and testing. You're entitled to your opinion, and I'm entitled to give those professors honest feedback on their course evaluations about what i didn't like about their performance, or lack there-of",

              "text": "When you had classes before the pandemic, they were in person, lecture based classes. Now they were probably asynchronous, online classes. Those are different modalities. Asynchronous classes have no meeting or discussion times and are often what online students are looking for. That gives them the most flexibility if they have variable schedules. It sounds like you were looking for a synchronous online class. Those are online classes with regular meeting times. Your school may not have offered those. There are a lot of technological issues with running those depending on the type of school you're at. \n\nI always appreciate feedback that will help improve my courses, but the feedback needs to be consistent with the type of class I was teaching, not the kind of class you wanted me to teach. That kind of feedback should go to the administrators of the school because often they are the ones that decide what the school offers. Your teacher may not even like the modality they were teaching with but was required to do it by the school. \n\nIt's good to remember that the pandemic affected teachers as well. Some are doing their best online with little preperation or support from their schools and are just as frustrated as students. Like students, teachers that had never previously been online were forced to do it online by the pandemic.",
