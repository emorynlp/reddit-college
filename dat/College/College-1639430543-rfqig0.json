  "text": "I am a senior in Industrial Engineering and will graduate in May 2022. I still don\u2019t know what I want to do despite applying to a bunch of jobs catered to IE\u2019s. I haven\u2019t found a burning passion for anything in specific and I am worried for myself. Any advice and comments people want to give me?",

      "text": "My best advice is that you don't have to be passionate to be a great engineer. You could be working for your dream company, whether it be NASA or Tesla or Exxon or whoever. Your work will be relatively similar, and involve lots of meetings and paperwork. You'll probably be making incremental changes to an existing design/system.\n\nI don't mean to be a bummer, but rather that to show you that passion isn't a necessary or even common thing in the engineering world. So go with for a company you've heard good things about, make sure you like your boss and coworkers, and if nothing else, maybe 5 years will give you a little clearer picture.",
