  "text": "Hey Y\u2019all, I started college in 2020 and now I\u2019m a Sophomore and I\u2019ve never had an in person class. Everyone I knew from higschool has literally just vanished into thin air. I tried bumble BFF and that has literally been a train wreck. I really don\u2019t know how to make friends at this point because I feel like growing up we only made them through school. I don\u2019t go to clubs as that isn\u2019t my scene, I\u2019m really a homebody but maybe that\u2019s just because I don\u2019t really have friends to go out with. I\u2019d love to go to Great America or the Mall or the movies or just sit at home and talk about life\u2019s problems. I go to Cal State East Bay, wondering if anybody that goes there or goes to school in the Bay Area would wanna be friends",
