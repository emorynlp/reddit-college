  "text": "Title. My wife and I each made about 24,000$ in 2020. Usually we always get pell grants, this isn\u2019t even the first time we filed independently , how does 2 students and 48,000 combined income mean 0 aid? Does it sound like I did something wrong? I just dont understand when I had comparable income before and filed independent and received a much better award.",
