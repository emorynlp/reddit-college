  "text": "Hiya! I am currently a freshman at a college in Pennsylvania. However, I am not emotionally tied to it at all nor have I made many friends because I am a commuter (and introvert). I just picked my current college because it accepted my dual enrollment credits easily.\n\nWith that being said, I am thinking about transferring and also living on campus come either the spring 2022 semester or the fall 2022 semester. I have a small cat and she is absolutely my favorite thing in the world. She helps so much with my mental health and I refuse to go anywhere without her. \n\nI need some suggestions for cat friendly colleges. I know there are some out there. Location wise, I prefer the north eastern region of the United States. My major is English and my high school weighted gpa was 3.65. \n\nAny help is appreciated! \n\ntl;dr Looking for cat friendly colleges!!",

Many schools don\u2019t have housing for transfers any way so it won\u2019t be that difficult. \n\nAs far as living in housing at your current school, you\u2019d have to check their housing policies regarding animals.",

              "text": "In my college (and a few I looked at before committing), you had to \u201capply\u201d to have an ESA. For my school, they had a form that your therapist/mental health practitioner fills out and one that you fill out explaining why you need one. \n\nHowever, in most cases (if not all), you need to have a documented disability, meaning you hold an official diagnosis given by a qualified professional. It\u2019s technically considered a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d by the ADA, so if you can prove you are disabled and the animal won\u2019t hurt people you\u2019re likely to be approved.\n\nIf you think you might have a disability in the form of mental illness, I\u2019d recommend talking to you GP for a referral, and mention your financial concerns as well therapists take different insurances and some do sliding scale (price based on your financial situation/needs) as well.",
