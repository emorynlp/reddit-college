  "text": "I think I have to abandon my physics major but I don\u2019t know what to do\n\nCurrently a sophomore pursuing a BS in physics but will end with a cumulative 2.1 gpa at the end of this sem. I\u2019ve struggled with a lot of mental health issues over the past 1.5 years and also bad study habits.\n\nPhysics has been such a big part of my life and I wanted to pursue a masters in it. But sadly my spark of motivation came too late. I didn\u2019t realize  that there was almost no way I\u2019d manage to be a competitive applicant to grad schools. So now I\u2019m left here feeling more hopeless than ever because I don\u2019t know what I want to do. I feel so reluctant to invest effort into anything else. Would I even be able to transfer into a different major? I just recently disassociated from my group of friends here so transferring to a different school would be easier to handle but could I even get accepted anywhere? \n\nIm going to try and set something up with the transitional advisors but finals are going to be time consuming. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why but I just feel like I\u2019ve failed in life and that there are no opportunities to bounce back. I know that there\u2019s a way somehow but at the same time I\u2019m hopeless. \n\nIf you guys have any advice or stories to share, please let me know!",

      "text": "You don\u2019t list any other interests or what majors you\u2019d change to. It sounds like maybe you shouldn\u2019t change. \n\nNext, you\u2019ll find a large majority of schools have a minimum GPA, and then if you meet that, you go to the school. \n\nGrad school may not be as intimidating as you think. But also, it\u2019s whatever. You Get to do whatever you want. If you have a larger program, you\u2019ll probably be able to go to grad school there, as long as you meet requirements. You have a long time left to meet requirements. \n\nGet through finals. Meet with your own physics adviser, and then call and make an appointment for mental healthcare. It should be free at your school. \n\nConsider taking a lighter course load next semester. Take time to heal. \n\nThen decide what you want.\n\nYou\u2019ll honestly find this story in many, many, many STEM sophomores. This happens, and it\u2019s okay. I got a 36% on my first biochemistry exam. I graduated high school at 16, and was considered a genius. We literally all do it to some degree. \n\nGo to professors, advisers, tutors, TA\u2019s, SI\u2019s, and therapy.",

      "text": "Someday this will seem like a blip. I know it seems huge and all-consuming now, especially with finals looming, but this is not your life. It is just a moment in time, a temporary situation.\n\nDefinitely talk to the advisors, but also take steps to address your mental health. Try to get regular sleep (I\u2019m guessing your sleep habits are not great at the moment) and take regular walks outside. Breaking up with your friends is not great timing, either, because we all need connection for our mental health, too. So I encourage you to reach out to a mental health counselor and make time for family and friends, even if they are far away and it is over the phone.\n\nThey may help you get perspective. Speaking as someone much older than you, I can say that my big failures in college were not even close to my biggest failures in life, lol. (It may be a strange way to cheer you up, but i assure you your biggest F-ups are probably still to come.) Anyway, when I hit those bigger failures, it was actually easier, because I knew I had stared down failure in the face before and survived. Not just survived, but went on to experience great successes, too!\n\nYou will survive this setback. It might not be easy to get from here to a place of success, but you can do hard things. Believe in yourself. You got this. It might feel like suck for awhile, but keep marching and it will get better. It will get more than better. It will even be great.\n\nAs far as your major goes, many people say at some schools in some majors, the first years are full of grueling weed-out courses and then get better. Could that be true for you?\n\nWhat attracted you to the subject in the first place? What changed or was different than you thought? Is there another major that more closely lines up with what you were expecting/seeking? Or have your interests changed? It is super common to explore new areas and switch majors in college \u2014 that\u2019s part of the purpose of college \u2014 to help you figure out what you REALLY want to do.\n\nGive those questions some thought. Think of it as an adventure you are taking to determine what would make you most fulfilled and give you purpose. Maybe it will reaffirm the path you are already on; maybe it will take you in a new direction. Either way, try to think of this less as a failure or hopeless situation and more as an opportunity to gain clarity and understand yourself better to guide you into a hope-filled future. Much better to figure that out now than after two decades in a career that\u2019s a bad fit and steals your joy.",
