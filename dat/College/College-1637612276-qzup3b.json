  "title:": "Snowballed to a 1.2GPA over the course of 2 semesters due to collapsing mental health and multiple incidents that shot me down just as I was starting to do better, and feel like I won't make it to Christmas at this rate",
  "text": " Hey all. I go to SHU and when I got in, I was doing super well. I had graduated HS in June of 2020, had a lot of hope going forward. First semester went mediocre, I had to withdraw from two classes. Second semester going forward to now(1st semester of my sophomore year has been a constant fight uphill and every time I've started to feel better, I get slammed back down to a new low point sometimes from my own mistakes, sometimes from other's refusal to accept that I was a broken kid with destroyed mental health and not understanding that I needed time to heal. Early Summer 2021 I had a severe crisis at home that ended with me in the hospital, and my parents using the \"recommended\" aftercare(4 hours a day for over a month or more) as collateral against me, instead of trying to understand how horribly down I was, and leading into mid September I started to slip on homework which led to another un-needed crisis at home. The only thing I have is good exam grades, and near perfect attendance(only 1 missed class the entire semester). Ever since then I've had to keep a fa\u00e7ade of optimism despite the fact that I feel like I'm rotting inside, and I have gotten nothing done and less than a week until Thanksgiving break I have nothing done, and considering Thanksgiving/Christmas breaks formed some of my best memories, it might just break me forever. I already feel so dead from the mountainous and horrible academic situation I've put myself in and I feel like I've cornered myself in a way where either flunking out or death are the only two options. I can't tank the berating tones,  \nfalse equivalencies, and passive aggressive remarks about my failures that I'm likely to hear If I can't pull off a miracle by Finals. If any SHU alumni or current students, even staff have any advice, I'd love to hear it.",

      "text": "First: Lots of us have been where you are and suicide is __NOT__ the answer.\n\nBig picture: What happens in the next few weeks is not critically important, (though I know it *feels* that way right now).\n\nTHE most important thing is for you to receive proper counseling that works for you. It sounds like that would not include taking any classes in the spring, but I am not a mental health professional.\n\nIn summary: Schedule an appointment with a mental health professional ASAP. Take the rest of the semester hour-by-hour. Best of luck to you. The fact that you posted this is testament that you know you need help. Now go get it so you can get to that inner you that will make the world a better place.",

The only thing that gets me up in the morning is class. I've always enjoyed classes more than anything else in my education but it becomes a crutch when I have nothing else to hold me up",

So glad you have something constructive that does that for you! \n\nDo you have any interest(s) that involve hands-on work? I\u2019m just wondering if taking classes in jewelry-making, welding, stained glass, etc. next semester might help provide \u201cstructure\u201d without the dread-inducing homework/assignments associated with credit courses. \n\n(Just thinking about it, this would have helped me).\n\nAlso, when you say you have reached out, do you have an appointment scheduled?",
