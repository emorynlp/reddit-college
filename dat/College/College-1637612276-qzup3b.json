  "title:": "Snowballed to a 1.2GPA over the course of 2 semesters due to collapsing mental health and multiple incidents that shot me down just as I was starting to do better, and feel like I won't make it to Christmas at this rate",
  "text": " Hey all. I go to SHU and when I got in, I was doing super well. I had graduated HS in June of 2020, had a lot of hope going forward. First semester went mediocre, I had to withdraw from two classes. Second semester going forward to now(1st semester of my sophomore year has been a constant fight uphill and every time I've started to feel better, I get slammed back down to a new low point sometimes from my own mistakes, sometimes from other's refusal to accept that I was a broken kid with destroyed mental health and not understanding that I needed time to heal. Early Summer 2021 I had a severe crisis at home that ended with me in the hospital, and my parents using the \"recommended\" aftercare(4 hours a day for over a month or more) as collateral against me, instead of trying to understand how horribly down I was, and leading into mid September I started to slip on homework which led to another un-needed crisis at home. The only thing I have is good exam grades, and near perfect attendance(only 1 missed class the entire semester). Ever since then I've had to keep a fa\u00e7ade of optimism despite the fact that I feel like I'm rotting inside, and I have gotten nothing done and less than a week until Thanksgiving break I have nothing done, and considering Thanksgiving/Christmas breaks formed some of my best memories, it might just break me forever. I already feel so dead from the mountainous and horrible academic situation I've put myself in and I feel like I've cornered myself in a way where either flunking out or death are the only two options. I can't tank the berating tones,  \nfalse equivalencies, and passive aggressive remarks about my failures that I'm likely to hear If I can't pull off a miracle by Finals. If any SHU alumni or current students, even staff have any advice, I'd love to hear it.",

      "text": "First: Lots of us have been where you are and suicide is __NOT__ the answer.\n\nBig picture: What happens in the next few weeks is not critically important, (though I know it *feels* that way right now).\n\nTHE most important thing is for you to receive proper counseling that works for you. It sounds like that would not include taking any classes in the spring, but I am not a mental health professional.\n\nIn summary: Schedule an appointment with a mental health professional ASAP. Take the rest of the semester hour-by-hour. Best of luck to you. The fact that you posted this is testament that you know you need help. Now go get it so you can get to that inner you that will make the world a better place.",

The only thing that gets me up in the morning is class. I've always enjoyed classes more than anything else in my education but it becomes a crutch when I have nothing else to hold me up",

So glad you have something constructive that does that for you! \n\nDo you have any interest(s) that involve hands-on work? I\u2019m just wondering if taking classes in jewelry-making, welding, stained glass, etc. next semester might help provide \u201cstructure\u201d without the dread-inducing homework/assignments associated with credit courses. \n\n(Just thinking about it, this would have helped me).\n\nAlso, when you say you have reached out, do you have an appointment scheduled?",

      "text": "I know it\u2019s incredibly hard to see past the next big event like finals (believe me, I get it) so please keep in mind that this will pass. No matter what happens during finals, life goes on. You get a new set of classes next semester, and some time to prepare for them over break. \n\nSo this semester wasn\u2019t your semester. The reality is, it does not define you in the long run even though it feels like it because it\u2019s the most recent challenge you\u2019ve gone through. The things people say about you or your failures do not define you either, do not let them get to you. Failing is a part of life, and if people are being hard on you for failing it is because they are scared of failure themselves. Don\u2019t be afraid of it, embrace it. Plenty of professionals in every field have failed tests, classes, semesters, years\u2026 they learned from it and it helped them get to where they are today. It\u2019s great that you love school and classes, just make sure you are also prioritizing your healing process as much if not more than your academics. A healthy mind is much more equipped to face challenges than an unhealthy one. \n\nSomeone already said suicide is not the answer, but personally I have heard that phrase so many times it feels empty. So let me put it this way; you living your life is worth so much more than any failure(s) you encounter. Our society puts so much pressure on grades, degrees, and getting to the \u201ctop\u201d that we fail to find happiness within ourselves without success. If you are considering death as a viable option for dealing with school, reevaluate where you are pulling your self worth from. Your worth is not derived only from your performance. You are not only worth your successes, and your failures do not take away from it. \n\nAlso, cut yourself some slack. You\u2019re a CS major, which to my knowledge is by far one of the most rigorous and challenging majors. The fact that you have good exam scores, attendance, and even a job related to the field is fantastic, so don\u2019t sell yourself short. Those are all wins! Especially considering your summer-fall 2021 timeline. \n\nApologies for how lengthy this is, but I hope my message got across. My heart goes out to you, and I am confident that you are strong enough to finish this semester and be here when the next one starts. <3",
