      "text": "I...honestly don't know. But maybe that's because I picked my major (CS) mainly due to my interest in programming. Also helps that I simply enjoy learning, even outside my field. For a time, I was even considering a minor in gender studies simply because I found it interesting.\n\n(If I had the time and money, I would 100% love to minor in like a dozen different things. No responsibilities other than 1 or 2 classes a semester for a stress free experience...that would be a dream)\n\nSo I think for some people, they just aren't really passionate about the field. Instead, they are only interested in the money or status that the field brings. It's what they value most, and so they look down on people who don't value it as much as they do.\n\n(And they see the fields they don't value as easy or low quality)\n\nAlthough, I also think a large part of it is ignorance. They don't know anything about the major, only what people say about it and their own assumptions, and base their entire opinions on it. For example, they may hear gender studies and think \"crazy feminists that use tumblr, whining about made up injustices.\"\n\n(Which, for the record, it definitely isn't. My Intro to Womens Studies was taught be a black woman born in Kenya who regularly visits family there. Her knowledge and experiences made for an amazing class that challenged me more than any of my CS classes have)\n\n\ntl;dr - Different values and/or ignorance.",

The problem isn't the degree it's people who don't know how to make money from their degree. \n\nFor example John Mulaney has this bit where he shits on his English degree because he says he didn't learn anything and all he got was a student debt. Some people use his bit as proof that having an English degree is useless (I know its a joke). In the joke he says he doesn't remember learning anything from his degree, and in the same joke he said he spent a lot of his time in university drinking, getting high, and eating pizza. Obviously if you spend your entire time in university getting high and drunk you wont be able to gain much from your degree. Plus I refuse to believe that he wasn't able to use anything he learned from his degree as a writer in SNL",

After an introductory photography course I wish I had the time to continue my hobby and take more, as there is so much depth and practice to be understood. It seems you can only master photography after intense study and practice, just like any stem major. Anyone who attempts to devalue anyone else's studies is an asshat. I would very much enjoy sitting in on a critique containing the photographic work of whoever you spoke with.\n\nStem majors are incredibly competitive, and its not good. The whole idea of engineering is to work as a team, but when grades are curved and whatnot, now everybody has the tendency to work against each other. That's what this guy does, and it's the worst outcome.",

This includes me, as I have seen some friends who were humanities majors resort to working at fast food restaurants, Starbucks, or manual labor after they graduate and then turn to drugs and alcohol without ever really using the degree they spent so much time on. Hey, it's their life, who am I to judge? Of course, this isn't the case for everyone, but that kind of history would explain why someone would be biased or spiteful. This doesn't justify harassment, though.\n\nI personally enjoy humanities classes, as they are both interesting to me and easier than my other classes. The volume and complexity of the content were but a fraction of what I could expect out of my physics or chem classes.\n\nOn a different note, being able to communicate with others is a crucial skill in any field, and being able to do so in another language is even better. It could be the case that those kinds of skills that you would get from humanities classes(except maybe film, art, or music) aren't as tangible as the benefits of knowing how to slap together algorithms in MatLab or websites in C++ or something, but that might be more about the job market than anything else.",

      "text": "This is what I've encountered in the context of applying for jobs. So many companies these days require you to have education or experience or both. The majority however are starting to focus more on the experience aspect. In all honesty, a degree is personalized to what you enjoy learning and yes, indeed, there are many people who are so competitive about what degree they got. Occasionally, they might be jealous that you actually got to study what you enjoy whereas they might have been forced but that is just a mere assumption. Further, there are also those who don't support what degree you got and if it's not medical, STEM, or law and on occasion business then they just love to put you down. Now this is my take, the fact that you were able to go to school and study what you want is a blessing on its own terms. Another blessing, is that you are/were motivated enough to compete your higher education and that is a huge milestone. Now it's up to you to be successful and hardworking whether you put your degree to use or do your own thing. I have friends who graduated high school and instead of going to college went straight into either trades, sales, or even built their own small business and they are making 10X what that Engineer crushing on your goals is making. Keep up what you are doing and always expand on your goals and you will easily learn how not to care about people, like the one you encountered. Can a lawyer compare himself to a doctor in terms of education; of course not. Therefore, can an engineer compare himself to a photographer, of course not. He might excel in your education and you might in his but you two are varying individuals that will find success and difficulties in each field. If someone can put down another person when they are bettering themselves, that just shows their true character and lack of esteem. Focus on yourself, be kind, and succeed.",

Bio/chem/biochem majors can work just as hard as engineering & CS majors but still end up having to fight grad students for near-minimum-wage lab assistant jobs.

Working from home is a common option now as well.\n\nFor every 1 person you see in a clinic, there are 4-5 behind the scenes in support roles.

The humanities and social service majors are by majority filled with women. It\u2019s a huge array of factors which contribute to this, but part of it is how we have been socialized. (definitely, there is an aspect of just naturally being better at one subject than another). Anyway, social service jobs like social work  and teaching are extremely important and make society run, yet they are underpaid and not considered \u201csmart\u201d or given very much credit.\n\nI will give credit where credit is due that stem majors are definitely difficult. No doubt about that. But I believe the overall attitudes which I observe of math and science majors putting down humanities majors stems from misogyny. The work women do just simply isn\u2019t valued as much by society, even if the work is just as hard in other ways and just as necessary. Since women dominate the humanities field, the field as a whole is criticized.",

It\u2019s like the difference between multivariable calc and simple multiplication tables \u2014 not really the same thing at all.\n\nWhen I practiced law, I was surprised to see how often educated business people turned to lawyers to help them write something clearly and precisely. Because of their training, lawyers are often good writers and good writing is harder than it looks. Many people who passed all their English and writing courses are happy to pay lawyers to write for them as much as they pay for actual legal advice.\n\nI am guessing it is like that with photography. I love my camera and occasionally get a good shot, but cannot achieve anything like the consistently good work produced by professional photographers or the creative accomplishments of artists. \n\nAlmost anyone can kick a soccer ball, but few can play on a World Cup team. Anyone can take a picture, but few can take professional quality photos. \n\nBut I suspect that as long as society tends to pay people with excellent STEM skills more on average than people with excellent writing, photography, etc. skills, the bias will persist.",

People insecure about their own strengths and weaknesses find any reason to turn their nose up at others. That goes for basically anything.\n\nFor whatever it's worth, my roommates for three years were a biology major and an international relations major. I would go insane doing the amount of lab classes the bio major roommate did, or doing half the amount of reading the IR major roommate did. Likewise, they'd go insane dealing with code all day or staring at linguistics datasets for hours on end. I also have no artistic talents whatsoever and could never hack it in anything beyond an intro arts class. Different majors have different hurdles, and what's difficult for one person may come naturally to another.\n\nAlso for whatever it's worth, my first mentor at my software engineering job was...wait for it...an English major. My second was a German major. Most of my coworkers have STEM degrees, but I'm aware of a philosophy major and a history major as well. I'm sure there are other non-STEM coworkers who just haven't mentioned it. Turns out that in a lot of jobs, even some STEM jobs, the key is critical thinking skills and knowing how to learn, as opposed to the degree you got.",

I studied physics and math, and I found my classes (as an undergrad) relatively easy because I picked subjects that I was strong in and passionate about, but I wouldn't last ten minutes in an art class and would drown in the readings required for something like upper-level political science or sociology classes. \n\nSomeone who tries to belittle your field of study by telling you they could do it in a heartbeat is probably just a very sad, insecure person who is in need of (but not necessarily deserving of) a hug.",
