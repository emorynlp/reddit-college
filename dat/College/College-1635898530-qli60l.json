  "text": "My genetics professor recently had given us a take-home exam. We were allowed to use notes and the textbook but weren't allowed to work with other people, which I did. Today in class she stated, \"I will be referring some people to the honor council.\" From what I gathered from the vague words of the TA's friend, whoever she was referring to sounds like it was the group I was doing it with. I am a Junior, how badly will this impact my future educational career?",

Getting a zero in the class\n3.) Getting suspended\n\nIf this is the first time you've been reported, then it is unlike that you will be suspended. You are almost certainly going to get a zero on the exam, though. Whether or not you fail the class entirely is up to the professor.",
