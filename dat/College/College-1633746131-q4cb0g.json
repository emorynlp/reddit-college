  "title:": "Should I tell professor why I'm withdrawing if I'm in another course with them",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI was misinformed about a specific course(my fault for not doing more research) and thought there was less work than there really was. I'm a full time student as well as have a job, and I'm probably the most stressed out that I've ever been, as I have other very difficult courses that I need to take for this fall semester. I'm not doing well in this course, and it's the only one that I have the ability to take again in the spring, which is why I want to withdraw. The issue is that I have another course with this professor this semester, and I'll feel very awkward seeing him after having dropped his other course. I know that professors don't usually care about student's personal issues(don't blame them for it), but should I explain since I'm going to see him in this other course? Thanks for any help guys.",
