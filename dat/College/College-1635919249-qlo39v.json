  "text": "So I'm writing an essay and occasionally I'll mention things that don't matter a whole lot to my overall message. For instance, I'll be embedding a quote of a dictionary definition for a term (so like, \"On Merriam Webster, the definition of xxx is \\*quote w/ quotation marks\\*). \n\nDo I still need to include that in my works cited? I don't want to get accused of plagiarism. Thanks!",
