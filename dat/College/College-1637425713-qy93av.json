  "title:": "Am I weird for not liking to go out?",
  "text": "\nI\u2019m a VERY social person. I keep a huge social circle, probably around 40-60 friends at school and 40-60 friends at home, all like actual friends as well. Like we text, call, hang out etc. however, I loathe going out on weekends. I get FOMO when all of my friends go but I would rather stay home, do homework and feel the FOMO than actually go. I love talking to new people, but the frat/bar scene is not up my alley at all. Is that strange because I\u2019m such an extrovert? I feel like I\u2019m wasting my youth and college years sitting in my dorm instead of going out, but every time I go out I just get anxious and want to leave early. I like drinking with my friends and people I know, but being surrounded by drunk strangers gives me anxiety. Is there a reason for this? Is this normal? Sorry this was so long I\u2019m just confused by myself sometimes. Thanks a lot for any responses and advice I get. I just feel awkward always declining invites and staying home alone. (I\u2019m Aware there are worse problems to have than \u201call 50 of my friends want me to go out but I don\u2019t like to\ud83e\udd72\u201d) (sorry for making you read this whole thing)",
