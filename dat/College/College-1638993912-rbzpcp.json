  "text": "As of now, I'm enrolled in creative writing next semester. The teacher who instructs that class also teaches oral communication which I'm currently in,  but she has treated me... poorly. \n\nFor context, one day before a speech I asked where I could view the order list (politely) and she responded by briefly looking up from her phone and said \"on canvas\". I didn't understand so I further asked \"where specifically in canvas?\" She then gives me an annoyed facial expression and stated \"in the modules\" in a snarky tone - she then looks back to her phone signaling the conversation was over.\n\nToday, I asked her if there were any retake options for a recent paper, she asks if I came in before class to workshop (which in all fairness I did not) then continues to talk about future assignments I could raise my grade with, Insinuates I'm lazy, and when I asked her if I had any hope of raising my grade from a C+, she said \"nope, I'm not even going to guess\" and walks away. I'm a man, but I started to tear up out of frustration.\n\nI'm really interested in writing and am even considering working on a book, but it's gotten to the point where I fear interaction with this teacher. It's not something I can really report or talk about with others because she's generally nice, relatable, and has articulated she had ADHD. As a generalization this teacher is not \"mean\", but rather very blunt and unsympathetic - and I feel towards me more so than others. I just don't understand why.\n\nHow should I handle this?",
