  "text": "Just curious if anyone has done this and still got the job. I'd assume most jobs even white collar jobs train you so one wouldn't need to really learn anything from college right? Also even if you did pass all your classes legit, there's no way you'd remember everything by the time you get a job.",

              "text": "$15/hr might sound like a lot compared to minimum wage, until you realize that adds up to $31k per year *before* taxes. That's hard to live on even in a low COL area. Rent is expensive and a lot of places want at least 2x proof of income to consider you. Health insurance is expensive but going without can cost way more in the long run. You can survive on $15/hr but it'll probably be stressful.\n\nCollege totally isn't for everyone, but it's worth thinking about other options like trade school. You can do a couple years of school and be making $40+/hr plus good benefits.",

                  "text": "Yea I meant short term obviously. But I also have alot of things helping me make that $30k livable. I'm married and my spouse makes decent money, my rent is only $1k/mo, I get Medicaid (not that I go to the doctor often anyways), my car is old and paid off, I shop at the dollar store whenever I can, and buy off brand food since it's cheaper. I'm currently making only $10/hr with part time hours and I don't know whatcha mean by \"stressful\". Yes I know about trade school but I wanna give college a shot first, plus I basically get paid to go which helps alot financially. Trade school wouldn't give me nowhere near the amount of financial aid I get for college. And if I get expelled or something then I'll go to trade school.",

Of course, you won\u2019t know everything when you graduate and will have to learn on the job, but if you cheat your way through college, you\u2019re going to lack some or all of the foundational knowledge and will not have expanded your brain in the process. It\u2019s a very risky gamble as to whether you could cheat your way through without getting caught and without doing yourself a big disservice.",
