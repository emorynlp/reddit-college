  "title:": "$paid 50 USD - Looking for college, postgrad, adult students who use e-learning platforms, self taught methods.",
  "text": "Not your typical tedious questionnaire; I'm looking for students to show me how they use some platforms to study. It's just an informal conversation.\n\nThe requirement must use one or more of the following:\n\n\\-Khan Academy\n\n\\-Coursera\n\n\\-Clutch Prep\n\n\\-Brilliant.org\n\nMust show the entire workflow on a current specific goal, screen share and webcam, including other tools on taking notes, memorizing, questioning, forums, Reddit, google docs, chrome extensions, mac or windows apps, paper and pencil, whiteboard, personal hacks, etc.\n\nIdeal: people who think they have very efficient workflows. Contact me via private message. Also interested in understanding learning for school VS learning for work or yourself.",
