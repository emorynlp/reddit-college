  "text": "So I am having trouble seriously picking between economics or math because it seems way too broad of what these degrees can actually do. I am not entirely sure of what I really want to do with my life for the next 20 years and I am a bit lost right now with nothing but uncertainty. Most people tell me that these degrees are useless and nothing helps out at all with these degrees because you only end up being a teacher or underemployed most of the time. I was thinking about economics but I truly liked math. I just don't think that I can get a master's in it because of poor math grades in college. What should I seriously do? Anyone?",

That being said, why do you want to do math as a major if your grades are poor?\n\nI'd say that if you don't know what you want to do, go with math. Math has so many applications that there's a better chance that you'll use stuff that you picked up during your math degree than stuff you pick up during your economics degree.",

Most jobs you'll get with an economics degree deal with data. For both majors, these certainly aren't the *only* jobs you can get, but for both majors, they make up the bulk of jobs. Jobs you'll get with an economics degree with be more business oriented, though, most likely.",

Once you get to upper division math courses, math is more about creative problem solving than adding numbers together--they're two different skillsets. A math degree will set you up for graduate school in economics if that's what you want to do. You won't have issues finding a job with a math degree either. I applied to jobs as a backup plan to graduate school, and during interviews, employers only brought up my math major, even though my physics major was listed first on my resume. Just make sure you have some programming and internship experience before you graduate.",

I\u2019m in my first semester of graduate school & I decided to go into computer science. Just because you majored in math in undergrad does not mean you have to do your masters program in it as well. Math is hard & I knew that when I was getting into my more abstract classes, so I started researching programs & found that math & CS are a good combination. \nI actually started my undergrad as a bio major, thought about going pre-med. Learned that I hated bio & chem & changed my major after my first year. I loved math all throughout high school, it was my favorite subject. That\u2019s why I changed my major to math and I don\u2019t regret it at all.",

      "text": "Hey, so first off, like a couple of other people have said, and econ/math joint degree is AMAZING and can open a LOT of routes. That said, you can also go for either major and then minor in the other one if you don't want to/can't do a joint major wherever you're going for college.\n\nAside from this, math is a VERY useful degree if you know how to market yourself well. If you throw in a little bit of programming knowledge, or finance or economics, or pretty much a lot of other things, you'll be VERY hirable. Even if you want to go purely into math, you can go onto grad school (not even a PhD, just a masters), and get a VERY well paying job. At that point, you can still switch over to economics (from what I know, having done a good amount of math, especially pure math, increases your chances of getting into a good school as well). And if not that, you can go for math+CS related degrees like data science/quantitative finance/computational science+scientific computing etc, and you'll be able to land an amazing job, which can range from being a data scientist, or a financial analyst, or a research scientist. Of course these are if you go for a more applied route, but again, you can change to that later. Tbh you can even go for an MBA route later and get a really good business/management job or smth. \n\nBasically, what I'm saying is that no. You won't be underemployed if you major in math. There's a LOT of options, you'll just have to choose what works good for you, make a rough-ish road map of what you want to+need to do to get jobs that you like, and somewhat stick to it. Again, if you market yourself well, you'll be able to get a LOT of jobs. Since math teaches good problem solving skills, you'll likely be a lot more \"clever\" than many other people applying for similar positions outside of purely math restricted options, so of course you'll be a good choice, given that you can apply your skills well. Just choose your courses wisely, and make sure you take some professional communication/business communication courses during your degree, they'll help with CV/resume writing and interviewing skills, which you may not learn from your degree alone. \n\nAnyway, best of luck deciding!! I hope you have a great time at college no matter what you choose! \n\nSource: senior year math major who has also thought of this stuff a lot lmao",

Assuming you go the \u201cpure\u201d/abstract math route rather than applied, then once you get past the calculus sequence your upper-division courses are all about proofs. A math degree trains you to analyze a complex situation, break it down into its constituent parts, come up with a solution process (not just a one-time answer!), write up a solid argument, and communicate your solution to a variety of different audiences. Those skills are all super valuable and applicable everywhere. Pick up some entry-level experience in whatever field you decide you\u2019d like to go into and you\u2019re golden.",
