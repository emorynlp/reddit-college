  "text": "I'm having a lot of trouble with school. Not academically, as the title suggests, but mentally. I put myself through a lot of mental anguish to try to keep my grades up. And I have a very hard time accepting that a B is okay, since I was so rewarded for having all As in high school. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I've considered taking a gap year after this semester started, dropping classes, and just straight up dropping out.\n\nHow did you learn to let go of \"excellent\" grades for college?",

And now I'm quitting college until it's back in person. So I guess that is letting go? But for real, I'm not gonna stress about keeping a 4.0 now that I am in university. All that matters is you get your bachelor's degree.",

You should study the material to the point to where you have no apprehensions and would rather get it over with. If you do well, go outside and let the light of the sun hit your face and soak it in. If you do well but not as well as you hoped to do, go outside and let the light of the sun hit your face and soak it in. You did your best, so just let yourself enjoy the warmth.",

But I can now get a B or a C on a single assignment without flying into full panic mode, because I decided that my physical and mental wellbeing matter more to me than an arbitrary letter that will literally mean nothing once I've graduated.\n\nJust to be clear, I am not advocating for the \"C's get degrees\" mindset; while yes, C's can get degrees, aiming for a C gives you very little room for actual failure. If you aim for an A and end up screwing up, you could get a C. If you aim for a C and end up screwing up, you could get an F. As much as these grades are pretty arbitrary, F's do not get degrees and I am not about to spend a small fourtune on an education only to have nothing to show at the end.",
