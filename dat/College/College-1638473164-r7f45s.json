  "text": "hey all, I\u2019m a freshman in college and finals are coming up. I think i will mostly get Bs with 2 Cs (i take 4 and a half classes by the way if you count the lab portion). I know this isn\u2019t very good and very unlike me. I\u2019ve learned the lesson that i can\u2019t put the same effort into college as i did in high school and expect As and Bs (which is what happened). I am a biology major and a C is a passing grade for my school but is this terrible?",
