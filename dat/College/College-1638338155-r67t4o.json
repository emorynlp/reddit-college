  "text": "Lately I've been feeling abit stressed as the year is ending. I feel like it mainly contributes to my terrible time management and could use some advice. I feel this way as in my mind everything feels the same. Figure out assignments, study few hours. Spend some family time,play some games then end the night. I think that if I spent my time more carefully I'd enjoy it more and lessen the work and studying I'd need to do. but I need some advice on how those of you with more experience handle your time (my first year in college) and how you give yourself time to enjoy other things than school related stuff.",
