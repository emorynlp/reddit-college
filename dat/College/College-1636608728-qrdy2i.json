  "text": "Anybody else feel like they've somehow just been able to BS their way through all of their classes and don't actually know shit about your area of study? Cause I do and I'm about to graduate in Spring. Spent my first 2 years chegging shit and cheating on tests and the last 2 years I've just split up every assignment with a couple friends and anything we can't figure out we just get from somebody else. I don't pay attention in class and basically start studying for exams the night before and I get like 60-70% grades on them that are somehow usually above the class average. During covid the P/F option saved my ass in a number of classes. I have no clue how I have a 3.47 GPA. Terrified of getting technical interviews",

      "text": "Meh, you're in charge of your education. \n\nI'm back at 32 and I definitely can tell that my education is a lot better than my early 20's. My drive and goals are a lot different. I love to learn all the stuff and a strive to do so. It makes me fuckin' smort! \n\nI did that kind of shit in my early days. It doesn't help. It's a rather round about way of shooting yourself in the foot too. If that same kind of behavior follows you into a job, your employers will figure it out pretty quickly and take care of it. I can't count how many people I'd seen hired at places where I was working who claimed they knew the industry and didn't at all. Granted, these were non-diploma positions. The concept remains the same though. \n\nI can't wait for people to ask me technical shit. I'm a mechanical engineering major with 10 years of industry experience. It's why I'm back at school. I love the technical horse shit. My previous experience has led me to view my education this way though. I worked shitty jobs with horrible management in horrible conditions for so long. Now I saved enough money to attend school and get away from that shit. College is a diamond for me. It's going to reduce the physical pain I was experiencing doing the jobs I was doing. I'll finally get to use my fucking brain. \n\nI just got tired of people telling me how smart I was and within the SAME sentence telling me exactly how to do something trivial. Micromanagement is fucking annoying.",

      "text": "I've felt this way before, like I'm just taking answers from the internet or my friends and not really grasping the concepts. I think it's got something to do with motivation to learn in the first place, and that's something everyone has to find for themselves.\n\nIf you just get by in college for every class, that's going to translate to your career and maybe the major you're in isn't fulfilling for you. That's okay, people change their career paths during/after college, or are stuck with one they don't like and figure it out along the way.\n\n If you want to change you can talk to your advisor or just sit down and think about what you want, but if you're fine doing what you're doing it's okay to not really know your next step yet, or if you're just going to get a job in your field and will learn through experience. \n\nBut yeah to answer your question I have felt this way and I usually get fed up with it and try to at least get the big idea by paying attention in lectures.",
