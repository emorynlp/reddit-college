  "text": "I\u2019m curious how people deal with problematic roommates, I\u2019ve tried talking with mine multiple times and we actually started out really well then suddenly I must\u2019ve done something I wasn\u2019t aware of and been asking over and over what is going on so we can fix it.\nShe\u2019s OCD and is incredibly independent, every time I come home I go straight to my room and lock the door.\nBut recently her passive aggressive behavior scares me enough I\u2019ve been sleeping in my car but it\u2019s starting to get extremely cold.\nI can\u2019t afford to get another place yet and I\u2019m not sure what to do, much love and thank you for any advice.",
