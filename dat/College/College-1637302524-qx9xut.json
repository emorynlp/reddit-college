  "title:": "FOMO on College Experience",
  "text": "I was recently accepted into my dream school: a top 25 (comp. engineering) with amazing name recognition, academics, and student culture, but the cost for 4 years would be around $80k even after financial aid and college fund. \n\nAnother school I was accepted into is offering me a scholarship that when combined with my college fund (\\~$20k) would make college essentially free to attend. The catch is that the college is barely  ranked top 150, I would still be living with my parents, and the commute would be around 40 minutes there and another 40 back. \n\nIs missing out on the college experience and opportunity at your dream school worth graduating debt free? \n\nIs the FOMO worth $80k?",
