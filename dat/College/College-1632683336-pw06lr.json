  "text": "I like both of these schools equally. I just can\u2019t figure out which one I like more. For starters, I\u2019m planning on majoring in Political Science and maybe Economics. I want a sports scene and a pretty big party scene. Preferably, I\u2019d like to get to know my professors personally.\n\nI also value the surrounding area. I want to sometimes, but not all the times, go off campus and do stuff.",
