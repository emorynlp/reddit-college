  "text": "I am basically done with everything. The only thing that is yet to be completed is my parent's signature. Since my parents are non-citizens and do not have ssn, I will need to mail their signatures. How long does it take to process a mailed signature? I am planning to apply ED to one of my schools. The deadline for ED is Nov 1. Can I get a confirmation email from FAFSA before Nov 1?",
