  "text": "So I have missed about a month of class, see my disability devolped  in the military was chronic pancreatitis  due to damage to my pancreas from polluted barracks water. I barely managed to scrape by but 1 of my classes was a Japanese language class. All in all its this class thst is dragging my GPA. Currently as I go take the finals I expect to have no less then a 1.7 and no more then a 1.9 and I'm panicking. I am most definetly gonna fail that Japanese class It's a new language and I haven't been able to attend. Of course I have disability services and attendance modification  but who cares if I can't pass the freaking class. Can anyone give me advice on what to do?",

      "text": "You should probably ask on the veterans reddit since people there would better understand your situation.  Since you're on academic probation you need to talk to an academic advisor about things. You shouldn't go forward without taking the classes you got low grades in again and fixing your GPA. You need to ask yourself why you got low grades. It could be your fault partially and the fault of a bad teacher. Either way don't get yourself in any more trouble because you can't just start over again somewhere else these days since your academic record follows you, especially if you want student aid. If you're getting MGI Bill and failing that's a big problem since you may have to pay it back. Also, if you're doing VA voc rehab then you need to talk to the rehab counselor about it.",

      "text": "That sucks dude, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m only a reservist but I feel for ya. That being said, language classes take a whole lot of work and learning a new language can be a super difficult prospect. If you\u2019re still getting in the hang of things, you should try to take some of the more basic classes to get in the swing of college and move onto something more difficult later on.",
