  "text": "I will not go into detail of what happened, but it involves me being reported to the honor council by my professor. I was already planning on transferring to a community college to pursue a different career, so I'm wondering if there'd be a way to do that without a violation on my records. I know you all go to different schools, but what could happen if I tried transferring to community college instead going to an honor council meeting?",

      "text": "Normally academic integrity processes will go forward regardless of whether of not a student participates. Obviously if you transfer the original school can't enforce any penalties that would apply only at their school like putting you on academic probation or forcing you to take a ethics course. They can probably still enforce any penalties that effect how the incident is reflected on your transcript though.",

          "text": "Agreed. Every university I've taught at has a policy in place to prevent students from withdrawing from the specific courses they committed academic misconduct in (to avoid people just trying to drop the course if they get caught) and policies in place to ensure (depending on the severity of the offense) that the misonduct is marked on the transcript.",
