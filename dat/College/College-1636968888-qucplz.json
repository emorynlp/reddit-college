  "text": "Hello, Im a Civil Engineering student (Freshman) and I really dont know what to do on this course. Im having troubles on calculus and statistics (I failed my prelims and midterms) but I passed and I have good grades on my other subjects, its just that im not really motivated and excited on the course I chose, I know and understand how to solve the lesson given to us on calc and stat but when it comes to exams and activities, Im lost lmao, its really frustrating because im not really good at maths but i like studying math because it makes me feel more dedicated and it really makes me feel like im finally \"studying\". \nFirst of all, I wanted Mechanical Engineering or Aerospace Engineering, why? because i like how machineries works and on top of that i like cars and some aerodynamic things, but my dream university only accept shs graduates from STEM (Im an IT shs grad) and other universities that has MechE or Aero are miles awaaaay from our home, plus the college fees of course are a bit of expensive per se, sooo I had no choice but to study on the other university that is like 2km away from my dream school that does not offer MechE or Aero, so i chose CivilE because i literally had no choice. Im like Fck it, its also engineering, and it sucks tbh because im not really into building houses and stuff...\nI hope some of yall can give some time on when should i consider shifting courses. Thanks!\n(P.S: I will probably retake calc and stat this summer)",
