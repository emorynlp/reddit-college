  "title:": "Work is scheduling me 37 hours the week prior to final exams",
  "text": "My job gives us our schedule 3 weeks in advance and finals week is also in 3 weeks. They scheduled me 37 hours the week before. This is retail so they are really not that respectful of my time. They know I\u2019m a college student but for some reason they think I want to work sub 40 hours a week even when I tell them otherwise. \n\nI called in today because fuck it and I\u2019ve been really deliberating over whether I should hand in my uniform tomorrow. I really don\u2019t think want to fail my final exams. I have enough money right now to get myself through next semester with a good amount of money left over so I\u2019m really tempted to pull the trigger. \n\nI plan on focusing more time on scholarship searching, treating it almost as a job in itself. Any advice?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to quit. I\u2019ll give them a one week notice as a small courtesy since, thankfully, not everyone there is an asshole.",

Doesn't make disregarding your wishes on scheduling any less shitty, but if there was any an industry and a time to do it, it would be retail two weeks before Christmas.",

I think it\u2019s also worth going to your manager and saying hey I have finals that week and unless you bring down my hours to 15 (or however many you want) then I\u2019m going to be putting in a weeks notice. Sometimes the threat of quitting and being serious about it will get a manager to pull strings. Best case scenario you keep your job and have less hours that week. Worst case you were gonna quit anyway.",
