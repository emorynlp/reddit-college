  "text": "Title.\n\nOur final assignment in a module is due in less than 12 hours. We are all supposed to write 2000 words each then put everything together as one whole paper and submit it.\n\nI was the dumb one for accepting the responsibility for the entire paper, and now I have to AND have been constantly nagging (once a week) my groupmates about their part for the past month and a half or so. They either don't open the messages, or just say \"they will\". I also have to make sure the paper has a uniform formatting, everything, you can imagine.\n\nEvery member besides me started working on their part today, and one of them is also radio silent. Someone already broke the wonderful news to me that they will only be able to send me their part by midnight... Guess I'll have to stay up for their sake.. The assignment itself is due tomorrow at 8am, and they really expect me to do all these (and will sadly), even though we are all graded individually.\n\nI have been thinking of just staying loyal to my sleep schedule and going to sleep when I have to and upload whatever they have sent to me by then, but I hate being a douche. Kinda scared of their backlash if I do something like this but I have been thinking that their parts were literally their own responsibilities... The teacher has known about the situation already weeks prior and told me to set deadlines for them but I have dozens of times already and none of them cared.\n\nReddit pls give me power, this is my last assignment before my exams, after this it is all Malibu and stuff.",

They didn't care enough to so their part, that's on them, not you.\n\nDo not lose sleep over this. This is a valuable lesson to your lazy group mates.",

You can learn from this to take advantage of the situation next time it happens.\n\nThis has happened to me for every single group project in my entire college career. After getting fucked once, I just started getting the professor involved really early.\n\n9/10 times, the group members still won\u2019t help but then the professor gives me extra credit or something. I just did this. Group ghosted me the entire semester. I notified professor about 1 month into the semester with weekly updates. I presented all by myself and my project definitely wasn\u2019t perfect, but I got the highest score in the class.\n\nEDIT: Pro-tip since every college student is going to be like the ones you currently have - tell everyone you\u2019re a single parent with a full-time job in addition to school and you just recovered from COVID. Then they *might* help.",
