  "title:": "Is taking a 5 week class for chem a bad idea while taking 3 other classes?",
  "text": "I haven't registered for chem yet, but I just wanna know...\nI know chemistry is a difficult subject and I'm taking 3 other classes during the winter semester. (One 6 day class, one government class for GE, and one money management class for my college program)\n\nIt is manageable to take a chem in 5 weeks while doing 3 other classes?\nI'll have zoom meetings every week and 2 out of the 5 days are from 11am to 4 pm.\n\nWhat was your experience taking chemistry in college? I'd like to know how much time and effort you put into it.\n\nI have difficulty gauging time and stuff so I'd like to know your take on it. My mom was lowkey worried about me cuz I get anxious lol so I just want to know what chem was like for others since I don't have friends at my college atm.\nTy for reading\n\nEdit: ty for the feedback. I really appreciate it. I'm not gonna take chem this semester and just do it in spring when the class is longer.",

      "text": "# I wouldn\u2019t recommend taking Chemistry with other classes at the same time. The class is heavy in general, and 5 weeks would be even more intense. It\u2019s probably best to take Chemistry alone, then take the other classes after Chemistry ends. Maybe try to find a longer course if possible, so you have more time to grasp the material.",
