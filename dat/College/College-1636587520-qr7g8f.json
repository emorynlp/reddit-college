  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m a third-year english major. I want to become a technical writer, and for that career you have to have a pretty good idea of Microsoft Office, HTML, Python, and other programs. Is it better to have certificates for each program, or just take electives at my university? Looking for advice because nobody in my circle is quite sure.\nThanks!",
