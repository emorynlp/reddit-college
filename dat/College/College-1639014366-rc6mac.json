  "title:": "Is it appropriate to give a professor a card at the end of the semester?",
  "text": "I have really enjoyed one of my professors and learned a great amount through the semester, so thought it would be nice to express this with a card written out to them. I would like to give it to them before the holidays, as I will not see them again after. I thought about also including a small gift ($10 amazon card) to express my appreciation. Is this appropriate to give to a professor? I don\u2019t want to create any uncomfortableness but really want to express my appreciation. Also, I do want to note that I have considered asking this professor for a recommendation letter in the future, but don\u2019t at all want to come off as bribing or sucking up for this. Any thoughts?",

              "text": "If you're insistent on giving a gift, don't make it an Amazon card. That's kinda like slipping your professor money at the end of the semester. Instead see if there's a coffee shop on or near campus and get them a $10 gift card there. There's a lot less issues with buying someone coffee than giving them hard cash.",

      "text": "I've given my psychology professor a card a couple of years ago, she was sweet and an overall awesome teacher. I think she really appreciated the sentiment. I would probably stick with the card just not the gift card. Like the other comment already mentioned, although your intentions are good it might be interpreted in a different way.",
