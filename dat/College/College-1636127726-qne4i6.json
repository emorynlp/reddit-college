  "text": "I am in my early 20s, currently in my third year of college still undecided (yeah pretty bad lol).I really don't know what field to pick as that I have been in college once before in 2018 but I am really looking for any suggestions for careers to try. What is the best ones for financial stability and decent pay, and long growth/stability in the next decade or two??\n\nEdit: So I am about to be in my third year and I took some business classes. However, I don't want to do this shit. What else can I do and I am willing to find different careers?",

      "text": "I'd say STEM majors are in demand but not always super versatile. You'd be stuck in that specific field. Like if you majored in human biology. There's not much you can do right out of undergrad with that. Maybe work in a lab if you have experience from an RA position.\n\nWhereas a communications degree, is more versatile but perhaps not in as much demand. Like you could work for a for profit business, a non-profit, government. They can get stuff in media. I know a guy who is the head of his department in Fidelity, but he was at the same company for decades.\n\nI feel like u/Kiwi_1127's comment is pretty spot on",

If you don't plan to go to medical school, or plan to get a Master's, best not to major, cause you won't make much and most jobs require at least a Master's if you're not going to go to Med school\n\n(T)echnology\n\nDegree examples: Computer Science, MIS/CIS, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Game Development\n\nTons of jobs, tons of demand. Good work life balance, able to find a job quickly, great pay. Hard, but rewarding. You should do internships, self-made projects to stand out to employers\n\n(E)ngineering\n\nDegree examples: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering\n\nThe best one from STEM. Hard as well, but rewarding. You can make A LOT right out of college, and you'll find tons of jobs. I hear the work life balance is good as well\n\n(M)ath\n\nDegree examples: Math, Statistics, Applied Math\n\nYou can get almost any job in the job market, cause employers will see you as very smart. You can make good money. I don't know too much, if you're interested, you can do more research.\n\nHere's a video rankings STEM degrees:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lDnLcPjOnEA\n\nThis guy's channel is great for finding which majors are good, which are bad, and how to find what major you want\n\nIf you have more questions, don't be afraid to ask",
