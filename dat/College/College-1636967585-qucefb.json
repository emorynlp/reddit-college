      "text": "Meh, I'm a 32 year old student and some of my peers from high school have done well. \n\nThen again, depending where you're getting this information it may just be cherry picked to look well. Those jobs don't mean they're actually doing well. Hell, those may be the absolute worst jobs they've gotten and they can't wait to hang themselves in their bathroom because of them. It's the good ole Snap Shot life. It looks good on the surface but they still get bit by mosquitos too. \n\nDon't gauge your life based on others. It's a dangerous hole to be digging. At this point, I'm uneducated. I'm getting there. My peers from high school could look at me and point out how big of a failure I am. That's not an indication of my happiness with my life. Not all of them could understand that some of my biggest accomplishments don't even relate to a career. I grow a gigantic garden every year that's incredibly important to me. The next guy doesn't even like fucking broccoli, ya know? \n\nDo what's best for you at all times. It'll take care of the people closest to you at the same time. Don't ever think that life is linear or even similar between people. They are all vastly different. Some of us will never work the giant businesses because it's not what we want.",

I'm not pissed/upset about their successes. \n\nI know that it's wrong/unhelpful to compare. I wanted to see if others experienced something similar, and how they responded to such experiences.",
