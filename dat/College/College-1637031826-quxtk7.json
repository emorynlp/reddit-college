  "title:": "My dog died and I have an essay due tomorrow",
  "text": "My dog died earlier today and I\u2019m really messed up about it. He was 12 years old but still it happened so suddenly I thought I would have more time with him. I had him since I was 8 and I just can\u2019t even believe he is gone right now, we were always together even during class(classes are online).I have an essay due tomorrow at 3pm that completed some of, but I just have no motivation to complete it nor any of my work for my other classes as of right now. I just can\u2019t get my mind off my dog. I emailed my professor earlier asking for an extension but she hasn\u2019t responded yet. I\u2019ve tried to go back to writing the essay but just feel so depressed and keep thinking about all the time with my dog\u2026\n\n* I would like to thank everyone so much for sharing their advice and kind words. Listening to what you guys have said has helped me out during this difficult time because it feels like I\u2019m not alone. I also thank you guys for sharing your stories about losing a pet or loved one, it must of been hard to share and bring back up these memories so I thank you for sharing them with me and everyone else. Thankfully, my professor gave me an extension but it\u2019s still gonna be hard to write because I just can\u2019t help think about my boy.",

      "text": "Hi, I just went through this myself a few months back. Losing a pet is very difficult, even if they are old and even if their death was expected. When it happened to me, I didn't have the will to eat, drink, or shower for a few days, and I was intensely sad, lethargic, and depressed. Grieving is hard work, and it takes a lot out of you.\n\nI emailed my professors and asked for extensions on homework and large projects, offered to take a late penalty too. All of my professors were very understanding and gave me a few extra days, but it helped that I was a good student who normally did my work and got good grades. Still, most professors are understanding how of difficult loss is.\n\nJust wait for a response and try to process your grief and feel your loss now. Taking care of yourself and your mental and physical health is vastly more important than this paper.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I (24f) lost my dog a month ago who was also 12 and my best friend. I took days off work and I couldn\u2019t eat, sleep, drink, or even think without bursting into tears and feeling so out of place. My chest felt so empty and my heart literally hurt. I still fight back tears and have nights where I just wish for more time together & cry myself to sleep. \n\nLosing a pet is hard, especially one who you\u2019ve bonded and grown up with. Take time to take care of yourself, cry and scream if you need to. Grieve, it\u2019s okay to mourn the lost of your family member. Wait until morning for a response and then depending on the outcome, do what\u2019s best for you. Again, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Feel free to message me if you need to vent",

I know when my fur bro died this summer, I went through many challenging days where I couldn\u2019t help but cry. To this day, I miss him. \n\nIt makes sense that you feel this way. You cared and loved your pet and you had great memories together. I got this letter from the service where we got my dog cremated and it talked about the rainbow bridge where our dogs are at now. According to this letter, they are safe there, happy to be with other lovely animals. This place has an open green field where they roam around and play. They are free from sickness and pain here. Their health has been restored in this place; they are strong and healthy again! It also mentioned that when our day comes and we leave this physical life that we\u2019ll eventually meet them there. I wasn\u2019t the type to believe in this kind of stuff before. However, that letter about the rainbow bridge gave me a sense of peace that I now believe it is real. I have to. We have to. Believe that your dog is now in this lovely place because he/she is!  \n\nWhat also got me through the pain is honestly feeling the pain. I got my dog cremated, so when I think of him, I dedicate some time to pay my respect whether that be taking the time to remember him or taking a walk where we used to walk together. I tried to be grateful that I had all those years with him and that I got the chance to get to know an amazing dog like him! It\u2019s the best gift that any pet owner can ask for. \n\nI know this may not be what you wanted to read\u2026I don\u2019t have the best answer for you. All I can advice you is to try to get progress on your essay. I\u2019m glad that you reached out to your professor ( I would have done that too). While you wait for an extension though, try to get some progress. If you have to take a break, do so. Losing someone you love takes adjustment so please don\u2019t ignore how you\u2019re feeling. \n\nI wish you all the best \u2764\ufe0f",
