  "text": "Do teachers or professors care about your spelling when it comes to tests and assignments? I have my first science test this weeks and I\u2019m doing my best to study but without having the words in front of me I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to spell certain words properly at all when it comes to taking the test, I\u2019m having a hard enough time remembering things and pronouncing them so remembering the spelling will be a real task for me.",

You have spellcheck killer, it'd better be right.  \n\nIf you're doing an exam with some paragraph responses and you misspell Venous Vascular Malformation, like say you add an extra \"i\" to the Venous (Venious) you'll be forgiven so long as it's clear what you're talking about.",
