  "text": "My friend failed calc 2 with a 31%. The passing mark is 40% in my university, but if everyone performed awfully, the passing mark will be moved down. The class average is 53% this time, with a standard deviation of 15%. \n\nAll of the rest of us got a total of above 60%, which gives us grades of B or above. I got a z score of 0.7 and should be a B+.\n\nThe professor sets hard exams usually in the fall (he is the only one teaching the class in fall) but in the spring the difficulty is lower.\n\nHow can we help him to make sure he doesn't fail again? If he fails again he is in risk of getting kicked out.",
