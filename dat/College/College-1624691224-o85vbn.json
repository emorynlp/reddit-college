  "title:": "After a really shitty year I got an A in my first summer class!",
  "text": "So before the rona hit I had a 3.67 GPA, was in a national honors society for my major, and hit the provost's list twice in a row. At the end of this last semester I had a 2.27 and got put on academic probation. Basically, this has been a year-long lesson that I absolutely DO NOT function as a student with online-only classes. \n\nThis is the first time ever I've been on probation and it was a fucking kick to the stomach when I got that email, let me tell you. I decided it would be a good idea to sign up for summer courses because the state would cover all but $200 if I took two. I just finished my first one and I got an A! It's probably not a huge win to a lot of you guys, but to me it feels like I'm finally getting my groove back, that I'm proving to myself that I'm not really a shitty student like I've thought all year. So yeah! Next session starts in 2 weeks and I'm ready to go HAM on that one too :)\n\nEDIT: all of these lovely comments have given me the biggest smile I've had in a long time, I love you guys <3",

I feel most schools have not given their students enough credit given the circumstances. You should be super proud of yourself for sticking with classes and getting back on track, it is not an easy thing to do. Hope your next session goes just as well!!",

          "text": "Thank you so much! I agree with you about so many higher ed administrations basically pretending like online courses are exactly the same as in-person and fuck the faculty/students who are struggling. I know that 99% of my professors have been moving heaven and earth to make sure the students don't suffer because of that. The other 1% was this one bitch I had last semester who basically had us teach ourselves then complained about how many of us were scoring low on exams like it was our fault.",

              "text": "I completely agree! I\u2019m a transfer student, and I started at the university I\u2019m currently attending when everything was fully remote, so I\u2019ve never actually attended classes in person at this school. The professors outlook and dedication were completely different compared to the last school I was at. Most professors expected you to teach yourself which I could understand to a degree considering there was no face to face interaction, but a couple of them were just so unhelpful like they weren\u2019t interested in teaching and that\u2019s the most disheartening situation in my opinion. I just hope with things beginning to return to how they used to be students will be able to get back to a method of learning that works for them again.",
