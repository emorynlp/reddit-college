  "text": "Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a medical student in asia (arabic country), here in my college students enter right after high school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn high school they taught us alot of science i guess etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in my college it is a 7 year programme:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-4 years for bachelor of health sciences\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-and then 3 years (rotations) so u become a medical doctor\n\nI am studying for free by the way\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso I have been passing the first 3 years without failing anytime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nin the third year I passed by luck\n\n&#x200B;\n\nessentially, I entered medical school because I have problems making decisions and I had a high grade in high school and I found that I had a chance to get accepted in medical school so I applied and got accepted but there's no passion and I never wanted to become a medical doctor and maybe some parental pressure (not little)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the issue is: once I reached 4th year (which teaches the theory of Central Nervous System, Renal System, OBS GYNE related systems, and digestive system) I took a leave of absence on my first attempt, failed at second (got 54% instead of 60% to pass in terms of the total grade of the year), failed at third (didn't study at all), but they give me a last chance this year so I can take the bachelor of health sciences (without allowing me to proceed to the next year) (right now, 6 weeks have passed since the year began)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy issue is that I don't know if whether I should continue in here, this 4th year is hard for me, I have issues actually going forward and studying to pass this year (it's not an easy curriculum this year)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am really struggling to decide whether I should stay and get that bachelor or leave for a different school ( I like computer related degrees such as computer engineering)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand at the same time I am so negative that I don't know if I will be able to succeed in a new school if I switch\n\n&#x200B;\n\nam a mess and am still living with my parents and I feel like I am useless and a waste of human in society since am living with my parents and having no progress or goals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfor guidance regarding my medical school programme they teach u mostly theory of medicine in the first 4 years and then in the next 3 years it's rotations in different specialties of medicine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(medical school is hell for me)",
