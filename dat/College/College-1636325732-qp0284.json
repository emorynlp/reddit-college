  "text": "I took a journalism class my freshman year and while I disliked journalism, I really enjoyed the technical aspect of it as far as video filming and production. My major is completely unrelated to video and film, but lately I have been considering it as a career since I enjoy it a lot. Would it be okay to email my former professor asking for advice? I'm not 100% sure if he remembers me but I think he would be a good person to ask",

      "text": "I'd say yes.\n\nMy thesis supervisor is now my biggest advisor. She was the first person I approached regarding career prospects in the field (2 years ago) and I highly doubt she even remembers that. Nowadays, I ask her stuff about graduate studies and super technical science-y stuff (population modelling, spatial analysis, etc. etc.).\n\nDo note that if this professor is handling a huge classload this semester (maybe something like a 300+ student introductory lecture), reaching out may be difficult",
