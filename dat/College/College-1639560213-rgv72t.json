  "text": "Hey there. I was just informed by someone anonymously that my dorm smells. (I don\u2019t have a sense of smell due to a previous brain injury and haven\u2019t had it in years.) I keep up on laundry including linens, and am a generally clean person showering multiple times a day because I do not want to be smelly, but I am absolutely mortified and embarrassed by this entire encounter. I do have horses, so maybe people are smelling the horsie smell, and if that\u2019s the case I can\u2019t help that because that\u2019s my line of work, and I\u2019m pretty sure that that is just a permanent smell attached to me. I have plug in air freshener going (Just bought new ones because my old ones ran out) but I am not sure what else to do at this point. I am just so embarrassed by all of this and while the person said it in kind of a hurtful way, I\u2019m glad it was brought up so I can fix my smells situation.",
