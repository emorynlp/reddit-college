  "text": "I love science. Chemistry, biology, you name it. Good stuff. Fascinating.\n\nI was going to school for paramedicine (I know) for a little while, but quickly found out that most of what you learn in school isn't used out on the field. Like the vast majority just doesn't get used.\n\nSO.\n\nI decided to bite the bullet, get over my fear of large time/money investments, and I'm going to major in something... sciency.\n\nI aced biology all through high school and early college. Same with chemistry. No sweat.\n\nI looked into medicine, but I don't want to work in a hospital or general care. Optometry looked awesome, so did physical therapy, but both are dwindling fields and I'm at least a decade out from licensure.\n\nSo M.D. is out of the question. Engineering? I'm not hyped about it, but I thought about looking into Chemical Engineering or Biochem. Maybe a Bachelor's to start out?\n\nI'm totally lost here, as you can see, and would love some guidance from some current students or industry professionals regarding what I might enjoy.\n\nI wish I liked either bio or chem more than the other. That'd make things much simpler. Biochem seems like a solid combo of the two...\n\nThoughts..? \ud83d\ude05",

      "text": "If you are considering grad school you could go that route with the sciences, but make sure you like to do research. Also, research what type of jobs you could get if you go to grad school for chemistry/ biology. My advice is if you are serious about the physical sciences, and think grad school could be for you, get into a research lab as soon as possible to see if you would enjoy that type of work. As working in a research lab is (in my experience) a much different feeling than a lab class.",
