  "text": "For context I\u2019m a first year engineering major. It\u2019s been about 2 months. Within those months I\u2019ve felt the most depressed, suicidal, anxious, and frustrated I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. I was out of therapy for 5 months, and within weeks of getting on campus my mental health has spiraled and I\u2019m forced to go back. I\u2019m genuinely concerned I\u2019m going to flunk out of college after the first semester, and it feels like everything I do is being blown up in my face. I worked hard in high school, and I\u2019ve always been a good student, and I\u2019ve never even went to any parties, drank, or smoked ANYTHING. I love my school, I love my choice and I love being here, but I don\u2019t know how much more rejection I can take. And I\u2019m not saying \u201cboo-hoo I got a B and now my life\u2019s ruined\u201d I mean I literally got a D on my first calc 1 midterm, way below average on my chem exams, and the only thing keeping me somewhat afloat is my 2 lib Ed classes. I\u2019m struggling in a way I\u2019ve never struggled before and I keep hearing \u201coh you\u2019re doing great!\u201d and \u201coh you\u2019ll be fine, everybody struggles!\u201d But I don\u2019t think they realize just exactly how stressed I am about just trying to get a fucking C on at least one goddamn test. I go see math tutors nearly every day of the week, and I\u2019m in the process of finding a time to meet with a chem tutor as well (peer tutors through university program) plus I dedicate nearly 9 hours a day to studying and homework and it\u2019s still never enough. But Is this even worth it? Am I the person they\u2019re trying to weed out? I\u2019ve never felt so fucking stupid in my entire life and I\u2019m already just so mentally taxed. I\u2019ve wanted to be an engineer since I was 9, and I\u2019m not even one semester in and i feel like such a failure to myself and the hard work I\u2019ve put in to get to this point. I\u2019ve wanted this for so long and I don\u2019t know what my purpose is if I can\u2019t do it. Does anybody relate? Can anybody tell me this gets better?",

      "text": "Welcome to the jungle, kid. \n\nEverything you just described is called \"being a freshman\". You just went through your first reality check where you realize this ain't high school. Studying doesn't guarantee a good grade anymore, slacking off is dangerous, high effort /= high performance, and most important of all, it's ruthless. \n\nLet me tell you this upfront: **anything above C is vanity.**\n\nFrom here on out, you study to pass classes. Not to ace them. Get that mindset of \"Studying = A's or B's\" out of your head because that will FUCK YOU UP real badly, specially if your mental health is fragile. For that reason, I must say this: **toughen up, buttercup.** You're in the big leagues now. You must take care of your mental health, yes, but grow thick skin. Take the challenges put forth, give it your best, and be proud of whatever the result is. If it's good, hooray. If not, learn from your mistake and keep on trucking. Don't take it too personal, don't take it too deep because you will fail. You will get F's, you will get 50%'s, you may even flunk in classes yet it is perseverance what wins in the end. \n\nMy friend, this isn't a race. This is a marathon. You're not here to finish in record time, but to pass classes at your own pace. Don't look to the sides, don't compare yourself against others. Slow breathes, steady hands, and a comfortable pace. Be diligent like a monk, and you will persevere.\n\nLearn of yourself, learn of your mistakes, and take every failure as a lesson for improving. Not as \"FUCK I SUCK IM USELESS\" but as \"Okay, so I should manage my time better and learn to see the problems differently\". It's all about self-improving. \n\nIf you ever need advice or help, my DM's are open. Best of luck, and remember:\n**\"Success is going from failure to failure without loosing your enthusiasm.\"**",

In other words, an A- average across all my classes. Of course getting A's and A+'s in easy elective classes helps offset difficulties in the harder core classes. But in general, for me, studying *does* have to yield A's and B's, because if it doesn't, my scholarship goes out the window.",

You will also be able to pick your classes which gives you some degree of flexibility (12 credits instead of 15 to lighten up the load and still make it through the curriculum). \n\nIt's your first semester. It's always surprising but, it's just a matter of getting used to.",

I'm also a first year in engineering, but I've promised myself to keep moving forward and take things at my own pace regardless of the results. Even if you fail, learn from your mistakes and move forward. Even if you succeed and ace your exams, don't let it get over your head and keep moving forward. Like you said, perseverance is the key here and life isn't about doing good in school or having money, it's about finding who you are and staying true to yourself.",

But even once you get a engineering job it will be tough because then you are doing engineering 24/7 and people will be relying on you to not mess up your job.\nAlso many majors purposely make intro classes and other class pre requisites as hard as possible to weed people out. It\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s the systems. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s the name of the game. Look more into the liberal education classes and talk to an advisor about a major change and careers. You might be able to find a job that is a mix of a liberal arts and engineering.",

Maybe look into careers that are similar to engineering, or you could even get your gen eds out of the way and see if anything else interests you.
