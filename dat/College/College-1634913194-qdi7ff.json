She missed 1 question on our midterm. She begged and cried in front of the entire class to retake it. He let her do it after 5 minutes of crying.",

      "text": "Unless the syllabus has a provision for this, and I doubt it does, I seriously doubt the professor will allow this. If you're really determined you can ask privately but if he says no I recommend accepting the no. Don't throw a tantrum like the girl in the other person's comment! \n\nRegardless of if you ask to retake it or not, I recommend speaking with the professor privately and asking him what does he recommend you study based on your grades overall, and advice on study resources and study groups generally. If the syllabus does not talk about extra credit or if it says there will be extra credit, also ask about that. You could still ask if the syllabus says no extra credit but if that is what is in the syllabus don't get your hopes up.\n\nEdit to add: if you have a disability like ADHD that could have contributed to the failure (perhaps you were unable to focus) go register with the disability office so you can get test taking accommodations for future tests which could include the ability to take it in a quiet room or extended test taking time. I doubt this will allow you to retake the previous test though, I suspect it will only apply to future tests. You could ask anyway though, the worst they'll say is no. Be prepared to provide a doctor note if you do this.",
