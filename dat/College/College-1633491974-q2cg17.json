  "title:": "Is It Just Me, Or Is My Professor Being A Little Too Harsh?",
  "text": "So, I'm in a Calc 3 class and my professor makes unusually difficult exams and quizzes, as in there are multiple subsets of each question prompt to answer, with some math problems on quizzes totaling 10 different math legibly in 50 minutes or less. Most students in the class have failed the first midterm and it doesn't help that he's not even sure if he'll curve the class average at the end of the semester. It does not help that I have Asperger's Syndrome and generalized anxiety disorder. Also, on the first midterm, he hadn't even finished teaching the last section before handing out the midterm, which is very disorienting! He had finished up teaching the chapter for vector functions three days after our midterm. There was no exam review whatsoever, extremely infuriating. I'm wondering if my anger and frustration is justified in this case.",

      "text": "Has he said he's not sure if he'll curve it? That sounds like he's disappointed in the performance, but hasn't figured out what to do about it. You have a right to know how or if grading will change ASAP.\n\nThere's no requirement to have a review for a midterm, a professor can finish a lecture and give the exam the next day. That's not necessarily a bad professor.",

          "text": "Yeah, he's not good at all. Literally the only teacher I've ever met that thinks it's a good idea to teach material on a midterm week, instead of reviewing what was learned. It is very upsetting for me, and every neighboring student had below a 60 percent, so if he doesn't curve the class grade, then his exams and quizzes are in fact unusually difficult and aren't given at a reasonable pace.",

He\u2019s probably just not telling you that now since he wants to you keep studying hard instead of thinking \u201coh all I need is another 60\u201d. Just focus on learning the material and stuff will work itself out.",
