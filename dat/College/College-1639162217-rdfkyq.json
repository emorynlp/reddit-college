  "text": "The title, what do you guys think? I\u2019m just curious as to see what everyone\u2019s view point is. I\u2019ve heard some of the shit you learn in college you don\u2019t even use in the real world (in some cases) or your job. I believe it really depends on the job you get I guess. Like I don\u2019t want a doctor to operate on me not knowing wtf they\u2019re doing lol. I\u2019m a sophomore in college going towards an economics degree & double minor. Again, just curious as to how all you college students think of cheating\n\nEdit: y\u2019all I don\u2019t condone cheating. I don\u2019t LIKE it. Just to be clear",

      "text": "I\u2019m a community college prof. The purpose of college is to learn skills and knowledge, not to get a grade, but unfortunately grades are what determine your future. Cheating is what happens when someone thinks they can\u2019t get a grade based on their own skills and knowledge, and values the grade more than they do the skills and knowledge. Honestly, if we could do away with grades entirely, and replace with actual feedback, that would help students\u2019 learning a lot more. (It\u2019d be a lot harder for profs though.)",

Professor also thought i was cheating, until I explained to him my situation, and also solved different variations of my test problems at ease when I didn\u2019t know they were from a test.",

      "text": "Interesting how many Redditors see cheating as common. I saw some cheating, but it was mostly confined to the small-scale homework (the assignments which are often just busy-work anyways), as it can be hard to cheat on many in-person exams or on a paper and not get caught. I mostly resided in the humanities departments (and some social sciences) in college though, where grades were determined 1/4 by active participation and debate, and 1/4 each by a paper. Hard to cheat on participation and hard to cheat on papers. Usually, if someone had the drive to actually cheat on a major exam, the amount of time one spent coming up with a way to cheat could usually be better spent actually studying.\n\nWill you need to know everything in college for a job? Absolutely not, but college is more than trade school writ large. Cheating, and the mindset that if a job doesn't require it who cares, negates the unique knowledges college can provide. I will probably never need to know the Quantity Theory of Money for any job, but I am a much more informed human because I do.",

I've been working on my BA for a few years (returning student, was PT for a while) and I still can't get over how much cheating goes on....and that was pre covid. There was a stupid simple project to put an income statement and balance sheet together, I say simple because the format and info was straight out of the book with pictures too! But my classmates were struggling with googling/chegging/quizlletting the exact answers. I know hardly anyone reads the book, but if they did, the solution was right there. \n\nOnce covid came around all this discussing came about anxiety levels and privacy concerns regarding proctored exams. Meanwhile in class group me/discords, it was all about faking anxiety and those other concerns to faculty so that they wouldn't use proctor software and the exam answers could be shared/used during g the exams. Yeah sure there were a lot of A's, but I was totally satisfied with my well earned B-.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not discounting that there are students with legitimate issues with anxiety, but I don't like how so many students took advantage of that. \n\nIt sucks, but it's life, cheating is out there. Good luck in real life though, because your thought process sometimes give you away.  I can start to see it in some of the other seniors I have class with during class discussions where you have to think on the spot.  \n\nTLDR: cheating is everywhere, but it'll hurt you down the road...so cliche. ikr.",

Let\u2019s just say I was soft and didn\u2019t know how to say no lol. When I did I would get called names and all that bullshit. But it\u2019s ridiculous to cheat when, like you said, the answer is right there. It\u2019s not only a waste of time but pointless. As for anxiety, I can understand that. And it sucks knowing people that don\u2019t have it use that excuse to their advantage. It\u2019s not fair to those who do have it. I have never had test anxiety, but ever since using lockdown browser for exams, I\u2019ve had it critically. I just think at some point it\u2019s inevitable to cheat in some cases, especially with really shitty professors. They\u2019re supposed to help you learn and take in the material and some just don\u2019t care enough.",

I think if you don\u2019t study at all that is a problem. However, if you want to use aid to fill in the gap of information you didn\u2019t study well, then it is fine.

Then when the pandemic hit and online classes came rolling. I took advantage with sites like chegg and multiple tabs.

Because you won\u2019t need your other classes like chem, sociology or some other random class you had to take just to fill a requirement. People in CS jobs use absolutely zero chemistry, sociology etc.\n\n The reason I don\u2019t recommend cheating is because it has a compound effect. If you start cheating in your CS class for example you may get used to cheating and solely relie on other peoples work. Which means you won\u2019t be learning and future classes will be hard af if not impossible to complete. \n\nTldr: Only cheat on the easy classes in your first two years at college that are unrelated to your major. If your a CS major then go ahead and cheat in your history, sociology etc classes that you don\u2019t need on the job.",

Unless you\u2019re in a very specific degree such as law or medicine, half the classes you take in college are nowhere near crucial to your education and are more or less taken to satisfy a gen Ed requirement. Cheating isn\u2019t cool and there are certainly very real consequences to it, but it\u2019s also pretty damn easy to get away with so long as you\u2019re not a belligerent fool about it. I guess we all have different morals and some people may think I\u2019m a scumbag, but at the end of the day I got my piece of paper that said I did all the stuff and that\u2019s all I really gave a fuck about once college started getting really grindy.",

Many don't in my experience (though I do know a few that do a good job). This completely undermines the goals of the class. Grades are handy because they provide a more transparent way of seeing how well you know something. Grades should reward \"bettering oneself\", they should reward going beyond the class syllabus and reading up/researching things that you found interesting. They should reward excellent comprehension of the material, ambition, dedication and research skills. If professors put more effort into giving higher quality assessments (like challenging exams, big projects/research tasks) then grades would align with the goal of getting students to \"better\" themselves.  \n\nIt's very hard to do this with a large class size unfortunately. For large class sizes, it would be better to have one big test or research project worth 100% of the grade as it reduces the amount of grading that professors have to do. \n\nThis is not me going after professors being \"lazy\". They have an insurmountable amount of other work to do. I just feel that high quality assessment should be rewarded far more in teaching than it currently is, given how important it is to stimulate learning.",
