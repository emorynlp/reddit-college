  "text": "hey guys, im 22, and have been in college for four years now (not consecutively, skipped a couple semesters for family/financial reasons, so i didn\u2019t even get that far into my original major for it to change drastically change how much time i would\u2019ve still been there) anyway, I\u2019ve since changed my life in order to prioritize finally graduating and moving on from college. the only problem is i recently changed my major from film to art. i have absolutely no experience in it, and i am mediocre/average at best. I\u2019ve been drawing since around age 12 but never thought i was good enough to seriously pursue a career in it. and i still really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve always had a passion for it, and eventually want to get into animation, n possibly become a freelance artist. im still not sure yet what my future looks like. today, my advisor asked me what are my goals, for becoming an artist. my real reason is just that i want to get better, and enjoyed my art classes way more (it used to be minor) than i did my film classes. i felt like i had the guidance, tools, and mentorship and it began to translate in my skills. i didn\u2019t say this to her, because she moreso meant career paths. im still not where i want to be, but her asking me that has given me doubts. is wanting to get better at something, and truly learn and understand a topic im v passionate about a good enough reason to pursue a degree in it? and is it too late for me, like in terms of being an adult who still doesn\u2019t really know how to draw. i know i shouldn\u2019t compare myself but there are kids in high school who draw their asses off and they\u2019re great. im not there yet, it just feels like i might be in over my head. any advice, comments, n opinions are welcome",
