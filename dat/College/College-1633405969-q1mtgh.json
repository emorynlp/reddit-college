  "text": "So I'm in a group for a financial accounting class and so far 2 of the people i'm working with are doing all of the work while barely talking to me. The only time I really hear from them is when they announce that they've finished a new part of the project or that they've sent it to the professor for review. I'll admit, I'm pretty shy and not doing super well in this class, but I'm trying to do my best. Every time I've tried suggesting ways to break up the work one girl would just come up with reasons it wouldn't work and go back to doing it all by herself. The other girl is doing all of the same work by herself as well. They basically just do everything alone, then compare answers and correct whatever doesn't match. I'm terrified f being \"that student\" who gets blamed for being lazy and not doing any of the work. I WANT to do work but they aren't working with me and I don't know where to start because I have no idea what they've already done. My professor for this class is really nice and he already knows that I'm struggling with some of the concepts of the class so I'm tempted to talk to him and tell him whats going on (this professor is also my advisor) but I just don't know if it's the right way to go about this. I'm honestly scared to try talking to my classmates because every time I've tried suggesting anything before it was shot down immediately and I just don't know if I can deal with it.",
