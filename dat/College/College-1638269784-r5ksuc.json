  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore health studies major taking 17 credits (I know, a lot ) and will possibly end up in mostly C\u2019s which is considered passing but will drop my GPA down from a 2.7 to even lower and a 3.0 is required to declare nursing as a major at my college. I am going to retake classes I have D\u2019s in next semester and over the summer along with just 13 credits this time. It just makes me so depressed that I can\u2019t even manage to get a B and a 3.0 GPA when it should be easy. I can\u2019t talk to my advisor because she\u2019s just going to discourage me and tell me to change my major like how she told me in the past. What do I do?",

I learned that spreading classes out makes it easier to manage all the work because when you take fewer classes, you can spend more time preparing for each individual class.",

I made mid-high A's in AP classes in high school essentially by just showing up and paying attention (and to a lesser extent in IB classes, though those were a lot more involved).\n\nSo I thought the same trend would track to college, with the added bonus that I would have to spend less than half the time in a classroom!  I was unaware of the implicit expectation that students should *at least* match their classtime with preparation and review outside of class, not counting time spent working on projects and papers.\n\nMy first college exam provided a rude awakening when the lectures only provided a skeletal outline of the material.",

If you also had Ds in your freshmen year, and your current Ds are in major subjects, it could be a sign you need to look in a different direction.  Hopefully, cutting your hours will help.  If it doesn't, however, I would rethink your current career plans.",
