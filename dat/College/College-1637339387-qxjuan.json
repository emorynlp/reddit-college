  "text": "This semester has been incredibly difficult for me. I have an A in the class, but I have been chronically late recently, and I don't believe I delivered a fantastic presentation. I have been failing to communicate with them, and as of today, I have just skipped class. I go to a small college, and there are not a lot of other profs who study her field within psych. I will have this same prof next semester. Thus I am wondering, is it possible to restore my reputation with them?",

The professor may be wondering what\u2019s going on, though. I would want you to reach out to me just to let me know you\u2019re okay. Others may be different, though.",
