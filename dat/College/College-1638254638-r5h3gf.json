  "text": "When I was younger I would become friends with others instantly. One minute we were strangers and the next minute we would spend the next few years hanging out together outside and in each other's houses. I would then meet new people along the way, and then they'd join in.\n\nFrom the point I became a teenager to when I went to college, though, I noticed that it was harder for me to get along with people. There was a certain \"barrier\" I felt towards people; and that includes people who were actively trying to get along with me.\n\nDoes anyone else relate?",

      "text": "I find that for most people, making friends as a child is far easier than as a teenager or as an adult. When you're young, you have less inhibitions, probably aren't as self conscious, and aren't really a complete \"person\" yet. As such, it's easy to just latch onto someone who likes the same video games as you or something grow with them at your side, coming into your own together. It's a lot harder as an adult because the people around you are so much more complicated and difficult to gauge at a glance, which is why for most college students, their best bet is joining a club.",

Before coming to uni I expected to be this extrovert who makes friends with everyone but then I realised it can affect my motivation too. Being around people who don't have the same aspirations or motivations as me can be bad. It's better to have few close friends than many unclose ones",

Nice people. I just wasn't willing to open up and become close to them. My social skills and self-esteem also just suck though so I always end up thinking they're just being nice to me bc I'm weird and awkward.",

When you and a person's  career paths/ hobbies are similar or somehow cross, there is a chance you will meet the person again and again. \nSocialization is a healthy practice and a human need therefore individuals are drawn to share impressions with others of similar condition about the aspects of life and experiences contributing to the overall evolution of humanity.\nI think the word friend is somewhat naive and belongs to childhood lexicon. Adults have peers with whom they interface reality and share experience thus making it more worthwhile and progressive.\nTherefore one should not aim at making friends but at surfing/ interfacing reality so as to keep up with the level of experience required.",
