A high enough number that hopefully OP and find what he/she wants but there are literally thousands of colleges in the US and I'd estimate the list definitely has less than 200.",

There 1-6 schools per state and a lot of states with a nice coast that aren\u2019t Cali. Appreciate the effort though!",

Also fairly close to St Augustine which also has beaches there.\n\nUniversity of South Florida (University of Tampa) is in Tampa, which is on the Gulf Coast\n\nUniversity of Florida is in Gainesville which is driving distance to Jacksonville (45 minutes to an hour, I think off the top of my head)\n\nFlorida A&M (Florida State University and Tallahassee Community College) is in Tallahassee, similar to Gainesville, the Gulf Coast is probably a drivable distance away but I don't know that for sure\n\nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University is in Daytona Beach, which is on the Atlantic Coast as well\n\nI'm not a surfer, so I don't know which areas are better for surfing, but pretty much any of the NROTC colleges or cross-town affiliates are either on the coast or easy driving to. The only one I'm hesitant on is Tallahassee because I'm not as familiar with that area",
