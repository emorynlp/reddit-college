  "text": "The first time I got approached about it (pre-covid on campus) I thought they were giving *us* some kind of token gift for finally graduating... but no, they suggest that you give $50+ more to this place where I had to take out tens of thousands of loans and pay about as much directly to them over the last 4-6 years? Is this common or is it just my school that has the gall to ask for this?",

      "text": "All schools do this, for two main reasons. First, long history shows that graduates who *start* donating *continue* donating. Second, there are a variety of situations in which the *percentage* of alumni who donate is important, even if they only gave $5.\n\nYou may well feel bitter about this, and depending on your college experience you may never give a dime. But *lots* of people do donate. I've been out of college 30+ years and still make a donation every year, and my parents (who graduated in the early 1960s) still make annual donations to their college as well.\n\nOne thing you might want to be aware of: if you do choose to donate you can designation your gift for *anything you want*. While fundraisers want \"unrestricted\" gifts they can use for whatever they want, you can designate yours to a particular fund, a student group, an academic program, literally anything.  I, for example, would never give an unrestricted gift because I don't want my money being wasted on football or a nice new office for the president. So I restrict them to one of the departments I graduated from-- and I know they get the money each year, which they use to help fund a winter event for students.",

That leads to faux-peer-pressure things (that are really organized by the school, not your peers) like senior and class gifts.",

Most professors have PhDs and that\u2019s 8 years of loans they need to pay off as well so they  need to make high salaries to make it worth it. Most big colleges have hundreds and hundreds of professors. Then they also have to pay people in dining services, dozens (and in my school probably hundreds since it\u2019s so big and there are so many places to eat) and hundreds of people serving the food, and the hundreds of people cleaning it up. Then they have to pay for transportation, they have to pay for busses, bus drivers, gas, and any sort of repairs the buses may need. They have to pay an advising staff, administration staff, financial staff, dorming staff, they have to pay for hundreds of janitors to keep that huge campus clean. And labs are insanely expensive, the cost of the equipment alone for one lab can be in ten of thousands of dollars, and most schools have dozens of labs. They have to pay for property maintenance, keeping the grass cut, cleaning up the snow, removing garbage etc.. They also have to pay for computers and library stuff, and the SA gives money to clubs as well. Most schools have on campus pharmacies and doctors too for sick students which costs a lot of money to maintain. Universities are almost mini cities. It takes a lot to keep them running.",

But again, you seem pretty stupid, so let me explain this to you. \n\nOpportunities are *not* business transactions. Me buying a whopper is *not* the same as being give an opportunity to obtain knowledge and skills that have gotten me into my field and allowed me to have the money to do the things i mentioned. \n\nThe fact that you disagree is irrelevant. Do you know why its irrelevant? It because *you* are irrelevant.

I've been one of the top complainers about cost of tuition at my school, (and my scholarship package is ridiculously good in comparison to others)  but working in the call center and seeing how difficult it can be to convince the few alumni who do donate to and  the fact that my school used all of its funds and endowment on an emergency fund for students after campus was closed showed me how much we overestimate what these schools bring in. Yes, the cost of college in this country is ridiculous, but many private schools offer crazy good financial aid packages to students which can drive up the sticker price. We also end up utilizing more school provided resources over the years than we realize. I was a commuter at my college but I still  have access to every free Microsoft, streaming, Google suite, ect platform they give us and at least for my school we'll be able to continue to utilize all of those services after we graduate until we die.  Just because we don't always see or choose to utilize the services our college offers us doesn't mean they're not still dropping money on it. it depends on the school overall, but it can help to be a little more understanding and truly look into what your college is providing you to better understand the cost associated. Also don't forget the scholarship kids! Even if you don't want to utilize the offered services the money still helps with financial aid and I know at least for my college over half of the students would be unable to attend without the generous support of the few alumni who do give back. (Also you can write off whatever you give on your taxes if you decided to take that route)",

              "text": ">Maybe universities should tighten their belt a little and have an emergency fund.\n\nYou should actually look at the budget of a non-$$$ college sometime. Mine has an annual operating budget of about $100M.  The large majority of that is labor costs-- salaries/wages for employees, including student workers. Of what's left most goes to operating/maintaining the physical campus and providing the key infrastructure  (like IT) that makes it work. We have no bowling alley and it's been years since we had even a third-tier act on campus. But our price tag is still almost $70K this year-- and in turn we provide enough scholarship money so the average student pays about $30K. That doesn't happen without massive donations from alums and others.\n\nWe also have an emergency fund of about $60M. We used 1/10th of that this spring when students left and residence halls closed. If we aren't on campus in the fall we'll use half of what's left just to keep online classes going. If we're \"closed\" all year from COVID the reserves will likely be exhausted. Should that happen, you'll see hundreds of colleges in the US close forever-- not because they wasted their revenues on Imagine Dragons but because they are non-profits that ultimately depend on tuition and room/board revenues-- and annual giving --to fund their operations.",

More of a tables turned scenario.\n\nThe crux of my point however doesn't have to do with the impact of COVID-19 on university revenue, because it's been happening for many years before shutdowns happened.\n\nMy universities love to preach about how \"we're a family\" and \"We want you to be happy and successful\" before and after you attend. But while you're there they will nickle and dime you for as much as you're worth with absolutely zero remorse. \n\nI spent $300 on a parking pass but was given tickets for daring to park within 5 miles of the stadium before a football game. \n\nI was required to buy a $200 textbook that my professor wrote that was never even once used in class, but proving we purchased it was required before having access to homework. \n\nI had a suicidal friend sent home from the university counselor because \"If you're able to get dressed and seek help it must not be that bad\"\n\nIf I wanted to walk at graduation I was required to rent a cap and gown for $80 that I had to return within two days of graduation or I would be charged $250.\n\nI have to pay $20 every time I want to send a PDF of my transcripts anywhere. A damn PDF that is sent by an automated system costs $20.\n\nAnd if at any point I lapse in my payments to the University I'll be kicked out without a second thought by the administration. But that's OK! Honestly there's no problem with that because a University is just a glorified corporation, we're making a business transaction and I need to hold up my end of the bargain. But you can't possibly expect me to spend 6 years being treated like a customer and then to suddenly act like we're a family that cares about each other. I've never had my apartment complex ask me for a donation, why should my University? We had a business transaction, and now it's done. Don't call me.",

That's not how *my* university works, nor a great many others of which I'm aware. But yes, there are certainly places like that our there...I got my Ph.D. from one years ago. And I've never given them a dime, whereas I've been donating to my undergraduate alma mater annually since that Good Ol' Senior Gift over 30 years back. Because they did care, they didn't nickle and dime me, and they certainly didn't think of themselves as a business or me as a customer.",

The point of the endowment is to have a source of funding in perpetuity. That's why the draw is generally only about 5% and why it is risky to up the draw in times like this. If your fund has lost value due to a weak stock market, and you draw on it more heavily, there will be less to draw on when times are normal again.\n\nHarvard already uses its endowment generously providing full cost scholarships to anyone making under (I think) 100K.",

I've managed non-profits, and worked in a university setting for years, including taking courses on university finances. \n\nYour point is fair, I did oversimplify it, but if you used it in the manner you are suggesting, it would still shrink year-over-year. Their 10-year return was about 8.5% from what I can find. The endowment is 40b, and their annual budget is 4.5B. That means each year it is growing by 8.5%, but being spent at ~11%, so it wouldn't be 40 years, but it wouldn't be forever.",
