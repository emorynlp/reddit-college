  "text": "The SCO is hiring and the application form would end in 2hrs. i am currently working on it but im having second thoughts. \n\nI am joining just because i want it on my resume. im in 3rd year college now and have little to no experience with working and anything so you could imagine how blank my resume would be. I list down the pros and cons about this and cons are really weighing me down. This is a really big risk for me too because i am not great at socializing which is why i wanted to push it more. But the thought of being a burden and not completing my role as best as i can is making my head hurt. i would really like to be a member, yet, i don\u2019t know if i should do it. Help.",
