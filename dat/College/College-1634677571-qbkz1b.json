      "text": "Baked Potatoes - rinse them, stab them with a fork (or else they explode). Cook them in the microwave for 7-12 minutes depending on size and number, flipping them over every 3 or 4. Put whatever you want, our go to in college was butter, sour cream, salt and pepper and cheese.\n\nRefried Bean Dip - one can Rosarita refried beans (we like the Chile lime ones), 1 cup salsa, a handful of cheese, lime juice and cilantro to taste. Heat for 2 minutes in the microwave. Add a spoonful of sour cream. Heat for 2 more minutes.\n\nSriracha chicken - make a bunch of rice and chicken (just buy chicken breasts and cook them in a pan or you can boil it in the microwave). Cube the chicken and mix it in the rice. In a bowl make as much sauce as you want by mixing 1/3 honey, 1/3 soy sauce, 1/3 Sriracha sauce.\n\nEggs - scramble them, fry them, boil them, omelet them. Scrambling is great because you can add whatever you want (potatoes, onions, bacon, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.) and don't have to have too many skills.",

          "text": "Those aren't baked potatoes, those are microwaved potatoes. Since they have an oven and grill, I'd recommend either actually baking the potatoes, or wrapping them in foil and grilling them with something (I often do this with steak). But yes, you still need to stab them with a fork (and if you grill them with foil, wrap them first and then stab them through the foil).",
