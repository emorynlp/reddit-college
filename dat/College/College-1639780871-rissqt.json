  "text": "Well guess who that happened to!? YES! ME!! Well fuck this bullshit crap! I asked my chem teacher about the labs and report, he didn\u2019t respond, and I got a low grade on those because he couldn\u2019t fucking bother to respond? My math teacher? I barely passed the class, not knowing what Taylor series or McLaurin series are because of him!!! I barely handed in my essay on time because my English teacher wouldn\u2019t respond to give me an extension because I\u2019ve been sick with the cold and sleeping all day to which I spend the last half hour of the day powering through the essay! So how has your semester been??????????",
