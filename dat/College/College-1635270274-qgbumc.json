  "text": " \n\nHey Everyone! \n\nI am a freshmen this year and to be honest I have been finding it a lot harder at college than I thought it would be. I was really excited to be going to college to make friends and have lots of fun but that hasn\u2019t really been the case. I have been feeling very lonely and sad, and I am really confused how people are already in their cliques and everything. This all started last month for me once I moved in. I was fine the first week at school but then I started missing home and I was crying all the time because I wanted to go back. Literally after the first day of college I went back home and cried that I wanted to dropout from college. I went back obviously and gave it a second try. Many people just told me to stay there for the week and things will get better, but they didn\u2019t. On top of this my roommate didn\u2019t make things any better for me. I can\u2019t say she is the worst roommate in the world but she ain\u2019t the best either. She has been really two faced with me I feel, like she acts nice to me when she wants to, needs something from me, or when she isn\u2019t around her friends, but besides that she totally ignores me and the way she acts isn\u2019t nice at all. The people that she calls her friends know are because I introduced her to them, and she didn\u2019t even include me. I don\u2019t mean to sound petty but I invited her because she was feeling homesick and lonely so I thought it would be a great way for both us to meet some people, but I guess she just wanted me out of the picture. A huge art was I just had high expectations but got crushed once I saw the reality. Just the whole month of September was a mess and I started to become really homesick to the point I didn\u2019t want to step foot on campus again. I commented a lot back and forth from home and now have overcome all that. After I started meeting some people and making friends I guess, but when I see others I always feel so lonely and sad because things aren\u2019t really going the way I thought. I don\u2019t get how people already have their cliques and everything. Also, I don\u2019t if its just a me thing but I feel people aren\u2019t as friendly because no one ever wants to talk. I always feel like I have to initiate the conversation. The one thing that was sort of going well for me were my classes because I enjoyed them and found them easy as long as I kept up with the class and did the work. But with my obsession for wanting friends I have started falling bacon my classes as well. On top of all of this I have been feeling so exhausted and don\u2019t have the energy to cope with everything. I am really struggling right now trying to make friends, do school work, and focus on my own physical and mental health. Tbh I am just a complete mess, and don't know what to do. I just was wondering if anyone is also feeling the same way or felt the same way during and what did you guys do to help overcome this feeling of loneliness and sadness.",
