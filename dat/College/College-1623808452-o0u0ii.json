  "title:": "Is anyone else feeling incredibly excited for in person classes in the fall?",
  "text": "I'm a rising junior so I got one year pre-covid and then all of last year was online (I went back to campus in January tho). I love college, it's been the best stage of my life so far. But the actual academics of it were far from ideal sophomore year when everything was online (I'm very much one of those people who doesn't do well in remote learning situations). I enjoyed learning and my classes in general so much freshman year, and whenever I look at my schedule for the fall semester or even just think about walking from building to building, I feel this really weird rush of excitement lol. Almost like I can't wait for the summer to end and for fall to start... even though I have exciting things going on this summer too. I know I'm romanticizing the idea and when I'm actually walking to my 8 am class in December with a muffin clutched in my freezing hands I will rethink these feelings, but in the moment, right now, I am so, so hype. Anyone relate?",

I mostly stayed on campus, not too interested in venturing out. After over a year of online schooling, I've decided to turn over a new leaf and truly take advantage of my university's location! Time to truly tour all of the sights!  :)",

You also can't go to clubs, events, use the tools that you are paying for on campus, etc. I feel like you lost a huge part of the college experience since college is more than taking a class and passing it.",

All in-person classes don\u2019t resume until January 2022. I really wish I could get on campus though. Just stepping off the bus and into the welcome building is like a massive dose of serotonin. \n\nOne course I picked up this fall though is this massive multi-modal transportation field study which I\u2019m looking forward to.

Best part of my day was taking the train home. Online is so nice for me because I can learn at my own pace and I don\u2019t have to deal with other students distracting me or whatever. Since that first year, I\u2019ve transferred into a CC but don\u2019t see any reason to have in person classes unless I have a lab. Won\u2019t go back in person until Fall 2022 when I go back to the university",

All my classes this fall are in person and I cannot wait to go back. I\u2019m just hoping covid cases stay way down so that it doesn\u2019t spontaneously switch back to online.

But yes, I'm happy that you get to go back to in person classes after the majority of people have wasted a year of their life.\n\nHonestly, 90% of the people I've talked to who took online classes say they absolutely hate it, learned nothing, and view the past year as an absolute failure. Even children were having trouble in their elementary school classes. How is this going to effect the future? People who were pro-lockdown need to be punished in some way. They ruined education for millions of kids among other things.",

Tip: Make friends with ambitious people.  \nOh, and the friends you make in college will last your life... your high school friends, not so much. It is much more difficult to make good friends in your mid & late 20s because most everyone has a serious significant other by then. In college you can hang out every day.",

I know \"it's not the destination, it's the journey\" (or something), but it makes me feel so incompetent. \nAlso, I have no friends and I don't really have anything (or anyone) to go back to (though I do like my uni's town, it's stunning)\n\nOn the other hand, HOO BOY am I bad at online classes! Jesus Christ, I can't wait until I can be in my professor's face all office hour long in person so I can ask them questions properly.\n\nYou know, sometimes I feel this hyped too, thinking about it. Because it's something new and I feel like I'm actually making progress. But then it goes away when I think about all of the things I wanted to get away from before lol",

Freshman year was the best period of my life until COVID hits and although there have been nice parts since, and I'm so excited and ready to go back to a normal college experience -- hurrying to class, lecture halls, studying in the library, eating with friends. I absolutely cannot wait.",
