  "title:": "Moving to a different state while taking online classes",
  "text": "I currently live with my parents. My university (in California) is mostly offering online classes, and all of the classes I need for my major are online. I plan on temporarily moving to a new state (New York) in the next six months for an internship. Would I have to notify the school, even if I would still have my parents house as my permanent address? In general, would I be expected to pay out of state tuition, even though I\u2019ll be coming back? I can\u2019t find any information on my school\u2019s website. If it matters, I\u2019m currently not on financial aid and am paying for school with personal loans.",
