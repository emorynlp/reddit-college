  "text": "Hi!! So I\u2019m in college rn am always scrambling last minute and have no motivation until the day of or days after! Im constantly getting extensions and often even hand stuff in after the extension has passed. That being said none of my teachers have deducted marks from handing things in late\u2014or atleast not significantly.. I got a 0 on one small project but other than that even handing things a week in late I can still get a 70+.. kinda good yet concerning because I\u2019m transitioning to Uni in the next year and don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m ready for the real thing, lol. I think I have to address my maybe undiagnosed adhd or something else but anyway I wanted to hear ppls input.",
