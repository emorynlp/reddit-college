  "text": "Been struggling in school recently, and last semester too I suppose. Online schooling does not agree with me as I am already a bad student so without having in person accountability I can\u2019t keep myself on track nearly as much. I have been slipping in a few classes this semester but the others have more forgiving teachers and I think I can come back fairly well, but one is at a 37%. Since classes end early December is it realistic to think I can return and pass or will I have to drop this one?",
