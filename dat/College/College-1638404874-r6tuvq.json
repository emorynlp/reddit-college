  "text": "My wife goes to a school called San Joaquin Valley College in California. It's a for-profit private junior college. I tried to change her password because it still had the default one. When she got to school the next day, her teachers all told her that isn't allowed to change her password. Has anyone every heard of this? It seems rather sketchy...",

Why would they log in like they\u2019re the student? Would that mean they have complete control over your email? Can they write and send emails on your account? \n\nMy university requires us to change our password every 6 months. \n\nAlso here\u2019s a general tip: don\u2019t go to a for-profit college.",

From what I understand, they needed the default password so that the IT department could help that student in the event they needed help logging into their iPad. I told my wife if she needs help, I'll be her IT guy. They don't need her personal password... My university U.C. Riverside also requires regular password changes and mandatory 2FA.",
