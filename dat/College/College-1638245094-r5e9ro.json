Dropped the lowest grades? How many papers did you have to write? What kind of questions were on the test/quizzes? That\u2019s just me though.",

      "text": "RMP is a gamble. I still use it, but you have to read through the comments and see if there's a pattern like \"only reads slides\" or \"projects are vague\". Professor patterns are key to figuring out their teaching style. For example I do horribly with \"slide readers\" so even if they have a good score I might keep them as a second option if I see that as a trending theme. You can't really take any reviews at face value, as people are more likely to leave a review if they didn't have a good time. Getting a teacher is a calculated risk, so even if you get a 3+ professor they can still be crap. Conversely you can be stuck with a 2-3 professor and really enjoy them. I've experienced both cases.\n\nFor example, I got a professor with a 4 rating and he was the worst teacher I've ever met. I swear to this day that he was buffering RMP with artificial scores. Our group me in class unanimously agreed that he was a garbage teacher. But I've also had a teacher who was swapped out at the last minute for someone I picked and they had a 2.3 on RMP. They ended up being a wonderful professor.\n\nSo, YMMV. Some people will leave reviews because they did poorly or because they're bitter, but it's easy to pick those out and ignore them. I still think it's a valuable tool but a lot of the results are left up to interpretation. \n\ntl;dr RMP is good, but you can't take it at face value.",

Usually I just ignore it but it just means I have to delve deeper than just the rating to see if they're actually bad or if somebody is just projecting their anger after failing.",
