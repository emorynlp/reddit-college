  "text": "On mobile.\n\nI'm a highschool student who takes college course for free through a state program. These course count for both college and high school credits and GPA. \n\nI took an online intro to programming course this fall semester. I had some mental health bumps along the way, and turned in a lot of assignments late. But I overall did well, and my professor focused more on the quality of the work than when I turned it in. \n\nWell, being behind on everything else in the class meant that I was behind on my final project (which is worth like 30% of our grade). I needed an extra day, and the professor agreed to give me one for slightly reduced credit. \n\nThen shit seriously hit the fan. I got stuck on something. I was almost done, but I edited my code somewhere and it stopped working. I couldn't seem to find where the issue was. I was stuck. \n\nI felt like I couldn't reach out for help because it was already technically late. \n\nQueue to the sleepless nights and panic attacks for a week, trying everything, nothing working. \n\nI refused to turn it in because I would get a B on the assignment as it was, and that would bring my grade down to a B, ruining my 4.0 GPA. \n\nI was a mess. And I was afraid, so I didn't check my email. \n\nOf course, when I finally did check my email there was one from my professor. He kindly informed me that he had yet to recieve my final project, and that he would still accept it for partial credit before Tuesday, as grades were due Wednesday morning. I had a D- in the class.\n\nI was reading it Wednesday evening. I had no idea. The chatter in my head cut out for the first time in a week. \n\n*you idiot* \n\nI emailed him and turned in the project as it was. I think he might be on winter break because he hasn't responded. \n\nI had a 4.0 GPA, I took all the hardest classes, I was looking at a hefty scholarship. Then I got stupid. Now everything is gone. My dream school is gone. My college GPA is shit. \n\nEven my nerdy best friends would disown me if they knew. My boyfriend and my parents will be so disappointed. \n\nI ruined everything. \n\nWhat do I do?",

      "text": "Things happen. The best you can do is be forgiving of yourself and try to move forward. \n\nYou don\u2019t know your grade yet. It sounds like your professor wants to work with you and help you out, so hopefully that D- will go up with partial credit. If not, you can always retake the class. Many colleges will replace the grade on your transcript. YMMV for high school GPAs.\n\nAs for college admissions, one bad grade on an otherwise pretty strong transcript will not screw you. Yes, it may make things more difficult if you\u2019re shooting for an Ivy League or something like that, but it\u2019s far from the end of the world. You\u2019ll still have good options and probably still scholarships on the table. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, my friend graduated high school with a strong downward trend in grades, got a lot of Cs and a D in junior/senior year, and ended up with a barely 3.0 GPA. Guess what? They\u2019re on a full ride at my university right now. All but $100 of their cost is covered, and they\u2019re doing great. Your high school mistakes won\u2019t haunt you forever.\n\nIt sounds like you are a really academically driven student with a similar community of friends and family. If their view of you will change completely with 1 grade, they\u2019re no real friends. If you were in their place, would you disown them?",
