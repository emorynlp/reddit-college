  "text": "So my professor for my kinesiology class decided that if you don\u2019t pass 10/12 quizzes with an 80% or higher, you are not \u201celigible\u201d to take the final exam. What\u2019s worse, is that it\u2019s a big fat ZERO in the grade book and is the reason why I am failing. Now my question is\u2026.can she even do this? \nI mean in all my years of school Iv never been told I can\u2019t take the final exam. And anything close to that was that I had a good grade so I didn\u2019t have to take it as a reward. \nI contacted academic affairs but I thought I bring it to Reddit.",

                  "text": "Do not go to the god damn Dean. If one more student says \"go The Dean!!!\" on this subreddit one more time, I will continue to be generally annoyed.\n\nThe order of operations in this situation is to *first* talk to your professor and clearly state your case. If, after exhausting all discussion, you've been shut down, and you still feel you're in the right, *forward your original communications* to the Chair along with a message stating why you feel the matter has not been correctly dealt with. The Chair will probably ask to meet with you and the professor together. If that mediated resolution fails, and only if you essentially think some kind of law has been violated, then maybe you can look on the website and see who's next on the list. At my institution, that's an Associate Dean (also may be the person to go to if the Chair is your professor), not The Dean(TM). Check your website. \n\nEverybody in this whole chain, from your professor on up, generally very strongly dislikes getting emails like this:\n\nTo: Professor\ncc: Student's Advisor, Chair, Dean, Provost, University President, State Governor, President of the United States Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierres, Mom\nSubject: Help\n\nHi Ms Professor,\n\nI don't think I should be failing plz fix it ur being very unfair by not giving me an A\n\n\nAnd while that's the most extreme case, even when the complaint may be well-founded, everybody hates being left out of the loop and hearing back from the top. In almost all cases like these, the person you ultimately need to convince is your professor, and if they don't want to, they almost never have to. Putting them off by immediately going over their head* generally will only hurt you.\n\n*This advice applies to grade-related matters. If your professor has done something worse than assess that you have earned a failing grade, you should seek out other appropriate resources.",

Same goes for the final. Labs generally have the same requirement too: fail the lab and you fail the entire course. You can't just fail major components and make up for it in another component. All are important and you need to pass all of them, separately. And this is where pretty much all finals are worth 45-80%.\n\nYou also need to remember that finals are not an internal thing. They are conducted in purpose built university buildings with third-party invigilators, at the university level. You sit exams with hundreds of students from other courses at the same time, in the same room. Your professor/TA is not in the room with you and has no contact with your class during the exam.

It is not okay to pretend this is an OK thing for a professor to do unless it is explicitly stated in the syllabus, just as jobs and grants have their clearly stated requirements to be able to be considered. The equivalent of what this student is experiencing is buying tickets to the amusement park expecting to be able to enjoy the entire park, only to find out that once your in the park the park supervisor has made a requirement that in order to ride any of the rides you must pass a physical exam prior to entering the park and no reentry is allowed if you exit. So now you are at Disney and you have nothing to show for it. This is like taking a class, a policy change is implemented that is detrimental to a students grade. For example, can\u2019t take final unless 10/12 quizzes are taken, which mind you is 83 % of available quiz points, so not failing by any means.  if this change happened after two quizzes had already passed, it is purposely deceptive. These classes cost A LOT of money. We are talking about a couple of thousand of dollars a credit hour. Another example, Go lease a new car and drive a couple years. Whoops a year into your contract it\u2019s been updated by the leasing company and you find out if you miss 2 out of the 12 oil changes, having very specific requirements on when you can take I mean get these oil changes then you owe the rest of the balance on the car AND you must return it. See what I\u2019m trying to say? Imagine still being a student, in their shoes and if this happened to you? Syllabi are created to be binding agreements between professors and students and if changes are made it must be clearly known and an amended document must be made available.",

I brought this up already. \n\nYou already said you can't fit all the material in a 1.5 hour exam. So if you want to truly assess a students performance you would weigh each individual unit assessment at a greater degree than the final. If a student flunks a unit or cannot take a unit assessment due to outside factors then you allow throwing out one unit assessment from the scoring. If you don't like that option then there are other options to pursue.\n\nI don't care about what the supposed standards are. I call bullshit out when I hear bullshit. Why not create a superior standard? Not doing so IS putting yourself in a box. And I don't even have a doctorate degree...",
