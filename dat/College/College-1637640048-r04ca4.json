  "text": "I feel horrible, I\u2019ve never failed a paper before. To be honest my head has been everywhere lately and I guess it\u2019s showing in my work. My paper was way to busy and needed to be cut down. I did put a lot of energy into it but my execution was terrible and I feel awful.",

      "text": "It\u2019s understandable to feel disappointed, especially when you invest a lot of energy into something, but please remember that one bad paper is not an accurate reflection of what you\u2019re capable of. Writing is a process and a skill you develop over time. It\u2019s normal and even expected that you\u2019ll make mistakes. As long as you\u2019re willing to use this as an opportunity to learn and improve, that\u2019s all that matters.",
