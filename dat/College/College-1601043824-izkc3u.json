Anyone feel like their friend group is starting to slip away? It\u2019s really scary because I only have like 8 friends and I don\u2019t even talk to 4 of them anymore. Am I overthinking?",

They\u2019re nothing like middle school/high school friendships where you can just hang out everyday after school and on the weekends. They\u2019re more than likely in the same boat as you and trying to find time to spend with friends like you too. I have college friends that I speak to way less than I do with the people from my home town, but every now and then we find time to get a drink together. Patience is the virtue!",

The scheduling with this can be an issue, but it\u2019s also a good way to force introverted people (like myself) to reach out and stay connected.\n\nA lot of people have suggested co-op video games and I definitely second that as well. Sometimes these kinda things just work as good background noise while you chat and keep in touch too.\n\nTotally normal to feel like people are slipping away at a time like this. You just gotta remember they *are* your friends and even after a few days/weeks/months of no contact they\u2019ll still be the same people and it\u2019s always possible to reconnect and catch up!",

I also began seeing my therapist every month rather than every four, and there's nothing wrong with needing a therapist or mental health help in general. Most recently, I reconnected with some childhood school friends from my hometown who I'd outgrown after my first year of university. They came into the city and we hung out, had fun like the years of silence between the last hangout never happened.",

In the midst of COVID I also transferred universities so it's been an even bigger struggle to keep in touch with the handful of friends from my old school, while also trying to virtually make new friends. It's scary to feel like you're losing people, but I think once we're all back in person you'll reconnect with them. Life is crazy right now, y'know?\n\nI saw some other people recommend playing games and doing video chats, those are super great ideas! Netflix party is surprisingly fun, just did one for the first time the other night. Jackbox games, Minecraft multiplayer (if anyone needs help setting up a server feel free to shoot me a DM, I can recommend a few sites!), Among Us, the list goes on. Quarantine has definitely brought out some of the possibilities for long distance socialization.",

It's not that I can't reach out to them, but we went into different paths in our lives (many of them attended comm. college or went straight to work). And since I live on campus, I am really engrossed in the school atmosphere and the friends I made at campus anyways to find time to keep up with them. I think a big factor of maintaining friends is geographic distance. If you live close together or have an opportunity to meet up with them often, then the friendship is much more likely to be sustained. Of course right now it's hard because nobody can go anywhere. But real friends will find ways to keep in touch no matter the distance\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you feel like your friends are slipping away :( You can message some of them a simple greeting! Something like, How's everything going recently?\" Then you ccan ask them further about what they replied to generate a conversation.",

              "text": "omg you're not alone in this at all. Even when I do manage to see people, like go on distanced walks or facetime, it sometimes still feels like we're not fully connecting, or they're only talking to me because they're bored or feel obligated. I also think that having a 'squad' is overrated- it's okay to have individual relationships that fulfill different needs for you! Hope you can find some peace with this.",

                  "text": "Really nice comment. I agree with you on the \"feeling obligated to talk\" part. I think this is partly because of all of the technology that have connects us. Any of us can easily be  reached through social media or texting. While it's quite amazing that we can talk to a friend in mere seconds via a text message, the fact that *we have the means* to do that makes it seem like you 'have' to keep up with them on a certain level/frequency or else you're not putting in \"enough\" effort. Or maybe that's just me",
