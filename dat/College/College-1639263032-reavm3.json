  "text": "I'm currently studying Archaeology in Sweden. I've been interested in the subject since I was a kid and it has since become my biggest passion. I've for a long time felt that **this** is what I want to do in life, in the sense of doing research as a professor rather than just doing fieldwork.  \n\n\nI've always heard that the job market is really and I mean really tough. That you really aren't going to have fun once you've graduated. But this applies to the majority of archaeologists who mainly do fieldwork. Since I want to do scientific research this wont really be that big of an issue. It would take me 7-8 years to graduate.   \n\n\nI'm just wondering if you think I should go for it?",

Hint: The answer is the most diligent, dedicated, passionate archaeologist (or the president\u2019s godchild, but some things are out of your control).\n\nAnother approach: Imagine you coming across this post ten years from now. How do you think you\u2019d feel if you don\u2019t/hadn\u2019t gone for it?\n\nLast one: Do you realize just how few people have the opportunity to make a living doing something they are passionate about?",

      "text": "The job market being tough and not having fun applies THE MOST to positions in academia. \n\nThere was an article a few years back by a guy named Doug Rocks-Macqueen who found you\u2019re more likely to die of lung cancer than get an academic position as an archaeologist. \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure what the situation is like for archaeology in Sweden at the moment, I know it\u2019s slightly better than most places but in general academia and particularly archaeology these days is pretty rough. \n\nYou\u2019ll need to have a very very clear path of what you want to do, with whom you want to work, and how you plan on doing that. You\u2019ll also need to find a site or group of sites that you work on during the summer for your research. Or you\u2019ll need to find a museum, archive, or database that is willing to hand over material for your research. \n\nThe best thing you can do is start early getting Teaching Assistant positions, getting your name on publications, going to and presenting at conferences and building up your resume. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to scare you off or anything but people often have major misconceptions about careers in archaeology. I know dozens of people who have finished their PhDs hoping for academic jobs and are either unemployed living with their parents or are working miserable adjunct/part-time teaching jobs or just non-archaeological positions. \n\nAlso, when people say \u201cyou have to be passionate about archaeology because it\u2019s not about the pay\u201d they mean it. So if you\u2019re passionate about it, don\u2019t mind having a lot of money, and you\u2019re ready to really work hard to get there then you should go for it.",
