  "text": "Hi! I am a senior in high school planning on majoring in biology. With this, I ask if in a bio degree are you required to take any English classes? I have already taken ENC1101 and ENC1102 and I am currently taking AP Literature. Does literature even matter in a bio degree? Is it a waste of time to take this course? is it part of the requirements for the degree? Thank you so much.",

Whether the 2 classes you took meet that requirement can only be determined by the college you attend.  \n\nFor general education requirements, there is no \"one size fits all\" answer.  College websites will often list each course one must take for each major.  Looking on the sites of schools you are considering attending will give you the answer.",
