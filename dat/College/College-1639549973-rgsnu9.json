  "text": "I have not been doing well in college really ever since I\u2019ve gotten there two years ago. I am near being kicked out and to be honest I\u2019m scared on one end but another end of me is barely interested in it like I do what to earn a degree and move on but except for a few health and life class I\u2019ve taken I\u2019ve either failed or done mediocrely in most others. I feel like I\u2019m trying to keep a front up for my parents and family and I hate it so much. I\u2019m so lost and do not know what to do anymore I feel like I\u2019m letting my life slip away and I am just lost",

      "text": "For the first question it\u2019s a pretty good job. Just beware of the workload and the people both customers and coworkers but this varies by location. My pharmacy is really busy so what I\u2019ve mentioned is up to it\u2019s extremes but it\u2019s a good job and it\u2019s always room for advancement. \n       When I\u2019m not working I\u2019m really into music and love playing bass guitar. I also like to listen to history videos as well as ones on anthropology.",
