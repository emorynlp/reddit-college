  "text": "I (19M Freshman ) started this semester and focused on settling in with my peers, thinking about girls, how to manage my schedule, and on other things, expect my classes. \n\nI did pay attention and tried to learn, but it was at almost October that I realized I wasn\u2019t studying that much, or paying attention to the classes.\n\nI decided to stop drinking as much coffee. To take notes on my note book. To finish all my homework and readings, but by that time i feel like it was too late. I got a hold of most classes, but the first missed months were clinical, and im feeling their loss. \n\nNow finals are coming up, my grades aren\u2019t the best and im not confident with the material. Im studying as much as i can but i feel like it wont be enough.",

      "text": "I think the best thing you can do is just be positive. Try to get through the finals as best you can. If you do well, awesome! If not, like the other person said you can always try next semester. Thankfully with college there\u2019s a bit more flexibility. Just believe in yourself and try to push yourself early to keep up with the school work so you\u2019ll be good throughout the classes. I wish you all the best, you got this!!",
