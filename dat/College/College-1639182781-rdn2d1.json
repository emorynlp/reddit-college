      "text": "With my undergraduate- I worked a full time job while going to school full time. At that time (2015)- I was getting paid 13 in an office, I could only afford one meal a day and sometimes not even that. I lived in a one bedroom that was 700 for rent, without anything included. The volume of work I was doing was manageable, because you get used to the routine (assuming you have the same work schedule every week). \n\nI often ask myself how I would have made it work during these times and with the current market and rent, especially in NYC- idk if it\u2019s doable. The highest paying job I ever had was bartending- easily 200-300 a night and on a very busy beach bar. That\u2019s probably the route I would take though it is extremely exhausting and hard work. I think you should look up the areas you\u2019re interested in renting from and see if it is realistic. Sorry I really hate to be the asshole, but it is soo crazy out here rn. I feel so bad for everyone that has to rent rn (me included)- they are jacking things up so much. \n\nAnother option would be to take out the max amount of loans offered to you each semester. Your refund will give you a few thousand each semester if you do that. But I will warn you- this accumulates quickly and can be a huge burden. You may look into your career option offering loan forgiveness after 10 years of qualifying payments. If you call fafsa, they can be more specific. From what I know you have to work either for the government, in education, or for a nonprofit. \n\nGood luck to you. I hope the market settles down by that time for everyone\u2019s sake.",
