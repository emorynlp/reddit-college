  "title:": "My boyfriend is an aerospace engineering student and gets A\u2019s without studying. How?",
  "text": "I\u2019m on mobile so excuse the formatting. My boyfriend goes to an expensive private college. He was a mechanical engineering major and recently switched to aerospace. I\u2019m a senior and he\u2019s a junior. The whole time he\u2019s been in college he\u2019s aced every exam. He has straight A\u2019s and literally never studies. His exams, however, are open note for every test. He gets to use all his notes. The content still looks very difficult. It looks like a foreign language. I\u2019m so proud of him and how smart he is. I can\u2019t wait to see what his future holds and hope I can be a part of it too. That being said, I\u2019m totally jealous of his natural talent! \n\nI\u2019m an allied health science major. I struggled through anatomy and physiology, organic chem, and microbiology because it was a lot of info at once. I\u2019m not great at studying and lack time management. I still was able to pull A\u2019s in a&p and orgo I. Microbiology was rough and the professor was actually let go last semester for repeated complaints from students. Just a little bit of information so you guys can understand why I\u2019m asking. \n\nI\u2019m definitely envious of his ability to ace everything. How does he do it? I thought engineering was supposed to be one of the hardest majors. My engineering friends at my school study a lot for exams and still fail. He definitely has a natural talent, but how on earth do you get an A on a thermodynamic exam you\u2019ve never studied for? Do all the exams being open note really make it \u201ceasy\u201d enough to warrant no studying?",

      "text": "> The content still looks very difficult. It looks like a foreign language.\n\nAs someone who studies math, this is normal, but it's as easy as learning the foreign language. It's not like they throw random symbols at you and don't tell you what those symbols mean, lol. You learn what the symbols mean, and then it doesn't look foreign and you can understand it. \n\nI'm not in engineering, so I can't speak for that field, but my experience is that biology and health science takes *way* more studying and time than what I do. I'm in statistics, specializing in biostatistics, so I come across all sorts of biological/medical ideas that look as foreign to me as all the math-y stuff looks to you. And you have to *remember* all that stuff. All we have to do is learn concepts and apply them. It takes a lot less time than what students in healthcare have to do. \n\nOf course, you do have to be smart enough to understand the abstract concepts presented, which is where a lot of people hit a wall, and honestly, most people never get their basic math skills up to par enough to even have a chance to succeed at engineering, but if you had a good high school education and a reasonable knack for it the more \"math-y\" areas of STEM are much easier than the more content dense areas of STEM like biology.\n\nI can 100% guarantee you that my GPA as a bio major would be lower than my GPA as a math major. I wouldn't  have the time or memory to be able to pull it off like some people can.",
