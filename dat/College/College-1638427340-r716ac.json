  "title:": "I essentially failed the first semester of my sophomore year. Is my path to a decent PhD program closed shut? (USA)",
  "text": "So I\u2019m technically a first semester junior but I\u2019ll need a fifth year, effectively making me equivalent to a sophomore. I have a 3.85 cumulative GPA for coursework over the past two years in intense math and physics courses. But idk this semester was terrible. I was commuting a bit far, it was my first semester being back on campus after 1.5 years so it was very distracting, and I was busy with my research labs and running Eboards for clubs and my fraternity. Regardless, the end result is that my term GPA is probably ~2.0, if even. \n\nI wanna pursue a PhD in statistics and I\u2019m wondering if this term just killed my chances of getting into a good program. \n\nP.s. I\u2019m sure i\u2019ll be able to bring my GPA back up again over the following 2.5 years, and I\u2019ll have tons of research experience, but I\u2019m more worried about the multiple Ws and Fs on my transcript from this semester.",

      "text": "You\u2019re going to have to apply to grad school, so it will require you to have a solid explanation. If you continue to get a good GPA, are proactive throughout your school, and are active in some sort of research then you\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m not a grad student, but I have friends that applied with much lower GPAs and got in.",
