  "text": "Can you share what your experience has been like in mentorship programs where another student or alumni acts as a mentor or guidance. What are some things you guys had to do? Was there a list of required tasks or something? Did you guys hang out together or anything? Or have you ever been in any type of academic recovery? What did you have to do to get back in good standing? I\u2019m writing a novel where a student has to complete academic recovery, but one requirement is they have to complete a sort of mentorship program. Thanks!",
