So the hardest classes would be calculus 1 (I'm terrible at math and I had to take that class three. fucking. times. Didn't help the first time that the professor was/is totally incompetent), calculus physics (enough said), and computer science 101. I figured that last one sounded interesting but again, another incompetent professor. All he would do was put the textbook on the projector and read off it. I was the only girl in the class and he'd poke fun at that. Additionally, the rest of my classmates apparently already had some experience with coding so they would do well or at least passable, while I struggled big time. Only one of them would be willing to help me and teach me step by step, but he dropped the class mid-semester for some reason.\n\nAs a psych major now, I'm sure the hardest class I'll have to take is statistical methods, but graduate level version. Building more upon chi squares, ANOVA, etc. \\*shudder\\*",

What made these classes so hard wasn't the material, but the professors.\n\nDiscrete Math: professor assigns a gazillion problems from the textbook as homework, and we turn them in at the end of the semester. Our homework grade is based on how many problems we did. Since he doesn't grade homework regularly, we have no idea if we're doing the problems correctly. He also expects us to learn almost purely by doing the textbook problems and he rarely teaches us in class. He doesn't tell us what chapters of the textbook will be on the tests/quizzes, so we have no idea what to study for. If we don't know how to do the problems in the textbook, we're screwed.\n\nPhysics II: Professor teaches us definitions in class, but not how to solve problems, which we need to know to do the homework and tests.",

It was just her exams that I could not pass for the life of me. She made them much harder than they needed to be, especially since this was a 100 level course at a community college. She would only give an hour to complete an exam that had over 60 questions and the last fifteen always had diagrams, which had many parts to them. Anyways, I would ask her questions through email and she always responded with the biggest attitude. In one email, she suggested that I should get tested for \"autism\" because I was not passing her exams. Not gonna lie, I found this to be very rude and was not expecting such a response. I'm gonna be taking my last exam with her this Thursday. I'm a little nervous, but I've been studying all day and night. For this last exam, I need to get at least a 78 percent to graduate with a B in her class and I will do so. If I don't pass this exam, then I have to take her final, so that she can replace my final exam score with one of my old test scores. The good thing is that I have a good GPA going and that this class does not coincide with my major whatsoever. But, if I don't get a B, then this class could seriously bring down my GPA.",

Meanwhile the algebra class was just straight numbers and letters and I couldn't find their relations to anything in my everyday life. I took intro stats then liked it so much I took the next class up even though I didn't need it.

Those exams really get into minute details too. Have fun!\n\nThat said, for all the stress of that class, it was one of the most fun too. The material was interesting and challenging without being impossible.\n\nMachine Learning was another contender for the material being tricky and the exams being difficult.

It wasn't until I failed the course and took two COMPE courses the following semester that I gained the intuition necessary to understand binary and logical operators.\n\nNow I'm passing the class and it's been much more enjoyable this time around.

HW is now worth a grade and I have more intuition for the subject. It's also much easier to meet up with people online via Discord. Furthermore, he actually gives you feedback on the HW now rather than just giving you exercises. That's helpful in its own right (getting feedback from a professor).\n\nPreviously, the class was very difficult and the majority of people on Rate My Professor agree that this class was very hard. It's only really now, since he's changed things, that this class is becoming easier due to an incentive to succeed.\n\nTLDR: The class was hard because I didn't have intuition for the subject material and I had plenty of other classes to worry about. Not to mention most people agree this class was hard on RMP.",

They would be more manageable otherwise, but they're probably the hardest classes I'll take as an undergrad.  Last semester was fine but this semester I'm just freaking out. Made me consider withdrawing and changing my major even though I'm very interested in biology, just not the little tiny cell bio and biochem details, and the ridiculous amount of pressure completely ruins any enjoyment I would have gotten from learning this stuff. \n\nI have literal nightmares about biochem. It's ruining my mental health. I already have an anxiety disorder and I've started to have panic attacks again and more physical symptoms (aka constant heart palpitations and my limbs just randomly aching). I just can't keep up, at all, and I have no idea how I have a C average so far. \n\nOrgo II is hard, but the professor is great and as long as I study I know I'll at least pass. However, biochem/cell bio is taught by TWO professors with completely different styles of teaching, grading, and writing questions. They literally each make a test and grade them separately. I'm not sure who would thrive in this type of class but it sure as hell isn't me.",

For example, to a student, an inclined plane might just be about forces, but to an expert, you can make an inclined plane be about lots of different physics concepts. So to understand the problems, pay attention to what you're given (variables, constraints, etc.).\n\nAlso, when I grade assignments, I often see answers that consist of 95% math. Math is not all physics is, imo. I'd prefer to see students provide explanations on why such and such equations are true, since the math are most likely trivial. That's why you can get extra credit if you write down how you would solve the problems even if you don't do any math or arrive at a correct answer. Also, classical mechanics is very observable, so you can often come up with intuitive answers for the problems. \n\nOne unique thing a physics class I took did was they forced me to write answers in paragraphs. Absolutely no math. Purely explain your answers using the meanings of the laws we know. It was eye opening.",

Well, those programs run on C++, animation? python, good websites? javascript(they all use many languages). Also, Codecademy has free versions which can help drastically. The final wave of knowledge... youtube or udemy to support ideals and clarify questions.  I think it's important to understand why you're studying something to give yourself the motivation to be great at it.\n\n-Chegg can be used for a better understanding of complicated questions but is a monthly service. But has most of the questions solved(but also the process for solving them), and if you get really stuck you can send it to a professional solver.\n\n-I've never been \"naturally\" gifted with intelligence. I've learned some challenging concepts and coursework because of persistence, practice every day, and knowing where to look for knowledge/information.\n\n-Good notetaking can be critical too...... I use a three-block system  \nOne block involved concepts and ideas, to the right on that it gives a summary\nthe third block on the bottom is questions I have pertaining to the subject so I can do an investigation later.\n\n-Also on the subject, ill look at a syllabus for a challenging class and ask the professor what the next class involves, I will normally go onto youtube and watch videos that explain the subject(take notes-3teir), so when I'm in class I can ask directed questions for the parts I struggled to understand conceptually.\n\n-If there's a review for a test given, I'll complete it two times minimum before test day.\n\n-Take it slow, my first semester they recommended taking -  Calc, chemistry, Into to engineering projects, an \"elective\", an intro to programming. ----I took Calc, chem ;)\n\n-Also turning off notification and deleting certain apps on your phone if you have problems with concentration, there are two modes in the brain, a diffuse mode, and a focus mode, to learn and be successful in STEM you need to spend a lot of time in the focus mode when your phone is constantly sending app messages, or notifications about silly emails, texts, etc that cycles your brain in between those the two modes, making it challenging to retain information.\n\n-Relaxation, start early on problems and coursework even if you don't get close to completing it. It \"primes your mind\" I do my best studying later into the night. But ill introduce problems in a certain course early so that my subliminal mind can take time to understand them if that makes it. It leads to more productive crunch time later.---Take time to take a walk, listen to music, or sit in a hammock to stay relaxed...\n\n-Study for an hour/ take 15 off.\n\n-stress kills.",

As in, they can do things fairly quickly once you tell them, in painstaking detail, how to do them.\n\nComputer programming is a lot like this video:  [This dad follows his kid's PB&J sandwich instructions very literally - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-6N3bLgYyQ)",

I learned from my mistakes and put in the time to learn java. I was the top of my class in that intro class as well as the follow-up class that I took the next semester. Programming is very doable, you just have to put in the time to learn the material!",
