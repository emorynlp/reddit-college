  "text": "I just took my second biology test and I got a 77. I feel pretty bummed since I did extremely good on the first one (96). I guess I just came here to ask if 77 is an average score in biology tests since I feel like I completely failed and feel kinda dumb. The test was on metabolism, membranes structure/function, cell resp. & photosynthesis",
