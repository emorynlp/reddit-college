  "text": "I share a room with this one guy who I\u2019ve posted about before. Basically he plays games all day, has no friends, barely does school work, and never leaves the room. To top it all off, he\u2019s completely nocturnal. \n\nI\u2019ve never woken up after him, even when I decide to sleep in and constantly have to get ready in darkness. I\u2019ll leave, get breakfast, study, go to classes, take exams, do some work, and come back in the early evening and he\u2019s still asleep. It\u2019s so frustrating when I can\u2019t even relax in my own room because he sleeps until 7:00 in the evening. How do you deal with living with someone like this?",

Either they need to talk to the roommate and try to come to a compromise or they need to talk to an RA about this or they can just move out. I can see that OP has sort of elaborated the situation in their comment. I feel like OP needs to do something. It might be uncomfortable or difficult, but OP is gonna have to do something eventually whether they want to or not.\n\nI understand that OP wants things to work out so that there\u2019s no need to move out, but things aren\u2019t gonna change unless someone does something. I\u2019d say OP should move out as much as it sucks if they still can\u2019t reach a middle ground with their roommate.",

You could frame it as \"I'm concerned about disturbing your sleep and want to be respectful of that, but there are also things I need to do in the dorm room during the day\". Maybe try to come to an agreement on a reasonable time, like 10 or 11 AM, when you can have the lights on and be doing what you need to do regardless of if he's still sleeping.\n\nFor what it's worth, last time I had a roommate who I shared a bedroom with (as opposed to separate rooms in an apartment), I pretty much learned to sleep through her alarm and morning routine. When you're a night owl and it's earlier in the morning than you're planning to get up, it's really not hard to tune out mild to moderate noise, roll over, and go back to sleep.",

Used to work 3rd shifts at gas stations and I'd normally leave the house by the time my parents are in bed, and come home after my parents have left for work. It was 10 pm to 6 am, and I'd normally stay up for a few hours after getting home so I'd probably go to sleep at around 9-10 am, then wake up around 8 pm so I have time to get ready before work. Sometimes I'd rarely ever see my parents at all even though we live in the same house. Sounds like he at least previously worked graveyard shifts, and just hasn't been able to break the nocturnal sleep schedule.\n\nI'd just talk to him and ask how heavy a sleeper he is. Or see if you can work out some sort of compromise. Like someone else suggested, time frames where you can do whatever.\n\nPersonally being naturally a nightowl, I know my lack of schedule isn't the norm. So I understand people shouldn't have to work around me, hopefully he's as considerate. But I'm also a heavy sleeper and can sleep through just about anything.",

If you don\u2019t live in dorms check out your housing contract to see if you can move to a different unit or get out of the contract due to your roomate being aggressive and combative. Then if you are told no, which you shouldn\u2019t be, time to start living normal as if he was awake by 10am at the latest - lights, normal getting ready, use your room as needed. \n\nNow, I\u2019m assuming he isn\u2019t quiet as a mouse with the lights off while you\u2019re trying to sleep at night?",

But if not, then you can at least tell resident services or student life that you tried, which is 100% what they will tell you when you first approach them. Secondly, it may be good when talking to your roommate to try and find out what's going on with him. It sounds like he might be depressed, so actively reaching in and seeing what's up could prevent a lot of undesirable outcomes. \n\nBut yeah, if none of that works, try being a bit more aggressive in how you move through the day (basically asserting your right to use and enjoyment of the space), or see about transfering rooms.",

Do not confront them. They need to get help on their own. But you can go the the student healthcenter or psychology clinic. Hopefully its not bipolar and you'd probably already know if it was. BP2 and ADHD or even vit deficiencies, drug addictions can cause sleep issues. The longer they wait to address it, well it can lead to long term damage. There is nothing wrong with being a night owl or pulling an all nighter here or there when young or even napping throughout the day. If there is hostility then they really are not getting proper sleep and need medical intervention. Office of disability accommodations might have on how to proceed too. If it comes down to confrontation then have a counselor with you that knows how to get through to them. Just let them know you care and are supportive. Even if you know you'll never be BFFs. Get them to the right people.",

I'm currently on prescribed vit d and the first time I had it happen I thought it was depression but years later and with a smart watch I see I get no rem or deep sleep when my vitamin D is low. Its really awful and I've gotten two kidney stones from it. Luckily they were small enough not to cause pain or emergency issues. Also went through psych testing because I though I was dyslexic but nope, adhd. Made sense since I was diagnosed as a kid but I did good in school until I had managers at jobs ask me if I was. Never believed them since I'm not the hyper type. Falling asleep has always been hard but I usually sleep good once I'm out. For bipolar people they go through phases of sleeping normal then not sleeping for three or more days while manic. Bipolar 2 is less noticeable as its a milder form of mania. But it could be anything or it might be normal. Should be addressed if its effecting the people around them.",
