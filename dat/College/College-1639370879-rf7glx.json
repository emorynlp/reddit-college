  "text": "Is it appropriate/ok to reuse cover letters, essays, and such across applications for foundation scholarships?\n\nSo I go to a small college and I'm seeking a dual major in art and education. I've won several scholarships from the art department here by using the same essays, cover letters, etc. to apply for each available scholarship that pertains to me. It's a small department and all the faculty are very laid back so I knew it wouldn't be an issue... Well now I'm some of my financial aid has run out and so applying for scholarships is more important than ever and I cant rely on just applying for art-related ones... I want to apply to some general ones and ones from the education department but I'm unsure if I can use my same strategy here... \n\nHave you guys had issues with this? Is it acceptable?",

      "text": "Yes you can re-use application materials. They aren't academic assignments.\n\nIt's pretty common practice to do this for jobs and scholarships. One thing you might want to consider is if you are applying for the same ones you have done before. If it's a small scholarship, they might recognize the essay from a previous year and toss it if they see it as lazy.",
