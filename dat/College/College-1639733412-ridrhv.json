  "title:": "So many of my fellow CCC (a Christian soc) members got low grades in calc 1. How can I help them prepare for calc 2?",
  "text": "I know that 3 of them got C+, C and C- respectively. They need to do calc 2 next semester and I think that there is a high chance that they will struggle. I did calc 2 in the fall (due to having credit transfer for calc 1) and got 0.9sd above mean (a B+ according to last year's distribution), so how should I help them not to struggle in calc 2?\n\nAs fellow Christians we need to uplift one another. After seeing them getting low grades in calc 1, I am worried that they may struggle even further in calc 2.\n\nEdit: Thanks God that a 4th guy got B. Still these three guys, I hope they won't struggle next semester!",

      "text": "The primary reason that people struggle in calculus typically has nothing to do with the calculus - it\u2019s the underlying algebra, or even fundamental skills farther back that are not solid. \n\nKhan Academy is great for helping diagnose and shore up these skills, as it does an excellent job breaking large concepts down into bite-size chunks. The best way to use it is to go all the way back to the beginning and just start working forwards. People usually fly through material at first, and that\u2019s great, but the moment you\u2019re not clear on WHY something works, never mind the HOW, that\u2019s when you slow down and start watching the explanation videos. Pay particular attention to fractions, division/grouping, and all the middle school math-as-language material. And no calculator. \n\nConsistent practice over time is much more effective than trying to do it all at once! There is always the option of getting a tutor to do the diagnosing for you and guide the process (shameless advertisement: this kind of thing is literally my specialty and yes I am taking new clients over the break), but KA is free so that\u2019s a big advantage. Best of luck to your friends!",
