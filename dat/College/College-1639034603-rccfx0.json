  "text": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore neuroscience major trying to figure what I want to do with the rest of my life. I\u2019m not totally sold on the idea of spending 4 years after college in med school but I can\u2019t think of many options besides that with my degree. I chose this degree with the hopes that if I chose not to go to med school I could capitalize on the expanding field of neuro technology but every other neurosci major I meet plans on going to med school. I\u2019d love to hear different paths taken by others that found themselves in similar situations or any advice y\u2019all can think of.",

      "text": "Bouncing between the ideas of going to medical school, getting my masters in public health or social work or both. But if all else fails, I'll use the career office and get any job related to healthcare that has a decent salary and benefits. Your degree shows that you have the ability to learn, which opens the door to a lot of jobs with position-specific training. Good for you for picking an awesome major that will give you a new perspective. Just like biology and behavior, many things in our world are intertwined and require an interdisciplinary perspective.",
