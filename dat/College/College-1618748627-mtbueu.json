Discuss something else than the thesis.\n\n4. Let somebody else read it through when you're finishing. This will help you get other points of view.\n\n5. Pick a theme that you're genuinly interested in. This way it will become more fun and doable.\n\nThese are some I can come up with now. You'll probably get better tips if asking somebody else :)",

Like a Cashier can earn as much as a nurse, but again, I think this comes from almost every institution that requires nurses, being public and therefor payed for by our taxes. And then again, less pay.\n\nEdit: to be a nurse in Norway, you have to have completed a bachelors. We don't have LPN and RN. We just have \"nurse\". The norwegian equivalent of a LPN would be a \"healthcare worker (2 years of practice before you can call yourself that).",
