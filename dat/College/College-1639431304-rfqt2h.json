  "text": "Like I\u2019m very tired but they don\u2019t leave the room and I\u2019m not sure what to do or say. I\u2019d expect usually for them to walk in on me taking a nap, therefore there not being an awkward falling asleep phase, but now idk what to do.\n\nAny advice?",

I used a headband with earphones built into them and played white noise on them so I\u2019d stay asleep even when they were loud. It worked like a charm. I\u2019m pretty sure they sell them on Amazon.",
