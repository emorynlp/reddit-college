  "text": "Below are some topics I\u2019m interested in studying but I can\u2019t figure out what categories they fall under. Overall I know they\u2019re mainly psychological and neurological topics, but there are so many subcategories and overlap of the two that I\u2019m trying to figure out what the specific fields of study and or/careers each of these belong to and need some help figuring it out. Thanks!   \n1. The effects of sleep deprivation on mental health   \n2. The effects of bright light therapy on mental health   \n3. The effects of exercise on mental health   \n4.
