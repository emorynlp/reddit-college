  "text": "\n\nIt seems like it's just rediculously punishing. Like I ended up taking a long time to finish my degree because of mistakes during my first year.\n\nSo I ended up failing 2 classes early into my college career and my GPA fell to a point where I couldn't get fin aid. So regular University is expensive and I couldn't afford to pay that out of pocket so I planned to just do like a semester or something at community college and retake the classes I Didnt pass. Ok so advisor tells me college policy is you can't retake classes you've attempted here at other schools for credit. Those 2 classes added 3 extra years to my degree because I couldn't afford to pay for more than 1-2 classes a semester. And taking one class doesn't boost your GPA by much",
