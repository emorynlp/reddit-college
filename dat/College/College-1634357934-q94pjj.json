  "text": "I meant withdraw. Last day for Withdrawal is in only 10 days. Already almost halfway through semester. \n\nBackground: This is my retake of College English Level 1. Got a C the first time I took it. \n\nHad an 88% percent up until recently. Did an essay. There are 2 essays in class, each worth 30% of grade. I received a 16.5/30. Grade dropped to 68%. I feel absolutely wrecked right now and I feel like my teacher graded too harshly. Lots of criticisms without clarification and sometimes are just plain vague. Some of the criticisms aren\u2019t even justified IMO. I just feel like I\u2019m not going to be able to get a B now. And this essay was not half-assed either. I put effort and thought into it. \n\nSince it was 30% of my grade and I got like 50 this time, I heavily doubt I will do good again. I\u2019ve legit never had an English teacher grade my stuff so harshly before. If I get a C in this class again then it would\u2019ve been a waste of time. I figure now that my grade is essentially capped to a B- minus bordering C. It seems like it will be virtually impossible for me to improve upon my last grade. \n\nI am absolutely FURIOUS. I have just messaged my teacher asking to negotiate for a higher grade. I included is criticisms and the rubric to support myself.\n\nAlso, I have already taken English Level 2. I am retaking this in order to increase my GPA but maybe I\u2019m just wasting my time? I have a 2.9 GPA at the moment.",
