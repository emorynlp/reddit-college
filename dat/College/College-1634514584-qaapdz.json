It\u2019s especially funny when the questions are opinion pieces and they just write the same thing over and over. \n\nLast year, my health professor would post articles from controversial sources that had info that was just blatantly wrong. People would just agree with the articles since everyone else was. I\u2019d point out all the issues in them and reply to people on how the info was wrong. Funny enough, I\u2019d get replies from people saying they agreed with me when their original posts said otherwise. It makes me wonder what kind of grades they got.",

I was chosen first and I get it done with, my teacher asks this guy in class to go for the 6th question and he answers that there is no 6th question and she argues that there is one, so i jump in and say i don\u2019t think there is 6 questions as i have only done 5, my teacher thought we had older copies of the book but turns out I forgot to actually do the 6th one and the guy had to confess in front of everyone that he stole my answers directly from my file, he went through all that for an assignment that could be achieved in 5-10 minutes for 5 grades.",
