  "text": "Hello, im a fresher studying business management in the UK and im really panicking about this but i feel like business management is just POINTLESS! I dont like it at all so far. I keep being told that its just the start and that i will be doing business analytics later and that i get to choose a direction (eg: marketing) in second year and stuff. The thing is... NONE OF THIS SOUNDS INTERESTING. I never wanted this course, i just didnt know what else to choose so i picked this because it is \"broad\"... Well maybe a bit too broad. It is also a course that has MUCH less workload than others, everyone tells me that and it makes it feel even more pointless. I feel like im not learning any useful skills!!! Sure u can argue that i get skills in accounting and business analytics and decisions and stuff but I DONT LIKE STUDYING THIS and i have no interest in learning this. i know that i might end up doing something completely different in the future and stuff, what concerns me is the next 3 years of my life. I feel like if i stay in this course its just going to be an easy stroll to get a diploma but also a waste of money since i wont grasp anything due to lack of interest.. i dont know what to do, i cant change courses anymore...even going to something more specific like finance sounds better (even though not very interested in it) any insights from graduates??",

      "text": "I picked business because it\u2019s so broad. The real waste of a degree would be getting one in a super specific field and then getting a job in that field and you hate the work. At least with the business degree you have a lot more options if you don\u2019t like a particular branch of business.",

          "text": "Thanks for the response. The thing is, no branch of business sounds interesting to me and i feel like if i had another course (eg: psychology or finance) i would at least be learning something new and interesting no matter if i go on to follow it later or not. I mean i pay 25k a year, might as well leave with some knowledge in my brain right? I dont know thats how i feel.",

I personally enjoy it because it\u2019s mostly computer based data analytics. Right now I am learning how to code in my classes and I think that\u2019s a very useful skill. Along with how to do taxes and financial reports since I want to own my own business some day.",
