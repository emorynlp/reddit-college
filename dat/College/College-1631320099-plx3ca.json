I only go to 2 in-person classes and I\u2019m really just there for the lecture and then leave. There\u2019s basically just no social aspect around here. None of the clubs are of my interest and the ones that are of my interests haven\u2019t been active. They didn\u2019t even bother to change the posters around the school about any of the events happening smh, they\u2019re all ancient pieces from Spring 2020 before lockdown and it all seemed fun too. It\u2019s a huge letdown since after all of this online learning, I was eager to meet some new people and do something fun before I transfer. The last time I was in-person, I was in high school. Makes me jealous of my high school friends who got their \u201cnormal\u201d routine back and my friends who left for college. Screw this pandemic for ruining my social life.\n\nAs for school, I\u2019m doing just fine. Probably better than my performance in high school. I think online learning gave me the time to improve on that at least. Plus it allowed me to spend time with myself and do things you can\u2019t do when you\u2019re too busy socializing. I\u2019ll leave it on a positive note here.",

A few classmates have even approached me first to be study buddies which made me so happy! \n\nFinancially? Yikes. I had to pay a portion of my tuition out of pocket coz financial aid has been giving me some problems, so it\u2019s been tight. Im still pretty upset about it and not being able to spend my paycheck on anything fun. \n\nI felt super overwhelmed and had to stop working one extra day and I dropped one of my classes. I\u2019ve already had 4 breakdowns and it\u2019s only the 2nd week lol. It helped taking on less little but it still feels like so much and I\u2019m considering quitting once I can so I can focus on schoolwork/volunteering/internship/tutoring. Holy cow I can\u2019t believe there are crazies out there taking 15+ units and working and doing extracurriculares alongside that. I hope all of you make time for self care y\u2019all need to look after yourself too (this applies to every student reading this, no matter the course/work load) \u2764\ufe0f \n\nLastly, my boyfriend is deploying this Sunday and I\u2019ve been avoiding the emotional response for the most part, I know I\u2019ll be busy af anyways but I still feel sad about not coming home to see him after a long day. We\u2019ll be fine, it\u2019s only 6 months but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that this semester will be hard coz I will miss him. \n\nThank you for asking this question (and letting us rant) \u2764\ufe0f hope you\u2019re doing well!",

He just dumped all the lecture notes for the semester and left a link to the online textbook. Other than that, radio silence. I emailed him asking if that much homework was really due on the first day and he said ofc it's due thats what he wrote and then went into a rant abt buying the textbook. The class made a group chat and we are all super confused and none of us can do the homework cuz its so advanced and not a single word is in english lol. Can't drop cuz i need 12 credits and the deadline was an hour ago. Plus i need a perfect 4.0 for my program. V excited for this semester \ud83d\ude12",

If you get a question wrong, partially wrong, mess up significant figures, or view the explanation, your progress gets reset all the way (back to 0 questions answered correctly), whether you were at 0, 1, or 2 before.\n\nBut otherwise I'm enjoying the semester, everyone's following the mask mandate and I'm glad to be able to be back in person.",

Two of the things that were great about it though were that you could go in whatever order you want, it just shows you the topics you have the prerequisite knowledge for and you can pick so we had autonomy, and we weren't required to keep any pace, as long as we were roughly on track to finish the course by the end of the year. Those two things are gone with your course so that sucks. But like, know that you will learn Chemistry and you will learn it properly. ALEKS forces you to actually learn. Accept it for what it is and maybe you can enjoy the system as one that ensures mastery idk",
