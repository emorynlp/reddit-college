  "text": "I graduated high school during the beginning of the pandemic, so I didn\u2019t walk or bother to send out cards.\n\nNow I\u2019m finishing my associate degree, but my family for the most part thinks sending cards out for it is a bit silly since it\u2019s just an associate \n\nI was planning on sending out the following info:\n\n-what I\u2019ve done during college (clubs, boards I\u2019m on, internships I\u2019ve had, jobs I\u2019ve had etc) \n-what school I\u2019m transferring to (most of the people receiving the card would find out I\u2019m moving to their state, which is kinda a big reason as to why I want to send out cards) \n-The program I\u2019m going for and future degree plans (law school etc) \n\nIs it stupid to send cards out? I won\u2019t be walking with my class purely because I don\u2019t want to pay the 200+ fee for the gown, cap, my chair in a almost empty room, AND my piece of paper stating my completion. \n\nIf I do send them, what else should I put on them? Or something less? I\u2019ve never done it so I don\u2019t know hah",
