      "text": "I\u2019ve done it twice, my first semester (which was last fall) and this current semester. The first time was incredibly stressful. I worked just about everyday and it was really hard to balance out my classes and schoolwork. My mental health was also declining so that made it hard to do both. My second semester I didn\u2019t work and it was much easier to focus on assignments since I didn\u2019t have any other major obligations. I\u2019m working this semester but I have a campus job which makes things more manageable. The type of job I have let\u2019s me have the most control over my schedule, I can only work but so many hours in a week, and my supervisors are very understanding and reasonable people to work with. Even though I still get stressed sometimes with the balance of school and this job, it\u2019s much easier to navigate around and if I needed to take a break from working, my supervisors would be open to making accommodations for me",
