  "text": " Maybe it\u2019s just me, but this seems weird and slightly frustrating. \n\nI imagine I\u2019m not the only one that borrowed slightly more than what was needed for tuition. In my case, it was intended for school supplies, books, and transportation costs, though I\u2019m guessing others would use it for off-campus rent, etc.\n\nIn orientation, we\u2019re told that they wouldn\u2019t even mail the check until 30-40 days into the semester, and at the time I didn\u2019t think much of it\u2026 But now that we\u2019re a month in I\u2019m thinking about it and it makes no sense.\n\nYou don\u2019t wait until midterms to buy books and supplies. Those that are paying monthly parking and/or renting would have already paid for half the semester\u2019s bills\u2026 etc etc etc\n\nDoes anyone else\u2019s school do this? Is it normal?",
