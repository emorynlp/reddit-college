  "title:": "Week 6 of being a college freshman and I\u2019ve only got 3 friends.",
  "text": "I\u2019m 18F and not very close to any of them yet but I\u2019m making an effort. Hung out with a 4th kid all day once after class and then he just ignored me. Tried reaching out but he just ignored me some more. It seemed like everything was fine, he even suggested hanging out again.\n\nIt\u2019s just really lonely here. I keep hoping things will get better but idk. Im trying to stick it out. But every time a relative or home friend asks how it\u2019s going it just hurts more. It\u2019s really difficult to keep feeling good as time goes on. I thought I could do this and be strong and find my people. But I\u2019m still just as awful at it.\n\nDoes anyone have some advice? I know 6 weeks doenst sounds like a lot but it really feels like a lot when you\u2019re living it. Did anyone go though similar stuff? Does it get better? I just want a friend group I can laugh with. I\u2019m so tired. I really can\u2019t keep doing this.",

I found most of my friends at university from meeting one or two people who shared interests with me and I now have a little group of friends that I regularly hang out with.",
