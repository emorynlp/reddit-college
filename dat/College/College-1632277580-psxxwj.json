  "text": "I just got a 0% on one of my web development projects because I copied a reset CSS style sheet (css is how you style a web page) from online, one that was fully free to use and attributed. Now, I get some people will say \"that's plagiarism/not your own work\", but here's the thing, my job title is literally \"FRONT END DEVELOPER\". Reset style sheets do not add ANY styling, they exist to solve browser inconsistencies by removing as many styles as possible (because a certain element on one browser might look different in another). In fact, me using one made the assignment harder. I could've just relied on the default styling, but out of habit I did what is standard and even recommended in the field I work in, and I got punished for it. The assignment did not have any requirements or even mentions of making the style consistent across browsers, it was something I did my own out of habit.\n\nIt seems like that for anyone with half a brain and an ounce of dedication is college just a rubber stamp on stuff you could've learned for free (assuming you're not going into the medical field or something like that).\n\nedit: I thought about it and it was stupid of me to assume that copy and pasted word would be ok as long as I \"had permission\". That's like assuming that your English professor would be okay with you copying your paper from the internet because the person who wrote it said you could. ",

      "text": "That sucks, man. Did the project criteria specify that you aren\u2019t allowed to use css libraries/frameworks? If it did, then I can understand a point penalty but a big fat 0% seems a bit extreme. Maybe using external resources is considered \u201ctoo advanced\u201d for the class or was not allowed for the scope of that specific project. \n\nI think, either way, to be safe, you should never use any open source resources unless you get cleared to by the professor or it\u2019s in the project requirements. I always opt to use my own reset even if it\u2019s probably *really* similar to all the other resets out there.",

A class isn't 1:1 job training. The onus is on you to meet the requirements and not plagiarize. Take it as a lesson.",

      "text": "<sigh>  \n\nA growing number of employers will not allow their developers to pull down code or templates from external sources either.  \nThe risk of license agreements changing after the code is embedded in the application is just too great.  \n\nYou, the developer are not empowered to agree to the terms of the license or usage agreement for the code repository you want to snatch a template from.  \nThat is the job of corporate counsel, or legal/risk management.  \n\nYou, as a standard staff member of the company are not empowered to accept the license agreement for WinRAR on your own. That's somebody else's job.  \n\nYou're thinking: *\"What? Wow, that's stupid. Corporations are dumb.\"*  \n\nYou think like a standard user, and that's a problem.  \n\nWinRAR is effectively free for a home user.  \nWinRAR is **NOT** free for business users.  \n\nI know, you're thinking *\"But they will never know...\"*  \n\nIt's the legal & risk management team's jobs to keep the company out of legal danger, and using unlicensed software, or violating the terms of use for a piece of software is a significant risk.  \n\nWhat happens when we get sued by stupid, dinky, trivial WinRAR for $25,000?  \nWell, we are now known to be an entity who misuses software licenses.  \nWhat if Oracle decides to audit or jack up our license renewal rate because now they know we're dirty?  \n\n-----  \n\nIf you think you can prove that the assignment didn't say you couldn't use a CSS template, then go have that conversation with your professor and see if you can get some points back.  \n\nBut don't suggest this isn't how the real world works, because it is, at least for companies who care.",

          "text": "<sigh>  \n\n\nThis is ignorant.\n\nEven Reddit is running on an open-source web framework built by Facebook called React.\n\nGoogle uses a Linux-based operating system to run their web servers. If they were suddenly not able to use any parts of the Linux kernel they could literally lose tens, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars because they'd be out for months as they reconfigured all their servers, modified all their software, etc. to get everything back up.\n\nI mean, just look up what sites use React, Angular, or Vue. You'll see lots of internet giants  like Netflix, PayPal, and Twitter use them.\n\nAlso WinRAR being effectively free is not the same as it being free. Sure, they don't enforce it, but they could still come after you for not paying for their software per the license agreement. Facebook (who created React) could not come after Netflix for using the software within the very unrestrictive terms of the license agreement.\n\nYea, they could change the agreement. Look up what happened when MongoDB did that and the effort that OpenStreetMaps has gone through trying to get theirs changed.",

They are developers, they just want to pound out enough code to complete the active sprint.",
