  "text": "As the end result of the semester approaches I look forward to the day when I won\u2019t have to stress about school work anymore. I spent all of thanksgiving break working on projects and stressing out about everything due after break so it was hardly a break at all. Well now that day is here as I just finished my last exam yesterday but I just feel empty like my life has lost meaning. \n\nI should feel happy to have all this pressure taken off me but I guess now I\u2019m just realizing how meaningless my life is outside of school. During the semester I put in 100% effort into everything and always try to do as good as possible. As a result of this, school pretty much consumes my life and I am pretty much always studying. I wouldn\u2019t say I enjoy how much time school takes, but it feels necessary. Now that the semester is over I feel like I have no meaning. Also the only place I really interact with other people is during class so now I just feel isolated and alone.",
