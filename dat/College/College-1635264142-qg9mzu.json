Like people regularly failed his courses for work quality that would have garnered a B in other classes. \n\nHe and I had a good relationship. I gave him the time of day, did the readings, was engaged in the classes I took from him and asked for mentorship during office hours. \n\nMy last semester in college I was 3 A\u2019s away from the 3.9 threshold to graduate summa cum laude. I had one of his classes. I felt doomed. But he gave me the A. I didn\u2019t ask, but I think he knew.",

Even if you don\u2019t have questions, you can ask about the prof\u2019s research. Eventually it just becomes a habit to stop by and say hi and talking to them after class. Hope this helped :)",

(Yes, a five page paper \u2014 you have to show them you are so serious about needing this scholarship that you will bust your ass to get it.)\n\n3) \u2014 and this one is key \u2014 tell the prof that you know this is a big ask.  Because it is.  It means more shit for them to grade, and risking the ire of other students.  It is a big ask.\n\nBest case scenario, your prof will say \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, you\u2019ve participated in this class and that earns you a bump\u201d\n\nWorst case is they take you up on the 5 page paper offer.\n\nEven worse case they say no.\n\nBut this is serious and you should try every thing  you can to keep that scholarship. DON\u2019T ASK FOR A BUMP \u2014 offer to work for and earn that bump.\n\nDo that and I bet you they\u2019ll say yes.",

Go to office hours and talk to your professors for help on that cause maybe they have insight on ways to study specific to their class.

      "text": "As a TA, I don't think you should ask - I don't see it accomplishing anything other than annoying the teaching staff. The only response you are likely to get is something along the lines of \"Your GPA isn't the response to one homework, one exam, or one single course - it's the collection of everything, and up to you to maintain it\". It's unfortunate, it sucks, but it is how it is - professors need to be fair and unbiased across the board, anything else would be 100% unethical.\n\nNow, I can still offer some advice. \n\n(1) Start going to office hours to clarify any misunderstandings that you may have on any content in the course. After going a few times, you **may** wish to tell your professors that you are trying to improve in their courses because you need to meet scholarship requirements. **Do not, I repeat, do NOT ask them to bump your grade**, however, if you are friendly-ish (to where they would at least recognize you in passing and know your name), then they are likely to be willing to help you pull your own grades up by making sure you really understanding things, and by providing better feedback.\n\n(2) This is complete speculation from me, but check your scholarship requirements again, and maybe call the point of contact for the scholarship. Again, complete speculation, so don't hold me to it, but I would imagine that the GPA requirement isn't a \"one and done\", however, if you fall below the threshold, they will likely put you on a probationary semester to get it together and meet the requirements. One of my old friends from undergrad was in a similar situation, and if I remember correctly, he had a semester to fix it, then a semester later, his scholarship amount lowered, then lowered the next semester, then finally dropped. There wasn't a heartless plummet to $0 of aid after one semester. I will specify that this was a scholarship through the university, I have no idea how it works at other schools or through external funding agencies.\n\n(3) You said you were first-year engineering. I don't know which discipline you study, but there is a good chance that your courses will already be graded on generous scales with some curving. There is a nonzero chance that you are worried about a non-issue that will be fixed upon final grade posting. \n\n(4) The textbooks, office hours, homework assignments, syllabi, and course schedules are your new best friends. Your course syllabus should be under your pillow, right where it belongs, so you will absorb the knowledge as you sleep. Joking aside, it's time to set up shop and have a very boring semester so that you absolutely nail the final exams, since it sounds (per your words) like that is the minimum acceptable outcome. \n\nI am sure you can pull through with this - myself and everyone else on this subreddit are rooting for you, but it's ultimately a problem that will be solved with your own blood, sweat, and tears.",
