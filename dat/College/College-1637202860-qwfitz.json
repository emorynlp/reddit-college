  "title:": "Small accomplishments, but I\u2019m really proud of myself",
  "text": "After wasting over six years of my life after high school working at a bank and not taking my college education seriously, I decided to go back to school full time in hopes of a chance to go to med school. I enrolled at my CC and took a counseling class to take myself off from probation during spring 2021. Then, I retook three of my classes during summer to replace my Fs. I passed all my classes with As and brought my GPA up to a 4.0 and got on the dean\u2019s list. Now it\u2019s fall and I\u2019m still full time and passing with As. I have a couple years to go before I can transfer to a university, but I\u2019m more motivated than ever. \n\nI just wanted to humble brag about my small accomplishments because no one in my life seems to care about how well I\u2019m doing in school.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your kind words! It really means a ton! I will keep working hard and not lose sight of my goals.",
