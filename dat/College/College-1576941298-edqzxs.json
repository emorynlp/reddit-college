      "text": "That's totally anxiety. We're still not in 2020 but your brain is already in the middle of 2030.\n\nWhat do you feel is the cause of this feeling of ''waste of time'? Maybe you do have something in your backlog, or maybe it could be guilt from not giving the effort you wanted during classes. It could be many \nother things that you worry about, these things are from the future (Closer and/or far future), dude, the problem probably is that you are having  trouble living the moment, either because you want something right now, have a pending task, are afraid of something that will happen, you could be feeling guilty over things you didn't do at school or something and now you want to compensate (even if not useful anymore),  or you're worrying over things out of your control, this is usually the case among people I often talk and have anxiety issues. The causes for this are endless, so you'll have to do everything you can to successfully determine what is causing you to worry or care so much about the future.\n\nI too suffer from high anxiety, I understand this exact problem fairly well, I struggle with it every time I'm in winter or summer vacation from school.\n\nTL,DR: This may sound like \"you need to be the earth, be the sea, be your mind, bla bla bla\" But basically yep, be one with your body and try to notice what triggers your anxiety, it's a good start to know what could be triggering it, or if it's chronic. In simple words, you're fighting in tbe future causing you to not enjoy the present. if you notice that the something troubling you is something that you can solve or mitigate in The present: do it, stop procrastinating if it turns out to be a pending task; if not, you need to learn accept things out of your reach.",

I'm not sure what you enjoy, but consider finding something productive yet relaxing that you like. Trying out a new recipe to share with others, starting (and finishing) a 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzle, tutoring a student, etc. Take some time to find out whatever that thing is, and once you do find it try and stick with it.",
