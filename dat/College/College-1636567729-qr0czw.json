  "text": "So I\u2019m a junior in college, I\u2019m a social work major and honestly I can\u2019t see myself doing it. I keep reading horror stories about people in social work as well and from my own experiences this far Im not sure I want to pursue it any longer. I was thinking of switching to either accounting or finance. Do you guys think If I took summer classes and started this journey next semester I could still graduate spring of 2023 or at the latest fall of 2023? Thanks",

      "text": "Definitely would be really hard. You could very well be taking the risk of not doing well in classes by taking on such a hectic workload. It\u2019s up to you. If it was me, I\u2019d take whatever time I need to get the degree I wanted. I actually did just that. You don\u2019t have to graduate in 4 years. Most take 6 years to obtain a 4 year degree and that\u2019s perfectly fine.",

I\u2019m already slated to graduate when I\u2019m 23 and took a gap year after college and saved, traveled some places and worked. I don\u2019t want to delay myself any longer while other people my age are already moved on  but I can\u2019t see myself in this career. Tough decision to make, thanks for your input",

              "text": "Don\u2019t measure your success by what others are doing. You should only be in competition with yourself. Some people hope to be as successful as you are now, and they will get there on their own time, just as you will achieve your goals on your own time. It\u2019s not a race man believe me when I say you\u2019re gonna put yourself in a deeper whole by using others as a measurement of your success. It took me 6 years to get my degree and I\u2019m happy as can be. Some people are further behind at the same age as you, some are ahead. All that matters is you do what makes you happy. Don\u2019t settle now because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019re taking too long. You\u2019re doing great!\n\nYou have to realize that some people don\u2019t make their break in life until they are in the their 30s, 40s, even 60\u2019s. Time is on your side, it\u2019s not going anywhere. As long as you have a goal to work towards, you\u2019re doing better than most are in the world.",
