  "text": "One of my courses had every assignment as group work. The labs and final project. I had to do substantial rewrites and bugfixes for any code my lab partner touched on every lab because they clearly do not have any experience coding despite being an upperclassman, and I did the entirety of the code for the final project. There were four people in that group and none of them contributed anything to the code at all. Zero lines. I am getting what I consider a subpar grade (albeit passing) in this class because I had to do the work of 2-4 people the whole quarter. It's frustrating that professors view this as an acceptable way to structure a course.",

When he chose the project he acted like he was going to get the whole thing done over the summer himself (this was a multi semester project) and acted like an expert.  That was why I went along with his choice of a project as I figured he knew a lot about it and so this would be easy.  Turns out he knew next to nothing - even less than I did.  We still got an A in the class due to mostly my efforts to \"make it look good\" but the whole experience sucked for me when it should have been fun.",

I got a head start and my new group members followed. It was average. Luckily, we earned an 80%. Group Collaboration assignments are a double-edged sword.",
