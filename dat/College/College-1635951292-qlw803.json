I also think genetics play a big part, but I wouldn't necessarily place them above the environment.\n\nHonors classes are easier. The teachers are better, there are more constructive questions, your classmates are generally well behaved, etc. The hardest math class I've taken is algebra 2, and I have to think it was because of the teacher, the students around me, etc. I had no trouble finishing calc 1-3, diff eq, and linear algebra in high school, but I don't think that would be true if I had teachers that didn't work well for me. I didn't actively seek out knowledge about math, I almost completely relied on what I picked up in class like most high school students. And since it was in high school, there were only like 10 students in the class for the half of the classes I listed. It was comfortable to just say \"wait I don't understand that\" and have it explained differently, that was the type of environment I was in. I can't say that I would have thrived in a different environment, I find it plausible that I could have grown up thinking I am bad at math.",

Stuff like partial derivatives got a lot more concrete to me when I had to solve some physics problem using those tools almost immediately after learning them.",

However, you seem to be encouraging the actions of this other user, which is disheartening to say the least.\n\nAlso, I understand that this pandemic has made everyone\u2019s lives more difficult, but I really think you should reconsider your anti-mask views. Students your age may not have the same risks as other members of our society, but it\u2019s important to keep the lives of others in mind.\n\nSuicide and Covid 19 are nothing to take lightly, and I\u2019m hoping you find yourself with a change of heart.\n\nGlad to hear math is going well, though!",
