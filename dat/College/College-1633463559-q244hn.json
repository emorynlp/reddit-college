  "title:": "Really Struggling to Write Paper",
  "text": "Hello! I'm currently working on an anthropology writing assignment that's worth twenty-five percent of my grade, but I'm struggling quite a bit as the descriptions for what I should be writing are extremely vague and I cannot get in contact with my TA, she literally never responds to my emails, and even the rare times that she does, she doesn't answer the question very well.\n\nI'm good at writing for the most part. In my most recent diagnostic essay, which was my first piece of writing ever for university, I got an 80% with a class average of around 60%. I also received compliments from my philosophy TA on my writing abilities.\n\nBut I'm just struggling so hard and feel like I'm writing points out of my ass for this assignment just because I never understand what the question is asking me, and if I try to ask my TA, she doesn't answer, and if I try asking Discord, it's just radio silence. Another difficulty is that my reflection is asking me to address five different questions in seven hundred words.\n\nI also have ADHD, which is really just the cherry on top of the cake.\n\nAny tips?",
