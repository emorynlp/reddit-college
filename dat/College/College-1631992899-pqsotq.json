  "text": "Im scared of accidently plagerising and its effects. I dont want my future to be ruined because i didnt cite something. Because of this i feel the urge to put a citation on every sentence I write. I dont know what ideas are mine and what are ones ive found anymore. This all stresses me out and i feel like the higher ups at my college would be cold and not show mercy on me if i mess this up or belive it was an accident. This has me scared to write and idk what to do. I dont want to be kicked out of college and branded a cheater to other colleges.",

Basically it's a sociological theory that no idea is an original one, therefore we are all plagiarizing everyone else without even knowing it. So you could technically argue under Zeitgeist that you didn't know your idea wasn't original, or that you didn't want to cite your source and give him/her credit because their idea wasn't original, either! Worth a shot. I'd make a case out of it.",

      "text": "So I just wanted to comment as a TA who has recently been grading a bunch of papers from a 200 level class that had nearly none cited correctly. As in tons of people didn't cite anything and most are not citing enough. Now since this paper only was using sources from class readings and not outside research, I'm just taking off some points and not failing or turning anyone in for plagiarism. For the people that missed a citation here or there, I just reminded them that they needed to cite everything and took off like a single point since this is a lot of students' first college paper. \n\nWhile I can't speak for all of your professors, as long as I see people are trying to cite, I'm never going to turn them in for plagiarism. If its really bad but I can tell they tried and just don't know what they are doing they will loose some points and I might ask them to come see me in office hours or go to the writing center for help with citing. Its generally better to over cite than under cite if you aren't sure. I will say in some of my research papers nearly every sentence does have multiple citations in certain sections. \n\nEssentially, very few professors want to deal with major accusations of plagiarism unless it is very intentional (i.e. copying and passing it off as your own work). We don't expect students to understand perfectly how to cite starting out. Basically, what I am saying is don't stress about this. If you are still worried try your writing center or set up a meeting with the professor or TA.",
