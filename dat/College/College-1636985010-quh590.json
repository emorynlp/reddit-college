  "text": "A lot of people have said that this depends to the requirements of different universities but how do they calculate it usually?\n\nIs the whole 4 years of college grades included or just the 3rd and 4th year of it?\n\nWhat if you've had an 80 on the midterm of your 1st year while the other subjects remain 90 and above, especially the major ones? Does having a grade below 85 bad in general? And would it disqualify you from getting one? \n\nI'm quite uninformed with how these things work, so I apologize",

However, the last semester is counted eventually when it comes to Latin Honors and whatever Latin Honors you get after the last semester would be printed on your diploma.",
