There is a mountainous difference between getting a high gpa in one versus the other. Statistics is significantly more rigorous. \n\nSince you\u2019re doing computer science, you are doing a challenging major. If you have no experience in programming at the moment, you may find your start to college difficult. Nonetheless, I\u2019m sure you are capable, but you are choosing a difficult major. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve very rarely seen an internship requiring that high of a gpa. Most will not.",

So if you are a junior then you can register earlier than other people. Which may help getting better professors.

The first year? Sure it\u2019s probably easier introductory classes than most STEM fields. However, junior year and beyond it really goes from programming to computer science. There is a lot of theoretical and algorithm based work in upper division classes. If you attain a 3.8 GPA almost any internship will hire you because not many people succeed with those grades. Don\u2019t expect to have a strong social life if you are proficient enough to attain those great grades.\n\nI quickly realized early in my junior year that I was not smart enough to attain those elusive internships so I made a change to greatly increase my involvement in student organizations instead. There are many factors that go into a resume that aren\u2019t GPA, though for internships in college in particular, GPA and connections are the only things that will get you hired.",

      "text": "As an Electrical Comp Eng student with a 3.9, it is and it isn't difficult.\n\nI would say there are three factors of getting a 3.8+ GPA:\n\n1.) Are you smart enough? You don't need to be the quickest or smartest in all your courses but you need to have the bare bone skills to comprehend, digest, utilize and articulate the course content.\n\n2.) How meticulous are you? For me getting a B+ is easy, but going back in your HWs, projects, and exams is essential for the extra little bit for an A. Further, you need to comprehend every concept taught, and be able to regurgitate that material, and actually be able to apply that knowledge to problems consistently. Attend office hours, go to tutors, consult smart peers. Confirm your understanding is correct when you think you are correct.\n\n3.) Do you have enough time to be meticulous? Is your courseload realistic to be consistent/meticulous for all your courses? Budget for worst-case scenario. I personally only do 12-15 credits(usually 14) a semester and usually 2 labs per semester. Most summers I've gotten credits from either cc or internships/research. Even with offloading my credits I still think I put more work into my courses than my peers.\n\nTBH I think between half the class to a third of my class could get 3.8+  if they really tried and had the patience for it, but they don't.\n\nUltimately, I think it is hard in the same sense that training and running a marathon is hard. Yeah, a fair number of people could run that total distance (some faster and more easily than others) but in the end, most people don't.",

      "text": "Like others mentioned before there's many variables to it. Grades are always unpredictable and some professors are just there to show off their own expertise and give everyone a hard time. \nI'm a history major, working as a student assistant at our university and state library and have been fortunate in that my professors are very demanding and strict, but also fair (most of them anyways). My GPA is currently at 1,2 on the German scaling system (with 1,0 being the best possible grade; so probably around a 3,8 American GPA).\n\nBut I am extremely passionate about my major, want to pursue a master's soon and have incredibly high (maybe even unhealthy) expectations of myself; meaning many sleepless nights and always going the extra mile. It's not easy and life happens, grades aren't everything, but if you're passionate about it and always try to give it your best, I'm sure you'll be fine. :-)",
