  "text": "Hi so I don't know if this is the right place to post this, please PM me where to post this if it isn't the right place.\n\nBut I have been thinking of transferring. Particularly from College to a University. I would like to obtain either a bachelors or a masters (currently studying business/economics) but I do not believe I can achieve that at a regular community college. (I think at this college the best we have is an \"honors bachelors\" or something like that).\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advice when it comes to transferring from a college to a university? Any pros/cons? Also, is it better if I complete my entire college program before transferring to a university program? Will I have to complete the entire program over again, or will my college credits count towards the university credits (I.E. Lets say I've finished 2/4 semesters in college but my university program is 8 semesters, will I be at 0/8 or 2/8?).\n\nAlso any other information or tips you may have will be really greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "It's better to finish your associates degree at a CC and then transfer for your bachelor's. What transfers is completely up to the 4 year you apply to though. Many CCs have a few colleges where most of your credits transfer to. So, this is something you will have to look into. Contact advisors at the 4 year you want to transfer to.",
