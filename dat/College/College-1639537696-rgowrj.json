  "text": "One week Spring break study abroad program in Brazil for American student 19M\n\nHey guys what\u2019s up. Are you guys familiar with any one week study abroad programs in Brazil which last one week. I also speak Portuguese so I am looking to utilize my language skills while I\u2019m there. Also, I am looking to stay with a host family in Brazil so that I have an immediate connection to the country and the language. Thanks!",
