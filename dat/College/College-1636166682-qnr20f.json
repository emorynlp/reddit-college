  "text": "Second year in college, and I still have no friends. I tried talking to people, but they don't seem interested in me. I thought I found a few good people who I made a real nice connection with initially, but then when I ask to hang out, there's either no response or they say they're too busy, yet I see them having fun with their other friends. I don't know what to do? I have anxiety/depression, yet still I try to get the nerve to put myself out there in clubs and activities, but it just seems like they all have their own friends, and when I ask them something, they answer and don't want to know anything about me. They go right back to their other friends. Why is it so hard for me? Am I really such a bad guy? Can anyone relate? ):",

      "text": "I feel for you.  Dealing with people and making friends sucks.\n\nI think my advice would be that the best way to make friends is to find kids you have something in common with.  And one thing college does provide is the opportunity for that, through clubs, groups and even honorary societies.  Keep trying new groups.  When I was an undergrad, Beta Gamma Sigma --the honor society for Business Students-- did a fair number of events, talks and socials.  I was also involved in a language club, student orientation, and student government... where I also met a lot of kids in other organizations, like the programming board.\n\nIt can be hard, but all of life is what you make out of it.  Go out and join groups, get involved.  All these groups NEED new and active members.  If there's not a group for something you're passionate about... create one!  Board games, crafting, entrepenurship... most colleges will give funding and space to almost anything, and give you a table during orientation and stuff to attract new members.  \n\nGetting active and involved I also found had a great effect on reducing my own anxiety and depression.  I was too busy running around.  \n\nWorst case, things don't work.  Oh well.  Ya tried.  Take the pain and move on.  Best case... you make some new friends --real friends-- and in my case I also found a few people to date. And there were things to ask them to thanks to the clubs and events!\n\nGood luck!!",

      "text": "I relate a ton. I don\u2019t have a hard time making at least one or two friends wherever I go usually but this new school has just been sheesh \ud83d\ude2c. It almost seems like everyone is afraid. The way so many kids act in class just sounds like insecurity. It\u2019s also a weird time right now with COVID, everyone\u2019s unsure if it\u2019s still a big deal or not. I think you\u2019re fine. Maybe try doing stuff outside of school?",

      "text": "Every last one (except maybe 2 people) from college were fly by nights. All of these people are out of state for reference. I am not getting into it but I was severely depressed ended up as a 5th year and had a lower than average gpa. Graduated 3 years ago and reality none of those people would fit into my lifestyle now.\n\nKeep focusing on the degree, then see who comes back into your life.",
