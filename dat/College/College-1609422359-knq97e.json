If your library has a system but your Prof isn\u2019t using it, gently ask them to. \n\nDepending on the class, you might be able to get by with a previous edition of the book. In one class I use an edited volume in that swaps out a few readings each edition. I tell students to buy an older version and to make up the missing stuff in the library. Ask your Prof if a previous edition is viable.\n\nIf you can, I encourage you to have these conversations with your Profs.

If you look hard enough, you can find a PDF of almost anything online! My friends do the same and share them in emails (but don\u2019t use your uni email just in case). That\u2019s how I\u2019ve gotten about 20 of my books haha. Do you know anyone that has taken the classes before? Or someone with a copy that can just send you the problem sets as they come up? Is there a uni page you can post an ISO to? Also, that one book I got last year I found used on Amazon for roughly a tenth of the price it was at the book store. I find a lot of relevant textbooks at the Goodwill in my college town too, if you have one!! Happy hunting!!\n\nEdit: I have had classes where the textbook is \u201cabsolutely required\u201d and in the end it absolutely wasn\u2019t. If I were you and I couldn\u2019t find a PDF, I wouldn\u2019t buy at all until you are certain it is actually needed. If a problem arises, just tell your prof you lost your textbook and are waiting on a new one or something. You are already being charged an arm and a leg, you really don\u2019t need to buy more useless stuff :)",

I get no use out of my textbooks, other than for formulae and Table lookups (looking at you Thermodynamics), so i don't really buy textbooks all that often. \n\nBut if you need them, buying used is a great option, try searching for international copies. Often times they are identical to the american copies except for a few words on the cover, and are often much cheaper. My Statics book was $200 gently used for the American copy; I did some digging around and the international copy, also gently used, was $20. I bought the international copy and it was identical except for swapping \"American\" and \"International\" on the cover\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that the further you get into your degree, the more expensive the books are, and the less likely you are to find a cheaper way to obtain the book. For one of my textbooks, the ONLY way to get it was to rent it through the school bookstore. Couldn't even buy it. It was $180 to rent. I just said screw it and didn't get it. Turned out fine.",

Contact your school\u2019s library and see if they have any of these options, and you should probably try talking to your counselor too and seeing if there any scholarships you can apply for that will help with textbook costs.\n\nBut also, I have a tendency to rent my books off Amazon since that is usually the cheapest option I\u2019ve found.",

My favorite so far has been Chegg Books. I actually was able to rent a book for $26 for 6 months while the book actually costs nearly $200.\n\nI\u2019ve also used Amazon to rent my books too. Majority of the time though, the cost of books is included in my tuition. However, I think that\u2019s because I go to a community college.\n\nDo be weary if you buy a code outsourced from the publisher though. Macmillan\u2019s customer support basically was telling me off and telling me the code will not work because I bought it from somewhere else. (It worked. Like hell I was going to buy a license from them for $100 if I got it for $40.)\n\nI did have one class where I didn\u2019t even bother buying the book at all because she basically gave us the short version of the book in our assignments.",

First, you could try to find other people from your classes and see if they would be would be willing to share their books with you or send you pictures of the reading. You could also see about getting vouchers from your school's book store. Also, you could try renting digital copies of your books from the Apple store or the Google Play store. They tend to run cheaper than physical copies and they typically let you keep them for 6 months at a time. Otherwise, I would recommend consulting your professors to see if they could help you find the cheapest accessible version of your textbooks. I hope you find everything you need. Good luck this upcoming semester!",

      "text": "Depends on your major and professors I think. I was a political science major and only really needed the texts that were assigned in one of those classes. In all of my science classes (I was a geology minor) I purchased all the textbooks and literally never even opened most of them. \n\nAt the same time, I took a few philosophy classes at the beginning of college and I read out of those texts literally every single day. \n\nMy take is wait until the second or third week of classes to decide whether you really need the texts or not. These days you can rent a lot of them off of Amazon or buy a digital textbook for a fraction of the cost of a physical copy. Again, my experience was very heavy on the liberal arts and earth sciences, so I can't give any good advice on STEM or business fields. In the end it really isn't worth stressing about I promise. College is a really fun time and those were the best years of my life. Just remember that while grades are important and school always comes first, take time to make friends and memories. The real learning experiences you get in college aren't going to come out of a textbook or classroom. I work in environmental conservation now because I took a crazy internship that had nothing to do with my major and it changed my life and everything I wanted to do in my career and I am so much better off because of it. I guess I'm just rambling now, but all this is to say that every little thing is gonna be alright.",

(If there are any profs lurking here, please correct me on this lol) They probably won't respond until the first or second week of January when they are back in office, so definitely be patient with them because they're also on their Christmas vacation.\n\nIf you can't get your syllabi early, you'll receive them during the first week of classes or whenever your professors publish their LMS pages. From there, you'll be able to see whether or not the book is actually being used and if there are any access codes you need to buy.\n\nIf any of your classes require access codes, make sure you *buy these first* because they're the most expensive and it is likely you'll need to use them sooner. Not having the codes can make it difficult to do homework and see course materials. However, a lot of the codes will also provide access to an eTextbook, so it will cut down on the number of books you still have to buy.",

Sometimes the differences between two editions are minimal, and sometimes the entire book has been restructured or redesigned. \n\nI would also proceed with caution if you\u2019re looking for textbooks that might include practice questions (because all of the questions and answers could be different between editions). Finally, I\u2019d use caution if you\u2019re in a discipline that is regulated (e.g. clinical psychology, health care, law, ethics for your program) because older textbooks might be using older regulations. For instance, lots of textbooks in clinical psychology released new editions around the same time that the switch was made from DSM-IV to DSM-5. Not having the new information from DSM-5 would be a huge disadvantage. \n\nTL;DR: find out what content has been changed between two editions of a book before just assuming you can stick with an earlier, cheaper edition.",

Maybe it's unethical, but it's certainly not illegal and they're already doing it, they just don't advertise that fact.\n\nThe only time universities or departments have deals with textbook companies is if it's a subscription model (what your second link talks about) where students pay for a subscription that covers all their classes that use that particular publisher.  This would be very clear to students because they would be billed for it as part of their tuition.  Trust me, there are no secret deals, at least not at reputable colleges, because this would violate academic freedom. \n\nWhile professors are often hounded by textbook companies, I've never once heard of any financial incentives for professors (unlike doctors, who often get financial incentives from pharmaceutical companies).  Professors select expensive textbooks because they are either oblivious or lazy, not because of some conspiracy.",

I would also suggest going to a secondhand books. A lot of people sell their books when they are done with the class so you can usually find them for a fraction of the price on Amazon, half priced books, and chegg.
