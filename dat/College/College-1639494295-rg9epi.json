  "title:": "Can a parent call the college to confirm that their child will be taking an exam on a certain day?",
  "text": "My immigrant mom is so emotionally abusive and toxic. I was going to go back to her home to see her on the 24-26th. My last final is on the 17th and I planned on going to DC to see my cousin for just a few days (19-21). The thing is that when she called, I lied and told her my last final is on the 23rd, and she didn't believe me and threatened to call my college. I had lied because I knew if she found out about the DC trip, she wouldn't let me go. I then admitted that my last final is on the 17th, and she cursed at me and said I must go back to her home on the 18th. She said she refuses to let me go on the DC trip (even though I purchased the non-refundable tickets already) and made all sorts of threats towards me.\n\nNow, my small trip is canceled but I'm not too concerned about it. I am thinking of just relaxing after my finals because it's been a challenging semester. I want to tell her that one of my professors changed the date of the final to the 22nd, so I will go see her on the 23rd. I plan to show her \"proof\" by using my friend's Gmail (with her permission) to write an email to myself about the exam rescheduling. Also, on my college's final exam time spreadsheet for all classes, there is a final exam happening on the 22nd for a different class, so I will screenshot this and send her it (she doesn't know the exact classes I'm taking). My question is if she still calls the school, can they tell her my exact exam schedule? Thanks in advance everyone\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone who took their time to respond. I called my college and they said that they can\u2019t and won\u2019t release any information about me. She doesn\u2019t know the exact classes I am taking so I\u2019m just going to say that a professor of mine switched a final to the 22nd so even if she looks online she\u2019ll see the schedule but doesn\u2019t know which classes I\u2019m taking.",

I know Latinx families have very unique culture standards on their children and are often fairly harsh. You are an adult and she makes you feel small, as if you were still under her roof because she is afraid to lose control. My parents did the same to me. One day, years prior to entering my PharmD program, I stopped responding to texts and phone calls and pretty much said hey, I\u2019m busy sometimes and I have my own life. This is my life and I have responsibilities and those responsibilities are stressful and sometimes I want to relax and do random shit and go somewhere. I used to be so worried about my mom freaking out about what I\u2019m doing and when and where and who with. I know how hard your situation is and I\u2019m so sorry",

I\u2019ve been friends with Spanish speaking people my entire life and some prefer latino, Latina, just as long as no one calls them a nationality they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s all good. Hispanic is an ethnicity and is a generalization. Most \u201cHispanic\u201d people that live in the US are from countries in\u2026 Latin America. Hispanic literally means of Spanish origin or descent or related to the Spain itself, Hispanidad. Some Latin American countries are Portuguese in origin. Since the initial occupation and colonization by Spain and Portugal of parts of the Americas, culture has changed a lot in those few hundred years and differs in some way between each Latin country. I rather say someone is Latin in origin before I say Hispanic. Spain has nothing to do with Latin America or South America or North America and Hispanic is such an outdated term. Hispanic IS an imperialistic term and originates from that time period. I would rather call a person of Latin origin Latin American, Latino or Latina, or Latine or Latinx before I say Hispanic, because it may not be true. If I hear someone that accentuates s I may say Hispanic, because that\u2019s the accent in Spain. I do academic writing and realize Latinx is just more white appropriation of the Spanish language, but at least I have enough of a grip on reality, unlike most Americans, that not every Spanish speaking person is automatically Mexican.",
