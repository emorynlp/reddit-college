      "text": "I haven't gone through the online program, but I've worked at starbucks for a few years. It's pretty fun, but you have to try really hard not to care about your job or it'll be pretty crushing, especially right now.\n\nI also did some online school for freshman year, and its not harder necessarily, but takes a different skillset. YOU are the only person that will be responsible for your education, there's not the same kind of accountability as in a traditional school.\n\nIt is cool that they offer it tho! I can see how it would REALLY help some people.",
