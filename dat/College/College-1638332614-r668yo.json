  "text": "I\u2019m going into computer science next year. I got a 5 on the AP Computer Science exam; is it worth it to exchange this for college credit in a course? AP covers JavaScript and we didn\u2019t get very far past simple loops/arrays. My fear is that I\u2019ll skip the introductory coding class and save money but be launched into some complicated class in a language I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to make my first year flow as smooth as possible. Does anyone have experience in this? Thanks",

      "text": "I thought about doing that, but after the first week/lesson I decided I wasn't advanced enough or familiar enough with C++ to do that so I switched back. That immediately became my easiest class, which isn't a bad thing your first semester to help boost your GPA, and will also put you with all the other new freshmen in CS, which is better for finding people to work with (not sure if groupwork is really a thing for CS majors).",
