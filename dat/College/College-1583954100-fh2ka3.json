  "text": "We just got the announcement that our college is closing on March 19th\n\nI\u2019ve moved 5 times this year trying to escape an abusive home, and now I\u2019ve finally escaped it, and college has become my home. During breaks I stay at my grandmas but she lives in a development for 65+ so I can\u2019t stay more than a short time period. \n\nI have a mattress in my car, but I don\u2019t want to resort to that\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I can\u2019t breathe. No one knows what\u2019s happening with the dorms. Everyone says the school will be closing, but not a single person has mentioned what happens to the dormers . I know a lot of dormers have moved out of other colleges, but will they make us all do that? \n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen???",

Find the people in your life who you feel safe with & if you trust them, tell them what you need. There are people who will fight for you. Look for a trauma-informed therapist if you don\u2019t have one already, and see if there are healthy shelter programs in your area, which is an option for anyone temporarily looking for a better place\u2014 they may be able to help you find ways to support yourself, although I have not had personal experience with it, my therapist at one point recommended one in my area that I would have gone to if I had to sleep in a car instead.

Most of the institutions that I am aware of are offering the ability to petition to stay in the dorms for specific circumstances. Your college is doing this because they feel it is in the best interests of the students if you explain your situation and let them know that it is worse off for you to return home I'm sure they will allow you to stay. \n\nIn terms of other options, check-in with friends, or even just other students from your institution. Right now there is a group of students and parents who live near my college that is offering to take in students for the time being if they have reasons they cannot go home such as having an internship, are international students who cannot return home right away, or are low income and cannot afford to leave immediately. Check on social media for your institution and see if anyone is offering the same. Even if you can stay in the dorms, this might be a viable option if offered as you will have an easier time having access to a kitchen if your dorms do not have community kitchens.\n\nWhile it might seem like a total mess, I'm sure there are people at your institution that will listen and help.",

Favoritism of gender applies because again, opportunities will be presented to one gender that aren\u2019t made available to the other. \n\nIn fact, Title IX was passed to help women athletic teams in colleges be able to recruit and provide financial assistance (through scholarships) for women, as at the time of its passing, college sports was predominately male and colleges only really addressed male sports teams typically. \n\nAll in all, Title IX basically just says to institutions \u201cdon\u2019t discriminate if you want to keep your federal funding\u201d :)",
