  "text": "I currently have a 2.8 gpa in community college and I'm applying to transfer as Computer Engineering this year but Im scared I wont get accepted anywhere since all the schools here in California are super competitive for engineering do I have any hope getting accepted or should I give up on engineering and transfer to Business? (I'm applying to schools like SJSU, CSU Long beach, Cal Poly Pomona and UCSC)",
