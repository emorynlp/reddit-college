  "text": "This semester has been more stressful than previous ones for me. Every time I get an automated email about my grades being low it stresses me out. I\u2019ve been close to just driving home to talk to my parents and just cry about my feelings. I know that I can pass all my classes but I just need motivation or something to help me along. \n\nHas anyone else felt like this more than before?",

      "text": "I am right there with you! This semester is harder than the previous ones, but I believe in you! Even though I am a good student, there are moments where I just want to drop all of my classes and forget about college, I remember that this is temporary and will pass. Utilize tutoring services and/or your professor if you can. I wish you the best! :)",
