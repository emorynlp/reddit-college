  "text": "I just started graduate school. Yesterday I had my first tutorial - a 20 minute video - on using the college library's resources. I can't believe I went this long without knowing about databases and how to access them. It would have made my undergraduate work so much easier.\n\nWhat I want to know is: **how do undergraduates learn how to use the library** \\- especially the digital collections? Is it normal for colleges to adopt a \"sink or swim\" method, like mine did? \n\nI am working towards an MLIS. I hope to graduate in 2024, and I live in the USA.",

However, I didn't think he taught us anything that all the students in that class hadn't already figured out by that class (2nd or 3rd year).\n\nHow would someone do their research papers without knowing the databases? You had research papers in undergrad, correct? How did you do them without all the academic journals available digitally? Books are great, but articles tend to be the instigators of minute academic debate. How did you do it?\n\nI felt like mine had a sink or swim method, but everyone learned how to swim quite quickly.",

Students were tolerated but not welcomed.\n\nI got what I needed from google, random internet digging, and an epic level of bullshittery. (It will not surprise you to know that my grades were okay but not great)",

              "text": "That sounds horrid! My university's library was bustling with students 24 hours a day (literally, it was open all the time except 6 hours late Saturday night and early Sunday morning). I spent hours every day there (mostly out of fun, I love libraries!), not to mention the time I spent online searching through sites like EBSCOhost and JSTOR finding academic journal articles to read. \n\nHonestly I'm not sure how I would have gone through college with a passing grade without the library. The number of research papers on topics so esoteric the internet failed to provide information, requiring a well-stocked library and databases, would leave me flabbergasted as to how one to even do decent without a library. \n\nGreat for you for still managing to get okay grades! Since you are doing an MLIS, I guess you should get used to knowing libraries inside and out!",

      "text": "At my college they go over library stuff so much. \n\nWe had to take a first year writing class where they showed us a similar 20 minute video, and we had class sessions in the library with the librarians for that class, plus several other classes with research papers had us watch that same video again. Plus another class I took had a librarian teach a session. It\u2019s gotten to the point where they\u2019ve taught us so much about library resources that if you don\u2019t understand them now you never will and you should probably just drop out. \n\nWhat I always do is just go to google scholar through the library website. I already know how to use google and google scholar is very similar just better. It gives you the citation in any format you need, and if your school subscribes to the database with the article there will be a link for it on the right hand side. Much easier than searching multiple databases individually.",

I am *extremely* appreciative of modern digital collections and that we don't have to physically search for documents as much anymore.",

It was an all day Saturday classes. I took it because it was one of my only options to avoid taking a science but it ended up being one of the most useful classes I took.",

My department tries to reach as many undergraduate students as possible, across a variety of subjects, during different times in a student's progression through their degree. We work with instructors to teach library sessions in classes (this can be anything from creating keywords, finding sources, evaluating information, and citing sources), create workshops, and offer drop in, chat, or appointment help. That said, we don't always catch every single student because there's like five  of us and thousands of students. Happy to chat more about academic librarianship if it sounds like a path you want to take with your MLIS!",

Especially using AI.  \nHere's an example: [Willow](https://www.ai-company.cloud/willow). This is a smart search engine makes it easier to look for information by using natural language and categorizes the results based on their content. With technology like that, doing research becomes much easier and probably tutorials on how to use college libraries will be less useful.",
