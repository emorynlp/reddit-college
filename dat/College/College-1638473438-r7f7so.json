  "text": "Last year, I flew by all my classes and passed with top grades. This year however, I've been attending placement that my lecturer set up which is 2 hours travel on a bus. On top of that, my family life has shaken up like crazy and I'm the one who is picking up all the pieces.\n\nMy week is literally this. Monday, wake up at 4 to make it to placement which is at 7. Do placement until 4 o'clock and head home but first I need to check on my Grandma because I'm the only one looking after her. I get to my grans at 5 and do the shopping for her, help out with other things and by that time she's sorted it's nearing 8. Get the bus home and end up home at 9. Sort out every single new family problem, whether it's trying to track my drunken mum or trying to not cry at my younger emotionally abusive sister. 11 o'clock I'll make dinner for myself and eat and at midnight, I can finally begin my college work.\n\nTuesday I'm up at 5 and oh, did I mention I fall asleep doing college work until 2? Anyways, same day as Monday.\n\nWednesday Thursday Friday,  college classes online from 10-4.\n\nBut this week, we were told Thursday and Friday, we were off and just to study. I slept in until 9:57 with a million notifications on my phone from the college griuochat who are screaming because there's now a surprise college call at 10. The teacher put on teams that there was a call at 9:55. I showed up 3 minutes late and she held me back at the end and gave me into an unnecessary amount of trouble. When I explained I was led to believe that there wasnt a call today, she said I always had to prepare for situations like this regardless. \n\nShe wasn't happy with me and said I was lacking in work. I explained my routine to her on Monday and Tuesdays and her response? Apparently that's just an excuse.\n\nToday I've sat at my computer screen for an entire 7 hours straight, catching up on work, trying to pass four different assessments and trying to submit 6 sheets of work today. \n\nI feel like she's failing to be understanding towards my situation. She asked me if I had just joined this year and I explained I was there last year too. She looked confused and said she didn't remember me at all so that was a great mood booster...",

      "text": "Respectfully OP, I'm a bit confused. What exactly is a placement? Like a class that has a score which determines a future placement in a class (like Regular vs. Honors vs. something else)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I'm sorry for your struggle OP, but this is kind of the facts of life. You're entirely right if you're being honest--her getting pissed over you being 3 minutes late to a *spontaneous meeting* is absurd. Hell, you missing the meeting entirely imo would've been understandable. I'm also sorry about her comment about literally not remembering a student she had just a year ago--professors have a lot of students, but c'mon now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, it isn't a professor's job to lessen a workload or judge your work differently because you *claim* (and that's what it is to them, a claim) that you have a tough home life. Additionally, while it seems like a blow, I'm also confused at why *you're* not understanding why she doesn't remember you. Clearly, you're describing her to be kind of a jerk. Did you talk to her regularly? Were you close? If not, I can't really blame her for not placing you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you talk to your grandmother? Losing 5 to 8 PM isn't helping and honestly it might be worthwhile to either look into her having a caretaker, doing things herself (if she's still able) or even things like Instacart if it's financially possible. Also, what's your weekend looking like? Maybe do work on the weekends if you aren't already--sucks but sometimes necessary to balance everything out (doing 3-4 hours of work on a Saturday is better than staying up till 4 AM on a Tuesday).",
