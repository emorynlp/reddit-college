  "text": "hi all, hope you are well. this year, i did the \u201crandom roommate\u201d option for my living situation and i have a roommate who is from china.\nshe\u2019s nice, but\u2026 we don\u2019t talk. at the beginning of the semester we got food together in the dining hall a couple of times, she offered me chocolate when i was sad, and we talked about our families and home lives. now it is week 15 in the semester and well\u2026 we don\u2019t talk. it\u2019s a bit awkward because we are in the same room but we could go for days on end without saying a word to each other. she never leaves the room, i\u2019m not sure she has friends that she hangs out with (and there are other international students here who i see hang out all the time) she constantly has headphones on and is on her laptop, and she does homework a lot (she has a way harder major than i do so i understand that). she also only makes food in the dorm room or brings it up, she doesn\u2019t even go down to the hall to eat anymore, so the room constantly smells like the food from the last meal, which my nose is sensitive to, so i find myself opening a window to air it out (even though we are in december). there are tufts of her hair on the floor from her brush that i pick up and throw away. but one of the worst things was when i came back from fall break (she had chosen to stay at the dorm), the whole room smelled so musty to the point where my bedsheets i had left behind smelled like it. i didn\u2019t know the source of the smell until i opened the microwave to make a mac and cheese cup, the walls and door of the microwave were dirty an filthy with a brown color, i was shocked because i remember it was clean before i left (and i was only gone for 6 days). she wakes up super early in the morning to talk to someone on facetime, i\u2019m not sure who, but it wakes me up every morning when i need to get extra rest for the day.\n\ni know she is far from home and she is doing what\u2019s necessary to take care of herself, but it\u2019s a bit frustrating when i\u2019m cleaning up after her or trying to keep the room fresh, it\u2019s a bit frustrating. it\u2019s also just upsetting how sh stopped talking to me after first couple weeks of the semester. does anyone have an experience similar to this? how do i make this better?\n\nsorry for the long paragraph, i just don\u2019t know anyone else in this situation and would appreciate advice",

      "text": "Some people aren\u2019t very talkative and not everyone is best friends with their roommate. \n\nMaybe you can suggest a cleaning schedule for the shared parts of the room? Like maybe you each take turns sweeping the floor once a day or every other day. Make a plan for taking out the trash, wiping down the microwave, and cleaning out the fridge consistently. Either a weekly or monthly rotation of who gets what chores. It\u2019s a small enough space that it shouldn\u2019t be too time consuming. Make a cute chart on a whiteboard or something \n\nIf you are going to the dining hall or the library or an event on campus you could invite her to join you. She might say no, but if you always give her the invitation it might make it easier for her to feel connected to campus. And if she can find her people, a group she clicks with, then maybe it\u2019ll ease up some of the stress in y\u2019all\u2019s room.",

      "text": "\"i know she is far from home and she is doing what\u2019s necessary to take care of herself\"\n\nHonestly I think the opposite. She apparently hasn't seen daylight in what, days? She doesn't clean anything or talk to anyone there either. It's almost to the point where it would be a red flag in terms of mental health. If it got worse I would be considering making a wellness check request through the university health center just so someone can ask her if she is okay.\n\n\"she wakes up super early in the morning to talk to someone on facetime, i\u2019m not sure who, but it wakes me up every morning when i need to get extra rest for the day.\"\n\nHave you brought it up with her? I would be asking her to use the common room if it's before... 7am? Sounds reasonable.\n\n\"the walls and door of the microwave were dirty an filthy with a brown color\"\n\nHave you brought it up with her? I would not be cleaning her mess. Not her mother.\n\n\"there are tufts of her hair on the floor from her brush that i pick up and throw away\"\n\nEwwwwww why did you pick it up? That's just disgusting. And I'm a saying that as a dude. It's also another little thing that could signal severe stress or mental issues if it's a lot of hair.",

              "text": "You can ask the counseling office for the form to do a wellness check. Almost all universities have a form like this that students, staff, and faculty can fill out. The reporting is anonymous. A counselor would most likely simply give her a call and make sure she knows about the counseling options available to her. Sometimes they will also phrase it in a way that makes it seem like a routine check-up they do with all students so that it doesn't come across as \"someone filled out this form saying you might have issues\".",
