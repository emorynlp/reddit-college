  "text": "I (recruited athlete) have to make a decision between two schools soon. I like both schools a lot but am indecisive about which one I should choose. I want to major in engineering and want to have very good career-building opportunities. Below are the main factors\n\nSchool A: Georgia Tech\n\n\\- Very high-ranked engineering program (my current intended major), large focus on engineering/tech\n\n\\- The athletic dorms are very nice, each person gets their own room, has a living room, showers, etc.\n\n\\- The campus is scooterable, and commute to classes & sports facilities is very easy\n\n\\- In a big city (Atlanta), which I personally like, both for things to do and potential internships\n\n\\- I would be able to drive there and have a car\n\n\\- Facilities are very nice\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSchool B: Duke\n\n\\- Very high ranked school overall, not only in engineering, students major in a larger variety of things\n\n\\- Sophomore, Junior, and Senior dorms are nice, but still with a roommate & communal showers/bathrooms\n\n\\- Commute would take longer, freshman year I would have to ride a bus between campuses for practice as opposed to a 3 minute walk\n\n\\- It is more selective than GT, and has a better reputation or \"curb appeal\", because it is ranked higher than GT\n\n\\- Because of the selectivity, I've been told that I'd meet many interesting/driven people while I'm there\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy main worry about going to Georgia Tech is that if I chose to pursue something non-engineering (most likely will still be in the STEM field though), I will not get as good of an education/as valuable of a degree as I would from Duke. Also Georgia Tech doesn't carry the allure of being a top 10 school.\n\nMy anxiety about going to Duke is that 1) Commutes will be longer from the dorms, and the dorms aren't as nice, 2) Durham is a smaller city, whereas Atlanta has many large companies willing to offer internship positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty adaptable, so I'm not going to *dis*like either school, I just don't want to waste a good opportunity.",

They\u2019re both great schools and unless you already know prominent Duke or Tech alumni, no one 10+ years out of school will care which school you chose as they both produce quality students.",

First, congrats on being recruited, that's dope.\n\nSo this applies to life beyond just choosing this one thing as well.\n\nInside of you, you know which one you really want to go to. If you were to remove pros and cons from the equation and you just got to choose one because it was what you really wanted to do, one would stand out.",

In addition Maybe look at the cost of the parking pass and if you can't decide from that put both names in a piece of paper on separate pieces of paper and then put them in a hat then pick one and whichever name you pull out of the hat read it read it and then analyze your feelings because of it if your reaction is joy go with that 1 if your reaction is disappointment go with the other.... I know that isn't super helpful but sometimes if you can't find any major difference between the 2 that's about it... That how I picked between UChicago and Oxford when I couldn't decided... Oxford was the one I pulled out of the hat and I was a little disappointed so that was how I figured I wanted to go to UCHICAGO more...",
