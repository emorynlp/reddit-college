  "text": "I wanna take this Spanish class next semester and I already took the prerequisite Spanish class however there\u2019s a another English class prerequisite which I haven\u2019t taken but will next semester, I emailed my advisor stating that I already have the one prerequisite and they didn\u2019t respond yet. Is there any chance I would be able to take the class? I can take the Spanish class and the English prerequisite as a co-requiste? I already have an A in the Spanish class I\u2019m taking now and If I can\u2019t take Spanish next semester I\u2019m gonna have to wait until next spring semester then\ud83d\ude10",

      "text": "Yeah it\u2019s possible. I had a pre-req waived by the head of my department. I\u2019m an art student and if I had to take this pre-req that semester I would have had to take a break from my sculptural work. He thought I was making headway in that area and agreed that taking a break from it at that time wouldn\u2019t be helpful. Just sort of depends on your circumstance",
