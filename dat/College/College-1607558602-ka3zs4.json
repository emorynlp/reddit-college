So what makes it easier?  I assumed before that adults in college might not feel so pressured to get the best grades because they don\u2019t have anyone but themselves to impress or have other responsibilities that prevent you from getting hyper focused on your studies.  Maybe that\u2019s stupid but even without my mother being able to see my grades I still have that fear that my mother is going to be disappointed in me for getting a B.  I feel like with my current track I\u2019m not going to accomplish my dreams and there will be nothing left for me to do.  Why did I even start talking about this.  I don\u2019t know.  I\u2019m stressed.  Have a nice evening.",
