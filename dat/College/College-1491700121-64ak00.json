  "title:": "I'm a professor: This is what I tell my family members BEFORE they go to college.",
  "text": "I know it is college season and many of you are picking a school or looking to switch schools. I see your questions and your comments on the front page of /r/college. Some of you have parents that went to college and some of you don't. Some of you are traditional and some are nontraditional with respect to age. Some of you are veterans and some have never had a job. I want to give you a piece of advice I give to my family members. You can take it or leave it, but don't discount what I say because you don't like it; I'm tenured, I've been doing this a very long time. I've spent nearly two decades now within the walls of a college in some capacity. \n\n**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered \"top\" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an \"in\" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. \n\n**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive. The average student loan debt in the US right now is around $30K for a bachelor's. This is about a $300/month loan payment for 10 years. In general, you can expect $100/month repayment for every $10K you take out. I see a LOT of students who are ROYALLY screwing themselves over here. Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, \"yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out.\" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.\n\n**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. \n\n**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.\n\n**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. \n\n**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. \n\n TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the \"real college experience\" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's. ",

          "text": "Based off your question, you are unlikely to like my response. \n\nI think academics are the ONLY part of college. Everything else is the same stuff you would do regardless of whether you were in college or not (go to parties with friends, socialize, etc...). \n\nAs long as it isn't impacting your education (which I've seen happen far too often), giving you a criminal record (seen far too often), and you're not being a jackass, you should be okay. \n\nExamples of pits I have seen more than one person fall in:\n\n1. Average students join a sorority/fraternity and spend *too* much time with it compared to their studies. Their grades slip because of double booking obligations and they prioritize their friends over school. \n\n2. Students who start drinking... ... and can't stop. I've seen a lot of students evolve into full-blown alcoholism, and I am on a dry campus. \n\n3. Students who make poor choices that end up destroying their lives. Being constantly drunk may not be a big deal to someone who drinks too much anyway. If you commit crimes while drunk and are caught doing those crimes though... that is a good way to lose all letters of recommendation, miss exams due to court dates, etc... \n\n4. And a big one that is super controversial: drug facilitated rape. On most campuses across the country people have sex with drunk people. In most places, having sex with a drunk person is considered rape. I've literally seen students get charged as rapists for what they thought was consensual sex, not knowing that a drunk person is unable to legally give consent. (It's controversial because, of course, people should be permitted to get drunk without inviting rape, but realistically, drunk people are easier to take advantage of. I want anyone who reads this to know that I'm not blaming victims for getting drunk, but it does make you a more likely target statistically.)\n\n5. Also, don't do stupid shit in public, don't put it on Facebook. Don't leave proof of your debauchery where a professor may see it. There are a lot of professors who will view you negatively for things like partying, especially if you aren't doing well in class. I allow students to friend me on FB, and I have seen them post some incredibly stupid things that nobody should ever let their professors see, and they aren't smart enough to add privacy filters.  \n",

Most people in software engineering don't realize that 6+ years into your career, it will be your proven track record, and the knowledge that you've gained that will make you stand out. 18+ years into it, no one gives a damn about what school I went to.\n\nCollege tells a perspective employer that you are able to read, write, and regurgitate. I'd say roughly 90% of my CS degree wasn't really relevant in practical development. Unless you are creating a compiler/framework, or dealing with Machine Learning, you will never have to remember how to do a bubble sort. There are so many layers of abstraction between the hardware and software, most of the time you will be implementing something someone else has already done, perhaps in a different set of sequences, but the principle is the same. \"Let me google that for you.\"",

The problem is that they don't offer the major I want. I want to major in global/international development and it's pretty niche. I asked McGill for financial aid and I'll get my package in about 1-2 weeks. They have international development and unlike Stony Brook, which is far from the city, McGill is in the center of Montreal so there should be great internship opportunities. Assuming McGill gives me no money I would have to pay $25k (full cost of attendance). I mean $25k is a great deal compared to colleges here in the US, but it's still a lot of money and I MUST have a Master's degree if I want to work for the UN. ",

You need a related undergrad degree, but if you are looking for a grad degree in that subfield, that's what will really matter. Look at a few programs and look at their admission requirements. If Stony Brook has a major with those requirements, there would be no problem going there. \n\nFor another example, a student who wants to be an anthropologist may be at a school that doesn't offer anthropology as a BA/BS. They likely offer sociology though with courses in anthropology in their sociology department. Those students aren't destroying their chances of becoming an anthropologist with a sociology degree as long as they get their graduate training in the subfield they are interested in.",

This post was intended to show students how to best save money and not screw themselves by graduations, but you seem fixated on the fact that sometimes students need to change their major. This is how a typical advising session goes:\n\n\"How are your classes going?\" \n\n\"I'm not doing well.\"\n\n\"Well what's going on with them?\"\n\n\"I don't understand calculus.\"\n\n\"Have you looked into tutoring?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll recommend you start off by going to get some tutoring. Do you know where the tutoring facility is? Here it is on the map. Have you talked with your professor?\"\n\n\"No.\" \n\n\"Okay, I also recommend you go to your professor during their office hours to ask some questions and get advice about how best to study the material for their exams.\"\n\nThat's student A. Student A doesn't need to change their major. \n\nHere's student B:\n\n\"How are classes?\"\n\n\"I'm failing everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I see that based off your midterm grades. Have you talked with the professor and looked into tutoring? Have you joined any study groups?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do all those things but I just don't understand this material. This is the second time I've taken all these classes.\"\n\nTHAT student needs to start considering changing their major. They are wasting valuable time and resources taking classes where they lack the aptitude to pass. If it is one class tangentially related to their major, it isn't a big deal. I say that multiple times in this thread. If it is literally every class in their major and it is what they want to do with their lives, and they are trying everything but it doesn't work out for them, yes, I advise them to change their major. Otherwise they are likely to drop out. That is the consequence of students on financial aid who keep failing all their classes. The aid gets taken away and they drop out owing a ton of money, with no degree and just as many skills as they had in high school to secure a job to pay those bills off. Surely in all of your infinite wisdom you understand that: students are better off changing majors to something they are good at than dropping out of school entirely. ",

A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.\n\n\nOn this subject, how much of an effect will poor grades in a community college have on me moving forward? I failed several courses back when I did my original AA degree ending with a 2.87 GPA, but since then got an AS with a 4.0 from another school and a BS with a 3.7. I am considering doing a Masters program now or going back for another undergrad degree, do you think that original AA will have a huge effect on how people see me?",

I think like you pointed out, if you work hard at any legit school you will be OK...but there's a reason why these companies have a set of colleges in there, it probably has to do with the knowledge and motivation of the students, but surely the colleges did help them, no?\n\nAs for high school teachers, most of my teachers were either from UCLA or Long Beach State and not Cal State Dominguez Hills, albeit less competition\n\nI think your argument is a lot better for those trying to go to graduate & professional school...there is a program for LSAMP, and there are profiles that have people who went from Cal State LA to Harvard and Cal State Dominguez Hills to Harvard as well",

      "text": "So with a grain of salt: I am also a professor, apparently with more/longer experience than OP, and I disagree with some of this advice.  Particularly #3...there are ~4,500 colleges in the US and whatever people might say the \"product\" they offer is not consistant across all institutions. Not all colleges are created equal, and not all offer equal educational opportunities. In fact, there is a tremendous gulf between poor/middling/elite schools both in subtance and in outcomes-- in part due to who is in the seats next to you. If you choose to attend a highly selective school you will be in classes with other high-performing students, which raises the bar in almost every way. It is also likely to mean you will benefit from a much better network after college-- who you know is important, and it doesn't require an Ivy degree for that to make a difference. \n\nOn a more practical basis, not all students are well suited to all types of schools. Some may do well in a lecture hall setting with 400 classmates, while others will thrive only in small classes (say 20-25) with much more direct attention from the instructor. It's important to know the difference between types of schools and to determine which fits your needs. There are also a lot shitty schools out there, to be frank, where faculty don't care about teaching and admins care only about revenues...fine for many people, but others will be much happier in a setting that offers more support, more services, and is more student-focused. Those are also quite often more expensive. But look at outcomes: OP is correct to suggest that many students drop out; graduation rates at many large public schools are <50%. There are also private schools with graduation rates of 85%+. Cheapest does not always mean most cost effective.\n\nFun fact: for many students an \"expensive\" school can be cheaper than a \"affordable\" one if you are simply comparing sticker price. Private colleges engage in [tuition discounting](https://www.agb.org/briefs/tuition-discounting), which means few students actually pay the sticker price; much of that is  done through merit aid so high-performing high school students should never decide \"I can't pay for that school\" until they have received a finacial aid package for comparison. At my school-- which indeed has a high price tag --a strong applicant from a family with $100K income might well end up paying less than they would at State U, which will not offer the same aid. They are also likely to require five years to graduate from State (because classes are often full) wheras our four year graduate rate is 2X that of State.\n\nIf all you care about is a credential-- a BA or BS on a piece of paper --then perhaps going to the absolute cheapest school you can find makes sense. But if you want an *education* it's worth being a bit more discerning about the process and taking into account more than just price. I say this as someone with degrees from public and private schools, and 35+ years experience as a student or profession in a wide range of institutions.",

          "text": "If a school isn't offering enough classes to get you through in 4 years, it's a shitty school and people shouldn't be going there. That's part of a different conversation that isn't mentioned here on \"what questions to ask colleges before picking one\". I'll let you post that one. That's an entirely different issue that is important to be addressed. Don't forget to mention the point about state schools often having students that work more hours and take fewer classes per term: not because the school isn't offering them but because they have to work to support themselves and sometimes their families. \n\nIf someone can find a private school that is cheaper and offers a good education, go there. That's my point overall: don't take out more loans than you need to, save money where you can. Private schools in general do cost more, and students are more likely to have to live on campus, costing more money overall. I absolutely disagree about the quality of education though. Public schools in the sciences are often much better funded than smaller private schools. They often have more faculty of different specializations. For chemistry for example, you need a certain number of faculty and certain instruments to even get accredited by the American Chemical Society. Smaller universities can't hit that mark. My point being, price tag isn't always indicative of quality of a school, and often times public schools and community colleges do a stellar job of getting students where they need to be. I've turned down quite a few jobs at ranked private schools because they couldn't offer the same quality of education as a similarly sized unranked public school. It's a commonly held belief, and one I adamantly disagree with. Good students will always succeed, and I think you're really underestimating the quality of state schools; based on your comment above it sounds like you worked at a bad one(s) that didn't even offer enough classes for their student body.

This is supposedly to allow upperclassmen to get the classes they need so they can graduate. But the result is Freshman who are behind in units immediately, who then also struggle to get their classes in order to graduate. You could avoid this by taking many AP classes in high school and receiving credit for them which would allow you to enter with enough units to allow you to finish in 4 years.

              "text": "> I absolutely disagree about the quality of education though. Public schools in the sciences are often much better funded than smaller private schools. They often have more faculty of different specializations. For chemistry for example, you need a certain number of faculty and certain instruments to even get accredited by the American Chemical Society. Smaller universities can't hit that mark.\n\nLots of private schools offer ACS chemistry majors, including the one I attended and two at which I've taught. Certainly there are differences in resources and priorities between schools; if you want to be an engineer it's probably not a great idea to attend an SLAC that doesn't have an engineering major. But if you look at the top producers of Rhodes, Truman, and Fullbright scholarships (just as one kind of metric) private schools are disproportionally represented, especially so amoung batchelors-granting institutions.\n\nPublic vs private isn't a clearcut issue on any scale. There are great schools on either side of that divide, and poor ones as well. I've been fortunate to work and study as some very good private schools, and some very good public ones. In my experience the huge public schools-- 40K+ students --are a real mixed bag, while the extremely well resourced larger privates are generally excellent. At the lower end of the size scale there are huge differences though; smaller private schools are expensive because they invest so much in teaching whereas small public schools are often quite marginal. Which is most suitable depends on the student, the major, and their goals. ",

I have former students who have gone on to the top med schools in the country, we have Rhodes scholars (multiple in my college but I don't know across the university), etc... you are acting like a public PUI isn't interested in stellar teaching when at least in the sciences, that is first and foremost the more important hiring criteria across the board. We aren't research-based schools, so what other criteria would they be hiring off of? Is it not that way in the humanities? I'm wondering if our takes on this are due to small sample size in experience (because we obviously haven't surveyed every department in the country), or if it is an issue of the difference between STEM and humanities. Maybe humanities at a public PUI hire bottom barrel people who can't do their jobs? The big schools are often teaching students with grad TAs who don't care, and I don't consider the education at those schools to be largely spectacular, but a lot of private schools I know of in my state and surrounding states have very limited resources in the sciences.

Their students are generally stronger with higher ACT scores. I don't think that makes for any sort of informative comparison to the quality of the school though.\n\nI do actually, because that's the one factor research says *is* highly important in terms of impacting outcomes. Selectivity does have an important impact on outcomes, and due to mission comparably-sized privates are likely to be more selective than their pubic counterparts (I'm talking about schools with <3K students, let's say).  One challenge in skimming the research on outcomes is that most of the studies focus on straight ROI: [does the increased post-college earnings potential make up for the additional up-front cost?](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/does-it-matter-where-you-go-to-college/257227/) I personally hate the idea of measuring college outcomes by salary, because a good many students don't go to college with the simply intent of maximizing lifetime wages-- they go to become teachers, social workers, non-profit directors, poets, and a range of other things that are motivated by things other than salary.\n\nReally, the bottom line is there are excellent and terrible schools in both the public and private sectors. The good ones emphasize teaching, support their students, and have campus cultures that encourage lots of student/faculty contact (including research). The bad ones disregard teaching, leave students to forge their own paths, and relay on TAs or adjuncts to deliver \"course content\" in pre-manufactured chunks while faculty are either off in a lab on their own or simply \"off\" (in the case of those schools where faculty only come to campus when obligated and spend their time elsewhere when not). It's been my experience that $$$ private schools tend to invest more in teaching and have more supportive campus climates *because that is their \"product\" and comparative advantage,* while similarly-sized public schools tend to be run on efficiency models that making offering similar services impossible. One simply indicator in adjunct faculty practice: at my private university our faculty is 84% tenure/tenure-track and almost all of the balance are full-time, multi-year contracts. I have a friend who works at a mid-sized public institution where the faculty is about 40% tenure/tenure-track and the bulk of their courses are taught by adjunct/term faculty. That makes a massive difference in the quality of the student experience even if those adjunct faculty are all outstanding teachers, because they aren't there long term, aren't supported by the institution, and aren't likely to be doing research that keeps them current and informs their teaching. It's a matter of resources.\n\nI would not be surprised to see data that suggests that public/private schools of similar size, mission, and resources have identical outcomes. But those key markers often do not align. My point was simply that the frequent claim that \"all degrees are the same\" and that students should attend the least expensive school possible doesn't really make sense if they are concerned with education vs. credentialing. I just went through this with a nephew, who is a top academic performer and a potential D-I varsity athlete. He looked at a bunch of schools and ended up picking a D-II school he liked over a much better D-III school due to athletics...the D-II was cheaper (public) than the D-III (private), but it also has a 42% five year graduation rate vs an 80% *four year* graduation rate. The faculty at the public school are clearly less accomplished, there doesn't appear to be much research going on there, and few of their students go on to graduate school. But it came in about $5K/year cheaper, so that's what he picked. I think it was a poor choice, and doubt he will maximize his academic potential in that setting vs the private alternative. ",

          "text": "> there are ~4,500 colleges in the US and whatever people might say the \"product\" they offer is not consistant across all institutions. Not all colleges are created equal, and not all offer equal educational opportunities. In fact, there is a tremendous gulf between poor/middling/elite schools both in subtance and in outcomes-- in part due to who is in the seats next to you. If you choose to attend a highly selective school you will be in classes with other high-performing students, which raises the bar in almost every way. It is also likely to mean you will benefit from a much better network after college-- who you know is important, and it doesn't require an Ivy degree for that to make a difference. \n\nTo a certain extent, I agree with you. My college's STEM department focuses a lot on the communication abilities of its students. That means they heavily emphasize reading and writing articles, as well as talking about one's subject in a way that people outside the field can understand. Yes, even in industry-oriented fields like computer science. Meanwhile, I've met plenty of STEM majors at other institutions - including some top ones - who clearly have never taken any writing courses besides AP English and the gut course that satisfies the divisional requirement, and it shows in how incoherent their articles and papers are. \n\nI also wish people would stop touting community college as a perfect solution to everyone's educational problems. The sad fact is that a lot of community colleges have sub-par academics and advising, do not prepare you for four-year college, and (this is most important for me) do not honor disability accommodations. \n\n>On a more practical basis, not all students are well suited to all types of schools. Some may do well in a lecture hall setting with 400 classmates, while others will thrive only in small classes (say 20-25) with much more direct attention from the instructor.\n\nAmen. I go to a SLAC and my current classes have no more than 15 students. My brother *wants* to go to a large public state school with huge class sizes. I can't comprehend this mentality, but he's much more extroverted than I am and can probably succeed in a place like that. Now I just have to convince his mother... \n\n>OP is correct to suggest that many students drop out; graduation rates at many large public schools are <50%. There are also private schools with graduation rates of 85%+\n\nTo be fair, many public schools draw from a larger swath of the population that is *predisposed* to drop out. The same people would have dropped out if they had gone to an elite private college. They go for the default option and can't hack it. People who go to private liberal arts schools are a minority among high school graduates. \n\n>Fun fact: for many students an \"expensive\" school can be cheaper than a \"affordable\" one if you are simply comparing sticker price. \n\nI am attending my current SLAC for a cost smaller than that of my home state's *cheaper* state schools. A common misconception among low-income students is that private elite schools are completely closed off to them. I was able to apply to a large number of these schools through fee waivers (due to being on free/reduced lunch) and got substantial financial aid packages from many that offered a much better deal than I would have gotten at my state's public schools.

      "text": "I agree with this post.\n\nI went to a 4 year private liberal arts college, it cost me $117k for 4 years. My parents mandated I go to school there even though they had a very limited list of majors. At the end of my freshman year I got stabbed by some people I thought were my friends. The school did literally nothing to help me regarding this and local police ceded authority to campus police (due to local legislation) who ceded authority to the vice president of student life (due to school policy) who didnt respond to the attack or my case until the end of my senior year. During my sophomore year I looked into transferring to another college... And none of the credits I already had would transfer at all (schools in Texas are still sort of like this but less so now a days because they talk to each other more now). So at $30k into a 4 year education my parents and I decided we'd wait for the school to make a disciplinary decision, which they didn't. Long story short the vice president of student life really screwed up, the guys who attacked me wrote me death threats for 4 years, and when I made complaints to school officials higher up, due to a lot of evidence the school lost, they were unable to do anything and instead mandated that I had to post a written apology to my attackers around campus for committing an act of slander against my attackers. It was bullshit and a terrible experience. They didn't offer a major I wanted, and had a limited selection to begin with, so I wound up with a ba in philosophy, and a really screwed up transcript that has caused problems pursuing further education. I have no senior level courses in my degree because the school didn't offer them, and I have more courses in my minor than my major, and my minor isn't even listed on my transcript. This has caused major problems pursuing a masters degree, and has caused major problems pursuing a second bachelor's degree. \n\nI have written my college a bad review on Google, yelp, etc... And that has caused the vice president of student life to call and harass me a number of times since graduating 8 years ago. He's hostile on the phone, and sometimes makes vague threats of physical violence. I've changed my phone number a few times, and I've recorded some of the phone calls. I've submitted everything to the police local to my area as well but what he's doing doesn't meet the legal definition of harassment due to time scale issues, and his threats of violence are too vague for the police to prosecute him. \n\nIt really sucks and I wish I hadn't gone to college at all, I wish my parents had been less dead set on the school I went to, they wish they hadn't been so dead set on it as well, my mother has developed an alcohol problem as a coping mechanism since graduating (for according to her \"damaging her kids before college and during\"), I wish the credits had been transferrable, I wish the school offered a computer science degree when I went to school there (they do now though), and I wish there had been a less violent student body at the college I went to, and most of all... I wish I didn't have a little round hard lumpy scar on the side of my torso from being stabbed, because it itches sometimes still and everytime I scratch at it, it's a constant reminder of the awful traumatic events I've been through.

Mine is like a 3.0\n\nThat said, don't fail and a high GPA can help get your foot in the door, especially at te first job. A low(er) GPA will close more doors to you.",

Many schools will even list the employers who come back year after year to recruit. \n\nA good career services office should also offer help with resumes and interviewing skills.

(I did actually change my major, and while that was the right decision and the material is far more interesting to me, it didn't suddenly make everything easy like I thought - be realistic with yourself.) I ended up figuring out how to study properly/took the summer to work and think, went back at it with a vengeance in the fall, and started getting some of the top grades in the class. I went straight from academic warning to the honor roll between terms (it only looks at the last term), and have had nothing below an A- all year (we do quarters, so that was 2 terms straight). In my case, I needed to spend more time reading the textbook, doing review, managing my time, and looking at the big picture/conceptuals.\n\nYou have to know what works for you, and be quick to change as needed.",
