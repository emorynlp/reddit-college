  "text": "Hi! I am a current freshman and the University of Minnesota, although I am set to graduate in three years instead of the typical four. I am thinking about the possibility of taking a gap year starting Fall 2022. I have been struggling with mental health and finance issues, as well as the loss of 4 grandparents in a short span of the past year. I am an independent student with no financial support from my parents, I am worried about how I am going to pay for next semester and next year along with my sorority dues which I pay in installments every month. I do work a job but it is a minimum wage campus job with few hours because I spend a lot of time in class and studying. I literally had $6 in my bank account with no savings before I got paid today. I believe that by taking a gap year I will not only be able to refresh and work on my mental health, but work on saving money working a full time job (probably as a travel cna/cna because I do have my experience and my license). I need opinions on this because I am very conflicted!",
