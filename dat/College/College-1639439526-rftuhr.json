      "text": "all the food options on campus close before 6pm for some reason so most nights i have to go without dinner. going off campus for food isn\u2019t really an option because a) i\u2019m broke and b) traffic is always insane in my college town. i lost a ton of weight this semester due to lack of access to a sufficient diet. i\u2019m definitely not getting enough nutrients either because i have zero energy all the time. but this school is one of the very few that\u2019s in the right location for what i\u2019m studying (recording industry), and it\u2019s already a really uncommon major, so i\u2019m kinda stuck here. the quality of education and the overall vibe on campus are great, but my physical health has to suffer due to never having the option to eat dinner and not really having healthy options for breakfast or lunch either",

My mental health was already starting to crumble, but halfway through college it completely collapsed never to be repaired. I'm 25 and 3 1/2 years out of college and I still have no passion for life, no hope for the future, and no motivation to do anything.",

I realized this at around 12:30 am so I got to work. This was two chapter worth of work so I had about 6 assignments. Two of which were around 40 questions each. I pulled and all nighter, without any freaking coffee like a crazy person because my anxiety was that bad. I zoomed through everything as fast as I could to at least get SOME sleep but I had finished everything at around 8:00 am and I had an exam at 8:30 so I didn\u2019t even bother. I passed the class with a 98%. I felt defeated after that, but wait there\u2019s more. I had an exam for my bio class at 11:30 which I had ALSO FORGOTTEN ABOUT. I got a 67. Passed the class with a 91. That was the scariest 12 hours of my life",
