  "text": "I'm a 20 years old studying physics, but I have advances almost nothing in my career. To put it in perspective, I finished highschool in 2018 and to this day, I have only finished one semester ( seven courses).\n\nThere are different reasons for this: First, I never learned math the proper way in highschool, so when I made it into college I faliled the first math class for the first time.\n\nSencondly, I never struggled in school (except for math), so I always had a rather relaxer and over-confident aproach towards studying.\n\nThirdly, I failed multiple courses several times, so let's wasted a whole year doing nothing.\n\nFourtly, i honestly wasn't prepared for college, even though I was very enthusiastic at the beggining.\n\nTo keep studying feels like a waste of time to me at this point. I have not really advanced for the stage of my life I'm in (having been three years in college now). However, I still love physics i would like to finish my degree even when it seems like a unreacheable goal.\n\nI wished to talk to somebody about this and this subreddit looked like a good place to do it.\n\nI would like to read some advice and thoughs on y situation. I will be honest and transparent in my replies.\n\nAlso, have in mind that I don't live in the U.S, so the education system here is a bit different, and sorry for the spelliing, english is not my mother tongue.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think you should drop out. Not because I believe everyone should go to college, but because it sounds like you\u2019re the type of person who should. You obviously care about it a lot. I just think you need to reset your goals and seriously think about changing your major. I personally hated college, changed majors twice and graduated with something I had no idea how to utilize. I just wanted out. I NEVER thought I\u2019d go back, but that\u2019s because I never had a plan in mind or a goal in reach.\n\nI\u2019m now in grad school after taking a break and working a dead end job. I finally discovered that I want to be a counselor, and now my useless degree is the stepping stone I needed to get into a masters program. Everything is working out for me now. My only regret is not figuring it out sooner. So I am suggesting you take a few days for mental clarity, talk to someone (school advisor, etc.) and figure out a new goal. I know you love physics, but you don\u2019t have to make it your life and kill yourself in the process. Hope this helps. You\u2019re going to be okay in the end. Just remember that.",

          "text": "Well, curiosity is a force that really drives me forward, and I have always liked the idea of being an educated person, degree kind of educated. And yes, I' ve thought of changing major many times. I love physics, but economics interests me as well, and some people have advised me to do it as well, given that the later major is less mathematics heavy, and in the words of my mom, \"they didn't really tough you mathematics in school, so you are well prepared for such degree as physics\".",

              "text": "If they didn't teach you mathematics properly in school, then it may be time to learn how teach yourself, which is an invaluable skill to have. You can also probably access school resources such as math tutoring, professors' office hours, and the like; you could even try making your own study group with classmates, because chances are at least someone is struggling with content which you are, too! \n\nIf you're interested in physics, which I'd say the layman isn't, then I'd wager you're likely capable of it. It is a ludicrous amount of work at times, but you might, or might not find fulfilling (depending on who you are and what your interests are), and your career prospects won't be shabby at all either.",

      "text": "Totally sounds reasonable. However, you need realistic. \n\nEvery year you are not in the workforce has the cost of not only one year of lost wages, but the effect of interest on it. It's something huge ( was in personal finance class but I've forgotten amount). So getting to work on your career quickly is important. \n\nThe problem is, what career? Where can you be happy doing physics and passing at this point? \n\nA college degree is like a union card - it opens up doors that are closed to those who don't have one.\n\nPhysics is something that requires advanced degrees in order to make a good living. Bachelor's level physicists don't make much. What could be great for you is to become a physics teacher for high schools. You'd be able to share your love of physics and make it contagious. You don't have to study it to a high level to teach. It's relatively e\u00e0sy to pick up the education classes while you study the hard courses too. \n\nThink about it. The faster you can get it the better!",

I really wanted to graduate and get a masters. \n\nI know some programming and I know i don't need to go to university to get good at that.\n\n\"Where can you be happy doing physics and passing at this point?\" I honestly chose physics out of curiosity.  When i took my decision I wasn't expecting high salaries, in fact, I was thinking more of having my own bussines (a technology company) with the knowledge adquired in the degree.\n\nAnd yes, the faster I get it the better, and that's really what brings me down the most. All my friends from highschool already advanced a lot in their career (most of them chose medicine), they are in like their sevent semester at this point and they went to private universities.\n\nAnd finally, thanks for your advice, it really was a touch of reality.",

              "text": "I *do not* think you should drop out. You are the one who loves learning and you are discouraged. Fight it out!\n\nI had a horrible background from a podunk high school. I really wanted to be a math major, but my Precal didn't even include trig. I was so lost. I became an econ major (highly recommend if you can do the math); for you, a business major would help you with that future tech firm. \n\nSome close friends have considered engineering because they love tech and their lives wouldn't be complete without it. They chose various business options and they love what they are learning because it's practical. They are going to career fairs with tech firms, and because they are fluent in nerd speak, they totally fit in. They've had internships at *tech* firms in business offered for next summer already. They will be parallel to tech majors, but in a position to later manage people! How cool is that?\n\nAnd yes, you don't need a CS degree, but the degree gets you in the door. My oldest sibling was a stem major and was really disappointed by starting salaries for bachelor's when he finally went to career fair senior year. Then he talked to CS majors who were bragging, and he went to talk to those recruiters about what he knew and what he'd done - mainly in high school. He went through competitive hiring and got 3 offers. He's now a programming engineer, but majored in pure science. If he didn't have that bachelor's, he could not get this job. \n\nThere are easier ways of getting degrees than 4 years on a competitive campus. Your bad grades currently taint your transcript. My other brother augered in in engineering school, with a gpa below 1 second term. He transferred using ea.asu.edu and is graduating just one semester later. His early passed classes show, none of the fs, and he'll graduate magna cum laude. Can't beat that!",

I've changed my mind about grad school and have had to think about changing career plans.\n\nIf I were you I wouldn't drop out. You clearly enjoy the subject. Don't feel bad that you struggle with it.. Its really tough. However, I also don't think you should kill yourself to get to the degree. Talk to an advisor, or even take a semester off and really think about what you want to do. Maybe get a Physics minor and then get a Business or CS Major. \n\nhope that helps. You got this!",
