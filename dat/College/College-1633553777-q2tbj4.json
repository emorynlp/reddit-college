  "text": "Like the typical person i zone out and get lost, except i get A LOT. I try my absolute hardest to keep focus and i actively try my best to pay attention, but sometimes no matter what Im always slipping away. For example in math today (only a 50 minute lecture) I probably spent about 20-25 of those minutes telling myself \u201ci need to pay attention here\u201d after i catch myself getting lost into my thoughts or whatever it is that happens. It happens mostly in math but it does happen in other classes really often. Its a serious problem, and its not that im not trying or im lazy I seriously want to fix this but idk what it is or why its happening.",
