  "text": "If I move onto campus from Out of state this coming august, will I be able to register to vote in that state for 2022, or will I still have to vote in my home state via absentee ballot? I know its usually not possible to establish residency in a state while living in a dorm-- anyone know how this works? Is there an established exception to the rule for college students?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

          "text": "Hi, to follow up: you're getting some bad advice on this thread. If you attend college out of state, it is your right to register to vote either in your home state (\"permanent address,\" absentee ballot) OR at your college address. But whichever state you choose, you have to be registered to vote in that state. Different states have different laws regarding how long you have to live there to register. (My own state for example doesn't have any restrictions. You could register to vote the day you move there.) Google \"register to vote in [state] college students\" for info for your specific state.\n\nNote also that \"residency\" for the purposes of voting isn't necessarily the same as residency status for the purposes of tuition. This probably also varies by state.",

But that will vary by state, and you almost certainly do have the option of which state to register in, regardless.",
