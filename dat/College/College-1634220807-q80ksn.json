  "text": "for context: the schools local intranet went down to the point where we couldn't connect to wifi on Tuesday, he still pulled up his notes and taught us just fine without internet access, it's a little ridiculous that he's stated he'll give us basically no notice for an 8am class if it's cancelled, for some of us it's our only class on those days and we'll have wasted a trip there",
