  "text": "I\u2019m a junior and only experienced my first semester freshman year in person. During that semester I didn\u2019t do very well but attributed it to the transition to college. I forgot how much time in person school takes up little things like walking from class to class and waiting for food take up way more time. Online I could hop on a zoom call one minute before and be fine and I could other things in the background of meetings. Since everything was online I also feel I didn\u2019t get a good grasp of certain subjects and having open note tests has wiped out all my study skills. I took the intro class for my major online and choose it thinking it would be a good choice but now that we are in person I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s entirely different in person and I hate it. My major Accounting has 7 Week semesters and class everyday and I am struggling so much with the workload. Our accounting professor expects 30 hours a week just on his class. I don\u2019t enjoy a single class this semester and my favorite class is my gen Ed English class. My one professor is also just really mean to me. I\u2019m so lost as to whether to switch majors to something I actually enjoy but as a junior switching seems harder than just toughing it out even though I hate my major and I\u2019m struggling. I also have adhd and sometimes my brain doesn\u2019t feel like it works well with such a detail oriented subject I have zero interest in. I\u2019ve been involved in a lot of different clubs but had a though time making friends my freshman year and being online made it so difficult to make new friends. Staying here longer than I have to sounds like my worst nightmare. Everyone else seems so sure and I hate that as a junior I still don\u2019t know what to do with my life.",

      "text": "I completely relate. I personally loved online school because I could wake up 2 minutes before my class and be fine. I\u2019d also get a shit ton of work done between classes because I didn\u2019t waste any time walking to a different building, waiting in line for 30 min to get food, etc. Everything in college now takes SO long, in addition to the fact that I now share a communal bathroom in my old ass dorm and even small tasks like taking a shower take so much longer because I have to put on my mask, walk all the way there from my dorm, hang up my shower caddy, take off my mask, take out each individual item, etc... There are 24 hours in a day but somehow I feel like the whole day escapes me and I never end up getting much done. I\u2019m scared that maybe in person college isn\u2019t for me because now I feel like everything distracts me and takes up time and I can never seem to focus (even asked my friend about getting diagnosed with ADHD).",
