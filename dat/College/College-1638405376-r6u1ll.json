No other exceptions. I think I've missed only a like 2 classes this semester. \n\nOne was because I was having a prolonged panic attack about presenting for a classes and couldn't handle going to my class before that one. The other was because I ate some sugary stuff, went to the library (it was a Zoom session), logged on, then promptly fell asleep. I have no recollection of what went on for that lesson so I considered myself absent.\n\nPersonally, it's easy for me to fall behind once I miss a class. Even if I read the material. I envy the students who miss days and days of classes and knows wtf is going on once they *do* come. \n\nI especially try not to miss my major specific classes because it's a smaller tight knit track and the professors end up knowing you personally. \n\n\nIdk if you asked this for fun or not, but I just want to post that I don't want anyone \"feeling bad\" for not attending each class. Everyone is different. If I don't attend class I'll end up feeling guilty and it raises my anxiety. For some people attending classes raises their anxiety or isn't too beneficial. I know of people who get even MORE confused when the professor explains stuff, and prefer to learn things themselves. If not attending classes isn't affecting your grade, then don't sweat it. Don't fool yourself though, if you can't maintain a passing grade, *go to class*. \n\nAs and Bs are nice and all, but not at the cost of your mental health. They won't matter unless you're going onto do something post-grad anyway(Masters, Doctorates, PhDs) or professional school (vet, dentistry, pharmacy, medical, law, PT)",

          "text": "I happy to hear your different views, yet I still find the possibility that my reasoning can prevail.   Firstly, why pay literally thousands if you can learn on your own. Just learn on your own. If it\u2019s better to learn that way for you, that\u2019s great. Elon Musk says university isn\u2019t for learning anymore. You can learn anything on your own these days. I feel I learn faster while learning from professor than by myself, though. Second, for those who don\u2019t feel it meets learning style or it\u2019s too fast then you can continue learning by yourself but do it before lecture. Pre read the content. Then go to class after learning it. You\u2019ll gain more than you think from it, and again why not if you are paying for it. Also, Veritassium, a credible science YouTube creator, claims that learning styles are one of the largest myths in education.  Lastly, I agree that there are certainly those cases where time is scarce and professors aren\u2019t ideal. Still, however, I don\u2019t see how we are fixing the issue by skipping. Education can increase in price while value decreases or remains constant. It probably make sense to fill out one of the mid semester and final semester surveys about professor evaluation. I\u2019d probably also email the professor of class isn\u2019t working out for you. Maybe I was giving the professor too much credit but I believe they hold a lot of power that we often don\u2019t tap into. They are people too. There are part of the 2% that hold PhDs. I\u2019d point out to them where they could improve to help you learn better. I print out lecture notes before the class my professor goes too fast for me to learn or write. Because of these printed notes that my professor provides, I have an A+ in the class. If a professor did not have these available, maybe it could be helpful to ask if they could. You are paying them. Make sure you don\u2019t do it in a Karen fashion, or teachers pet fashion, but suggest improvements so you have an incentive to use your dollars worth. \n\nApologies for the lengthy response.\n\ntl;dr: u pay good $ for them to teach u. If you can learn on own, then why pay. Learn by yourself before hand and then go to lecture if you find lecture useless. We\u2019re not fixing underlying issue with skipping. (Not a cheap thing to ignore)",

To clarify if I work I make more than I would have spent on the class so it literally isn't worth my time. The exception to this would be a class where I GAINED something by going in person, which I never do. I tried in person classes and showed up but it's literally a waste of my time most of the time. \n\nTo answer your why pay question because self taught skills are not as marketable as institution taught skills. Unless you have a decent portfolio of projects that show your skill in your field than you probably won't be getting any interviews. You might ask than why not just build a portfolio and I'd say to much time constraint and a little bit of laziness. Also if you go to school in fields that require certifications (like CPA) you can't just be self taught, you have to attend school per the requirements set by your state. \n\nAs far as learning styles being myth, sure you can believe whatever you want. I know myself well enough to know anyone talking at me for more than 7 minutes will have most of what they say forgotten. I read a book take a few notes, I'll remember that 7 years later, I know because I still know the answers to my certification exams for IT despite not having touched or worked in IT for 7 years.",

Keep in mind I\u2019m still in community college so 1) I\u2019m not currently paying for the classes I\u2019m in and 2) I\u2019ve only had one professor so far that took attendance in a meaningful way and it was only cause she wanted us to come and do the labs. Technically all of my computer science related professors took and graded attendance, but it counted so little towards our grade that people would skip half the class and still get Bs. Often times the professors will take attendance but straight up say \u201cthis is only so I could get a feel of who\u2019s actually coming so when people ask for extra credit I know\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve only missed three days so far (so technically two in one course and three in another) so far this semester and I know I won\u2019t miss any others unless I pretty much die cause from here on out it\u2019s finals/finals review lmao. First one was a snow storm, one professor cancelled and the other decided not to. Second one was illness. Third one is today and it\u2019s cause my professor said we\u2019re not learning any new material, just reviewing a topic I already know pretty well and the other professor doesn\u2019t really teach anything. I love the dude but pretty much everything I\u2019ve learned in his class has been online since in his actual lecture he just goes on about personal stories and long winded analogies so I always leave feeling like it was sort of a waste. Especially since I\u2019m a Comp Sci major, it\u2019s pretty common for students to prioritize getting coding work in/working on their portfolios over making sure they do excellent in every class.\n\nSo TLDR: it depends on whether I feel I need the material for that day and if the professor cares that I\u2019m there, which I think is what the majority of decent college students do.",

She skipped all the time in favor of studying for her microbiology class. We're about to do our final and she just realized she's going to be automatically failed for our class even though she's made decent grades on all the assignments. She's is currently trying to plead with the school because if she fails the class she's going to be dropped from her scholarships and the nursing program she's in. \n\nMoral of the story is always read your syllabus and go to class unless you're sick, even then be sure to email the professor.",

I'm half-listening to stuff that's going on, but I'm typically reading the textbook and doing the homework. I see it as keeping me honest - if it turns out that the class is harder than I anticipated, it takes much less effort to increase participation than it does to completely change my entire routine to start going to class again.\n\nMost of my professors have been indifferent to this, especially after I get a good grade on the first midterm.
