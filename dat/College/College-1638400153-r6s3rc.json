  "text": "I was always excited to try partying and do these stuff since I couldn\u2019t in my country. But since I\u2019m in the UK now, I want to do it. But i have no idea how\n\nI\u2019m new to the country so I basically know no one. Most of the people in my foundation year are new here as well and it\u2019s hard for me befriend them because i lack the social skills to just go and somehow be their friend \n\nHow can i do that??",
