  "text": "**It's kinda a lot but i just want to know what's possible given my circumstances.\n\nIn my mid 20s, Ive been doing the best I can after a year break to get back on track and been recovering from poor mental health, losing contact with family from stupid drama, fiance of 5yrs leaving me me, and i had moved like three times this year. I currently work at amazon graveyard shifts that are ruining my sleep patterns. \n\nIt's been hard keeping up and I barely pass my courses. Nevertheless, I plowed through most of my lower division and am taking my first upper division courses right now.  But I am missing 1-2 prerequisites for my next upper division courses and I know I won't be allowed to bypass these requirements. **I am a physics major btw. \n\nI will have to wait another year while i retake the the last few prerequisites.  I had basically needed to pay out of pocket/loans since my 2nd year at the UC. Itll be my 6th year (excluding the year i left) soon. Im exhausted and can't wait another year but should I just suck it up and take this chance to improve by the time the upper division courses i need come around again? Or should i just accept my losses? (I may be dismissed as well given that my academic standing/gpa is teetering by like 0.1 points. So i would probably have to take the lower division at community and readmit myself or apply to another UC if that's even possible :/)\n\nWill I even be able to do any career related to my field without my degree? \n\nI really don't know what to do from here. I do like my major but with everything that happened it took me forever to just stand back up on my feet and move forward. It's a lot of things that are not in my favor.... what is the best course of action?\n\n*** edit: I am specializing in computational physics and want to get into a data analyst job. But I am open to other jobs using programs such as python, SQL, and others. How can I start building my portfolio to get into said career and what other jobs let me start getting experience using these programs?",

So it did leave an impact on me and i still feel rushed even tho I don't have her breathing down my neck anymore. but now i see I can't go in at the pace I want given the circumstances I'm coming from. I'm already nearing the finish line, might as well do it right and slow down.",
