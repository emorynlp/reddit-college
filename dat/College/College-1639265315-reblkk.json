  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI don't have anyone immediately to me that can probably relate (or not), but here is my situation without doxxing myself:\n\nI have moved twice in the past 2 years, which means I am now at my second university. However, my boyfriend , who obviously didn't have a chaotic 2 years like I did, is about to graduate very soon while I'm probably set for Spring 2023. With his graduation approaching, I'm starting to feel inferior about myself and my situation; I feel like I'm falling behind compared to him. It feels lonely and quite depressing, to be honest. \n\nI understand that he and I have had different situations since I moved twice and he stayed in one place--I've had to complete pretty much 2 school exclusive requirements. Still doesn't make it hurt any less, though.\n\nI've always been someone that talks down in themselves, it's just natural to me and I suffer from feeling inferior to everyone else and this feeling of being behind stings even more. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person in the world, even. Which is why I'm reaching out here to see if maybe I'm not alone as a 20 something year old feeling left behind...\n\nHas anyone felt like this? Seeing other people in your age group graduate much earlier than you? If so, how do you deal with this? Any help is appreciated. Thank you, kind people.",

      "text": "Hey, I totally understand what your feeling and it\u2019s the same thing I\u2019m going through now. My boyfriend is graduating earlier than me as well, but he grew up being able to stay on track for school, but on my end of life situations happen where you ofc you can\u2019t take as many classes as you want. Then I realized that I need to congratulate myself more about the effort I\u2019m putting into school. Because at the end of the day, I made the choice to continue pursuing something for my future and giving myself opportunities that my older generations didn\u2019t have. Basically I kind of give myself credit and keep pushing myself because if you, don\u2019t that little voice will always keep creeping in and staying you aren\u2019t good enough or smart enough and that everyone\u2019s ahead of you. I decided to stop letting that voice take over me and believe I can do it. Because even if I\u2019m not on the same track to graduate as my other peers, I still know I\u2019m going graduate and that life and education is not a race. Not everyone is built the same way or raised the same. We are all set uniquely born different and we must always acknowledge the great thing we do no matter how little, because we can seek validation from others but it won\u2019t mean much if you don\u2019t see it in you. I\u2019ve always felt like the dumb kid growing, but I started feeling proud of myself because I managed to get into college, even though others did better, I stopped focusing on what they were doing and acknowledged myself more. Not saying I don\u2019t feel like that dumb kid, but I replaced the dumb with a girl who is trying and will make it in life, and that calling myself dumb means I\u2019m okay with disrespecting and lowering myself. So I had to have a serious talk with myself and realize that I needed to boost my confidence and stop allowing negative talk into my life. Because I will always live in my body, but what use is it if I keep saying hurtful things in the place I reside in. It\u2019s almost like being in a empty room and screaming outloud. Wouldn\u2019t there be a time you stop and think , this isn\u2019t right. That\u2019s what I did and honestly it was best thing I did. Because how you feel about yourself effects you alotttt, and I learned that the hard way. you can be your own enemy or your biggest supporter. I know it sounds easier than done, but trust me it\u2019s a process, but it comes with so much self love and freedom. You are you and always be proud of what you do and what you know is to come. We are still young and we can\u2019t continue to give into the negative talk otherwise it\u2019ll always eat away at our potential. I\u2019ve had a hard life growing , but I also knew I can\u2019t keep wearing the past, on an outfit of the future. \n\nAlso I used to be sad about  people younger than me graduating at like 19 , but then I stopped and I\u2019m like nah this stuff is HARD, and 80% of the time these are people who like graduated HS earlier or had college credits coming in and I\u2019m just like damn, but hey they were raised into a life that gave them opportunity to move quicker than others. So I can\u2019t hate on it, but only focus on myself and my make my own path. Sometimes comparison is the thief of Joy. \n\nHope my message helps have more clarity and understanding that you aren\u2019t alone, and to not keep beating up yourself up about it. You are uniquely you \ud83d\udc93  \n\nFrom, Fellow 20 something year old, graduating hopefully spring 2023 \ud83d\ude05",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing all this with me, I'm so amazed at how similar our situations are--especially our hopeful graduation date!! \ud83d\ude2eI'm also so grateful you took the time to write your experiences out for me to learn from, I really appreciate that. \u2764\n\nYou are totally right about everything you said; I need to be proud of myself for making it to where I am despite what life has thrown at me in the past and even now. I've always compared myself to other people--both academically and even with drawing/painting--and I've never been a super duper happy person, so that saying about comparison being the thief of joy really speaks volumes to me.\n\nI was diagnosed with a speech delay when I was little (obviously I'm a bit better now), so all my life I've felt behind everyone else and I guess that feeling just stayed hidden with me all my life. But..I want to be happy and get to the future I want, and your words really inspired me and gave me a reality check. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "text": "I\u2019m so happy they did,because it\u2019s hard doing all this alone man. Sometimes the best support you can have is yourself and it\u2019s okay to have moments where your down, just remember the feeling is temporary and don\u2019t give it a permanent stay in your life. Also, I love that fact that you draw and paint as well. I actually recently picked back up on painting , because I discouraged myself for so long not to draw or paint, and I finally picked up on it again, and it felt nice too , because I always told myself I couldn\u2019t do it, when in fact you can. Never let your negative talk , take you out of your passions and hobbies. Leave that negative talk AT THE DOOR! You got this girl !",

I think art is a nice way to release stress and other negative feelings, it is nice to hear you picked it up! :) Thank you for the amazing talk and words of encouragement, I will never forget what you have told me here. You have no idea how much I needed your words right now. \u2764",
