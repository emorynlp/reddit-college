  "text": "Nothing really to it. My tapestry was a little too high on my dorm wall so my RA texted me to move it down a little bit. \n\nDid that but the office of student living still wants to place me on residential warning for it. Literally trying to get me to sign a letter that basically would be me admitting to \u2018disrupting the residential learning environment\u2019. Obviously not signing it because the guidelines never gave a specific measurement for how much the distance of the tapestry should be from the ceiling, so basically I was out of the loop\n\nLove to know how a fabric in my room is more disruptive than the kids who literally cause Armageddon in the study lounges every night. \n\nAnywho, I hope y\u2019all are having a better end of semester than I am.",

If the administrators had even the slightest modicum of respect, it would be a two minute conversation. \"Hey, just so you know, that's too high, let's get that lowered\" and then maybe review some of the other common violations.\n\nI've lived in slums where the landlord treated me with more respect than what you're describing.",
