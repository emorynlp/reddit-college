      "text": "I think its entirely up to you and what you want to do with a career. Are you doing the paralegal stuff because you like the subject, but its just hard? Are you ultimately pursuing law school? For the automotive path, research jobs and careers that you can utilize the degree in and see if thats even remotely anything you're going to want to do. I'd say go with whatever has enough general interest from you and what has good (doesnt have to be perfect) job prospects afterwards.",
