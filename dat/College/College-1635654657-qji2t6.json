  "text": "I feel out of place at my new college. I attend MSU Denver, which if anyone knows, is a university that has a campus combined with two other colleges. I once attended UNCO where I lived on the campus and had friends that from high school, went to that college. But because of financial issues, I had to transfer school and I took a gap year to figure out if it was a possibility to attend UNCO. I am a first gen too and this was my dream school (UNCO). So it broke my heart when I had to attend a different college that is seen as an \"Oh, if I can't get accepted to this college, then I guess I will go to this college that technically isn't a community college.\" I tried my best to be happy at this university. I would look around campus and try to imagine myself being here for the next 3-4 years of my life, interacting with people, and trying to be comfortable on campus whilst also having to go home at my mom's house (which I don't like being at, but can't afford to be anywhere else).  I don't know if it's because I don't live on campus or if it's because it doesn't feel like a real college experience, but I don't feel like I belong there. But I can't afford to go anywhere else. I am paying only over $300 per semester compared to the $10,000 I was paying at UNCO. I don't know how to make the experience better for me. I am seeing a counselor at the college, but I feel like I am being selfish for not being happy that I am at a college. Does anyone have any advice or in a similar situation?",
