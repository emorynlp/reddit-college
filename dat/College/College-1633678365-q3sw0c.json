  "text": "not to emotionally dump on here or anything but i\u2019m turning 23 in december and i have. no. fucking. idea. what i even want to do in my life. all i know is i\u2019m exhausted and so depressed from working for minimalistic jobs that i have to slave away at day in and out just to survive and pay my bills. i don\u2019t even know who i am as a person or know much of my actual interests. i\u2019m honestly just really sad and confused and overwhelmed because i started college late (when i was 20) then took a year off after covid hit and now i\u2019m back in school while working two part time jobs and i\u2019m just,,,,,,,, fucking sad. i was originally going to school for music production but i switched my major to social work this semester and i can\u2019t say that i hate it but the reality of how fucked up the world is that i\u2019ve been exposed to because of this program is weighing on me in such a negative way. i feel like i have this immense pressure that i\u2019ve put on myself, along with my best friend\u2019s mom who i love with, and idk what to do about it bc honestly, all i want to do is move to a deserted island and not have to worry about this capitalist and \u201cfinding your purpose\u201d bullshit anymore \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
