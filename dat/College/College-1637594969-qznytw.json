  "text": "So I currently attend university in the UK and I\u2019m enrolled in Information Technology\n\nI\u2019m writing this because I believe the college\u2019s lack of teaching is causing me to fail my subjects \n\nI have a project due on Wednesday in regards to creating a website, now, we were meant to have fully learned how to write in HTML and CSS write up languages for this project \n\nWe had one practical session each week since September and frankly, we learned nothing. We were sat infront of a computer and given a task, along with a full 38 page document with how to use HTML and CSS. The teacher that we were assigned to was unavailable for the entire semester, so we were given a substitute (who didn\u2019t know how to write in HTML) so he called a student who did, this student didn\u2019t know how to teach and therefore, she was asking me if I thought everything I was doing looked alright \n\nI feel like I\u2019m gonna fail and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it because the last 2 months have been wasted. Was this my fault?",

That's on you. However there can be inadequate instruction and inappropriate assessment resulting in a failure to meet the expectations of the class/department/university. Given what you've described I see no evidence of this.",
