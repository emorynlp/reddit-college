  "text": "So I'm a freshman in college and I've been in college for over a month now, but have yet to go to a party. I hear about people going to parties every weekend, and I don't even know where to find one. My roommate rushed a frat and he's a pledge now. He told me he'd bring me to the next party for his frat but he's been too busy with pledge shit and they haven't had an actual party in a while. So I'm just wondering where I can find parties? I feel like all parties are just frat parties and you need to know someone to go.",

Hey I'm new here you know anything going on this weekend?\n\nIt worked well for me. YMMV. \n\nBut small hangouts where you know most of the people there are A LOT more fun than big parties where you don't know many people IMO. Going to clubs is also fun, even if you only have two or three friends to go with you. But I am avoiding those until the covid situation improves.",

      "text": "It\u2019s kind of hard to get party details without being friends with people in Greek. A lot of my close friends are in frats or sororities, and girls in sororities usually know all the frat parties cause they\u2019re in group chats with the frats. Some of my girl friends who aren\u2019t in sororities also know a lot of the details because frat guys hit them up. If you find yourself around those people organically, it\u2019s not weird to ask about weekend plans and see if it comes up, but befriending them just for the purpose of getting into parties is trashy.",

Pretty much make friends with outgoing people and they'll know where to go.\n\nMy cop out answer is be friends with any semi-attractive girl...I had a friend that was getting invites to go to another party while we were at one already.",
