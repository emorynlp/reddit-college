All I can say is just relax and you know more than you think. The less I stressed the better I usually do. Don\u2019t put so much pressure on yourself! 27.5 is nothing! Like just show up and I\u2019m sure you can easily pass. Lol relax",

      "text": "Like out of a hundred? That seems doable. Still, that's very stressful if your grade is riding on that one test. \n\nI think you can do it, though. Get a good night's sleep and eat a hearty breakfast before the test. Study a bit right before you take it (nothing intensive, just polish what you know) and fate will handle the rest.\n\nYou've done what you can and that's enough. Regardless of how it turns out, the best thing you can do right now is to keep yourself in good working order. Get some rest, eat some food, and everything else will follow.\n\nYou've got this. I'll be rooting for you from OK!",
