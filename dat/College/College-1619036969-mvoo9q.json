  "text": "I'm barely passing classes at this point. Skip classes and binge watch them on 2x speed right before tests. BS the online assignments because I'm too lazy to use my brain. It's too easy to get credit without learning anything. I think I put in 1 hour of work total last week. Spend 10 minutes working then spend the rest of the day on YouTube. I've never been this lazy in my life, not sure what's wrong with me (I'm not depressed though). \n\nWho else is out here living their laziest life?",

In class I was just the average bloke who just gets by with a severe skill deficit in maths, having ample social contact with my friends was what often pulled me through as well as the structured routine of going to school every day. Now I can't even bother going through literal stacks of learning modules that have accumulated over 2 semesters, as well as not finding ample motivation to get on with them. I'm not even depressed or anything, just uncertain of what I'm supposed to do to get me to a job I still can't quite put my finger on. I could've gone for a gap year dedicating myself to practicing bass playing, soaking up all the enriching qualities playing music imparts to a mfer smh, would've been more enjoyable to say the least, and not be a complete waste of time.",

And me being a man I have to find a solution to that and find a solution to this situation and get both of us from this ass hole. \n\nI came up with a plan of how to fix it but Im supper skeptical of it because all my other plans before have failed. \n\nI am really not sure about things and trying to be positive. But the approaching of the retakes is fucking terrifying.  \n\nPlease share some stories of how you dealed or dealing with failed classes and this year, would really appreciate",

      "text": "I was similar in college, my senior year was spent playing clash of clans throughout the classes I hated. In-class breaks to the snack machine to get poptarts were a daily occurrence. And group study sessions always turned into Call of Duty lol. When I left college, I think it was even worse. I ended up taking a job I wasn't thrilled about, but was a seemingly wise career move. Failed a licensing test and couldn't continue with it. Next 3 years were spent in jobs I hated, mildly depressed and very apathetic.\n\nI finally started applying to teaching English abroad jobs, which I was really attracted to when I discovered it in college but seemed too impractical/ scary to do. Anyway down the road I loved it, and discovered self motivation for studying shit I actually cared about, including things completely outside of my degree. Years later and I basically live to study (still have my Youtube binges, but I don't punish myself for it, I just ride it out until I get sick of youtube and stop watching). \n\nIn my experience college was a giant waist of time & money (disclaimer I went for liberal arts degree), minus the fact that the degree aloud me to work abroad. Just get through it asap, but after, don't be afraid to pursue something you are interested in. Fuck what other people think. Your motivation will be intrinsic and you will get way more satisfaction out of life when it's not on rails like it is in college or in a career you are shoed into.",

Not that I don\u2019t need it, but man I would love to raise my grade even higher.\n\nWithout a doubt I will use the knowledge I have of my passed failures to ensure that next semester I follow a extremely strict schedule that ensures I do not slack off and waste time. A schedule that is strict but works and pays off.",

Doing stuff I love was not making me happy. I was just angry that nothing was working.\n\nA second wind has kind of hit me with only a couple week left because I am so ready to be done with this crap. Guys, we are almost there. We can't give up now. They aren't going to help us, so we have to help ourselves.\n\nI think of a soldier when I get bent out of shape. I imagine someone my age in a trench half way around the world.

The same boring ass subjects with questionable relevance. \nAnd even though people say you NEED it and the knowledge you acquire will come in handy  YEARS down the line, i can barely remember what I studied last semester let alone last year.  \n\nIt's like zombie mode, you kinda care but don't quite care enough. Just going through the motions. This is honestly frustrating and I feel like instead of studying in university I could use my time and energy more productively.  \n\nDistance learning made some things easier but made studying even more unengaging . \n\nOf course your experience will vary depending on where you study and what field you have chosen. I personally chose business admistration. \nHowever, i think that at least 50% of all students have had a similar experience to mine to one degree or another and if the educational system was better, distance learning wouldn't be a problem for so many people in the first place.",
