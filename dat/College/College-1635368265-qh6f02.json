  "text": "Hey reddit peeps. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Anyways, I am here to ask for advice, which I would not have done if I could come up with better ones. \n\nFor background, me and my close friend started going to this university in different fields, but we do have classes together. At first, both of us had problems socializing, for me, because I was very socially anxious. Always had a very high heart rate because I had to introduce myself/ answer questions, but I broke out of that after about 2 weeks and made a few friends. \n\nMy friend, while he has better social skills in general, didn\u2019t want to socialize, but he does understand that making friends is necessary. He just doesn\u2019t cuz more than half the people in our uni are basic and uninteresting (can confirm that this is true. I made friends with people not belonging to that general group). Now it feels like it\u2019s too late because in just a few weeks, people already started making friend groups. We also have a possibility of going online, which will make this worse\n\nIn parallel, he started to not want to pursue his major, but doesn\u2019t have anything else he wants to pursue. He now despises coming to class, has completely shut himself out, except for his closest friends from HS like me and relatives. His motivation for anything has dropped as he says. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I can do to help him out but I desperately need some good advice. Thanks for reading.",
