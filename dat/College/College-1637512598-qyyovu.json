  "title:": "Losing motivation right before graduation",
  "text": "I\u2019m one semester away from graduation and for some reason I\u2019m ready to drop out. Surprisingly, I preferred online classes versus in person classes. I lack motivation to get up for classes (I commute) and I feel like I just don\u2019t care if I even fail my classes anymore\u2026 I had all these plans after I graduate college. I\u2019m the first person in my family to ever go to college, so I want my grandparents and my parents to be proud of me, but I feel like I\u2019m holding on by a thread.\n\nI don\u2019t want to do the work anymore, not because I can\u2019t, but just because it requires so much effort. I know I\u2019m not the only person to deal with feelings like this. I\u2019m simultaneously scared that I won\u2019t graduate in the spring, while also not caring. My brother passed away in April, so I think that has something to do with it.\n\nI know I\u2019m not the best student. I\u2019m not on academic probation or anything like that. I have a solid 3.2 GPA which isn\u2019t awful. But college has drained the energy out of me and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

My dad almost passed away, too, so I guess I\u2019m doing alright for what life has been handing me. Thank you for your comment, it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not alone in this. I really appreciate it",

Anxiety and depression have this kamikaze failsafe in it that wants you to stop right before you finish something. Protects your from anxiety because you stay in the same state you are in, you don\u2019t progress or experience anything new. And it helps depression through this cognitive dissonance you have going on. You dissociate, detach from reality and school, and by dropping out you can spend more of your limited energy elsewhere. Either way, anxiety and depression aren\u2019t your friends. They only do what is worst for you. Don\u2019t let them win. You are way stronger than that.",
