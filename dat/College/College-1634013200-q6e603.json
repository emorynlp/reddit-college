  "text": "My English professor suggested I take honors classes but I am not really sure about what it means. I know I want to get my AAS in Cardiac sonography through my community college because I am an EKG tech already. I've debated transferring into a 4-year college (Texas A&M) for a bachelor's in Health Admin or doing a bachelor's in diagnostic medical sonography (U.T). \n\nSo are honors classes worth it? GPA is a 3.6",

      "text": "I'm 31, also at a CC, and also had a teacher recommend the honors program. I decided to decline after going to a tepid honors orientation and seeing how much extra $ it would cost me every quarter. \n\nBut I'm confident in my ability to get a transfer to my 4-year school of choice bc my state schools have an agreement with the CCs and my grades are good. I would have done it if I felt I needed to plump up my transfer app.",
