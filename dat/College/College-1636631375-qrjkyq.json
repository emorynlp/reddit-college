  "text": "  \n\nHi guys, I\u2019m from Spain and I would like to know if you could help me financially with my project called La Fruiteria ([https://www.instagram.com/lafruiteriauab/?hl=es](https://www.instagram.com/lafruiteriauab/?hl=es)). \n\nLa Fruiteria is my college radio program at UAB (Universitat Auton\u00f2ma de Barcelona), this semester we\u2019ve been hacked ([https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20211025/7813564/uab-autonoma-universidad-cibertataque-campus-virtual-hackers.html](https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20211025/7813564/uab-autonoma-universidad-cibertataque-campus-virtual-hackers.html)), so we cannot record yet.\n\nDuring this time, I came up with some good ideas, but I do not have the money to make it the way I would like to do it.\n\nTo introduce the new season of the radio program I want to make t-shirts for my team like this ([https://imgur.com/4W6S6lT](https://imgur.com/4W6S6lT)), we are six, and I want to make a video, like squid game trailer using stickers with the logo ([https://imgur.com/a/DHBF3zM](https://imgur.com/a/DHBF3zM)).  The idea is recording my co-workers finding the stickers and without knowing nothing carried to the studio with a bus.\n\nLast year, we made a spot using flyers instead of stickers. ([https://www.instagram.com/p/CIqycpNKySA/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIqycpNKySA/)) \n\nSo, to pay the stickers, which for me is the most important thing right now, the price is 23.99\u20ac. ([https://imgur.com/a/Fxqn8aK](https://imgur.com/a/Fxqn8aK)) \n\nI\u2019m asking help here cause my college is public and they say that they cannot help us financially.",
