  "text": "I\u2019ve always been a night owl, but when I first got to college (I\u2019m a freshman), I had the best sleep schedule I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019d naturally get tired by 11:30 PM and wake up without an alarm or even feeling tired at like 9:30 AM. I think it was because I was super homesick the first few days and that was so emotionally and physically tiring. Then I got COVID early on so I had to be sent home, and this is where things started getting worse. Once I came back, I was going to bed at like 2 AM and having a little difficulty getting up for my earliest class (at 11:15 AM), but I never skipped it to sleep.\n\nI went home for a weekend early in October, and ever since then, my sleep schedules been the worst it\u2019s ever been. I struggle to fall asleep before 6 AM and wake up before 3 PM and even have not been able to get a single second of sleep 2 nights in the past week, including last night. Obviously, it\u2019s extremely difficult to get myself out of bed after 4ish hours of sleep without my mom making sure I get up.\n\nI\u2019ve tried melatonin and get consistent cardio, but nothing helps. It\u2019s really frustrating because I had an exam today and it\u2019s pretty much pointless to take an exam after being awake for more than 24 hours. Does anyone have any advice? It\u2019s also affecting my mental health - I feel awful sleeping until 3/4 PM, missing my classes, and being awake for 3 hours of sunlight.",

      "text": "Ive found that all it takes to fix a fucked up sleep schedule is to stay just awake until your desired bed time, so like, if you normally go to bed at 6 am, force yourself to stay awake, no matter how tired/sleepy you are, and stay awake until 11pm, or whatever your goal to be asleep by is",

So I\u2019m never really having fun except when partying, but I wouldn\u2019t even count that as true fun since it involves alcohol.",

              "text": "Alcohol is interesting - I admit the people who drank were much more down to earth in college, though underage drinking was rarely something people reported but it depends, some places have high rate of reporting. I will say that from someone who had a bad experience in college, that I did not relate to the people who had a normal sleep schedule. Not just bad cultural fit, but in college I was an emotional wreck. I could not relate to people who did well in a high school with a lot of white people in the student body, since I went to a diverse high school. Clearly it was a culture shock for me.\n\nMy advice: look at the misfits in the area around your college, the homeless, maybe visit a prison, idk. During coronavirus, that may be impractical idk. But some people don't want to \"give you the thumbs up\". Its also possible that you may be allergic to something, like are you feeling itchiness often? I'm allergic to the people here where I live in Seattle, sorta. I have hay fever (chronic sneezing).",
