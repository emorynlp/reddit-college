  "title:": "I think I\u2019m about to get my first legit 4.0 this semester",
  "text": "Some context: During the pandemic my university allowed us to do an alternate grading scale where students could accept the credits but not have the grade in the class affect your gpa. I did this one semester where I got 4 A\u2019s and an A- (an illegitimate 4.0) \n\nNow I\u2019m my fourth year of undergrad I\u2019ve worked my ass off. I\u2019m currently awaiting my grade for a final project but i believe I\u2019m finally going to get that real 4.0 for the first time ever! I\u2019ve hit many accomplishments over the years but this will be the sweetest by far",
