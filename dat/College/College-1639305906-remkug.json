  "title:": "Is it true that it's useless to save up money for college because they'll take all of it?",
  "text": "So I've always been something of a worrywart and I've been saving up all the money that I make from my job for college and emergency purposes. My mom keeps encouraging me to spend it, though, because apparently once the college sees that I have money in my account, they'll want to take all of it. I've always heard people claim that teens should start saving up for college so this was really surprising to hear - is it true that it's basically useless to save up money for college in advance?\n\nAlso, not sure if this is relevant or not but I come from a low-income family - we don't have any income aside from child support and alimony so I'm expecting to receive some sort of financial aid from colleges. I'm pretty sure my brother had money in his bank account but he was able to go to college for free, aside from paying for health insurance.",

      "text": "What your mom is saying makes 0 sense.\nI saved for college. They knew I had savings when I applied for aid. It impacted absolutely nothing.\n\nTwo of my friends did the same thing.\nSo did my mom and my dad.\nMy brother's doing it as well.\nCan say the same about a coworker and some of my classmates.\n\n\"Don't save for college because they'll take your money.\"\n\nThat's literally the point. It keeps you from having to pay back interest on your tuition thanks to student loans. Or, hell, keep the money in your savings and pay back your student loans as you receive them, and keep what you need for bills/books. That's what I did.\n\nDo what's best for you.\n\nEDIT: Typo",

Yes, save for college as much as possible, See what your financial aid will cover (because it probably won\u2019t be the entire cost) and then pay the difference with what u have saved",

      "text": "It's true that student assets (your savings) are counted toward EFC at a higher % rate than your parents (I think it's 50% of your savings count toward EFC). But like another commenter said, that's the point. Your savings = less in loans. \n\nThere is some logic for spending down your savings if is is a lot of money and if you attend a school that will give more need--based aid (as opposed to merit-based aid) for low income students (usually private schools that advertise \"100% need will be met\"). If your savings is only a few thousand dollars, it probably won't move the calculation.",
