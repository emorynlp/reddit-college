  "text": "It's a bit more complicated, but the rules say I cant post a super vauge title. haha.\n\nSo, recently, ive been feeling extremely burnt out. Consciously, or subconsciously, I keep putting everything off this semester and I keep missing assignments because of it. (It's to the point where i'm borderline failing most of my classes). Im a csci major, 1 semester away from graduating (2 if I fail this semester). But, ive hardly an interest in csci. It was the major I went into following the path id taken in high school - Hoping to figure out what Id want to do. The plaguing thoughts of \"whether or not this worth it\" make it really hard to stay motivated.\n\nOver the last year, I'd taken a liking to creative writing. And am thinking about working a job full time (for money. ofc) while writing a webnovel. But... I'm also split on pursing a associates in english to improve my writing skill in a class environment. I am taking a creative writing course this semester and have been quite enjoying it after all. haha.\n\nShould I drop out? Finish the csci associates? Take a break from college? I'm really not sure. Ive asked my friends about this and have been met with conflicting advice. Hence why I came here.",

      "text": "I would recommend finishing your csci degree. You have already spent a lot of time and money on it and you are almost done. Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll use the degree, at least you\u2019ll have it for just in case. Then if you want to get a degree in English afterwards, go ahead. I know it\u2019s hard to keep pushing through when you are burnt out and just don\u2019t want to do it anymore, but you\u2019ll be proud of yourself later for finishing the degree.",
