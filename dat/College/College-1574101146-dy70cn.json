I still don't feel ready to forgive him, but I don't hold grudges. This is good enough for me to move forward, but I still feel hurt. I hope we can both move past this in the future.",

It's a quasi-Christian belief, not anything that's actually rooted in psychology,^1 and it gets used all the time to minimize the experiences of abuse victims and make them feel like bad people for not forgiving their abuser. Forgiveness is *not* taking your hands off the other guy's throat, it's deciding they don't deserve to be strangled. And sometimes someone just needs and deserves to be strangled, because it's either you or them, and they started it.\n\nIn this case I don't know the details so I don't know if the guy really deserves forgiveness or not, but it wouldn't necessarily be unhealthy if OP didn't forgive him. You can recognize that a person is untrustworthy or dangerous without dwelling on it to the point that the obsession with how they hurt you causes more harm than the initial problem. But you can't forgive them by any meaningful definition of the word without also letting them back into your life and giving them another chance, and some people just shouldn't be trusted with additional chances.\n\n___\n\n^1 Edit: or even good theology. The Bible is very clear that forgiveness is only for those who acknowledge that what they did was wrong and try to make amends. For both divine *and* mundane forgiveness.",
