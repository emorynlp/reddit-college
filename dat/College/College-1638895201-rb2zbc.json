  "title:": "Feel like I'm incapable of getting good grades no matter how hard I try",
  "text": "This isn't a matter of interest or anything outside academics in case you're wondering. \n\nAfter some deliberation, I've come to a conclusion that I am not smart enough to achieve good grades in college. All my assignments are essay based rather than exam based. Not saying I'm horrible at writing my essays but I genuinely feel that my writing is pretty lackluster compared to my peers. And for that reason, some of my sentences in my essay sound vague or rather too simplified for it to have any substantial meaning behind it. \n\nSo after some minor tweaks and carefully planning for literally all my essays (I'm talking about taking 1 month to start doing my essays before the deadline), I still get lower grades than some of friends who seemingly just happen to do their essays on the deadline day itself.\n\nIt feels like an insult to my time, effort and intelligence when I'm struggling to complete something and there they are panicking to submit on deadline day yet they always get better grades than I do. And when I mean by they, I meant literally all of them.\n\nThe comments from my professors on my assignments doesn't help much either (too vague, not informative, too messy, not structured and not written expressively). And even after pointing it out and rechecking on my next assignment to prevent myself from repeating the same mistakes again, I still got the same grades with the same comments attached to it. It's as if I'm too stupid to realize my mistake over and over again. \n\nI can't help but feel overwhelmed due to my stupidity. No matter how much I try, my grades will never improve. I have come to terms with it and find that accepting mediocrity is better than trying so hard and see myself failing again.",

      "text": "First and foremost, you are not stupid. Everyone obtains and applies knowledge differently. The second half of my undergrad and all of my graduate work was essay, after essay, after essay. I hated it, with a passion. I enjoyed the subject matter but I\u2019m the type that doesn\u2019t use 5 words when 3 words will due. I had to work hard and learn to be more \u201cwordy\u201d and almost over explain when doing my coursework. Thankfully my wife is a essay master and she was immensely helpful when it came to organizing my thoughts and creating a flow to my work. My humble advice would be to reach out to your instructors for more detailed guidance, ask for specific examples and look into writing labs if they\u2019re available. Those were helpful for me when I was taking classes helped me understand how to tailor my writing style to each instructor. Good news is, it\u2019s not forever. Since finishing school I have written exactly zero essay papers. It was only a demonstration of how well I understood the material. You\u2019ll get better just keep going. Hopefully that helps.",

      "text": "Talk to your professors! Every Prof will have different standards for essays and what flys in one course might flop in another. Chase them down in office hours and ask them about the vauge feedback, explain what you've been trying, and let them tell you what exactly isn't working for you. Not only it'll show them you're dedicated and give a shit abt their class (which every self respecting professor loves and might translate to more lenient grading wink wink), it'll take the guesswork out of why you're performing not up to par. It sounds like you're putting the burden solely on urself when the point of college is to let yourself be taught - ask for help!!",

      "text": "People have offered great suggestions. I would go to your campus writing lab if they have one. They can give extensive edits at both the grammatical and the content level! Often times I ask, \"hey does this sentence feel clunky?\" And they'll give very helpful suggestions. Or you can send them the whole essay and they'll give more general feedback that can still be paragraphs long. Best of luck to you!",
