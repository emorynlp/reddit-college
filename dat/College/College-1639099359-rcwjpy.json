      "text": "Address whatever caused you to struggle in the past. If that's mental health issues, see a mental health provider if at all possible. If that's lack of fundamental skills needed to succeed in your courses, build those up (and consider changing your major if you don't enjoy/feel like you should continue in that field). If that's financial insecurity making it hard to focus on school, try to save up some money to make it a bit easier. \n\nIf you're further in your program you can look for internships in your field but if you're still relatively new there's nothing wrong with taking a high-school type job to build work experience and earn a bit of money.",
