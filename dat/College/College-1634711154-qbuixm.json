  "text": "Hi r/college\n\nI'm currently a student studying in the UK after living my whole life in Canada. \n\nMaybe it's because I've gotten so used to the place, but for the past 2 years I've had trouble adjusting to the Uk. \n\nI'm always thinking about how great it would be to attend a great school in Canada instead. \n\nI've thought about moving, but a lot of the people around me tell me that the school I 'm attending is prestigious; hence it would be a waste to move. \n\nAs stupid as it might sound, I'm unhappy with the school I'm attending solely because of geographical reasons/missing where I had lived; hence I want to move back. \n\nIs it a bad idea to let the reasons above decide which college I attend?",
