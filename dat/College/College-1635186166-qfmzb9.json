  "text": "Idk if this is the right place to ask this and I feel like this is a dumb question but, I'm currently completing a transfer degree at a local CC before transferring to a university. \n\nOn my Resume should I put that overall I'm pursing a bachelors with like a bullet point that I'm pursuing a transfer A.A from x college, or just say I'm pursuing an associates and then describe in the description that its a transfer degree in order to complete a bachelors? I hope that made sense.",

      "text": "I think it's ok to do whatever you want as long as whatever you write cannot be misinterpreted as claiming that you already have a bachelor's degree.\n\nPersonally, I'd go with the second option, writing that you're currently in school studying for an associate's degree with the intention to transfer after graduation to a four-year school to finish a bachelor's degree.  You could even put something like \"Estimated date of completion of Associate's Degree and transfer to four-year college is <date>.\"",
