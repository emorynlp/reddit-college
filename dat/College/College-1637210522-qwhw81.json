  "text": "Hello. I\u2019m currently a sophomore in college and I\u2019m honestly not happy with where I\u2019m attending school. The only reason I attended the college is because I was offered a full ride and my family pressured me into taking it. I feel like I\u2019m missing out on opportunities for growth being that the school is 10 minutes away from home and I\u2019m not getting the experience of being away from home in a new area. The school is also very small and there\u2019s not as much extracurriculars or diversity as I\u2019d like there to be. Since I\u2019ve already made it through half of sophomore year, I\u2019ve been contemplating on whether I should stick with it until I\u2019ll apply to another college for grad school or if I should just transfer even if it means I\u2019ll be paying out of pocket for my undergrad. \n\nI\u2019m grateful for the scholarship I just wish I could be happy where I\u2019m at.",

      "text": "I know people at all kinds of schools that feel the way you do, as did I when I was a sophomore (I wasnt on scholarship but that\u2019s beside the point) I can\u2019t speak for everyone but I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t transfer because that would\u2019ve created a whole new set of difficulties and I might have been left with the same kind of problems just in a different location. \nRegarding your scholarship I\u2019d say don\u2019t transfer if it\u2019d mean you have to take on debt. College isn\u2019t worth going into debt in my opinion.",
