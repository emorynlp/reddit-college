  "text": "To keep it short I\u2019m trying to transfer from CC with an AA to Uni as soon as possible. So to get back on track I need to take as many in the summer as possible. I know given how accelerated they are 2 is recommended, but I believe if I choose the right/easiest classes I can take more. (Humanities/Fine Arts/Communication gen eds come to mind). Any suggestions on 3-4 easy gen eds I can take during the summer would be appreciated.",
