  "title:": "What should I be doing during lectures?",
  "text": "It's nearing the end of my first semester of the first year of university and I'm still confused about what I should be doing during lectures.\n\nShould I be taking down notes at all? I noticed that most of the people were writing/typing a lot while looking at the lecture slides. I tried taking down notes but most of it was just copying off the lecture slides, which I gave up doing after realising that it was impossible to keep up and I wasn't paying attention to the lecturer.\n\nShould I just listen to the lecturer, trying to understand the content and when I get home, watch the recorded lecture again and take notes then? I've also noticed that the lecture slides are also a summarised form of the weekly required readings, so should I be taking most of my notes from the required readings (i.e. before the actual lecture)?\n\nSorry for the mouthful, I'll gladly clarify if you're unsure of what I'm trying to say!\n\nP.S. All of my modules are biological/medical sciences subjects if it matters!",

      "text": "i'd focus on summarizing what the prof is saying vs. copying off slides. you retain stuff better when you actively reword them in a way that'll stick for you. every prof has a different system, and its good u noticed the similarity between the slides and the reading - in that case, use the reading as a supplement to add to ur notes after class. try not to waste time relistening to lectures twice, get as much info as u can during classtime.",

      "text": "Studying is all personal preference. It's based off of what works best for you. The only thing I would say don't do in lectures is show your professor that you're slacking off or not paying attention (I'm not saying you are, but some professor see not taking notes as a form of it)\n\nWhat I do is take notes as I do the reading, but try to only summarize the key points (ie don't just rewrite the book). What worked best for me (also a science major) was to have the slides printed out or up on my computer and write notes on each slide on what the professor is saying. If it's on the slide you don't need to write it but maybe make a note that they emphasized that point. For example, if your professor has on the slide \"the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\" you don't have to write that down but maybe star it and write down the reason why. If they don't post the slides ahead of time then I would have written the title of the slide as a header for the notes so that way I can match them up after.\n\nI will admit having recorded lectures during covid was both a God send and a nightmare because on one hand I could rewatch if I missed something but on the other hand I caught myself writing down a lot of unnecessary information just because I had the ability to rewatch it multiple times and write down every little thing.\n\nAgain though, studying is a very personalized thing. You have to find what works for you even if it's not what works for other people. If you're really struggling with that you can see if your school has any academic support center that offers study help because they can give you some tips you might not have thought of.",
