  "text": "How do you ask a prof to be your mentor? Is it appropriate to ask them? I really need a friend/mentor and there is a prof I really respect and who I\u2019ve become friendly with and I\u2019ve often gone to for advice or moral support. Should I ask them to be a mentor or just keep visiting them during their office hours?",
