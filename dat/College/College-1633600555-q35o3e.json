  "text": "I got dismissed from college for bad performance during covid online classes. I was studying in the only cheap college in Bahrain. Now i am in india and i havent given JEE exam or SAT or any uni entrance exam. The only options i have are getting into a mediocre college(all good colleges ask for JEE and the exam has already been conducted. Also i wouldnt have got good grades anyway as i havent studied those topics in 2years) in a program that doesnt require JEE/SAT or hasnt conducted their own entrance exam yet. I got 10CGPA in 10th grade and 90.8% in 12th grade in PCBM. I feel like such a failure for possibly going into a mediocre university in a mediocre program..my life seems to have been in vain.. please give me advice on what best options you think i can do..\n\nTl:dr; i need advice on which uni to enter. I havent written any entrance exam",
