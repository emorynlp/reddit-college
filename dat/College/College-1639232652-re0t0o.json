  "text": "So those of you that are working at these companies like Walmart, Target, Kroger, Amazon, and etc for tuition assistance; is it worth working these jobs part time considering all that is happening with the high turnover off staffing, abusive customers, getting micromanaged, getting yelled at for not working fast enough, working alone all the time due to wage shortages.",

      "text": "I worked at Walmart since my junior year of high school and through most of this semester of college (I\u2019m a freshman).\n\nI quit two weeks ago. Management was abusing me by giving me basically 40 hour weeks and they wouldn\u2019t lower it so I quit. However, I may not have quit if I didn\u2019t have enough money in my savings to get me through. \n\nIf you live on campus I would check to see if they have any on campus job openings. They\u2019ll be way more flexible and for a lot of colleges you can\u2019t work more than 20 hours a week. Only downside is that they typically pay close to bare minimum wage.",
