  "text": "to give more context, i\u2019m a sophmore half way through my bachelors degree in psychological science. i am also working towards a minor in sociology. i only have 6 credits in my minor with 12 credits left. i took intro to sociology my first semester of college and loved it, thinking the other courses would be similar, i decided i would minor in sociology. however, the other required course seem boring and difficult. given, i\u2019m more focused on my major, i just feel like i won\u2019t do as well in the sociology courses when my motivation and attention is elsewhere. is there another minor that would benefit my major? should i continue my minor in sociology and suck it up? or is a minor even that important?",

      "text": "Considering you can\u2019t even really do anything with a bachelor\u2019s in sociology, a minor in sociology is absolutely not something that you\u2019d be able to do anything with. The only reason I had a minor on my first degree is because I already had to take the classes anyway for other requirements, so I might as well had declared the minor, but I can\u2019t do anything with it. I\u2019d definitely say save the extra money and your energy and do not worry about minors. You\u2019d be better off trying to find an internship for your major.",
