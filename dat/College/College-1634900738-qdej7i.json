  "text": "Hi there! I'm going into my senior studies (and then uni/college) and am wanting to find decent exercise books for my notes and revision. I've had heaps of spiral books, which are easy to write on but the covers tend to fall off and all of the pages come off - which isn't helpful right before exams!\n\nI'm looking for a decent notebook that I can use to do work and revision in that won't fall apart and keep the pages protected. I'll be buying quite a few for each subject. \n\nAny recommendations for when I go to buy them? Thanks!!",
