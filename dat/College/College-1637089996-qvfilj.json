  "title:": "Recommended Accommodations For ADHD?",
  "text": "I\u2018m diagnosed with adhd, I was hoping I would be able to be properly medicated by the end of the semester, but my doses aren\u2018t high enough yet or something\u2018s off, and my meds aren\u2018t helping me much, if at all. I have trouble studying or doing homework- it recently took me 8 hours to complete 16 calculus problems for example. I can focus, do pomodoro, take breaks, etc, but still the time I take is on the very high end.\n\nThings my school offers that I think may help me are things like extended time on tests, extended deadlines, or being able to record my lectures, but there are other things that may be more appropriate, etc, I could probably ask for. \n\n1. What are your recommended accommodations for this disorder? I have type C (mixed) if anyone is wondering on specifics.\n2. What paperwork should I bring/give? Is there anything I would need from insurance/the like? \n3. Anything extra about accommodations I should know about before applying?",

They way these might be useful is\u2026\n\n* audio recording technology \u2014 if you lose focus during the class, you can go back to it later\n\n* a note taker \u2014 a human taking notes for you during class if you have difficulty focusing enough to take coherent notes yourself \n\n* use of a computer \u2014 to take notes during class, some people focus more easily using a computer or tablet instead of paper, like how some people need to doodle during class or use a fidget spinners. \n\n* a screen reader (also called text-to-speech) \u2014 for assignments on the computer, or reading the textbook, if concentrating on written words is difficult, an audio version might be better. I\u2019ve recently been enjoying reading audiobooks instead of print books, as I can do something else at the same time like wash dishes or knit. \n\n* dictation software (also called speech-to-text) \u2014 for completing assignments, if you have difficulty keeping focused while typing out your answers or essays, you could talk aloud and it would turn it into typed text, that you could then edit further. (If appropriately combined with audio recording technology, this could also make word-for-word transcripts of recorded classes.)",

I don't know if you've timed all your classmates to compare yourself to. \n\nDo you absolutely know that most problems take them 10 minutes or less or is that a generalized assumption?\n\nEssentially, be careful comparing yourself to standards that you absolutely don't know for fact. Your classmates could be taking 15-20 minutes per question, which really wouldn't put you behind at all. \n\nIf you wouldn't bet your life on how long your classmates are taking on the calculus homework, you shouldn't be comparing yourself to that as a standard. It's an unhealthy mental behavior that's hard to break. It's important to know what you don't know for certain. If you haven't timed your classmates on how long they take to do calculus problems, then you don't know and can't use that as a baseline for comparison.",
