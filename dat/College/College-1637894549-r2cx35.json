  "text": "i\u2019ve been in school almost 4 months and I still feel like I haven\u2019t made a good group of friends yet. I have very few friends and most of the ones I have turned out to be fake a lot of the time. I\u2019m in a club but it\u2019s not the type of club where we go around meeting each other so I get no friends from that. I also joined a sorority but I joined a month later than everybody else so I made it harder on myself to make friends. I still have no friends in it. im also a very outgoing person so this is all weird to me. I\u2019m dreading going back to school next week after break and I just want friends. I feel so lonely. How do you make friends?",

      "text": "I did not make a close group of friends until halfway through the spring semester of my freshman year, so I just want you to know that you will be okay so long as you keep looking. My advice is to just attend campus activities, or if there are people chilling in common areas playing games/other stuff just ask if they'd mind if you could join. You have to be a little bold, but in general people WANT to make friends, so use that to your advantage.",

      "text": "(sorry if this isn\u2019t helpful or redundant as i am barely figuring out this same thing and just got lucky with the organization i joined) \n\nngl i\u2019m an introvert and made zero friends at first but also put no effort in for the first few months. i finally joined a sewing club and with that type of activity we are kinda forced to make small talk and help each other out due to sitting together multiple times a week for hours. i mean you can try participating in an activity where there\u2019s not like a stiff structure so everyone\u2019s kinda allowed to interact more and forced to due to frequent meetings. can also attend like round table discussions and those types of events where everyone is talking and it\u2019s not just a silent meeting or whatever. i feel like in college everything happens by chance just make sure whatever events and activities you participate in are ones you are interested in so you can at least have small talk about the common interest and also i definitely recommend things with frequent meetings maybe where everyone is developing a skill because then you know every week you will see those same people. i realized so many people are lonely in college especially because with our generation it\u2019s not really normal to just go up to people. as an introvert though i really appreciate the outgoing people around me that just started small talk by asking random questions because without them i would have never opened up. use your outgoing personality if you haven\u2019t already. also check if your school has a recreational center and if they do group activities. some schools have less popular organizations that are kinda lowkey that do things like hiking or group trips so that could be a good way to at least get some human interaction and make acquaintances. i haven\u2019t made a group of friends but i\u2019m not rushing it. i have made some good acquaintances that are pretty much friends at this point because we have some random weekly conversation and learn about each other over time. when in doubt things that require forced interactions always work at getting people to talk and become friends",
