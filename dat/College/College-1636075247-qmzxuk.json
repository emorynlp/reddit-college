  "title:": "I messed up because I had a half ass approach towards college. What do I do?",
  "text": "I enrolled in community college with the plan of getting an associates to get my parents off my back since they're very pushy about getting an education. I enrolled with my major being liberal arts because I thought that would be a good way to get my \"gen eds\" done. I wasn't very informed on how gen eds worked at the time. After the drop/withdrawal period ended I asked an advisor if I could change my major to computer science and she told me that it would be best to just change it next semester since two of my classes were not necessary for the major change and to avoid the drop/withdrawal charges. Upon hearing this information I stupidly assumed that this meant I did not have to attend those two classes so I stopped showing up. This messed up my attendance which ended up taking away my grant that paid for community college leaving me with a larger fee than I was ever willing to pay and throwing me into a panic. I was recently informed by an advisor that the best decision would be to email my financial aid office and ask if withdrawing from these classes would allow me to get my grant back. I feel heavily discouraged and just want out of this whole operation and I don't know what to do. \n\nIf im able to withdraw I was informed i'd only be getting 11 part time credits for this semester which makes me worried getting my associates will just take an even longer time now which on top of a 4 year college or university after my associates would be way longer than I wanted or anticipated\n\ndoes anyone have advice or has been in this position before?",

      "text": "Changing your major and taking fewer credits will definitely mean your degree will taker longer, yeah. You absolutely need to email financial aid immediately and *grovel*. This is entirely your mistake and they're under no obligation to fix it, so you should be prepared for the very real possibility that you don't get that grant back. Also, double-check the terms of your grant to make sure it doesn't have additional requirements - most require that you be a full time student, so only having taken 11 credits might mean you lose the grant anyway.\n\nUnder no circumstances can you just stop showing up for a class and assume it will be fine.",

Just get yourself together, don't half ass things, and you'll be fine. Take your education seriously - it's deciding your future - and make sure you talk to your advisor before you do stuff like not show up to class anymore.",

                      "text": "This isn't a mature way of looking at this. The point is that you would get it, as opposed to never getting it. You can make up two classes by overloading in two semesters or taking a summer semester. Honestly, you should figure out what you want to do with your life. You need to be able to handle this and take it seriously, and have a really good backup plan for what you're going to do if you don't get a college degree. You should look at the differences in lifetime earnings with and without even an associates if you take that route: https://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/college-costs-tuition-and-financial-aid/publicuvalues/employment-earnings.html",
