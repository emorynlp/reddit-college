  "text": "Hello I live in a dorm with 3 other dudes. They all knew each other from a local highschool and I knew no one coming to school. I was nervous about the fact they were all best friends, but I didn't really have any other options. After about 7 weeks they are extremely cliche. My actual roommate never talks to me. When I try and talk to him I get one word answers and no questions back. They are always planning things in my face without asking me if I would like to join. For instance last week they went to their high school friends house to drink and spend the night. When they got back I was asking them questions how it was. I simply said, \"sounds fun\" and one of them said sorry you weren't invited it wasn't our house. I thought nothing of this because I barely knew the kid whose house they went to, until I heard they invited the kid above us who did not go to their high school. I have been nothing but open and considerate to these people. I do all the cleaning in the dorm to avoid any dissention towards me. I invite them to get food from the dining hall, they will decline saying they aren't hungry. I leave for 20 minutes come back and they are getting ready to leave for the dining hall. It really feels like they are going out of their way to leave me out of things. I get it, I'm new but still something just doesn't feel right.",

          "text": "I've tried, joined multiple clubs but nothing seems to stick. It's been very difficult. I'm a sophomore and spent my entire first year online from home. This lead to me not being able to attend freshman orientation. So when I arrived to the dorms to move in, everyone had already been here for almost 2 weeks getting to know one another. I get to lectures early to talk to people and nothing seems to amount from those conversations either. Any suggestions?",

You could try joining other student organizations, study groups, maybe find a job on campus, etc. It is also good to make sure you are keeping up with any events on campus that you can attend.",
