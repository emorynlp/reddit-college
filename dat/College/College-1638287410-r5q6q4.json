  "text": "I was basically humiliated by this one teacher for not being able to hand in an assignment because I never had the Google drive shared with me and apparently that\u2019s my fault (and I had contacted her 2 weeks prior about it, and the day the assignment was due). \n\nSo in class, 5 days after the assignment was due I go to her and ask her what was happening she decided to humiliate me in front of the class because my 18-page paper was late. And it was my day to talk about it. But I never had access to the drive.\n\nThat was 3 weeks ago. I have anxiety disorder and I\u2019m still hung up on it. I have one more class with this bitch (Thursday). Then I don\u2019t have to see her ever again. \n\nI\u2019m so pumped for Friday. I just want to get out of her class.",
