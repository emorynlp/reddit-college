  "title:": "My professor assaulted me and I feel so frightened",
  "text": "Hello I am a college student in my last years and everything has been going downhill recently. In my psychology class, there is a professor who made me feel uncomfortable in the class. Each time, she looks at me in a strange seductive way that really gets on my nerves. It just feels uncomfortable dealing with a woman in her mid-thirties who keeps stalking me throughout the class and watches me at times. She seems to be very focused on me most of the time in the classroom and it feels awkward. None of the kids in class notice this as that she does it when nobody looks, between class breaks and even during test times. I come to class , try to do my work and pay attention but again, she keeps trying to flirt with me so much. I don't know how to deal with this anymore because it is hard when there's absolutely no help. Nobody believes me and there isn't proof to explain it to others. The worst day happened recently when I went to meet my professor in the office hours for an assignment. I was discussing with her about it and I felt a bit confused about the assignment that she gave. The weirdest thing happened when she got close to me sexually. I felt her breasts close up on my face as she was near me and I got up to walk away as it started getting awkward. She instead grabbed my arm and told me to sit down. I didn't feel comfortable dealing with this and I tried to leave but she grabbed me and forced me against the wall. This professor started threatening to fail me for the entire course if I was going to tell anyone what was happening between me and her. I felt honestly very scared and just afraid as that she does have some higher connection within the college itself that I am in. She forcefully held me against the wall and started to grab my crotch and kiss my neck everywhere. The worst part is when she started grinding her buttocks on my genitals and felt aroused. I felt aroused and I didn't want this to happen. It felt so gross and she still did this forcefully over and over again. I kept feeling so aroused that it was out of my control. I ended up ejaculating on myself after this and she kept repeating the same thing all over again until my penis and body started to hurt badly. I felt so disgusted and violated like a piece of shit and it felt horrible.  She threatened me to fail and expose my penis if I told someone this. I ran out of there feeling worthless. I never felt like this in my entire life and it hurt badly. I don't even know what to do as that she's very close with the dean and faculty in the school. So many thoughts are racing through my head and it feels so real. Sorry but it's just so many emotions that I am experiencing and I don't know what the hell to do...",

      "text": "My school did a great thing a few years ago where above nearly every urinal and in every stall, they stickered a flowchart on what to do to get help with harassment. Everyone has it memorized. One thing it emphasizes is you can report this to different channels simultaneously. It's not like you talk to your Title IX coordinator, wait for a meeting, then report it to the police, then wait to sign a statement, then report it to the Provost (or your school's equivalent of \"boss of all faculty\")...you can do all these things simultaneously.\n\nBecause stories in the news necessarily focus on school failures, there's a perception of crookedness that, in fact, is pretty rare. Title IX officers are required by federal law to be independent. Religious advisors take their 1st amendment rights as seriously as their, well, rites. But deans, department heads, and HR have no formal singular obligation to you and sometimes make well-intentioned terrible decisions because their obligations often work at cross-purposes. That's another reason to learn about your different reporting options and how they vary in terms of confidentiality, processes they may trigger, etc. \n\nDM me, OP, if you'd like a copy of that flowchart I mentioned. And know that none of this is your fault and any reporting steps you decide to take are about protecting both yourself and the potential next person. Your professor by their actions has forfeited any gentleness on your part.",

Send her an email saying you feel wrong about what she did to you (detail explicitly what happened and make sure it\u2019s clear that you did not want or enjoy anything that happened) and keep her replies documented.

You could also file a reort with your RA, RD, or any other mandated reporter on your campus (although if I was in your shoes I'd go right to the Title IX office). In addition to the Title IX office you could make a report to campus police for a criminal investigation. If you make a report the professor won't be able to fail you. \n\nThe other option is to not make any report of this. If you don't report it there is no way that the professor will be held accountable. This behavior is deplorable and I would strongly recommend that you report it.

Campus police work for the university and therefore any higher ups who are friendly with this professor, the real police do not. It's not going to be a pleasant experience, but filing a police report and getting a restraining order shows it's serious and also takes power out of the hands of the university. It also sets up a legal paper trail so that if you're retaliated against you have proof and can file suit. \n\nRefuse to speak to anyone in person without witnesses you can trust, try to only communicate through email so you create a paper trail. If you live on campus try to back everything up off campus or in the cloud. Document everything.\n\n Sit down now with a calendar and document every incident to the best of your recollection, all the details such as times, witnesses if any, her words, her actions. Everything. A detailed written record like carries a lot of weight in court. \n\nAbsolutely do not wait or let your fear of her retaliating stop you. She's already escalating and she's 100% counting on you being to afraid to report her. She may not have as much influence as she's suggesting, especially if you control the narrative and report to outside authorities that the university can't protect her from. Honestly if it gets too thorny for them, the university is more likely to throw her to the wolves than protect her. She's a young professor with no tenure so she's expendable. \n\nAnd absolutely remember none of this is your fault. You don't deserved to be assaulted and harassed.",

      "text": "You can file a Title IX report and the university will investigate.\n\nI'll be pragmatic here and answer this very frankly. Yes this person should be fired and in jail or rehab. The university and police have a very formal process though and it's important to understand what is required so you can make it happen. Evidence wise, the school is going to use the preponderance standard which means whichever is more likely. They will need to show there is a >50% chance she did this. There is definitely the possibility they will fire her with the evidence they can get as of this moment, it isn't a safe bet though. If you can get more evidence the chance of this happening will shoot up dramatically. Criminal charges would also be possible.\n\nPersonally I would handle it a bit differently. Sexual assault cases are notoriously hard to prove and you don't think there is any evidence. On the contrary there might be some evidence that is just not yet discovered: you two might have been seen by a stray hallway camera or a witness may have heard the conversation for example. But you should not assume Title IX will just get lucky and find enough of it. My suggestion, if you think she will do something again, is to start turning on audio recordings when you are around her. That would help the university have enough evidence to terminate her which is the result you should be trying to get. You would file the Title IX after she attempts to do something again and you get the audio. The advantage of waiting a little bit is that you can be prepared and catch her in the act -- the Title IX complaint will probably spook her and make her very cautious. If you cannot handle being around her, just file the Title IX now and they will move you to a different class. Title IX in general will protect you regardless of if you report this tomorrow, in two weeks, or two months. It's the same thing with how the police report you will file is treated minus statute of limitations (typically you can report something years old though).\n\nAny evidence you can collect or go back and find would be useful. These sort of people are awful and it's important you provide everything you can to the university so there is a high chance she will be fired and not be able to continue doing this. You are helping yourself here but also other students that she could target in the future so it's important to start building a good case. I would also write down the factual details now like locations, times, events, etc. At the end of the day you and everyone on this subreddit wants her fired and arrested. Catching her in the act on tape is the easiest way to get a slam dunk case.\n\nNext time she attempts to touch you, you need to physically defend yourself and run away. Catching her trying to do this again is a lot to ask and very intense mentally speaking after what you went through. Being able to stand your ground and control the situation is necessary. Also I would never ever recommend this approach if you could not do that or were too mentally traumatized to be exposed to those advances again.",

New York, for example is a ONE party consent state. If there's a friend you trust (believe me, I know it's hard to discuss situations like this) perhaps they could hang around when class let's up?

None of this is your fault and this situation should be dealt with before it happens again. If you are worried about your grade then don\u2019t. It\u2019s just a scare tactic that most predators use to manipulate their victims from reporting them. Similar to a predator telling someone they will kill their family if they tell anyone that they assaulted them. Chances are your not the only student she had done this to. Legally the college has to file a report if you make a sexual assault complaint to them that happened on campus. Also do not go to any of her future classes and don\u2019t speak to her. Talk to a counselor and the college and see if you can transfer to a different class.",
