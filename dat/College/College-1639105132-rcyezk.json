  "text": "After having passed my last BA101 test with a 92/100 bringing my grade up to passing, my professor goes and grades the business plan assignment a zero. I did this assignment all by myself, produced far higher quality work than anyone else in class and turned in all necessary documents. Yet, I get a zero on the assignment and it brings my grade back down to failing. I swear this lady secretly hates me but loves to act sweet.",

      "text": "This might be a mistake. I'd recommend sending her an email about this and asking if there was possibly a mistake in the grading, as it doesn't make sense for you to have a zero on the assignment.\n\nIf you think this isn't possible, it is. A month or so ago, I took an exam in one of my online classes on Canvas. A portion of the exam was multiple choice while a portion of it had an essay. The multiple-choice component was graded by the computer, the essay portion was hand-graded by my professor. My grade on the exam was low but only because the essay hadn't yet been graded. A week or so ago, my professor released grades on the exam including the essay, and strangely my grade on the exam did not change from when I first submitted it. I found this odd, so I emailed my professor about this asking if he graded my essay. He got back with me and told me he made a mistake by not grading the essay portion of my exam.\n\nHe of course corrected his mistake by grading the essay portion of my exam, however this goes to show that sometimes professors make mistakes too. They're only human. I have never seen a professor give me a zero on an assignment that I turned in, even if I did poorly on it they would still give me some pity points for at least submitting *something.* It's highly possible this is a mistake on the professor's end and I highly recommend you email her about this, especially since you feel this is your best work.",
