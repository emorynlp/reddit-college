  "text": "I\u2019ve been hearing about these quite a bit and my friend walked in on an orgy recently so I\u2019m curious\n\n1. How do you find multiple people willing to have an orgy?\n2. Where do you do it?\n3. How would you convince your roommate it\u2019s okay to have an orgy in their room?\n4. How would you get away with it without alerting your RA or others outside the room?\n5. Where do you have the time to find the people to have an orgy and actually have an orgy?\n6. When do you have the orgy?",

Invite them\n4. There\u2019s no rule against having sex in your room - just do it early enough in the evening you don\u2019t get a noise complaint\n5. I assume the people having orgies are more focused on orgies than on their schoolwork, lol\n6. Probably a weekend evening",

Again, don't dorm.\n5. I don't know, but if you ask some people in my university, they will tell you.\n6. I don't.",

      "text": "Orgies are gross, but I imagine you have to be more or less attractive to begin the process. In my lack of experience? These things just happen without any forethought and planning, precipitated by copious amounts of alcohol assumption at some dude's place.\n\nWhich in all fairness, is how 90% of orgies happen outside a commune.",
